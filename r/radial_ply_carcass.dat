50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|R

50|$|Chrysler Australia {{launched}} {{the first generation}} in April/May 1979 as the MA series Chrysler D-50. Initially, two pickup versions were sold, the Commercial with the 1.6-liter Saturn (4G32) engine and the higher specification Recreational with the 2.0-liter Astron (4G52) engine. Commercials received the three-speed column-shift manual, with the floor-mounted four-speed transmission and taller axle ratio for the Recreational. Commercials were specified with heavy duty suspension rated for 1000 kg payloads; the Recreational version carries a 500 kg load. The reason for the halved payload {{was due to the}} sedan-type suspension of softer springs and more supple shock absorbers. The Recreational model also featured <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tires, electronic ignition, bucket seats, pile carpet, radio, floor console, sports steering wheel and an adjustable steering column as standard. An optional sports stripe package was also available. Options included a weather-tight, fibreglass canopy with foam rubber mattress. This was manufactured by Challenge Industries and incorporated sliding side windows. Later in 1979, a cab chassis body variant of the Commercial was released. In March 1980, the D-50 was renamed Chrysler L200 Express to form linkage with the newly released L300 Express vans. In October 1980, the Chrysler labelling made way for Mitsubishi badges following the establishment of Mitsubishi Motors Australia from Chrysler Australia's old operations. In June 1981, Mitsubishi released 4WD versions of the pickup and cab chassis, both with the 2.0-liter motor. Free-wheeling hubs to reduce noise and fuel use in 2WD mode were optional. In late 1981, the 2.0-liter with five-speed manual was made optional for the 2WD one-tonne suspension models.|$|R

The finite element simulations basing on aircraft tyre test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> aircraft test tyre and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed. The researches have provided knowledge in comparing single and double bead tyre designs with respect to wheel loading mechanisms. The computational model also allowed manufacturers to assess the performance and safety criteria of a particular tyre at its design stage. The development of such models would add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing...|$|R
5000|$|Chrysler Australia {{introduced}} the SA series Delica to the Australian market on 14 April 1980 {{under the name}} [...] "Chrysler L300 Express" [...] after debuting at the Adelaide Motor Show in 12 April. After acquiring control of the Chrysler Australia operations in the same month, Mitsubishi Motors renamed the firm Mitsubishi Motors Australia in October 1980. This resulted in the rebranding of the L300 Express as a Mitsubishi. Fitted with a 1.6-liter engine and four-speed manual, both van (three-seater commercial) and wagon (eight-seater) variants were offered, with the commercial (van) version available with or without side rear windows. The utility (pickup) version was not sold in Australia, as the L200 Express covered that segment of the market. In November 1981 the SB series was introduced, now fitted with <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tires on larger diameter wheels, thus increasing the payload capacity from 925 to 1000 kg.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The wide use of wire-reinforced rubber products such as conveyor belts, hose and <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tyres has reawakened interest in the parameters affecting the adhesion of rubber to brass plated steel wire. My research work {{is an attempt to}} improve and explain the rubber to metal bonding technology; it is concerned with the effect of rubber compounding ingredients as well as wire surface factors on adhesion. This work pertains to show the role played by two of the recently introduced and widely used bonding systems namely (i) Hexamethylene tetramine-resorcinol system and (ii) the Triazine system (Vulcabond SW) * on the adhesion of the rubber to brass plated steel wire. Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to brass plated steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to brass plated steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties. Because of the widespread use of radial tyres in the automobile industry and in every field in which heavy types of tyres are used, this research considers in detail the phenomena of fatigue and pressure at various temperatures on bond life. Also wire ageing is considered to be very important and to effect the bond between the rubber and the brass plated steel. * Trade name of Vulnax International Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or <b>radial</b> cord <b>plies</b> are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater tyre casing fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The {{aim of the research}} described in this thesis is to assess the technical feasibility of pneumatic tyres for passenger cars which have no directional reinforcement in their carcasses. Conventional tyres are constructed from composites of twisted textile or steel cords in a rubber matrix, a process which is both labour intensive and costly. If it were possible to injection mould or cast tyre carcasses in a single operation, and if the performance of the resulting tyres matched that of modern <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tyres, then the implications for the tyre industry would be of major proportions. After reviewing the history of pneumatic tyres and summarising their principal attributes, the design of unreinforced or fabricless tyres is investigated and methods developed for defining their meridional profiles. Materials suitable for their carcasses and treads are then considered, prior to describing the manufacture of two series of tyres designed to have section height to width ratios, or aspect ratios, of 0. 9 and 0. 7 respectively. To facilitate experimental work, two sizes of tyres were employed: half scale models for which testing procQdures had been developed previously; and a size suitable for small saloon cars. The results obtained on a range of tyre properties are presented and analysed to give a number of empirical relationships between the properties and the design variables: carcass material Young's modulus, carcass wall thickness and the inflation pressure. For the important property of radial stiffness which affects other tyre characteristics, an improved method of analysis is developed to allow the structural and pneumatic components to be quantified. Using the relationships established experimentally, consideration is given to optimising the design of a fabricless tyre. It is concluded that to approach the performance of a conventional tyre, a design with a low aspect ratio is preferred but, to restrict growth with inflation'pressure, limited directional reinforcement must be included as a circumferential-belt beneath the tread. Nevertheless, the discussion concludes that there are fundamental reasons why even the optimised tyre would be unacceptable for use on modern passenger cars, although less demanding applications may be identified...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. January 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Lev Khazanovich and Joseph F. Labuz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 199 pages. Agricultural equipment manufacturers have been producing equipment with larger capacity {{to meet the}} demands of today’s agricultural industry. This rapid shift in equipment size has raised concerns within the pavement industry, as these heavy vehicles have potential to cause significant pavement damage. At present, all implements of husbandry are exempted from axle weight and gross vehicle weight restrictions in Minnesota. However, they must comply with the 500 lb per inch of tire width restriction which may lead to very large loads as long as the tires are sufficiently wide. A full scale accelerated pavement test was conducted at the MnROAD test facility. Both flexible and rigid pavements were tested in this study. This thesis presented analysis performed on the flexible pavement sections. The flexible pavement sections consisted of a “thin section” which represented a typical 7 -ton road and a “thick section” which represented a 10 -ton road. Both sections were instrumented with strain gages, earth pressure cells, and LVDTs to measure pavement responses generated by these heavy agricultural vehicles. These response measurements were compared to responses generated by a typical 5 -axle semi truck. Additionally, tire contact area and contact stresses of these vehicles were measured. Through this research, it was determined that traffic wander, seasonal changes, time of testing, pavement structure, and gross vehicle weight have profound effects on pavement response measurements. The effect of vehicle speed and benefits of flotation tires over <b>radial</b> <b>ply</b> tires were not significant in this study. Additionally, all agricultural vehicles loaded above 80 % of full capacity generated higher subgrade stresses compared to the 80 -kip 5 -axle semi truck. Layered elastic programs, BISAR and MnLayer were used in the modeling analysis. The contact areas of these vehicles were approximated through multi-circular area estimation. This detailed modeling of the contact area yielded a more realistic representation of the actual vehicle footprint. DAKOTA-MnLayer optimization framework was introduced to perform backcalculation analysis to determine Young’s moduli of the pavement layers. The backcalculated Young’s moduli resulted in a close match between predicted responses and field measurements...|$|R
50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} <b>carcass</b> <b>plies</b> of cords laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the tread. Without a belt, the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being inextensible, prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through vulcanisation. The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its flatter profile even when the tyre was inflated.|$|R

O delineamento experimental foi blocos casualizados, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 x 4, com 24 tratamentos e três repetições. Os resultados evidenciaram vantagens para o trator equipado com pneus radiais. The {{objective of}} this study was to compare the performance of the FWD agricultural tractor, equipped with three types of tires (bias <b>ply,</b> <b>radial</b> and low pressure), with and without tire water ballasting, operating in four forward speed. The research was carried out at UNESP, SP, Brazil, with the tractor pulling a chisel plow. A tractor with 89 kW (121 cv) engine power equipped with FWD, was used in the experiment, and the tires used had the following characteristics: radial (front: 14. 9 R 26 and rear: 620 / 75 R 30), bias ply (front: 14. 9 - 26 and rear: 23. 1 - 30) and low pressure (front: 500 / 60 - 26. 5 and rear: 700 / 55 - 34). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block, design (3 x 2 x 4), with 24 treatments and three replications. The results evidenced advantages for the tractor equipped with radial tires...|$|R
40|$|Com o presente trabalho, teve-se como objetivo comparar o consumo de combustível de um trator agrícola operando com pneus (radial, {{diagonal}} e de baixa pressão) em duas condições de lastragem (com e sem água nos pneus) e quatro velocidades de deslocamento. O experimento foi realizado na FCAV-UNESP, Jaboticabal, SP, em condição de preparo do solo com escarificador. Utilizou-se um trator 4 x 2 TDA, com potência de 89 kW (121 CV) no motor. Os pneus foram do tipo R 1, com as seguintes características: radial (dianteiros: 14. 9 R 26; traseiros: 620 / 75 R 30) diagonal (dianteiros: 14. 9 - 26, traseiros: 23. 1 - 30) e BPAF (dianteiros: 500 / 60 - 26. 5; traseiros: 700 / 55 - 34). O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 x 4, com 24 tratamentos e 3 repetições. Os resultados evidenciaram vantagens para o trator quando equipado com pneus radiais. A condição de lastragem com água nos pneus ofereceu menor consumo específico. Observou-se também que o aumento da velocidade de deslocamento reduziu o consumo específico. The {{objective of}} this study was to compare the consumption of fuel of the FWD agricultural tractor, equipped with three types of tyres (bias <b>ply,</b> <b>radial</b> and low pressure), with and without tyre water ballasting, operating in four forward speeds. The research was carried out at FCAV/UNESP, SP, Brazil, The soil was tilled using a chisel plow. A tractor with 89 kW (121 HP) engine power equipped with FWD was used in the experiment, and the tyres used had the following characteristics: radial (front: 14. 9 R 26 and rear: 620 / 75 R 30), bias ply (front: 14. 9 - 26 and rear: 23. 1 - 30) and low pressure (front: 500 / 60 - 26. 5 and rear: 700 / 55 - 34). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design (3 x 2 x 4), with a total of 24 treatments and three replications. The results evidenced advantages for the tractor equipped with radial tyres. The ballasting condition with water in the tyres showed lower specific consumption. It was also observed that the increase of the forward speed reduced the specific consumption...|$|R
