40|$|Introduction Finely focused {{electron}} beams {{are used}} in lithographic processes to expose polymer resist layers. Very complex device patterns with high resolution nanometer size can be created. Such resolution is in general superior to presently available optical lithography techniques because the electron probe size may be {{much smaller than the}} corresponding diffraction limited image in optical lithography. In any lithographic process, the <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> is the important item. Therefore {{it is very important to}} understand how that <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> is produced and what factors are influencing the quality of the image. In order to utilise EBL successfully in nanometer range, the interaction and scattering of electrons within the resist layer and the underlying substrate must be well understood. For example, the effects of beam energy, type of resist, resist thickness, substrate type, and several other variables are critical in producing an optimal pattern in the resist. The resolution obtain...|$|E

Organic compounds containing one or more aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups were modified with DNQ substitutions. Inorganic compounds like polysiloxanes have never been studied as a backbone of PAC. However, they would give higher oxygen etch resistance and thermal stability, and more transparency in deep-UV region. Diazonaphthoquinone- 5 -sulfonyl-incorporated low molecular weight polysiloxanes as a dissolution inhibitor in deep-uv resist system were studied. The photoresists were composed of a novolac or polyhydroxystyrene polymers mixed with modified polysiloxanes in various compositions. The short siloxane polymers were synthesized from diphenyl substituted dichlorosilane, and further substitution of the terminal hydroxyl groups with photosensitizer DNQ. The modified siloxane in the resist system, after exposed to VU light of 254 nm, render the higher solubility of the resist in base developer because of ltetene formation, giving rise to high resolution positive tone <b>resist</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|The present main {{interest}} in photolithography is chemically amplified resists for 248 nm excimer laser lithography. However, the g-line and i-line photolithography is still predominately {{used by the}} industry. The main problem is the extendibility of Diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) -based resists in deep UV region with a high sensitivity. DNQ-PAC compounds with mono- or poly-hydric aromatic backbones have been well investigated before, however, not many {{attempts have been made}} on backbones with saturated cyclic-compounds, which show higher UV transparency than conventional aromatic ballast molecules. In this thesis, we have examined the performances of two resists with 1, 4 - cyclohexanediol and 4, 4 '-propylidene dicyclohexanol as backbone compounds, together with poly (styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) as resin.

40|$|The Engineering Test Stand (ETS) is a {{developmental}} lithography tool designed to demonstrate full-field EUV imaging and provide data for commercial-tool development. In {{the first phase}} of integration, currently in progress, the ETS is configured using {{a developmental}} projection system, while fabrication of an improved projection system proceeds in parallel. The optics in the second projection system have been fabricated to tighter specifications for improved resolution and reduced flare. The projection system is a 4 -mirror, 4 x-reduction, ring-field design having a numeral aperture of 0. 1, which supports 70 nm resolution at a k{sub 1 } of 0. 52. The illuminator produces 13. 4 nm radiation from a laser-produced plasma, directs the radiation onto an arc-shaped field of view, and provides an effective fill factor at the pupil plane of 0. 7.

40|$|An {{antireflection coating}} (ARC) {{containing}} polyvinyl alcohol and two dyes {{was applied to}} a substrate {{to form a new}} multilayer resist system. Based on the results of the application of the ARC on a planar aluminum substrate, an increase of the latitude of exposure and an improvement of the <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> quality were found. The ARC had a specific concentration of dyes and a specific thickness. The image was a 1. 0 µm line and space pattern. By using the ARC, even though the resist thickness varied from 1. 2 µm to 1. 5 µm, the resulting 1. 0 µm image remained within a ± 10 % tolerance range. This result was then used to apply the ARC technique on an uneven aluminum substrate with a 0. 5 µm height step. The final aluminum image was obtained by transferring the positive <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> to the aluminum film. The ARC film can be etched by using the same plasma etching as was used for the aluminum film without extra processing steps.

Recently inverse lithography (IL) is widely studied for source and mask optimization (SMO) to enhance the resolution for over diffraction limit integrate circuit (IC) patterns. In this paper, we propose a gradient based SMO algorithm where the SO and MO are two sequential steps due to their different image formation mechanism. Moreover, we employ three cost functions including aerial and <b>resist</b> <b>image</b> and the image contrast which is proposed in our previous work.

40|$|Thin resist films (< 1500 {angstrom}) {{based on}} DUV {{chemical}} approaches {{have been demonstrated}} for use in EUV lithography. Resists with good sensitivity (5 [...] 6 mJ/cm{sup 2 }) were observed but imaging mechanisms, in particular as they affect sensitivity, are poorly understood. To clarify mechanisms leading to photosensitivity, acid-generation efficiency at both EUV and DUV wavelengths was measured for the most promising EUV resist compositions as well as initial radiation damage experiments. In previous work, polymer composition {{was found to be}} more important in determining the relative dose to print of resists to EUV and DUV radiation than was PAG composition. Here, acid generating efficiency for several polymers upon exposure to EUV and DW are compared to gain insight into the role of the polymer and PAG in converting the incident EUV photon energy into <b>resist</b> <b>images.</b> It is shown that acid generation efficiencies at EUV do not track efficiencies measured on identical films with DUV exposures, and is attributable to polymer and polymer/PAG interactions. No particular structural feature of the polymer could be correlated to the acid generation results. Radiation damage studies showed that polymers that create acid in different yields at EUV do not show differences in radiation damage, as detected by dissolution rate changes. In addition, it is shown that no significant dissolution altering mechanisms occur with EW radiation at relevant exposure doses. The authors conclude that photospeed differences between EUV and DUV are quantitatively attributable to acid generation efficiencies for the compositions studied...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{reliable}} information hiding {{scheme based on}} support vector machine and error correcting codes is proposed. To extract the hidden information bits from a possibly tam-pered watermarked image with a lower error probability, information hiding is modeled as a digital communication problem, and both the good generalization ability of support vector machine and the error correction code BCH are applied. Due to the good learning ability of support vector ma-chine, it can learn {{the relationship between the}} hidden information and corresponding watermarked image; when the watermarked image is attacked by some intentional or unintentional attacks, the trained support vector machine can recover the right hidden information bits. The reliability of the proposed scheme has been tested under different attacks. The experimental results show that the embedded information bits are perceptually transparent and can successfully <b>resist</b> common <b>image</b> processing, jitter attack, and geometrical distortions.
