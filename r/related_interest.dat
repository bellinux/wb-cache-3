2500|$|Bias may be imputed to a {{decision-maker}} {{when he or}} she has a [...] (monetary) or [...] (property <b>related)</b> <b>interest</b> in {{the decision}} he or she is charged to adjudicate. This form of bias warrants the decision-maker being automatically disqualified from exercising its powers. The rule is vigorously enforced to protect the maxim enunciated by Lord Chief Justice Hewart in R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1923) that [...] "justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done".|$|E
2500|$|If actual bias on {{the part}} of an adjudicator can be proved, the High Court can [...] the decision. Cases of actual bias are rare due to the {{difficulty}} of proving the existence of a prejudiced judicial mindset. Imputed bias arises when a decision-maker has a [...] (monetary) or [...] (property <b>related)</b> <b>interest</b> in the decision he or she is charged to adjudicate. The courts have also extended the category of imputed bias to situations where adjudicators have personal, non-pecuniary interests in decisions. The existence of a situation leading to an imputation of bias warrants the decision-maker being automatically disqualified.|$|E
2500|$|Of <b>related</b> <b>interest</b> is {{a popular}} soldier's song which parodied an {{imaginary}} voyage by Eugene and the marquis de la Moussaye on the Rhine. A storm breaks and the general fears the worst, but the Marquis consoles him: [...] "Our lives are safe/ For we are sodomites/ Destined to perish only by fire/ We shall land." [...] A comment made by Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg in 1709, who had served under Eugene, could be read that the prince enjoyed [...] "la petite débauche et la p au-delà de tout," [...] or that he derived his sexual gratification from the virile member of others.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gleizes, {{both the}} content and form in this {{painting}} {{were the result of}} mind associations as he completed the work from memory; something that would {{play a crucial role in}} the works of other Cubists, such as Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Francis Picabia. More so than an 'objective' view of the real-world, Jacques Nayral valorized subjective experience and expression. He and other Symbolist writers embraced an antirationalist and antipositivist world-view, consistent with concepts that underscored Cubist philosophies. Nayral's interest in philosophy led him to correspond with Henri Bergson, someone who would greatly inspire both Metzinger and Gleizes. Nayral's <b>related</b> <b>interest</b> in avant-garde art led him to purchase Metzinger's large 1912 oil on canvas entitled La Femme au Cheval, also known as Woman with a Horse (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen).

2500|$|A similar concept {{lies behind}} Albert Gleizes' {{portrait}} of his friend, neo-Symbolist writer Joseph Houot, pen name Jacques Nayral, who in 1912 would marry Mireille Gleizes, {{the sister of}} Albert Gleizes. Along with Metzinger's Tea Time, Gleizes' Portrait de Jacques Nayral, painted the same year, exemplifies ideas and opinions formulated between 1910 and 1911 that would soon be codified in Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] (1912). According to Gleizes, both the content and form in this painting {{were the result of}} mind associations as he completed the work from memory; something that would {{play a crucial role in}} the works of other Cubists, such as Fernand Léger, Robert Delaunay and Francis Picabia.

2500|$|The rule distinguishes {{transactions}} by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies {{supervised by}} the Federal Reserve Board. [...] The rule states that in general, [...] "an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any <b>related</b> <b>interest</b> of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; {{and if the}} transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance {{by a majority of}} the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction." [...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions. The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approval of FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.|$|E
