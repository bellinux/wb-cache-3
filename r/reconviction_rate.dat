40|$|One of the {{underlying}} aims of a prison therapeutic community (TC) is to lower the rates of re-offending in those that take part in it. This study reports the reconviction data for 94 prisoners who had attended Her Majesty’s Prison Dovegate TC and had been released back into the wider community. The <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> was collected using the Inmate Information System, a central database used by the UK prison service. The 48 % <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> amongst the liberated was lower than previously found in other prison treatment programmes. The majority of reconvictions (74. 5 %) were breaches of licence involving absconding. There were no reports of serious violent offending and only one report of sexual re-offending. Most re-offenders (87. 5 %) did so {{within a year of}} being released into the community. Analysis also revealed that 70 % of reconvictions were committed by those who had spent less than 18 months in the TC, suggesting a treatment dosage effect.

40|$|This {{briefing}} {{presents the}} key findings and implications from {{an evaluation of}} Nacro’s On-Side project, based in HMYOI Portland. The project aimed to demonstrate what was needed to resettle the youngest and most vulnerable juvenile prisoners safely within the community. The research aimed to explore which kinds of interventions helped to bring about positive and durable outcomes for different young offenders, with varying backgrounds and offending histories. There are implications for policy makers who address the resettlement of young people, particularly {{in relation to the}} development of effective interventions. Key findings l The On-Side project demonstrated that, in order to reduce re-offending by vulnerable young prisoners, it was crucial to take a multifaceted ‘holistic’ approach and provide young people with multi-modal interventions to tackle their numerous and complex needs. l The On-Side project delivered individualised programmes, which were responsive to need and took a proactive stance. l The keyworker component {{appears to have been a}} positive feature of the programme and has provided the overall framework for the other strands of support and intervention to ‘work ’ better. A statistically significant effect was regular contact with project staff – 73 per cent of those who did not maintain or receive any post-release contact were reconvicted, compared with 39 per cent of those who did maintain or receive post-release support. l The <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> for On-Side participants, at 58 per cent, compared favourably against the national <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> for juvenile prisoners, which stands at 84 per cent. l In line with previous research, the most important factors that increased the likelihood of reconviction were related to the criminal history of the individual – the number of previous convictions and the length of sentence. Implications for policy and practice l If there is one key implication for future practice that appears to be most strongly reflected in the research, it is that to be most effective, a multi-faceted approach is required to address persistent offending. l There is a need for greater co-operation from housing and training providers. l Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) need to consider the On-Side model as a means of fulfilling the requirements of and meeting national standards for th...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some reasons}} for the apparent increase in the <b>rate</b> of juvenile <b>reconviction</b> between 2004 - 05 and 2006 - 07. Method: Observed and predicted <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> were investigated for the 2004 - 05 (n= 4, 225) and 2006 - 07 (n= 4, 368) cohorts of juvenile offenders given non-custodial sanctions. Various factors (for example, number of prior police cautions) {{were included in the}} Group Risk Assessment Model to determine whether they eliminated the discrepancy between the observed and predicted <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates.</b> The profile of re-offences across cohorts was also compared. Results: Two factors may explain the discrepancy between the observed and predicted <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> in 2006 - 07 : (1) a higher than expected <b>rate</b> of <b>reconviction</b> among juveniles dealt with via a Youth Justice Conference; and (2) the absence in the Group Risk Assessment Model of any control for the number of prior police cautions received by a juvenile offender. The higher than expected <b>rate</b> of <b>reconviction</b> among juveniles dealt with via a Youth Justice Conference in 2006 - 07 appears partly attributable to changes in policing practices.

The sexual offense <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> for the sex offender group was 18 % at 10 years follow-up, compared with 2 % for the violent offenders. Survival analyses revealed the violent offenders were reconvicted at twice the rate of any other group. Reconviction data were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The RMV significantly predicted violent recidivism in the sex and combined sex/violent offender groups. The RMS obtained marginal accuracy in predicting sexual reconviction while the RMV obtained good accuracy at predicting violent non-sex reconviction. An item analysis revealed four factors not included in the risk scales significantly correlated with sexual and violent reconviction.

40|$|SHOPLIFTERS possess {{characteristics}} which distinguish them criminologically {{from other}} thieves. More {{women than men}} are convicted, the <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> is low, and the offenders have a higher average age and come from more diverse socio-economic back grounds. SHOPLIFTING has been investigated from psychiatric and sociological standpoints. It is frequently associated with a stress situation in an otherwise law-abiding individual. He may then disregard the criminality of his act {{for the sake of}} its therapeutic effect. It can be carried out successfully without the support of a criminal subculture, but that support may be essential if the offender is to continue once discovered. RESEARCH to date is concerned mainly with the convicted shoplifter - but many who are apprehended are never convicted, since this depends primarily on the readiness of the store to instigate proceedings against them. Although few stores keep reliable records about those they apprehend, one firm made 382 such records available for analysis. From this a descriptive report was made, and a comparison drawn between those apprehended and those convicted.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The study compared the relative effectiveness of two types of residential treatment in reducing the subsequent offending of delinquent boys. It was undertaken in two house-units of an approved school in the West of England which admitted delinquent boys {{between the ages of}} 13 - 15 on entry. Under comparison were a therapeutic community (the Experimental or E House), and a traditional regime (the Control or C House) which emphasised training rather than treatment as a means of rehabilitating young offenders. A controlled trial design was used, boys considered eligible for treatment being randomly allocated between the E and C Houses. Boys entering the School but considered ineligible were sent to a Third House. (Comparison data is included for this group.) Data on the treatment processes and boys' reactions were collected, and a standardized two-year follow-up of those released, using data from criminal records, was carried out. Main Topics : Background characteristics of the boys at entry; post hoc determination of eligibility criteria used to govern entry into the controlled trial subsample; success of the random allocation process; the treatment processes and boys' reactions to them; a standardized two-year follow-up to measure the post-treatment <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> of E and C regimes; comparisons with a third regime, housing the non-eligibles, which {{was not part of the}} controlled trial.

Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were used to investigate recidivism rates while controlling for time at risk. Results During the 10 -year period, 502 offenders were discharged from medium security treatment. Over a follow-up period averaging 3. 6 years, 7. 4 % of discharged patients were reconvicted or received a new ‘not {{guilty by reason of}} insanity’ (NGRI) verdict for a violent offence.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of {{offering}} victims choice in their level of engagement with restorative justice interventions. Consequently, this study compared the expected risk for reconviction, calculated using the Offender Group Reconviction Scale and actual <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> for completers and non-completers of three different restorative justice (RJ) initiatives: conference, letter of apology and victim-empathy work. Where reconvictions were evident the comparative level of harm between the initial and subsequent offences was examined. This was a risk-band analysis of 253 offenders who had received an RJ sentence between September 2007 and September 2011. Data analysis began after September 2012, to allow at least a one-year follow-up. The analyses revealed statistically significant differences between expected and actual <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> for all three interventions. The choice offered to victims regarding their degree of involvement in the RJ sentence appears to do no harm; indeed it is still associated with lower <b>rates</b> of <b>reconviction</b> and a relatively high likelihood of a reduction in harm where reoffending occurs...|$|R

40|$|Reducing {{offending}} is a main aim of {{the probation}} service, but few mechanisms exist to monitor how this is achieved. This paper describes how information about reconvic-tions can provide routine feedback about effectiveness in combating offending. Using a reconviction predictor, outcome, in terms of <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate,</b> can be evaluated against predicted outcome. A predictor was validated for use in Inner London using case records. Information was obtained retrospectively about offenders {{at the start of}} their probation orders, and about subsequent reconvictions over thirteen months of probation. The predictor was found to have considerable predictive power. The predictor was piloted for routine use by probation officers, and a customized version of the predictor was developed. The research is now moving into a third stage, of developing an end of probation order return which will supply information about reconvictions. Issues relating to the use of reconvictions as a performance indicator, and questions of implementation, arc discussed. Combating offending is central to the day-to-day work of probation officers; crime reduction is the raison d'etre of the probation service (Inner London Probation Service, 1993), and yet information about the reconvictions of offenders supervised by the service is rarely available. A reason for this lack of feedback might be its limited value to indi-vidual probation officers, teams and projects. If a team has a lower than average rate of reconvictions, who can say whether this is because of the efforts of its officers, or because it has an 'easier ' (i. e. less ser-iously or actively offending) than average caseload? The work described in this paper was carried out to find ways of answering these questions...|$|E
40|$|This quantitative-descriptive study reports data on ex-offenders who resided at a {{community-based}} {{residential centre}} (CRC) in St. John's, Newfoundland. This study, the first formal research about correctional treatment programs in Newfoundland, describes background characteristics and program {{factors related to}} recidivism over a two year follow-up period. [...] The study sample was composed of 172 males who stayed at Howard House between April, 1977 and May, 1981. Parolees and mandatory supervision cases {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Correctional Service of Canada (C. S. C.), and Temporary Absence (T. A. cases along with probationers referred through the provincial Department of Justice, comprised the sample. [...] Data were collected from individual Howard House files and Finger Print Serves (FPS) records obtained through the Canadian Police Service Information Centre (CPSIC). Four study instruments were developed and used in this study: 1) The Program Participation Scale (PPS), 2) the Alcohol and/or Other Drug Problem Scale, 3) the Employment History Scale, and 4) the Family Support Scale. In regard to the PPS, two independent raters assessed Howard House files and rated program participation according to the criteria of the scale; and there was a 74 % degree of congruence between their ratings. [...] The study sample was composed of men who were primarily young, single, from rural Newfoundland, with generally poor educational backgrounds, and lacking in family support. Almost half had an observed alcohol problem, while more than half had been previously incarcerated. The large majority were employed (74. 1 %) or attending an educational institution (6. 4 %) while residing at Howard House. [...] Eighty-two percent of those in the study sample successfully completed the Howard House program, which compares with other CRC study findings, while the <b>reconviction</b> <b>rate</b> of 32. 6 % after two years compares favourably with other Canadian recidivism studies. More specifically, the following variables were found to be significant and related to recidivism: 1) poor program participation, 2) the greater the number of occasions convicted two years prior to Howard House, 3) the greater the number of occasions convicted as an adult, 4) the shorter the period of time "on the street" without a conviction two years prior to Howard House, 5) previous incarcerations, 6) alcohol/drug problems, 7) poor family support, 8) property offender status, and 9) unemployed on the day of departure from Howard House.

40|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the Criminal Justice Act 1982, probation day centres {{have assumed}} {{an important role}} in the work of the probation service and as a sentencing option. This paper discusses the success of day centres in terms of their <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates,</b> while pointing to the limitations of relying solely on this criterion as a measure of success. It is concluded that, taking account of the high-risk offenders who tend to be the recipients of a day centre order (17 - 25 years old, with several previous convictions and experience of custody), the <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> of centres are not unacceptable, although wide variation among centres merits further study. Probation day centres are the most recent major development in mainstream probation work—and may well be the most significant—since the introduction of the community service order in the mid- 1970 s. 1 Day centres offer probation officers a new method of working with offenders; in the centres, group work replaces individual counselling. Since the Criminal Justice Act 1982 the number of day centres in existence has multiplied rapidly (it is difficult to state with any degree of certainty how many centres exist, but it is likely that there are between 80 and 100 in operation) and they are now a major probation resource.

40|$|In criminology, {{measuring}} recidivism is {{a well-known}} method of establishing the preventive effect of penal interventions. There are measurements of this kind dating from {{as early as the}} 19 th century. Recidivism studies have been conducted in the Netherlands too, but the earliest we know of stem from the 1970 s. Due to developments in public sector fund accounting methods, interest in <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> is now again on the increase. The Dutch government is looking for clear indicators to gauge the success of implemented policy measures. In the area of penal law recidivism, or rather the absence thereof, is readily embraced as a valid and efficient outcome indicator. Under what circumstances do recidivism statistics provide proof of the efficacy of policy interventions? And how can this construct best be measured? In the Netherlands there is no tradition of recidivism research. The methods used in past evaluation studies vary widely, the measurements were predominantly small-scale, and most studies were conducted {{at a time when the}} penal interventions under investigation were still at a developmental stage. Recidivism research in the Netherlands has lacked a sound methodological basis and there is consequently no comprehensive view on the outcome of penal interventions – until recently, that is, since the WODC has meanwhile developed a ‘Recidivism Monitor’.

40|$|This study {{challenges}} {{a number}} of preconceptions about the risks posed by sex offenders who have been sentenced to long determinate terms of imprisonment: 162 prisoners were followed-up {{for four years and}} 94 for six years. The category `sexual offender¿ was disaggregated in order to examine <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> of offenders against adults as compared with offenders against children, whether in an intra-familial or extra-familial setting, and to explore evidence of `specialization¿. The study also analysed the extent to which members of the Parole Board, in deliberating on the suitability of these prisoners for parole, correctly identified as `high risks¿ those who were subsequently reconvicted of a sexual or serious violent crime. These `clinical¿ predictions were compared with those derived from an actuarial prediction instrument for sex offenders. The findings have implications for both sentencing and parole...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} life-course {{explanations of}} desistance and explores {{to what extent}} important life-course transitions are associated with reoffending rates in convicted sex offenders. It analyzes the effect of stable dynamic factors and focuses on the way marriage, divorce, and parenthood are associated with recidivism of registered sex offenders over a 25 -year period. The chapter describes the sample of convicted sex offenders in terms of demographic and criminal history characteristics. It then examines general, special, and specific recidivism in this sample over the 25 year period. The chapter estimates event history models to assess {{the extent to which}} <b>reconviction</b> <b>rates</b> for different types of offenses are influenced by between individual characteristics and within individual differences in life course circumstances. Life-course research, however, indicates that institutions like school, work, and intimate relationships can act as important sources of informal social control that deter offenders from committing additional crimes...|$|R
