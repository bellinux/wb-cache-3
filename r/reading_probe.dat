This thesis focuses on extra-grammatical influences that sometimes obscure such judgments. For example, processing resource limitations may lead a perceiver to reject a grammatical sentence because its constituents cannot easily be recognized. Further, extra-linguistic processes may influence sentence ratings due to the analytic nature of the judgment task. Thus, In order for the researcher to accurately delineate the boundary between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences {{it is necessary to}} identify and evaluate non-grammatical influences that muddy acceptability judgments. ^ Three experiments, exploiting the technique of monitoring eye-movements during <b>reading,</b> <b>probe</b> readers 2 ̆ 7 responses to various classes of unacceptable sentences. This technique was chosen because eye-movements serve as a rich source of information about how sentence features are assimilated as they unfold in time. The Referential Model of the human sentence processor (HSP) serves as a theoretical framework for interpreting results, paying careful attention both to computational devices and the resources available to them. ^ Experiments 1 and 2 contrast ungrammatical sentences, containing morpho-syntactic anomalies, with others that are grammatical, yet pragmatically anomalous. The results illustrate that eye-movements are sensitive to constraints invoked by a range of morpho-syntactic and pragmatic anomalies, and that responses to the two classes of anomaly are distinct. These findings are argued to support a model of HSP that engages distinct devices in response to each class of anomalous sentence. ^ Experiment 3 examines the status of constraints on long-distance syntactic movement. Judgment satiation is a phenomenon in which some, but not all, classes of initially unacceptable sentences are judged increasingly acceptable with additional exposure. This study uncovers an on-line counterpart to judgment satiation, where the effort expended in processing (satiable) wh-island violations increases with repeated exposure. No such increase is seen in the case of (non-satiable) adjunct island violations. The initial unacceptability of wh-island violations is argued to stem from a processing resource limitation, while the satiation effect derives from the HSP 2 ̆ 7 s ability to dynamically shift resources to meet the moment-by-moment needs of its sub-components. ...|$|E
40|$|Stephanitis pyri (Fabricius) (Heteroptera Tingidae), {{also known}} as “pear lace bug”, is a heavy fruit pest of Rosaceae common in Southern Europe. Its {{preferred}} host is Pyrus communis, a typical agricultural crop tree of high economical relevance in the region Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy). The damages inflicted to leaves and fruits are marked yellowing and vanish-like tar spots, resulting into complete decline of untreated plants. The number of studies on Tingidae family is still limited, although several species are economically relevant in regions where pear tree orchards are widespread. A study to collect more information on behaviour and especially on feeding habits of the most relevant Tingidae species, S. pyri, was therefore initiated in 2006. The {{purpose of the study}} was to observe and record for the first time the feeding behaviour of S. pyri by Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG), to identify and analyze the different feeding phases and the interactions between the insect and the plant during the feeding process. The identification of EPG phases is based on waveforms, different in number and duration but typical of each species. To collect more information on feeding behaviour, the stylets of the insects were cut (stylectomy) during feeding phases and, after resin inclusion, the plant tissues containing the stylets were examined by optical and electron microscopy to match each stylet position to the typical waveform detected. These data allow to identify the plant tissues involved in feeding, establishing the degree of food specialization of the pest. Comparisons of duration and other parameters of feeding phases were then performed in different hosts, such as the pear varieties “William” and “Conference”, economically relevant cultivars, typical of Emilia Romagna. A study on feeding behaviour during host pre-contact and pre-penetration phases was also performed by choice tests, both in the field and in laboratory. Field experiments were also performed on S. pyri adult and nymph populations, to detect possible differences in development related the genotypes of the pear cultivars analyzed. The leaves of the two varieties are actually different from a morphological point of view: in Conference the leaves are more bended and often overlapping (thus offering a better hiding for insects), while in William they are flat and well separated. To exclude morphological factors in host choice, the experiments were repeated in laboratory on flat, round leaf disks. For field experiments, greenhouses with anti-aphid nets were prepared to restrain each individual S. pyri introduced and born, thus allowing a continuous time recording of insects and of their distribution on plants, and preventing the introduction of other species. The setting of laboratory conditions similar to the orchard ones allowed observations of typical features of behaviour and life cycle, such as orienteering, feeding choices, plant sensitivity or resistance to the pest, longevity, fitness, egg laying habits, etc. Besides choice tests, also no-choice tests were performed on the two pear cultivars to collect more information on development of S. pyri adult and nymph populations. The two cultivars were independently tested to avoid interferences in the host choice. The data collected could also be useful to increase information on the pear cultivar tested, to identify interesting traits for agronomical practices with low environmental impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS Insects Adult male and female individuals of Stephanitis pyri, progeny of individuals collected in orchards between the provinces of Ferrara and Rovigo (Northern Italy), were employed in all experiments. The parent individuals were collected by an entomological sheet on trees of wild pear, Pyrus pyraster (Burgsd.), common pear, Pyrus communis (L.) and apple, Malus pumila (Mill.). The insects were adult males and females of first, second and third generation, raised on P. communis cultivar “Abate” in full vegetative stage, in temperature-controlled rooms at 22 °C and 16 : 8 hours (day/night) photoperiod. Only for the choice test experiments on round-cut leaf portions, first generation S. pyri adults raised on Conference were employed, since this cultivar is considered more sensitive to the pest attack in comparison to William. Plants The plants employed in all experiments were one-year grafted plants of Pyrus communis belonging to the William, Abate and Conference cultivars, respectively grafted to Butyrra Hardi / BA 29 (William and Abate) and on quince Sydo (Conference). All plants were free from chemical pest and fungus disease treatments, raised in plastic pots with standard, regularly watered soil for tree culture. Feeding habits and stylet position Technical equipments Many instruments were simultaneously employed: the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG-DC, Wageningen University), a software for data <b>reading</b> (<b>PROBE</b> 3), an electric microknife (RF microcautery unit), a Faraday cage, a micromanipulator Narishige (Japan), a binocular Nikon 48161 microscope, an optical microscope Nikon Eclipse E 200 (Tokyo, Japan), a Photoshop programs for image analysis, a transmission electron microscope (TEM) Hitachi H- 800 (Electronic Microscopy Centre of the University of Ferrara), an ultramicrotome Reichart Om U 2, (Germany). Semithin sections (about 1 μm thick) were observed at the optical microscope after staining with methylene blue; ultrathin sections (600 Å) for TEM were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. EPG-DC parameters A comparison was performed between the cultivars Conference and William. For each 8 -hr EPG-DC test, a different insect and a different plant were employed: all insects were placed on plants in standardized positions. A total of 20 trials with 20 different insects were performed for each cultivar. All results were validated, considering only those in which no interruptions were recorded in the trial period. The statistical analysis of all EPG parameters and the data obtained by comparison of the insect feeding behaviour in the two cultivars was performed by the Mann-Whitney test (p< 0, 05). Choice tests Choice test on leaves in laboratory. A total of 492 male and female S. pyri IIIrd generation adults were employed, raised on Abate. Each group of 6 individuals was placed inside a 15 -cm Petri dish containing 6 leaves (3 from Conference and 3 from William), alternately arranged. The leaves were collected from different plants and immediately employed in the experiments. The insects were counted on each leaf every 5 minutes for 1 hour. Data were analyzed comparing the average insect number found on each cultivar by Student’s t test. These experiments were performed in September-October 2008. Choice test on leaf disks in laboratory. Each group of 6 individuals (male and female S. pyri IIIrd generation adults, raised on Abate) was placed inside a 15 -cm Petri dish containing 3 leaf disks (2 cm diameter) per cultivar, alternately arranged. A total of 46 replicates were performed, for a total of 552 insects. The average number of insects found over the cultivar disks in each 5 -minute interval was recorded and data were compared by Student’s t test, as previously described. Choice test on leaf disks in laboratory - insects raised on Conference. The experiments were performed as previously described, but employing male and female S. pyri IIIrd generation adults, raised on Conference cultivar (instead of Abate). A total of 46 replicates were performed, for a total of 552 insects. The average number of insects found over the cultivar disks in each 5 -minute interval was recorded and data were compared by Student’s t test, as previously described. Choice test in field. A total of 15 plants for each cultivar (Conference and William) were employed, alternatively placing the grafted plants on two parallel rows, 40 cm apart. To isolate plants from attacks of other pests and from S. pyri parasites and predators, each row was covered by the anti-aphid net. The artificial infestation was performed with first generation S. pyri adults raised on Abate on 13 June 2007. Two adult insects were introduced for each plant and the infestation resulted uniform (relevant condition for experimental success). The observations started 3 days later and were performed at 3 -day intervals by counting the number of adult insects on each plant and, later, also the number of nymphs derived from eggs laid by the adults initially introduced. At the end of tests the average number of insects found on each cultivar and sampling date was compared. The experiments ended on 25 July 2007 because of sharp plant decline due to heavy infestation by lace bugs. Statistical analyses were performed by Student’s t test as previously described. No-choice test in field camp. As in the previous experiments, a total of 15 one-year grafted plants of both cultivars Conference e William, arranged in parallel rows at a distance of 40 cm were employed. To isolate plants from attacks of other pests and from S. pyri parasites and predators, each row was covered by the anti-aphid net, that also prevented possible rain and wind damages. The artificial infestation was performed on 28 April 2008, employing first generation S. pyri adults raised on Abate: the infestation resulted uniform. RESULTS Feeding habits and stylet position This study performed on Stephanitis pyri allowed to record for the first time the feeding behaviour of the insect through EPG-DC recording. The data analysis allowed to characterize the EPG-DC waveform and identify the different phases. Two types of waveform were detected, waveform 1 and waveform 2, representing two different phases of insect feeding (respectively phase 2 and phase 3). Two other phases were identified: the initial one (phase 1), related to stylet penetration into leaf tissues, and the final one (phase 4), during which it is possible to observe at the stereomicroscope the stylet retrieval from the leaf tissues. Thus the EPG-DC of S. pyri is composed of four phases, two of which (phase 2 and phase 3), respectively identifiable by typical waveforms, waveform 1 and waveform 2. The total number of screenings performed and validated (including the data of comparison of phase duration between the two cultivars) was 85, each of them for a length of 8 hours. Correlation of stylet position with EPG-DC wave 1 and 2. The stylectomy in S. pyri to identify the stylet position in relation to the waveform type allowed to obtain in four experiments data on their position in relation to wave 2 (or feeding phase 3). In two cases the stylets penetrate until the borders of vascular bundles, and in the other two they penetrate the mesophyll, but do not go beyond the spongy parenchyma. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that during waveform 2 does S. pyri not perform a specialized tissue choice. Comparison of phases between Conference and William A total of 65 repeats (each lasting 8 hours) was performed using 31 adult f S. pyri or the Conference cultivar and 34 for the William one. The results of this series of experiments shows a significant difference (p = 0. 014) in total duration of waveform 2, longer in William (average duration of 1906. 65 seconds) in comparison to Conference (average duration 1275. 73 seconds; standard error respectively 82. 90 in William and 241. 66 in Conference). Influence of Conference and William cultivars on S. pyri behaviour in pre-feeding phase and insect permanence on host plant Choice test on leaves in laboratory. S. pyri expresses a significant host preference for Conference leaves, already detectable after 10 minutes (an average of 1. 32 individuals on Conference and of 0. 8 individuals per leaf on William, p = 0. 03). This difference increases with time. Choice test on leaf disks in laboratory. Again, a significant preference is expressed by S. pyri towards Conference from minute 35 to minute 40. The differences become non-significant from minute 41 to minute 55, then again are significant until the end of the experiment. Choice test on leaf disks – insects raised on Conference. The same series of experiments was repeated with insects raised on Conference cultivar. The results were very similar to those obtained in the previous experiments: Conference is the preferred host plant, with values similar to the previous ones. Choice test in field. The field experiments also support the preference of S. pyri towards Conference cultivar, with a significant difference (an average peak presence of about 65 individuals vs. about 35 in William). These results are also supported by the average number of nymphs on each plant, with a peak of almost 120 individuals per Conference plant, in comparison to about 40 individuals per William plant. No-Choice test in field. Towards the end of June a significant difference was noticed in the average number of individuals, in favour of William, but in July the significant difference favours Conference. The results also show that the peak of number of adults is reached after about five weeks on the William cultivar (average about 15 individuals per plant). The peak of the number of adult S. pyri on Conference appears later but reaches an average of almost 20 individuals per plant. Concerning the average number of nymphs per plant, it is always higher in William in comparison to Conference (respectively an average of 90 vs. 50). The average number rebalances in the last part of the experiment, reaching an average maximum peak of 120 individuals for both varieties. CONCLUSIONS - For the first time the EPG-DC waveform was recorded and characterized in all its phases in the pear leace bug, Stephanytis pyri (Fabricius) (Heteroptera, Tingidae). - Two economically relevant pear cultivars (“Conference” and “William”), common in orchards of Emilia-Romagna (Northern Italy) were analyzed for feeding habits and host choice in S. pyri. Significant difference were detected between the two cultivars in waveform 2 (feeding phase 3). - The stylet position was analyzed by optical and electron microscopy and was also determined in association to waveform 2 (feeding phase 3) - The choice tests on leaves, leaf disks and plants of both cultivars showed significant differences in host preference by. S. pyri. These difference are very likely related to morphological factors, the most relevant of which appears the leaf shape. - The field choice tests showed a host preference of to S. pyri towards Conference, when the cultivars are tested simultaneously. However, when plants are separately tested, the insects favour William for population development. The data collected in this study appear very interesting and require further investigations, especially concerning the complex relationships between S. pyri and the pear cultivar tested: these relationships may allow to identify interesting traits for agronomical practices with low environmental impact...|$|E

Scalp-recorded eventrelated brain potentials (ERPs) were collected as healthy adults <b>read</b> <b>probe</b> words (CRAZY) preceded either by jokes or non-funny controls (Everyone had so much fun jumping into the swimming pool, we decided to put in a little water/platform.) Probes were related to the meaning of the jokes, but not the controls. In experiment 1 a, with central presentation, probes following jokes (related) elicited less negative ERPs 300 - 700 ms post-onset (N 400) than did probes following non-funny controls (unrelated). This finding suggests related probes were primed by the jokes. In addition, unrelated probes elicited a larger anterior positivity 700 - 900 ms than did related, as irrelevant stimuli impacted control processes invoked by task demands. In experiment 1 b, probes (CRAZY) were preceded only by sentence-final words from jokes (water) or controls (platform). No ERP effects were observed in experiment 1 b, suggesting the N 400 priming effect and the anterior positivity observed in experiment 1 a reflect semantic activations at the discourse level.

The latter can transfer spin between the two subsystems in an incoherent way owing to the $(s;p) -(d;f) $ exchange scattering. Since the effect of the external excitation in this process is reduced to the transient heating of the mobile electron subsystem, we also discuss possibility to trigger the magnetization reversal by applying a voltage bias pulse to antiferromagnetically coupled metallic ferromagnetic layers embedded in point contact or tunneling structures.

As a result, educators {{are faced with the}} challenge of teaching basic skills to second-language learners (SLL) while simultaneously promoting the development of their second language. Despite the fact that SLL from Spanish-speaking backgrounds are about twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to be reading below average for their age (Moss 2 ̆ 6 Puma, 1995), research on second-language children 2 ̆ 7 s reading is limited in scope and quantity. The limited research has indicated that the reading rate of SLL might be slower than that of native-English speakers (Geva, Wade-Woolley, 2 ̆ 6 Shaney, 1997; Mace-Matluck, 1979). This study was conducted with the purpose of (a) examining SLL weekly rates of growth (slopes) in reading, (b) comparing these rates to those demonstrated by of native-English speakers in a study conducted by Fuchs, Fuchs, Hamlett, Walz, and Germann (1993), and (c) understanding whether certain factors typically discussed in the educational literature on SLL contribute to positive slopes in reading. ^ The sample was composed of SLL in second through fourth grade (n = 69) attending two urban elementary schools in Western Massachusetts. Grade-level Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM) English <b>reading</b> <b>probes</b> were administered to children once a week for 12 -weeks. A z-test for independent samples was used to compare slopes found in the present study and those found by Fuchs et al. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine the degree of influence of proficiency in English and/or Spanish, age, Spanish reading fluency, and language(s) used for reading instruction on weekly outcomes in reading. Both descriptive and correlational research methods were used to answer these questions. The pattern of reading growth across grades identified in the present study suggests that SLL make the most dramatic reading growth in the later grades (i. e., fourth grade).

The treatment emphasized the reestablishment of phonetic radical-to-syllable correspondences in regular and partially regular phonetic compounds and encouraged the patient {{to make use of}} the semantic information associated with the signific radical to assist her in arriving at the target pronunciation. By the end of the therapy, CSH read all the treatment items flawlessly and improved significantly on <b>reading</b> generalization <b>probes</b> while no observable change was found in the irregular phonetic compound control probes. Specific treatment effect was evidenced by the synchrony between the introduction of training and marked progress seen at various treatment stages, and greater improvement on treatment than generalization probes. In addition, CSH demonstrated an increase in regularization errors coupled with a decrease in 'no responses'...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{advantage is}} that the sequencing reactions are non-progressive; after each <b>reading</b> of the <b>probe,</b> the probe and anchor are removed and a new anchor and probe set are added. Therefore, if a probe did not bind in the previous reaction, this {{has no effect on}} the next probe ligation, thus eliminating a major source of reading error that may occur in other next generation sequencing platforms. [...] It also reduces the use of expensive probes, since DNA nanoball sequencing does not necessitate the probe ligation reaction to be run to completion.|$|R
40|$|A 16 -year-old gunslinger named "Doug, " who {{performed}} nine drive-by shootings {{in his hometown}} of Omaha in 1 year, considers the films South Central and Boyz'n the Hood to be affirmations of his aspirations and lifestyle (Hull, 1993). In contrast, most viewers of these films absorbed explicit lessons about which behaviors and life choices to avoid. What are the factors that lead to these radically different understandings of the same video text? Why are the "take-home " moral lessons so distinct? Combining methods and theory from two research areas—discourse comprehension and moral judgment—a research program is summarized that examines moral thinking using methods such as narrative recall, multiple-choice moral theme extraction, thinking aloud while <b>reading,</b> and <b>probing</b> for inferences while reading on computer. These studies offer a new approach to uncovering how people process moral events in discourse such as written and visual texts, persuasive messages, and real-life events.

30|$|Total RNA was {{extracted}} from frozen quadriceps muscle (n[*]=[*] 4) {{by using an}} RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan) {{in accordance with the}} manufacturer’s instructions. For microarray analysis, the quality of total RNA samples was checked with an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc, Tokyo, Japan); the RNA integrity number of each sample was over 7.0. DNA microarray analysis was performed with a one-color system and the Agilent Mouse SurePrint G 3 mouse gene expression array. In brief, 200  ng of each RNA was labeled and amplified with a Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (one color; Agilent Technologies) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Cyanine 3 -labeled cRNA was fragmented and hybridized by using a Gene Expression Hybridization Kit and then washed with a Gene Expression Wash Pack (both Agilent Technologies). The hybridized microarray slides were scanned with an Agilent Technologies Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies) and the data were extracted by using Agilent Feature Extraction 10.7. 1 in Hokkaido-System Science (Sapporo, Japan). After we had confirmed the high degree of reliability of the microarray processes {{on the basis of the}} QC report, data normalization and filtering were performed with GeneSpring GX 11.5 (Agilent technologies), as follows: 1) threshold raw signals were set to 1.0.; 2) 75 th percentile normalization was used for the normalization algorithm; 3) the baseline was transformed to the median of all samples; and 4) raw values filtered by signal intensity value (upper cut-off: 100 th percentile; lower cut-off: 20 th percentile) of raw values and flagging to exclude absent <b>reads.</b> <b>Probe</b> sets were then identified by using unpaired t-test (P[*]<[*] 0.05) to compare between the experimental and control SAMP 1 groups, with a relative fold-change value of > 1.2 and no correction for multiple testing; this was done because the MicroArray Quality Control Consortium suggests the use of a fold-change cut off along with a non-stringent P-value cut-off as a baseline practice to improve reproducibility in microarray data processing (MAQC Consortium et al. 2006). Selected probe sets were analyzed with IPA (Ingenuity Pathways Analysis) software version 9.0 (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA).|$|R

Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, {{the outline of the}} privy is carefully excavated. This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through. Dug dirt or “fluff” as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling.

40|$|The present {{research}} investigated {{the effects of}} negation on young and older adults’ comprehension of sentences. Participants <b>read</b> sentences, named <b>probe</b> words, answered comprehension questions, and completed the operation-span test. Negation adversely affected comprehension in both age groups such that probe word naming times were marginally slower and comprehension accuracy was reduced for negative sentences. Although older adults' comprehension overall was poorer than young adults, the negation effects were similar for both age groups. Furthermore, age was less predictive of negation comprehension than working memory. Unlike other variables that demonstrate age-related declines in reading comprehension, difficulties in processing negation may not increase with age...|$|R
40|$|A central {{question}} for psycholinguistics concerns {{the role of}} grammatical constraints in online sentence processing. Many current theories maintain that the language processing mechanism constructs a parse or parses that are grammaticality consistent with {{the whole of the}} perceived input when it processes each word. Several bottom-up, dynamical models make a contrasting prediction: partial parses which are syntactically compatible with only a proper subpart of the input are sometimes constructed, at least temporarily. Three self-paced <b>reading</b> experiments <b>probed</b> for interference from such locally coherent structures. The first tested for a distracting effect of irrelevant Subject-Predicate interpretations of Noun Phrase-Verb Phrase sequences (The coach smiled at the player tossed a frisbee) on reading times. The second addressed {{the question of whether the}} interference effects can be treated as lexical interference, instead of involving the formation of locally coherent syntactic structures. The third replicated the reading time effects of the first two experiments with grammaticality judgments. We evaluate the dynamical account, comparing it to several plausible approaches that also predict effects of local coherence, and arguing against several accounts which rule out the formation of merely locally coherent structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − Assessment {{of risks}} {{connected}} with exposure to electromagnetic fields at either low or radio frequencies requires appropriate {{evaluation of the}} value <b>read</b> on <b>probe’s</b> display – whose variability depends on both EM field and measurement system – {{with respect to the}} actual value of the underlying monitored process. That can be accomplished through a statistical investigation about whether the over-come of reference limits which can possibly have happened is merely a transient effect of measurement uncertainty which sums up with random process variation, or rather a more serious stable condition which calls for countermea-sures. To that end, it is required that the probability distribution of the monitored process be obtained from the set of meas-ured data, which can be done by taking out of them the fluc-tuation due to measurement itself. Such methodology falls under the generic name of deconvolution, after the operation used to separate the two contributions, and requires a pre-liminary measurement campaign for the evaluation of the statistical distribution of data. This paper presents the men-tioned methodology and provides an example pertaining the evaluation of the electromagnetic field in urban area...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether different encounters {{of reading}} material influence {{the likelihood of}} mind wandering, memory for the material, and the ratings {{of interest in the}} material. In a within-subjects design participants experienced three different reading encounters: 1) reading a passage aloud, 2) listening to a passage being read to them, and 3) reading a passage silently. Throughout each <b>reading</b> encounter <b>probes</b> were given in order to identify mind wandering. After finishing the passage participants also rated how interesting it was and completed a content recognition test. Results showed that reading aloud led to the least amount of mind wandering, while listening to the passage led to the most mind wandering. Listening to the passage was also associated with the poorest memory performance and the least interest in the material. Finally, within the silent reading and listening encounters we observed negative relations between mind wandering and both memory performance and interest in the material, replicating previous findings. Taken together, the present findings improve our {{understanding of the nature of}} mind wandering while reading, and have potentially important implications for readers seeking to take advantage of the convenience of audiobooks and podcasts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{techniques}} are developed to <b>read</b> out nanoscale <b>probes</b> and arrays of probes. The main targeted application area is probe-based data storage. The work {{also contributes to}} other areas, such as metrology, biological sensing, materials research and nano-electro-mechanical switches. First, an exhaustive literature review of the accomplishments within probe storage is presented. It is found that optical readout techniques are used extensively in applications using probes; however, the very demanding application probe storage is not amongst them. Optical readout of probes offers reliability, high-speed, low noise and low complexity. It has to be extended to operation on arrays of probes for successful implementation in probe storage. The first technique that is developed in this work is parallel [...] . ...|$|R

Furthermore, <b>reading</b> times and <b>probe</b> reaction times on a secondary task were longer when subjects were processing text segments containing information of the type addressed by questions. These results can be accounted for by a mvolume of attention " theory asserting that readers selectively allocate a greater volume of attention to question- relevant information, and that a process supported by the additional attention causes more of the Information to be learned. This theory was found to account for somewhat more than two-thirds of the indirect effect of questions and one-third o...|$|R
