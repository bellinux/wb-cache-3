40|$|The {{process for}} assuring {{adequate}} controls over {{the disposition of}} all <b>residual</b> <b>waste</b> from any water treatment processing ___________________________________________________________________ Summary – Assuring adequate controls over the disposition of all <b>residual</b> <b>waste</b> or <b>sludge</b> from any water treatment processing is authorized under state authority by adding sludge requirements to the state Water Pollution Control Operating Permit. Specific issues involving sludge (residuals) for the Missouri and Mississippi rivers involving permitting and other issues are addressed in the department’s regulations for effluent limits. Sludge is the byproduct of the industrial treatment process of raw wastewater and {{is the result of}} contaminants removed from the wastewater stream. Sludge that meets the requirements for land application is called biosolids. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (the department) requires state operating permits for all persons who operate, use or maintain facilities for the storage, treatment or disposal of sludge and/or biosolids as well as construction permits for those who build such facilities for storage, treatment or disposal. The department, under state rules, administers a state biosolids program. A Missouri biosolids program has been in place sinc...|$|R

A biological approach {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> is through predation by aquatic worms. In this paper we test the applicability of a new reactor concept for sludge reduction by the aquatic worm Lumbriculus variegatus. In this reactor concept the worms are immobilized in a carrier material. In sequencing batch experiments, the sludge breakdown in the predation reactor is compared to sludge breakdown in a blank reactor (i. e. without worms). Predation by the worms results in a distinct sludge reduction, which is almost three times higher than in the blank experiment. The worm faeces that are produced after sludge predation have a sludge volume index (SVI) that is approximately half that of the initial <b>waste</b> <b>sludge.</b> Due to the configuration of the predation reactor, <b>waste</b> <b>sludge,</b> worm faeces and worms are separated, which is beneficial to further processing.

Adequate EU and RS strategies, legislation and well-known good practises (IPPC directive/BAT/BREF) were studied. Alternative contemporary proceedings for <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable <b>wastes</b> treatment were checked and compared by SWOT analysis. An examination of actual treatment with such kind of wastes was carried out for Gorenjska region. Three different options of contemporary biodegradable <b>wastes</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> treatment were experimentally checked. Findings were corroborated with physical – chemical – biological analyses of entry materials and final products and also with characteristics and products applicability of single option. An economic seight was studied for single option, too. In view of received data the most appropriate method for integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludges</b> and biodegradable <b>wastes</b> in Gorenjska region was proposed; namely anaerobic digestion with biogas production, followed by composting of the residue.

However, those methods consume a lot of time, energy and operating cost. Thus, this work targets to recover the base oil from <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> using ultrasonic solvent extraction method. It was done by determining the effect of ultrasonic power, extraction time and types of solvent used into the samples. The treatment of <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> using Hexane, Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a medium solvent was conducted using ultrasonic bath (maximum power is 240 W) at a different number of power scales, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 9. The effects of treatment duration have been tested at different times which are 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes. The types of solvent have been analyzed between the effect of Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH). The samples were then separated using a centrifuge machines in order to remove sludge particles {{at the bottom of}} centrifuges tubes. Based on the results obtained, it can be determined the optimum base oil recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> at 30 minutes with ultrasonic power at 53. 3 W which is on the power scale number 2 using KOH as a medium reagent.

These processes produce huge volumes of <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> (up 1. 5 million m 3 /year in the Netherlands). Further processing of the <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> involves transportation, thickening and incineration. A decrease {{in the amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> would be both environmentally and economically attractive. Aquatic worms can be used {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>waste</b> <b>sludge.</b> After predation by the worms, the amount of final sludge is lower. Additionally it has a distinctive granular structure with improved dewaterability characteristics. If a useful application can be found for the worms that are produced in the predation process, then a valuable product would be obtained from a waste material. Aquatic worms can be used for improved processing of <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> and recovery of resources. The <b>waste</b> <b>sludge</b> is produced in biological {{waste water treatment}}. In the Netherlands, this sludge is mostly thickened, dried and incinerated. These are costly operations in which only some energy is recovered. Recently, an aquatic worm (Lumbriculus variegatus) was found, which consumes the sludge, grows on it and compacts the non-digested sludge into worm faeces. In a new reactor concept the worms are placed in a mesh, thereby retaining them in the reactor and allowing for separate collection of the compact worm faeces. The latter results in much more efficient processing of the remaining solids, i. e. the worm faeces. Additionally, worm biomass is produced that contains a high protein fraction, offering opportunities for re-use.
