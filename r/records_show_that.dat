5|$|It gained further {{attention}} {{after the}} first companion of Muhammad, 'Uthman ibn Maz'un (or As'ad ibn Zurarah) was buried there in 625. Four Shi'a Imams: Hasan ibn Ali, Ali ibn Husayn, Muhammad al-Baqir, and Jafar al-Sadiq were also buried there making it an important location for Shia Muslims. Historical <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> there were domes, cupolas, and mausoleums in Jannat al-Baqi before the 20th century; today it is a bare land without any buildings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> 121 internees {{died in the}} camp, mostly due to illness, {{with half}} the deaths being of internees {{over the age of}} 50. There were also a few {{accidental}} deaths. Two internees died from falls and one child drowned. The worst accident occurred during the large US Navy attack against Hong Kong on 16 January 1945, when a plane accidentally bombed Bungalow 5 at St. Stephen's College, killing 14 internees. These internees were buried at Stanley Military Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Visitors to Brook Farm came frequently, totaling an {{estimated}} 1,150 each year, though each was charged for their visit.

5|$|According to Diane Dimond of Hard Copy, Torbiner's <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration {{of drugs in}} house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contemporary}} <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> his grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a veterinarian, not a rancher, {{and was not}} wealthy.

Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. While some sources support Scientology's claim of Hubbard's blood brotherhood, other sources say that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that he had ever been a Blackfeet blood brother.|$|E

5|$|In 1764 the {{population}} of the island was 52. Later census <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> there were 113residents in 1841, 150 in 1881, 142 in 1891 (occupying 28houses, compared to the 1841 total of 19), and 135 in 1901. Families were often large, and ten or more children was not uncommon, with three generations sometimes sharing a single small house. Life was co-operative with fishing, waulking, peat cutting and landing the boats all being communal activities. The island is remote but was by no means cut off. In the 19th century fishermen sold fish in Glasgow and Ireland, both men and women worked on the east coast herring fishing industry, and food was brought in from mainland Scotland on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Many prelates lived {{around the}} street during the Middle Ages, {{including}} the Bishops of Salisbury and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe and Cirencester. Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street {{owing to the}} nearby river, though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid-14th century. Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented {{as early as the}} 14th century. <b>Records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for attacking a friar in Fleet Street, though modern historians believe this is apocryphal.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1887 Pickingill's {{wife died}} at the age of 63 in Canewdon; her death was {{attributed}} to a disease of the liver by the certifying doctor. She was buried at Canewdon's St. Nicholas Church on 17 September. According to the 1891 census, Pickingill was still employed as an agricultural labourer, and was living in Canewdon with his married daughter Marry Ann and his granddaughter, Emily Wood. <b>Records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> he was living in a rented cottage with an adjacent garden, and that in July 1899 the owner sold the property at auction.

5|$|Surviving <b>records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the German claimants {{included}} Staffelkapitän Hauptmann Theodor Rossiwall and Oberleutnant Sophus Baagoe {{who were}} credited with kills against Hurricanes, taking their scores to 12 and 14 respectively.

One of the 80 Squadron pilots involved in the battle, Roald Dahl, records five Hurricanes were downed in several air battles that day, with four pilots dying. One of those was Pattle.|$|E
5|$|The Jägerstab was {{instrumental}} in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labour {{for the benefit of}} Germany's war industry and its air force, the Luftwaffe. The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation manufacturing. <b>Records</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of Jägerstab's construction activities. Taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects, the historian Marc Buggeln estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000−90,000 inmates. They belonged to the various sub-camps of Mittelbau-Dora, Mauthausen-Gusen, Buchenwald and other camps. The prisoners worked for Junkers, Messerschmitt, Henschel and BMW, among others.|$|E
