5|$|The Human Rights Campaign, a LGBT rights organization, has {{frequently}} given Ryan a 0/100 rating on its legislative scorecard. During Paul Ryan's 2012 vice presidential bid, he {{was endorsed by}} two gay conservative organizations, GOProud and the Log Cabin Republicans. On April 30, 2013, Ryan came {{out in favor of}} same-sex couples adopting children. <b>Ryan</b> <b>said</b> he had always supported civil unions, and that if the US Supreme Court declares the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, then he believes it will become a federalist issue for states to decide same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|Westerman {{was signed}} by the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2009. On June 9, 2009, Jets head coach Rex <b>Ryan</b> <b>said</b> that he {{expected}} Westerman to make the team's final roster. He ended up making the final roster as an outside linebacker and recorded two tackles and a sack in his debut against the Houston Texans on September 13. On October 9, 2011, Westerman recorded 5 tackles along with 2 sacks against the New England Patriots but in a losing effort while the Jets lost 30–21.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews in which two Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel <b>Ryan,</b> <b>said</b> that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E

On December 14, Nunes requested a formal briefing to gain more information about assertions officials had revealed to the media; the DNI refused, citing the ongoing review ordered by President Obama.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, 2006, {{the jury}} found Ryan and Warner guilty on all counts. However, when ruling on post-trial motions, the judge {{dismissed}} two counts against Ryan for lack of proof. <b>Ryan</b> <b>said</b> that he would appeal the verdict, {{largely due to the}} issues with the jury.|$|E
25|$|Ryan and Lavelle {{disagreed}} {{over the}} number of protective reaction strikes flown under the liberalized rules. <b>Ryan</b> <b>said</b> there were 28, while Lavelle said there were 20 or fewer.

25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James <b>Ryan,</b> <b>said</b> he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, {{to see if they could}} find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig at the site of the hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.|$|E

Jets head coach Rex <b>Ryan</b> <b>said</b> that although Warren would be practicing at both cornerback and safety, he felt that Warren's best shot was at safety.
