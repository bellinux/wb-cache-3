5000|$|The Hausa-language cinema, {{also known}} informally as Kannywood {{is also a}} sub-industry of Nollywood, mainly based in Kano. The cinema, {{which is the largest}} in Northern Nigeria slowly evolved from the {{productions}} of RTV Kaduna and Radio Kaduna in the 1960s. Veterans like Dalhatu Bawa and Kasimu Yero pioneered drama productions that became popular with the Northern audience. The 1990s saw a dramatic change in the Northern Nigerian cinema, eager to attract more Hausa audience who find Bollywood movies more attractive, Kannywood; a cinematic synthesis of Indian and Hausa culture evolved and became extremely popular. Turmin Danya ("The Draw"), 1990, is usually cited as the first commercially successful Kannywood film. It was quickly followed by others like Gimbiya Fatima and Kiyarda Da Ni. Sunusi Shehu of Tauraruwa Magazine created the term [...] "Kannywood" [...] in 1999 and it soon became the popular <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> for the industry.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a three-layer model for generation {{and recognition of}} attention-drawing behavior. The model enables a robot to recognize people’s attention-drawing behavior {{as well as to}} perform attention-drawing behavior to people. It consists of three layers: the PSM (Pointing Space Model), the RTM (<b>Reference</b> <b>Term</b> Model), and the OPM (Object Property Model). The PSM associates the pointing gesture with a <b>reference</b> <b>term,</b> the RTM associates positional relationships with a <b>reference</b> <b>term,</b> and the OPM associates other supplemental verbal cues with a <b>reference</b> <b>term.</b> We implemented the model in a humanoid robot, Robovie, and verified its effectiveness through an experiment.

40|$|When we {{talk about}} objects in an environment, we {{indicate}} to a listener which object is currently under consideration by using pointing gesture and such reference terms as "this" and "that". Such reference terms {{play an important role}} in human interaction by quickly informing the listener of an indicated object's location. In this research, we propose a threelayered draw-attention model for humanoid robots with gestures and verbal cues. Our proposed three-layered model consists of three sub models: <b>Reference</b> <b>Term</b> Model (RTM), Limit Distance Model (LDM) and Object Property Model (OPM). RTM decides an appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> using functions constructed by an analysis of human behavior. LDM decides whether to use the object's property with a <b>reference</b> <b>term.</b> OPM decides the appropriate property for indicating the object by comparing object properties with each other. We developed an attention drawing system in a communication robot named "Robovie" based on the three layered model. We confirmed its effectiveness through the experiments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the forms, interpersonal or social functions {{and patterns of}} terms used as address or reference resources in spoken urban Shona, integrating Hymesâ€™s (1962) Ethnography of Communication theory and {{a modified version of}} Brown and Levinsonâ€™s (1987) Politeness theory as analytical tools. Our concern is the speakerâ€™s manipulation of address or <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> to index social meanings that serve desired social functions. Although personal address or <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> have obvious literal meanings that serve referential functions, native speakers of Shona recognise certain usages as social or idiomatic, rather than literal, in their reference to others. That is, linguistic resources carry meaning beyond their literal reference to persons and relationships. The discovery of social meaning may be accomplished by studying normative uses of address or <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> in a wide array of contexts and relationships. The usual assumption in personal relationship research has been, until recently, that only the relationship of the interlocutors, their individual qualities and needs and what they have communicated to each other about themselves determine their address behaviour. We take a broader approach attributing address choice and usage to factors pertaining to the interlocutorsâ€™ personal relationship as well as the cultural premises, beliefs and values of their society. Thus, relationships and the social world are intertwined systems of meaning. We obtained data from everyday interactions through triangulated research techniques. Ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews are the main methods of data collection, supplemented by casual conversations, tape recording and transcriptions of conversations and introspection...|$|R
40|$|The study aims {{to examine}} the use of first-person {{personal}} <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> in Thai by kathoeys and women. Kathoeys are male-to-female transgender individuals in Thailand usually viewed as a third sex in Thai society. In this study, kathoeys‟ use of first-person personal <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> in the internet-based data was compared to women‟s. The terms were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The survey was conducted to obtain {{more information about the}} terms found in the internet-based data. Five categories of first-person personal <b>reference</b> <b>terms</b> are found: personal pronouns, personal names, kin terms, the combination of kin term and personal name, and the word „the post owner. ‟ Pronouns are used most frequently by both kathoeys and women. Gender-neutral pronouns are used more often than male and female pronouns by both kathoeys and women. Kathoeys perform their femininity through the use of female pronouns with a frequency even higher than women. The female pronoun dichan is used as a default pronoun by kathoeys in the internet-based data while used for an emphatic purpose by women along with other female pronouns ichan, dian and dan. The questionnaire responses reveal that dichan, ichan, dian and dan directly index femininity and that most kathoey respondents use the male pronoun phom, a direct index of masculinity, in formal situations conforming to their biological gender. Moreover, the questionnaire also shows different meanings conveyed through different terms including the only Chinese kin term found in the data which, apart from directly indexing older age and femininity, is used by kathoeys to index experience and power of speakers...|$|R

A simple {{equation}} of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid: a new <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> for equations of state and perturbation theories. Fluid Phase Equilibria, 77 : 13 - 38. A {{simple equation}} of state (EoS) for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid that has a form similar to the Carnahan-Starling (CS) {{equation of state}} for the hard sphere fluid is presented. Excellent agreement between simulation data and calculated values for vapor pressures, saturated liquid and vapor densities and vapor PVT behavior is obtained for subcritical temperatures except in the critical region. For supercritical temperatures, the results are satisfactory but become less so with increased temperature and density. When combined with the van der Waals one fluid theory, the proposed equation provides satisfactory agreement with molecular simulation vapor-liquid equilibria results for binary LJ mixtures. Its overall behavior makes it suitable {{for use as a}} <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> in equations of state for real fluids. © 1992...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} in a generic scalar-tensor theory of gravity, the ``referenced'' quasilocal mass of a {{spatially}} bounded region in a classical solution is invariant under conformal transformations of the spacetime metric. We first extend the Brown-York quasilocal formalism to such theories to obtain the ``unreferenced'' quasilocal mass and prove it to be conformally invariant. The appropriate <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> {{in this case is}} defined by generalizing the Hawking-Horowitz prescription, which was originally proposed for general relativity. For such a choice of <b>reference</b> <b>term,</b> the referenced quasilocal mass for a general spacetime solution is obtained. This expression is shown to be a conformal invariant provided the conformal factor is a monotonic function of the scalar field. We apply this expression to the case of static spherically symmetric solutions with arbitrary asymptotics to obtain the referenced quasilocal mass of such solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the conformal invariance of our quasilocal mass formula by applying it to specific cases of four-dimensional charged black hole spacetimes, of both the asymptotically flat and non-flat kinds, in conformally related theories.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} two {{terminology}} extraction tools {{in order to}} compare a knowledge-poor and a knowledge-rich approach. Both tools process single and multi-word terms and are designed to handle multilingualism. We run an evaluation on six languages and two different domains using crawled comparable corpora and hand-crafted <b>reference</b> <b>term</b> lists. We discuss the three main results achieved for terminology extraction. The first two evaluation scenarios concern the knowledge-rich framework. Firstly, we compare performances {{for each of the}} languages depending on the ranking that is applied: specificity score vs. the number of occurrences. Secondly, we examine the relevancy of the term variant identification to increase the precision ranking for any of the languages. The third evaluation scenario compares both tools and demonstrates that a probabilistic term extraction approach, developed with minimal effort, achieves satisfactory results when compared to a rule-based method. ...|$|E
