40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the effects of different types of resins and also their mixtures on the impregnated paper properties. In this regard, pure urea resin (100 %), mixture of melamine and urea resins with various combinations (60 / 40 and 70 / 30 and 50 / 50), mixture of nano-fiber cellulose ratios of 1, 2 and 3 percent with urea resin and pure PVA (100 %) were used to impregnate of newsprint basic paper of Mazandaran wood and paper industries. Immersion of samples in the impregnation step were done in two time of 5 and 10 seconds. Next, melamine resin was used for surface coating and then absorption of <b>resin</b> in the <b>impregnation</b> and coating process measured. Results showed that in the impregnation step with pure urea (100 %), in the respect of absorption rate and surface properties of melamine paper, the best time of impregnation was obtained 10 seconds. In the combined treatment, adding up to 30 % melamine to urea <b>resin,</b> as <b>impregnation</b> step <b>resin,</b> offers better properties in terms of stain resistance, cigarette resistance, resistance to cracking and resistance to hot water steam for impregnatedmade paper.

50|$|Powder metal is also {{impregnated}} {{to enhance}} machinability. PM parts are generally difficult to machine and some compositions {{may not be}} machinable without ruining the cutting tool.

50|$|Porosity Sealing or <b>Resin</b> <b>Impregnation</b> {{is similar}} to potting, but doesn't use a shell or a mold. Parts are {{submerged}} in a polymerizable monomer or solvent-based low viscosity plastic solution. The pressure above the fluid is lowered to a full vacuum. After the vacuum is released, the fluid flows into the part. When the part is withdrawn from the resin bath, it is drained and/or cleaned and then cured. Curing can consist of polymerizing the internal resin or evaporating the solvent, which leaves an insulating dielectric material between different voltage components. Porosity sealing (<b>Resin</b> <b>Impregnation)</b> fills all interior spaces, and {{may or may not}} leave a thin coating on the surface, depending on the wash/rinse performance. The main application of vacuum impregnation porosity sealing is in boosting the dielectric strength of transformers, solenoids, lamination stacks or coils, and some high voltage components. It prevents ionization from forming between closely spaced live surfaces and initiating failure.|$|E

5000|$|Fiberglass direct rovings are {{immersed}} in a resin bath where they are coated with resin system. Each strand in the fiberglass roving is coated with sizing chemistry that provides secondary bonding between the fiberglass strand and the resin. Sizing can be singular resin system compatible (like polyester compatible or epoxy compatible) or multi-system compatible (polyester+epoxy+polyurethane compatible). Compatibility of the sizing is critical in ensuring a bond between the resin and fiber except {{in the case of}} polyurethane resin systems where the resin bonds directly to the glass as well as the sizing equally well. Conventional <b>Resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> systems are the [...] "W Dip Bath" [...] or the [...] "Doctoring Roll" [...] design, however recently there have been major advances in the impregnation bath using a squeezed roller design patented and built by TSE Industries Inc.

5000|$|A resin-saturated felt tube made of polyester, {{fibreglass}} cloth or {{a number}} of other materials suitable for <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation,</b> is inverted or pulled into a damaged pipe. It is usually done from the upstream access point (manhole or excavation). It is possible to invert the liner upstream (e.g. from the downstream access point) but this carries greater risk. It is possible to install a liner from the downstream access point, upstream to a blind end however this carries the highest risk of all the CIPP installation methods. Little to no digging is involved in this trenchless process, making for a potentially more cost-effective and less disruptive method than traditional [...] "dig and replace" [...] pipe repair methods. The liner can be inverted using water or air pressure. The pressure required for inversion can be generated using pressure vessels, scaffolds or a [...] "Chip unit". Hot water, UV light, ambient cured or steam is used to cure the resin and form a tight-fitting, jointless and corrosion-resistant replacement pipe. Service laterals are restored internally with robotically controlled cutting devices in the larger diameter pipe. Smaller diameters (100mm) can be opened remotely however they are often reinstated by excavation. The service lateral connection can be sealed with specially designed CIPP materials. The resin used is typically polyester for mainline lining and epoxy for lateral lines. Since all resins shrink (epoxy resins shrink far less than poly and vinyl ester versions) and it is impossible to bond to a sewer that has fats, oils, and grease an annular space exists between the new CIPP liner and the host pipe. The annular space exists in all installations just some are larger than others and depending on the severity may need additional rehabiliation. There are multiple ways to prevent water from tracking in the annular space and entering back into the waste stream including: water swelling material (hydrophilic), lining of the entire connection and host pipe with a continuous repair (YT repari) gaskets, and point repairs placed at the ends of the host pipe and at the lateral connections. The rehabilitated pipe is then inspected by closed-circuit television (CCTV). CIPP is considered a trenchless technology.|$|E

This study has been undertaken to obtain experimental data and provide better understanding of the creep performance and long-term behaviour of the new products. In the experiment, fifteen samples, five untreated, five treated with MUF resin and five treated with Isocyanate resin were loaded in four-point bending at 30 percent of the matched samples' failing stress, in a protected external environment in Brisbane, Australia for a period of nine months to date. The treated samples were found to produce lower relative creep deformations than the untreated sample. The samples treated with MUF resin showed better creep resistance than the samples treated with Isocyanate resin. Data from the first 90 days were used to obtain parameters for the two chosen models: the power law model and the 5 - parameter model. While both models provided good fitting for the data, the 5 -element model was found to possess better extrapolation capacity beyond the regression period. An increase in the period of regression data from 90 days to 150 days significantly lowered the errors in both of the models. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation {{was made of}} the integrated photoelastic effect in a transparent fiber glass reinforced epoxy <b>resin.</b> Vacuum <b>impregnation</b> techniques were developed to render the material transparent. The integrated effect of the isochro-matics and isoclinics in the material when subjected to both uniaxial and biaxial stresses was observed and compared to the predicted data. Isochromatic data proved to be representable by a proposed orthotropic stress-optic law. Isoclinics were predictable, but at a given point in a stressed model the isoclinic angle depends on both the fiber orienta-tion with respect to the principal stress directions and the ratio of principal stress magnitudes. Thus, the isoclinics do not directly give the principal stress directions. At this point, the anisotropic photo-elasticity solution has not been determined...|$|R

30|$|In molding {{of carbon}} fiber {{reinforced}} thermoplastics (CFRTP), <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> behavior to fiber yarns {{is very important}} because higher viscosity of molten thermoplastics inhibites <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> to the interspace among fibers. Resultant resin un-impregnation causes lower mechanical properties of CFRTP. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the relation among molding method, molding conditions and <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> to fiber yarns experimentally and analytically. In this study, CFRTPs using continuous carbon fiber yarn as a reinforcement and a thermoplastic polyimide which is excellent in heat resistance as a matrix resin were produced by Micro-Braiding, Film Stacking and Powder method. In addition <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> was modeled based on Darcy’s law and continuity condition. As a result, analytical <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> prediction showed good agreements with the experimental results in all the producing methods and molding conditions.

30|$|In the FS and Powder methods, it {{was found}} that the {{experimental}} <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> ratio remained almost constant after molding time 120  s at molding pressure 2  MPa and after 60  s at molding pressure 4  MPa. It was considered that the <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> saturated at that points. As for the MB method, molding time necessary for <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> saturation was longer than for the other molding methods. This is considered to be because the aspect ratio of the MBY is smaller than the carbon fiber yarn for the plain woven fabric used for the other method because braided resin yarns constrained the carbon fiber yarn at the center before weaving. The smaller aspect ratio resulted in the longer <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> distance.|$|E

Similarly, comparing the <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> ratio for 12  K composites under molding pressure 4 and 8  MPa at the molding time of 300  s, the improvement with molding pressure was limited. Moreover, comparing the rein impregnation ratio under molding pressure 4  MPa at molding time 300  s, the ratio for the 12  K composites was {{less than half of}} that for 3  K composites.

30|$|As {{described}} above, many researches on <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> {{behavior in}} FS, CY and Powder method could be confirmed. On the other hand, {{there are some}} researches about MB method (Sakaguchi et al. 2000; Fujihara et al. 2003; Kamaya et al. 2001; Hung 2004; Kobayashi et al. 2012 a, b; Kobayashi and Tanaka 2012; Kobayashi and Takada 2013) for unidirectional composites, whereas the <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> behavior for continuous woven materials has been limited (Kobayashi and Morimoto 2014; Kobayashi et al. 2014, 2017) because of their complexity. However, {{it is important to}} clarify the <b>resin</b> <b>impregnation</b> behavior for continuous woven material with superior in drape property compared to unidirectional material, considering actual usage of the composites (Kobayashi et al. 2017). In the analysis of impregnation behavior in continuous fiber yarns, {{it has been reported that}} by assuming that all the fiber yarns are simultaneously impregnated in the laminate and they are all identical in geometry can be described by impregnation with only a typical single yarn (Lin et al. 1995). The cross-section of such a fiber yarn is roughly elliptical after initial compression.

40|$|T he {{development}} of Medium density fiberboard (MDF) made from renewable biomass of pineapple (Ananas comosus) leaf fiber and their suitability as a construction material has been investigated. Two {{different types of}} board with a target density of 0. 8 gr/cm 3 were manufactured. The board was prepared in three layers of about 1 : 1 : 1 weight ratio in unidirectional and cross-oriented board using low molecular weight (LM) PF resin type PL- 3725 and high molecular weight (HM) PF resin type PL- 2818 for impregnation and adhesive purposes. For comparison, boards with the same structure were prepared using high molecular weight PF resin only. The mechanical properties of the boards have been examined {{as well as their}} physical properties. The results shows that generally, mechanical properties, Modulus Of Elasticity (MOE), value was improved with mix PF resin as well as Modulus Of Rupture (MOR). Pineaplle leaf fiber resulted in significantly higher MOR, consistent with our observation during the test. This information is useful when a high MOR is required in application. Other mechanical properties such as internal bonding (IB) and screw-holding capacities (SH) improved as those of MOE and MOR. Fiber from agricultural residues such as pineapple leaf are longer than wood fiber. This might explain why screw-holding capacities increased since the failure in those tests is mainly due to tear force. Diffrences in the physical properties between the board types were caused by the presence of the low molecular weight PF <b>resin</b> for the <b>impregnation</b> of the fibers. As using of mix PF resin, thickness swelling (TS) properties improved as well. No significant difference was found for both mechanical and physical properties.
