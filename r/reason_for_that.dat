5|$|Modi {{became an}} RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, {{overseeing}} RSS {{activities in the}} areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he {{went to work for the}} RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The first {{condition}} is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case {{there is no}} particular <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner’s dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{catchment}} decreased 10 {{times between}} 1989 and 2005. Apart from pollution, another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is hydraulic and engineering works. For example, {{construction of new}} ports in Ust-Luga and Vysotsk and on Vasilievsky Island adversely affected the spawning of fish. Extraction of sand and gravel in the Neva Bay for the land reclamation destroy spawning sites of European smelt.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{advanced}} tournament {{rock and}} roll dancers don't wear petticoats and jeans - as the original {{rock and roll}} dancers did - but rather multi-coloured costumes that are made of elastic artificial fibre and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special tailors. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.|$|E

25|$|The name of Maodun {{has been}} {{associated}} with Oghuz Khagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turko manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Compilation of reports, pp.56–57).|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|First of all, the King sent Danish noblemen to Norway {{in order}} to {{administer}} the country and to fill civilian and military offices. Norwegian noblemen were deliberately under-represented when new high officials were appointed. Whilst this {{was a part of}} the King’s tactics, also the lack of Norwegian noblemen with qualified educationNorway did not have a universitywas a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> the King had to send foreigners. The educational sector was considerably better developed in Sleswick and Holsatia, plus in Germany, so only nobles who sent their children to foreign universities could hope to keep or obtain high offices.|$|E

25|$|The {{stationary}} aether theory, however, {{would give}} positive results when the experiments are precise enough to measure magnitudes of second order in v/c. Albert A. Michelson conducted the first experiment {{of this kind}} in 1881, followed by the more sophisticated Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887. Two rays of light, traveling for some time in different directions were brought to interfere, so that different orientations relative to the aether wind should lead to a displacement of the interference fringes. But the result was negative again. The {{way out of this}} dilemma was the proposal by George Francis FitzGerald (1889) and Lorentz (1892) that matter is contracted in the line of motion with respect to the aether (length contraction). That is, the older hypothesis of a contraction of electrostatic fields was extended to intermolecular forces. However, since there was no theoretical <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> the contraction hypothesis was considered ad hoc.|$|E
25|$|There were fruitless {{attempts}} {{to resume the}} platinum mint in 1859, {{which resulted in a}} scientific study on the usage of platinum in coins by academician Moritz von Jacobi, published in 1860. No country had used platinum for money after 1846, and one <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> could be that platinum was about 2.5 times cheaper than gold in the 19th century. Currently, the platinum coins of the Russian Empire are rare, especially for the period from 1839–1840 when only a few coins were minted. All platinum coins minted in 1840 were bought by the famous numismatist Earl Ivan Ivanovich Tolstoy directly from the Saint Petersburg Mint; on the numismatic auction of the United Bank of Switzerland (UBS Gold and Silver Auction 50) held in autumn 2001 in Basel, one of the two 12-ruble coins minted in 1839 was sold for US$60,500 (with a starting price of $22,000).|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone but the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{is a little}} harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E

50|$|In 2014 Spider.io was {{acquired}} by Google Inc.. At that time, the company had seven employees. For Google inc. {{it is important that}} advertising fraud is eliminated from the internet. One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is that much of the income of the company comes from online advertisements. Besides the acquisition of Spider.io, it also employs many people to combat such fraud in other ways.|$|R
50|$|Any more {{sophisticated}} invariants {{still have to}} be provided manually.In particular, when verifying an imperative program using the Hoare calculus, a loop invariant has to be provided manually for each loop in the program, {{which is one of the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> task being extremely tedious.|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, decided this footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version. Mason recalls the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is that the reel of film featuring the other members was lost attempting to assemble the original cut.|$|E

500|$|In her writing, Frank {{examined}} her {{relationships with the}} members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E
500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd {{decided to do it}} a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's {{going to be a very}} interesting game".|$|E
500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, {{it sounds like a}} rock power ballad.|$|E
