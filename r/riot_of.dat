5|$|A turn-of-the-20th-century {{apartment}} construction boom {{allowed the}} expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area. The transition was rapid and marked with conflicts such as the Race <b>Riot</b> <b>of</b> 1919. Some white Protestants left to form an exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership.|$|E
5|$|Even though Maryland did not {{secede from}} the Union, Steuart's loyalty lay with the South, as did {{that of his}} father. He {{commanded}} one of the Baltimore city militias during the <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> April 1861, following which Federal troops occupied Baltimore, an incident which was arguably the first armed confrontation of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as whites resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> 1871 erupted, with whites attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, the <b>riots</b> <b>of</b> 1981 are two riots on the Christmas Day of 1981 and the New Year's Day of 1982. Since the {{majority}} of the participants were youths, the riots were also named as the Christmas youth <b>riots</b> <b>of</b> 1981 and New Year youth <b>riots</b> <b>of</b> 1982. The <b>riots</b> had a long-term impact on the government's youth policy.|$|R

50|$|Although no Maryland Army National Guard units {{served in}} Vietnam, the Maryland Army Guard played a {{significant}} role during the Cold War. Across the state, Nike missile batteries, armed with nuclear warheads, were manned by Maryland National Guardsmen to defend the National Capital area from Soviet bombers from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s. Maryland National Guard troops were also kept busy with riot-control duty in the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably during the Baltimore <b>Riots</b> <b>of</b> 1968, the Salisbury <b>riots</b> <b>of</b> May, 1968, the University <b>of</b> Maryland student <b>riots</b> <b>of</b> 1970-72, and the Cambridge <b>Riots</b> <b>of</b> 1963 and 1967.|$|R
5|$|The Sydney <b>Riot</b> <b>of</b> 1879 was a civil {{disorder}} that occurred {{at an early}} international cricket match. It took place in Sydney, Australia, at the Association Ground, Moore Park, {{now known as the}} Sydney Cricket Ground, during a match between a touring English team captained by Lord Harris and New South Wales, led by Dave Gregory, who was also the captain of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was to have}} been a <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.|$|E
5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a central tower dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However {{the interior was}} a <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago race <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> 1919 {{was a major}} racial {{conflict}} that began in Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3. During the riot, thirty-eight people died (23 black and 15 white) and over five hundred were injured. It is considered {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, so named because of the violence and fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, looting, and murder made it the worst race riot in the history of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Houston <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers {{took to the streets}} of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Civil War in April 1861 immediately affected the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. On April 19, two days after Virginia's secession, a violently pro-Southern mob in Baltimore attacked Union soldiers en route to Washington, D.C. as the troops marched through the city's streets between railroad stations. Thereafter known as the Baltimore <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> 1861, the resulting loss of life and local unrest also threatened the , a U.S. Navy ship in Baltimore at the time. Later that same day, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company declined to transport Union forces from Baltimore to the beleaguered Union naval yard facility at Portsmouth, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|United States President Woodrow Wilson {{pronounced}} white participants the instigators of {{the prolonged}} riots in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. As a result, {{he attempted to}} promote greater racial harmony through the promotion of voluntary organizations and through the enactment of legislative improvements by the United States Congress. He did not change the segregation of federal departments which he had imposed early during his first administration, however.

5|$|The Bishop's Palace {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} former Anglo-Saxon parish church of Holy Trinity. The primary wing was {{completed}} during Bishop de Losinga's episcopate (1091–1119). Bishops Suffield (1244–1257) and Salmon (1298–1325) developed the palace and its grounds substantially. Under Bishop Salmon the palace underwent ambitious expansion, possibly prompted by damage from the <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> 1272 and his personal success of being elected as Lord Chancellor to Edward III in 1319. The main feature of the original palace was a three-storey fortified tower which was directly connected to the cathedral, drawing upon the precedent of Carolingian imperial palaces. In c. 1858 the building underwent major restoration under the supervision of Ewan Christian. The building came to be used by the school in 1958. Today the building contains classrooms where mathematics and geography are taught, the junior common room (for sixth form pupils) and libraries in the former parlour and undercroft.|$|E

5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a <b>riot</b> <b>of</b> gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E

5|$|In The King of Fighters '99 Iori is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of the game. Iori can be faced as a bonus fight {{in the end of}} the game if the player manages to get a high score. In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament where he finds those responsible, an organization named NEST. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the Nests' agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character, named Striker, also appears for Iori in The King of Fighters 2000 but with an outfit based on his illustrations from artbooks. In The King of Fighters 2001, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, presuming that he would get his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in KOF 2002, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port from the game as well as the remake of KOF '98. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appears to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get the power from the descendants of the clans who sealed Orochi and steals the ones from Chizuru. In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team once again with Kyo's student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the <b>Riot</b> <b>of</b> Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades. Ash appears afterward and defeats Iori, stealing his powers. Iori is a playable character in The King of Fighters XII. Iori is featured with a different outfit, and with a new moveset, that does not use purple flames. Like each character, he does not have a team. Iori's appearance in The King of Fighters XIII sees him teamed with his former team members from the 1996 tournament, Mature and Vice, who return as spirits. He recovers his flames in his ending and appears as downloadable content in this form. He is set to return in the upcoming The King of Fighters XIV, and he is also the one who tracked Orochi's weakened body in the middle of Hungary when Verse's destructions scatters every revived souls including Orochi and Ash who were sealed inside the monster's across the globe after the tournament is over, thus sealing the weakened snake with the help from Kyo and Chizuru immediately.|$|E
