25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> to mark up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens with liquid-ink {{are more}} likely to [...] "bleed" [...] through the paper. Liquid ink is more readily absorbed into the paper due to its lower {{viscosity}}. This viscosity also causes problems when leaving the tip on the paper (to pause for a thought for example). The bleed-through effect is greatly increased as the ink is continually absorbed into the paper, creating a blotch. This does not affect gel-ink <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens as much. This is one way through which the thickness of gel-ink gives it an advantage, in that it isn't as prone to being absorbed. Though the bleed-through effect of a gel-ink <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> is greater than that of a ballpoint, it is usually not too significant.|$|E

50|$|Once the ink is created, a <b>roller</b> <b>ball</b> pen is {{dismantled}} {{and cleaned}} {{so that the}} ink can be placed inside using a flat tip spatula.

50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>ball</b> pens or rollerball pens are pens {{which use}} ball point writing {{mechanisms}} with water-based liquid or gelled ink, {{as opposed to}} the oil-based viscous inks found in ballpoint pens.

The writing point is a tiny ball, usually 0.5 or 0.7 mm in diameter, that transfers the ink from the reservoir onto the paper as the pen moves.|$|E

50|$|While {{paying a}} sales call to Goldblatt's {{department}} store in Chicago, Reynolds was shown {{one of the}} rare Biro pens and apparently recognized it as a potentially hot consumer item for the postwar era. Working with engineer William Huernergardt and machinist Titus Haffa, Reynolds came up with a design that did not rely on patented capillary action but caused ink to flow by gravity. However, successful gravity feed required much thinner, viscous ink and a much larger barrel to avoid constant refilling. The thin ink made the pens prone to leakage, but, realizing time was of the essence, Reynolds rushed them to market anyway, touting the high ink capacity. With <b>roller</b> <b>balls</b> repurposed from the metal beads used in war-surplus bomb sights and barrels machined from aircraft aluminum, the Reynolds pens had another feature that captured the popular imagination: In early ads, Reynolds claimed, “It writes under water!” The claim was essentially truthful because his pen wrote successfully on wet paper. Consumers had little use for this bizarre practical application, but a generation of shoppers remembered the slogan long after Reynolds passed into history.|$|R
