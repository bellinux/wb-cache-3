25|$|Drawing {{these distinctions}} is necessary, but often {{challenging}} {{for the courts}} and lawyers, especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the public domain, depending on the jurisdiction.

This often involves payment of a periodic <b>renewal</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E
25|$|Still at Cambridge, Whittle could ill {{afford the}} £5 <b>renewal</b> <b>fee</b> for his jet engine patent {{when it became}} due in January 1935, and because the Air Ministry refused to pay it the patent was allowed to lapse. Shortly afterwards, in May, he {{received}} mail from Rolf Dudley-Williams, {{who had been with}} him at Cranwell in the 1920s and Felixstowe in 1930. Williams arranged a meeting with Whittle, himself, and another by-then-retired RAF serviceman, James Collingwood Tinling. The two proposed a partnership that allowed them to act on Whittle's behalf to gather public financing so that development could go ahead.|$|E

By comparison, in 2004, a taxi driver had an average yearly gross revenue of $90,747 and a net income of $49,532.Because of the historically high prices, medallions (and most cabs) are owned by investment companies and are leased to drivers ("hacks"). An auction was held in 2006 where 308 new medallions were sold. In the 2006 auction, 254 were designated as either hybrids taxis and 54 were designated as ADA-accessible taxis.

40|$|A {{socially}} optimal {{structure of}} application and <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> for patents would encourage the maximal {{number of applications}} while reducing effective patent length. We find, however, that when patent offices are required to be self-funding, resource constraints can distort this fee structure. Specifically, a financially constrained, but welfare-oriented, patent office will tend to raise initial application <b>fees</b> while lowering <b>renewal</b> <b>fees.</b> This creates two detriments to social welfare as it discourages the filing of some patents while extending the effective life of others. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} how patent <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> may be restructured to discourage low-value patents {{with the goal}} of reducing the burden on patent offices without unduly impairing innovation incentives. We depart from Pakes' (1986) real-option model by moving to an approach involving binomial trees, widely used in valuing financial options. The new approach has the advantage of allowing the dynamics of the patent rent to follow a wide range of stochastic processes. The model is estimated using French data from 1970 to 2002. Policy simulations cast some doubt on the relevance of the current schedule of <b>renewal</b> <b>fees.</b> An alternative fee schedule is suggested...|$|R

40|$|This article aims at {{estimating}} the optimal profile of <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> patent offices should implement. It {{is at the}} crossroad of two strands of literature. The first strand is the theoretical literature analysing <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> as an optimal revelation mechanism. The second strand is the econometric literature developing real option models of patent renewal decisions to assess the value of patents. Using data from the French patent office, we find {{that there is little}} room to lower the social cost of patents without affecting the monetary incentives to apply for a patent and innovate. We show that a menu of optimally defined profiles helps to further discriminate among patents. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} {{literature on the}} role of fees in patent systems. Two main research questions are usually addressed: the impact of patent fees on the behavior of applicants and the question of optimal fees. Studies in the former group confirm that a range of fees affect the behavior of applicants and suggest that a patent is an inelastic good. Studies in the latter group provide grounds for both low and high application (or pre-grant) <b>fees</b> and <b>renewal</b> (or post-grant) <b>fees,</b> depending on the structural context and on the policy objectives. The paper also presents new stylized facts on patent fees of thirty patent offices worldwide. It is shown that application fees are generally lower than <b>renewal</b> <b>fees,</b> and <b>renewal</b> <b>fees</b> increase more than proportionally with patent age (to the notable exception of Switzerland and the U. S.) ...|$|R
