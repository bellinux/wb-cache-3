40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an {{economically}} important crop {{that is highly}} susceptible to cotton root rot. Remote sensing technology provides a useful and effective means for detecting and mapping cotton root rot infestations in cotton fields. This research assessed the potential of 10 -m Sentinel- 2 A satellite imagery for cotton root rot detection and compared it with airborne multispectral imagery using unsupervised classification at both field and regional levels. Accuracy assessment showed that the classification maps from the Sentinel- 2 A imagery had an overall accuracy of 94. 1 % for field subset images and 91. 2 % for the whole image, compared with the airborne image classification results. However, some small cotton root <b>rot</b> <b>areas</b> were undetectable and some non-infested areas within large root <b>rot</b> <b>areas</b> were incorrectly classified as infested due to the images’ coarse spatial resolution. Classification maps based on field subset Sentinel- 2 A images missed 16. 6 % of the infested areas and the classification map based on the whole Sentinel- 2 A image for the study area omitted 19. 7 % of the infested areas. These results demonstrate that freely-available Sentinel- 2 imagery {{can be used as}} an alternative data source for identifying cotton root rot and creating prescription maps for site-specific management of the disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} leaf rot disease {{detection}} for betel vine (Piper betel L.) based {{on image processing}} algorithm. The measurement of plant features is a fundamental element of plant science research and related applications. The information related to plant features is especially useful for its applications in plant growth modeling, agricultural research and on farm production. Few methods have been applied in leaf rot disease detection for betel vine leaf (Piper Betel L.). Traditional direct measurement methods are generally simple and reliable, but they are time consuming, laborious and cumbersome. In contrast, the proposed vision-based methods are efficient in detecting and observing the exterior disease features. In the present investigation, image processing algorithms are developed to detect leaf rot disease by identifying the color featureof the <b>rotted</b> leaf <b>area.</b> Subsequently, the <b>rotted</b> <b>area</b> was segmented and <b>area</b> of <b>rotted</b> leaf portion was deduced from the observed plant feature data. The results showed a promising performance of this automatic vision-based system in practice with easy validation. This paper describes the steps to achieve an efficient and inexpensive system acceptable to the farmers and agricultural researchers as well for studying leaf rot disease in betel vine leaf...|$|R
40|$|In July 2013, {{symptoms}} of stem rot {{were observed in}} the Dracaena sanderiana cuttings in greenhouses of Mahallat County, Markazi Province, Iran.

The cortical tissues of the plants showed a distinct brown discoloration. Eventually, the infected plants died. The pathogen was isolated from Dracaena stems and identified as F. solani by a fragment of the translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF- 1 α) gene. Fusarium solani was confirmed by a pathogenicity test, and the causal agent was re-isolated from infected D. sanderiana plants.

The attachment mechanisms used by E. coli O 157 :H 7 on produce, and the interaction of bacterial cells with salad greens are not well understood. This research investigated the attachment patterns of two bioluminescent strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7 associated with the expression of thin aggregative (curli) fimbriae. To accomplish this work, lettuce leaves were immersed in 107 – 10 8 CFU/mL liquid culture for 60 minutes. Bacteria attachment patterns of curli and non-curli E. coli O 157 :H 7 to cut lettuce pieces and whole Romaine leaves were examined. Based {{on the results of}} these experiments, E. coli O 157 :H 7 can attach to whole Romaine lettuce leaves and pieces, showing preferential attachment to veins and cut edges. Non-curli O 157 :H 7 demonstrated attachment to wounds and soft <b>rot</b> <b>areas</b> of whole leaves, whereas curli producing O 157 :H 7 bound only to fresh wounds and the central vein, if damaged.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a serious disease of citrus (the orange cv. Washington navel, lemon {{and the common}} {{mandarin}} grafted on sour orange rootstocks) has been observed in southern Greek orchards. Affected trees decline, their leaves become yellow and fall early, and shoots and twigs die as the damage expands towards the trunk. Crosssections of the trunks and large branches reveal a light-colored rot in the center, which is surrounded by brown hard necrotic wood. Symptoms start from pruned areas and spread to the rootstock wood, and then resemble esca of grapevine. From the white <b>rotted</b> <b>areas,</b> a fungus was isolated on PDA that formed cream-yellow to light-brown colonies with dense aerial mycelium. Fungal fruit-bodies formed abundantly on the trunks of diseased trees. The fungus was identified as Fomitiporia mediterranea by both traditional and molecular methods. Pathogenicity tests were performed by artificially inoculating orange, mandarin, lemon and sour orange trees with the fungus. Control holes were filled with two PDA plugs. Branches inoculated with the isolates from infected citrus showed wood discoloration that extended up to 20 cm above and 20 cm below the infection hole. The fungus was re-isolated from the discolored parts of the wood. Inoculations with isolates from grapevine and kiwi produced wood discoloration only 3 – 4 mm around the holes...|$|R

25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble <b>rot.</b> In <b>areas</b> that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|R

A section of Miocene volcanic rocks totaling 5000 feet in thickness are exposed in a fault escarpment {{on the eastern side}} of Steens Nountain. These include: the Pike Creek Formation, consisting of rhyolite and dacite flows and tuffs about 1000 feet in thickness, including one rhyolite ignimbrite locally 900 feet thick; the Andesite Series (also known as Steens Mountain Volcanics), a sequence of andesite and basaltic andesite flows totaling about 1500 feet in thickness; Steens Basalt, a series of 15 million year old high-alumina olivine basalt flows totaling about 3000 feet in thickness, which crop out extensively in southeastern Oregon. Steens Basalt also crops out in the Mickey Hot Springs area, 16 miles east of Steens Mountain, where it is overlain by a thin, continuous ignimbrite and a younger basalt, here informally named Mickey basalt.

40|$|Surveys of the {{intensity}} of soft rot in plantations of lettuce and Chinese cabbage were performed from January to May 2004 in mesoregions of the Mata and Agreste {{of the state of}} Pernambuco, Brazil. Disease prevalence of 42. 9 % was observed in lettuce and 100 % in Chinese cabbage. The incidence of soft rot ranged from 0 to 22 % in lettuce and 1 to 67 % in Chinese cabbage. In lettuce higher intensity of soft rot was observed in areas with more than 17 years of cultivation; planted with cultivars "Cacheada", "Elba" and "Tainá"; with clay soil type; irrigated by hosing; and having poor drainage. Lower disease intensity was detected in areas of cultivars "Verdinha" and "Salad Bowl"; when coriander was the previous crop; and when seedlings wereproduced in trays.

40|$|Brown rot on {{peaches and}} {{nectarines}} caused by Monilinia spp. results in significant economic losses in Europe. Experiments were conducted to {{study the effects of}} temperature (0 – 33 °C) on the temporal dynamics of decay and mycelium development and the subsequent sporulation on peaches and nectarine fruit infected by M. laxa and M. fructicola. The rates of decay and mycelium development increased with temperature from 0 °C to 25 °C for both Monilinia species. At 0 °C, decay was faster for M. laxa (0. 20 cm 2 days− 1) than for M. fructicola (0. 07 cm 2 days− 1); indeed, M. laxa was able to develop mycelia and sporodochia, but M. fructicola was not. At 4 and 20 °C, there were no differences in decay and mycelia development between the two Monilinia species. When temperature increased from 25 to 33 °C, the rates of fungal decay and mycelium development decreased. At 30 and 33 °C, M. fructicola decayed faster (0. 94 and 1. 2 cm 2 days− 1, respectively) than M. laxa (0. 78 and 0. 74 cm 2 days− 1, respectively) and could develop mycelia and produce sporodochia, whereas M. laxa failed at 33 °C. These results indicated that M. fructicola is better adapted to high temperatures, whereas M. laxa is better adapted to low temperatures. These results can be used to predict the relative importance of the two species during the season at a given site and to improve management strategies for brown <b>rot</b> in <b>areas</b> where both species are present.

40|$|Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was {{isolated}} from the rhizosphere of eggplant in the Nile Delta of Egypt, and its antagonistic potential against Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2, the causal agent of potato brown rot, was in vitro evaluated on KB agar medium and in vivo on potato plants. In vitro, four isolates of S. maltophilia (PD 3531, PD 3532, PD 3533, and PD 3534) appeared antagonistic. The isolate (PD 3533) was screened as the most promising antagonist for the in vivo tests. In the greenhouse, the antagonist was applied directly to soil or by bacterization of potato eyepieces. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia significantly suppressed potato brown rot in Egyptian clay soil but not in Dutch clay soil. Survival of a rifampicin and chloramphenicol-resistant S. maltophilia strain PD 4560 was investigated in two pairs of clay soils, conventionally and organically managed, from Egypt and the Netherlands. The survival of S. maltophilia was significantly less in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, while the converse occurred for R. solanacearum. These results are in agreement with those obtained in the in vivo biocontrol tests. In conclusion, S. maltophilia may be useful for control of brown <b>rot</b> in the <b>area</b> where it was originally isolated, the Nile Delta in Egypt...|$|R
50|$|Darapsa myron (Virginia creeper sphinx) is a moth of {{the family}} Sphingidae. It lives from Maine south to south Florida; west to North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas. It also {{can be found in}} Mexico. There are 2 or 3 broods in much of the range, and larvae can mature in as few as 3 weeks. Larvae hide on the midribs of their host leaves and are nocturnal feeders. During July and August, this species is {{abundant}} in many areas, particularly Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Adults emerge in the mid-afternoon and females begin calling after dusk. In spring, adults are more likely to feed, nectaring from flowers and drinking fluids from <b>rotting</b> fruit. In <b>areas</b> where they are common, D. myron readily come to both lights and sugar baits, being most active between sunset and midnight. Females have much rounder abdomens while the end of the male's abdomen is spade-shaped. Pairing is fairly quick and captive adults {{do not need to be}} fed, although females lay more eggs when fed. Sometimes adults refuse food altogether.Mated females deposit up to 150 small eggs that start out green but turn yellow within 48 hours, indicating fertility. Incubation lasts about 6 days. Fully grown larvae turn a purplish brown before spinning a sparse, wiry cocoon among host leaves. Pupae either eclose within about 24 days or diapause, eclosing in late May.|$|R
40|$|Avocado (Persea {{americana}} (Mill.)), {{an important}} commercial fruit, is severely affected by Phytophthora Root <b>Rot</b> in <b>areas</b> where the pathogen is prevalent. However, advances in molecular research are hindered {{by the lack}} of a high-throughput transient transformation system in this non-model plant. In this study, a proof-of-concept is demonstrated by the successful application of Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated plant transformation to produce composite avocado plants. Two ex vitro strategies were assessed on two avocado genotypes (Itzamna and A 0. 74) : In the first approach, 8 -week-old etiolated seedlings were scarred with a sterile hacksaw blade {{at the base of the}} shoot, and in the second, inch-long incisions were made at the base of the shoot (20 -week-old non-etiolated plants) with a sterile blade to remove the cortical tissue. The scarred/wounded shoot surfaces were treated with A. rhizogenes strains (K 599 or ARqua 1) transformed with or without binary plant transformation vectors pRedRootII (DsRed 1 marker), pBYR 2 e 1 -GFP (GFP- green fluorescence protein marker) or pBINUbiGUSint (GUS- beta-glucuronidase marker) with and without rooting hormone (Dip 'N' Grow) application. The treated shoot regions were air-layered with sterile moist cocopeat to induce root formation. Results showed that hormone application significantly increased root induction, while Agrobacterium-only treatments resulted in very few roots. Combination treatments of hormone+Agrobacterium (-/+ plasmids) showed no significant difference. Only the ARqua 1 (+plasmid) :A 0. 74 combination resulted in root transformants, with hormone+ARqua 1 (+pBINUbiGUSint) being the most effective treatment with ~ 17 and 25 % composite plants resulting from strategy- 1 and strategy- 2, respectively. GUS- and GFP-expressing roots accounted for less than 4 and ~ 11 %, respectively, of the total roots/treatment/avocado genotype. The average number of transgenic roots on the composite plants was less than one per plant in all treatments. PCR and Southern analysis further confirmed the transgenic nature of the roots expressing the screenable marker genes. Transgenic roots showed hyper-branching compared to the wild-type roots but this had no impact on Phytophthora cinnamomi infection. There was no difference in pathogen load 7 -days-post inoculation between transformed and control roots. Strategy- 2 involving A 0. 74 :ARqua 1 combination was the best ex vitro approach in producing composite avocado plants. The approach followed in this proof-of-concept study needs further optimisation involving multiple avocado genotypes and A. rhizogenes strains to achieve enhanced root transformation efficiencies, which would then serve as an effective high-throughput tool in the functional screening of host and pathogen genes to improve our understanding of the avocado-P. cinnamomi interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of Biological Soil Disinfestation (BSD) to control potato brown rot, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2, was investigated. BSD involves the induction of anaerobic soil conditions by increasing microbial respiration through incorporation of fresh organic amendments (here: grass or potato haulms) and by reducing re-supply of oxygen by covering with airtight plastic sheets. Control treatments were left without cover and amendment, or amended without covering or covered only without amendment. The effect of BSD on survival of R. solanacearum was tested at three different scales: in 1 -l glass mesocosms under laboratory conditions, in 1. 2 -m-diam microplots positioned in an outdoor quarantine field, {{and in a}} naturally infested commercial field. Within a few days, anaerobic conditions developed in the BSD-treated soils. In the mesocosm and microplot experiment, anaerobic conditions persisted {{till the end of}} the 4 -week experimental period. In the field experiment, the period of anaerobiosis was shorter due to birds damaging the plastic cover. In all three experiments, BSD reduced soil populations of R. solanacearum significantly by 92. 5 % to > 99. 9 % compared to the non-amended and uncovered control treatments. In the field experiment, BSD also resulted in a significant reduction of R. solanacearum survival in potato tubers buried at 15 or 35 cm and in the rapid decomposition of superficially buried potatoes remaining after harvesting, thus destroying an important inoculum reservoir of R. solanacearum. The treatments with grass amendment only or covering with only plastic did not result in anaerobic conditions and did not decrease R. solanacearum populations during the experimental period. PCR-DGGE analyses of 16 S-rDNA from soil samples of the various treatments in the mesocosm and microplot experiments revealed that BSD hardly affected bacterial diversity but did result in clear shifts in the composition of the bacterial community. The possible implications of these shifts are discussed. It is concluded that BSD has the potential to strongly decrease soil infestation levels of R. solanacearum and to become an important element in a sustainable and effective management strategy for potato brown <b>rot,</b> especially in <b>areas</b> where the disease is endemic...|$|R
40|$|Potato brown rot, {{caused by}} Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 (Phylovar II, sequevar 1), {{is a serious}} endemic disease in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It is a {{quarantine}} disease in the EU, and export of potatoes from Egypt is restricted to pest-free areas in the desert. This thesis is directed at survival and eradication of the pathogen in areas that may become contaminated and at brown rot control in infested areas. R. solanacearum survival and disease suppression were studied for soils differing in origin (Dutch versus Egyptian soils), type (san d versus clay), and management (organic versus conventional). Effects of amendment of conventional soils with NPK and organic soils with compost or cow manure were compared with non-amended controls. The pathogen survived longer in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, and in clay than in san dy soils from both countries. Survival was never longer than 180 days {{and in many cases}} much shorter, especially in Egyptian san dy soil. Organic management reduced pathogen survival in Egyptian soils, especially in the san dy soil, but not in Dutch soils. Pathogen survival was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, negatively with organic matter (OM) content at similar DOC content, and negatively with bacterial diversity estimated from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of eubacterial 16 S rDNA extracted from soil. NPK ferti li zation and cow manure amendment reduced pathogen survival in most soils while compost was not effective. There was a clear shift in microbial community after manure amendment, a weak shift by compost amendment, and no shift after NPK ferti li zation. Disease development was highest in Dutch san dy soils and similar in all other soil types. It was positively correlated with DOC (substrate availabi li ty), and negatively with K and Ca contents in soil, which may increase plant resistance. The disease was s li ghtly suppressed in organic compared to conventional san dy soils from Egypt while organic management increased disease incidence in all Dutch soils. This was related to a high DOC content in organic Dutch soils. There were no differences in bacterial diversity and composition in different rhizosphere soils, and no correlations between disease development and bacterial diversity. Manure ferti li zation suppressed brown rot in most soils with a clear shift in rhizospere bacterial community. Stenotrophomonas maltophi li a, isolated from the rhizosphere of eggplant in the Egyptian Delta, was antagonistic to R. solanacearum in vitro; its antagonistic activity was not Fe-siderophore dependent. A selected S. maltophi li a strain survived longer and reduced R. solanacearum survival more in Egyptian than in Dutch clay soils, and suppressed potato brown rot in Egyptian soil (by at least 36 %) but not in Dutch soil. Survival and suppressive activity of S. maltophi li a were positively correlated with OM, which was highest in Egyptian organic clay soil. The effect of biological soil disinfestation (BSD) was tested in glass vessels, microplots, and in an accidentally infested commercial field. BSD is based on production of toxic organic acids through anaerobic digestion of fresh organic matter. BSD was accomp li shed by incorporating grass or potato haulms in soil and covering the soil with airtight plastic. Survival of R. solanacearum in soil and potato tubers was significantly reduced in the BSD treatment (> 93 %), and not in separate g rass amendment -or plastic cover treatments. This thesis may contribute to regulatory decisions in the EU concerning the time required for keeping accidentally infested fields out of potato production and to recommendations for management of potato brown <b>rot</b> in <b>areas</b> where the disease is endemic...|$|R
