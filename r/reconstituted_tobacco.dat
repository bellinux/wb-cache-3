50|$|In recent years, the manufacturers' {{pursuit of}} maximum profits {{has led to}} the {{practice}} of using not just the leaves, but also recycled tobacco offal and the plant stem. The stem is first crushed and cut to resemble the leaf before being merged or blended into the cut leaf.According to data from the World Health Organization, the amount of tobacco per 1000 cigarettes fell from 2.28 pounds in 1960 to 0.91 pounds in 1999, {{largely as a result of}} <b>reconstituting</b> <b>tobacco,</b> fluffing, and additives.|$|R
50|$|Sweet Caporal {{launched}} as a brand in 1878, persevered {{through a}} merger and survived the subsequent dissolution of a cigarette trust after United States v. American Tobacco Co. It {{turned into a}} money making brand for the <b>reconstituted</b> American <b>Tobacco</b> Company {{on a par with}} Pall Mall and Mecca. In the beginning of the 20th century, it became especially popular in Canada. American Tobacco Company entered the Canadian market in 1895 by acquiring the Montreal-based American Cigarette Company and D. Ritchie & Co. forming the American Tobacco Company of Canada, Ltd. In 1908, when American Tobacco Company of Canada was bought out by the Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada, Sweet Caporal cigarettes commanded a 50-percent share of the Canadian market; the brand continued in Canada until 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1933 and {{the late}} 1940s, the yields from an average {{cigarette}} varied from 33 to 49 mg [...] "tar" [...] and from < 1 to 3 mg nicotine. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the average yield from cigarettes in Western Europe and the USA was around 16 mg tar and 1.5 mg nicotine per cigarette. Current average levels are lower. This has been achieved {{in a variety of}} ways including use of selected strains of tobacco plant, changes in agricultural and curing procedures, use of <b>reconstituted</b> sheets (reprocessed <b>tobacco</b> leaf wastes), incorporation of tobacco stalks, reduction of the amount of tobacco needed to fill a cigarette by expanding it (like puffed wheat) to increase its [...] "filling power", and by the use of filters and high-porosity wrapping papers.

5000|$|The tobacco {{industry}} has reduced tar and nicotine yields in cigarette smoke since the 1960s.

However, just as a drinker tends to drink a larger volume of beer than of wine or spirits, so many smokers tend to modify their smoking pattern inversely according to the strength of the cigarette being smoked. In contrast to the standardized puffing of the smoking machines on which the tar and nicotine yields are based, when a smoker switches to a low-tar, low nicotine cigarette, they smoke more cigarettes, take more puffs and inhale more deeply. Conversely, when smoking a high-tar, high-nicotine cigarette there is a tendency to smoke and inhale less.|$|R
40|$|The En/Spm encoded {{suppressor}} function {{has been}} <b>reconstituted</b> in transgenic <b>tobacco</b> protoplasts. The suppressor affects genes which contain an En/Spm responsive transposable {{element in the}} transcribed sequences. The En/Spm encoded protein tnpA binds a defined cis element in the inserted transposon, repressing expression of the adjacent gene. This was shown by monitoring transient expression of a bacterial marker gene (GUS) expressed from a strong plant viral promoter. Suppressible variants of the marker gene were produced by inserting I element sequences into the untranslated sequences of the GUS transcript. Comparison of transient expression of these variants in wildtype tobacco protoplasts with their expression in protoplasts transgenic for tnpA protein demonstrates that tnpA is the suppressor. In addition, the minimal cis element required for suppression {{has been defined as}} a dimer consisting of two 12 bp tnpA binding sequences in a particular inverted orientation. One of these dimers occurs in each En/Spm end close to the characteristic 13 bp terminal inverted repeat. TnpA binding sites in different arrangements do not respond as well to tnpA. The implications of this observation are discussed. This system can be used to analyse tnpA-DNA interactions involved in gene regulation further...|$|R
50|$|A cigarette, or cigaret, {{is a small}} {{cylinder}} of finely cut tobacco leaves {{rolled in}} thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end causing the cigarette to smoulder and allowing smoke to be inhaled from the other end, which is held in or to the mouth; in some cases, a cigarette holder may be used, as well. Most modern manufactured cigarettes are filtered, and also include <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> and other additives.|$|E
50|$|A little cigar is a cigar that is {{the same}} size as a cigarette—often {{featuring}} a filter—however, it still retains its identity as a cigar because it is wrapped in a tobacco leaf, or more often a paper wrapper made of tobacco pulp, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> or homogenized tobacco. Flavored little cigars are available on the market as well. Flavored little cigars have been steadily increasing in popularity among cigar smokers. Manufacturers like Prime Time have been offering flavored little cigars since 1993.|$|E

40|$|Transfer of {{nicotine}} to mainstream smoke was measured for Reference cigarettes {{made with the}} addition of 20 - 40 mg of seven different nicotine salts, d- and l-nicotine and N’-formylnornicotine. Regression analysis of the nicotine yields from these cigarettes {{as a function of the}} nicotine content of the tobacco rods indicated an average nicotine transfer efficiency (17. 5 %), similar to that found for a separate series of cigarettes made with single-grade tobacco materials (16. 2 %). Analysis of the enantiomeric purity of the smoke nicotine from the cigarettes made with added nicotine salts and neat nicotine showed no evidence of conversion between l- and d-nicotine during the smoking process. The cigarette made with added N’-formylnornicotine showed no evidence of additional nicotine transfer attributable to reduction of this compound to nicotine. A third series of cigarettes were made with varying levels of d- and l-nicotine added to a tobacco blend and to <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> to further investigate transfer efficiency of the enantiomers. Regression analysis indicated no statistically significant difference between transfer efficiencies of d- and l-nicotine. These results suggest that nicotine salts and d- and l-nicotine transfer to smoke at the same efficiency. However, transfer efficiency of either compound was lower when applied to <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> (9. 7 %) than when applied to the Reference tobacco blend (15. 3 %). The thermal stabilities {{of nicotine}} salts have little bearing on efficiency of transfer to smoke or on racemization between d- and l-nicotine.

40|$|Reliable {{methods are}} needed to detect the {{presence}} of tobacco components in tobacco products to effectively control smuggling and classify tariff and excise in tobacco industry to control illegal tobacco trade. In this study, two sensitive and specific DNA based methods, one quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay and the other loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, were developed for the reliable and efficient detection {{of the presence of}} tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in various tobacco samples and commodities. Both assays targeted the same sequence of the uridine 5 ′-monophosphate synthase (UMPS), and their specificities and sensitivities were determined with various plant materials. Both qPCR and LAMP methods were reliable and accurate in the rapid detection of tobacco components in various practical samples, including customs samples, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> samples, and locally purchased cigarettes, showing high potential for their application in tobacco identification, particularly in the special cases where the morphology or chemical compositions of tobacco have been disrupted. Therefore, combining both methods would facilitate not only the detection of tobacco smuggling control, but also the detection of tariff classification and of excise. </p...|$|E
40|$|By {{the late}} 1970 s, eight {{technologies}} {{in the design}} of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette were classified as significant. The eight included: The tobacco blend, the filter tip, filter-tip additives, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> sheet, paper additives, air dilution via paper porosity, expanded tobacco, and air dilution via filter-tip perforation. In addition to these eight cigarette-design technologies was another proposed technology which involved the incorporation of a substitute for {{some or all of the}} tobacco in the cigarette filler. Despite considerable research and development (R&D) effort on various tobacco substitutes that indicated the replacements in most instances fulfilled the definition of a ‘less hazardous’ cigarette with regard to the chemical and biological properties of their mainstream smoke, tobacco substitute-containing cigarettes failed to attain consumer acceptability. As a result, several marketed products containing tobacco substitutes had an extremely brief tenure in the marketplace. Outlined herein is a summary of some detailed research conducted on the composition of the mainstream smokes from cigarettes containing either all-substitute filler or fillers comprising various substitute and tobacco mixtures as well as an all-tobacco cigarette...|$|E
40|$|A cigar is {{a product}} made of tobacco leaves or parts of leaves rolled {{together}} {{and covered with a}} binder (a firm tobacco leaf which holds the filler together and gives the cigar its shape) and an outer wrapper made of natural or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco.</b> The term includes cheroots and cigarillos (small or miniature cigars). Some small cigars are similar in size to a cigarette and may include a filter.

40|$|Utilizing tobacco wastes {{is one of}} the {{important}} problems for tobacco industry. They can be divided into easy recycled which can be returned into technological process without special treatment, and irretrievable which can be recycled only after special treatment. Easy recycled wastes consist of leaf parts and large tobacco scraps, which are cleaned from the dust and then returned into manufacturing process. Irretrievable wastes consist of small tobacco scraps which use for <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> production and midrib parts which used for expanded stem manufacturing and added into cigarette for nicotine decreasing. Little tobacco scraps is not used for recycling and thus utilized. In the laboratory of technologies for tobacco products manufacturing possibility for utilizing little tobacco scraps for manufacturing new tobacco products: hookah blends and non-smoking products has been studied. Fractional composition of little tobacco scraps from cigarette industry has been defined. Samples of hookah blends and non-smoking products have been manufactured. New tobacco products manufactured from burley leaves were used as comparison. Tasting of these products has been done, utilizing methods developed in the laboratory. As the result, it has been found that samples made of wastes have better tasting score because of rich taste and tobacco aroma.

40|$|Diammonium {{hydrogen}} phosphate (DAP) {{is commonly}} used as a flavor ingredient of commercial cigarettes. In addition, among its other uses, it is employed to expand the tobacco volume, to manufacture <b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> sheet, and to denicotinize tobacco. However, the use of DAP as a cigarette ingredient is a controversial issue. Some authors have stated that ammonium compounds added to tobacco increase smoke ammonia and “smoke pH”, resulting in more free nicotine available in the smoke. On the other hand, other researchers have reported that the larger ammonium content of a cigarette blend due {{to the presence of}} DAP was not reflected in increased smoke ammonia. In this work, the thermal behavior of DAP, tobacco and DAP-tobacco mixtures has been studied by TGA/FTIR. The chemical processes involved in the different pyrolysis steps of DAP have been suggested. Marked changes in the pyrolytic behavior of both, tobacco and DAP have been detected when analyzing the behavior of the mixtures. A displacement of the decomposition steps mainly related to the glycerol and lignin from tobacco toward lower temperatures has been observed, whereas that associated with cellulose is displaced toward higher temperature. Additionally, no peak corresponding to the phosphorous oxides decomposition has been detected in the curves relating to the DAP-tobacco mixtures. All these features are indicative of the strong interactions between DAP and tobacco. The FTIR spectra show no significant qualitative differences between the qualitative overall composition of the gases evolved from the pyrolysis of tobacco in the absence and in the presence of DAP. Nevertheless, depending on the temperature considered, the addition of DAP contributes to a decrease in the generation of hydrocarbons and an increase in the formation of CO, CO 2 and oxygenated compounds in terms of amount generated per mass of pyrolysed tobacco.

40|$|During {{the period}} of tobacco smoke {{research}} from the early 1950 s to the mid- 1960 s it was repeatedly asserted that a) tobacco and many tobacco components {{were involved in the}} pyrogenesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), several of which were reported to initiate tumors on the skin of laboratory animals and b) tobacco additives (flavorants, casing materials, humectants) were highly likely to be similarly involved in PAH pyrogenesis. Extensive knowledge on PAHs was deemed highly necessary because of their claimed importance in the smoking-health issue. The numerous assertions about the generation of PAHs in cigarette mainstream smoke (MSS) triggered extensive and intensive research both within and outside the Tobacco Industry to define the nature of the PAHs, their per cigarette MSS delivery amounts, their precursors, etc. It was not until 1960 that VAN DUUREN et al. (1) reported three specific aza-arenes in cigarette MSS that were asserted to be involved in smokers’ respiratory tract cancer. As noted in a recent Letter to the Editors (2), the presence of these three aza-arenes in tobacco smoke has never been confirmed. Between 1960 and 1965, other MSS components (phenols as promoters, polonium- 210, N-nitrosamines, ciliastatic compounds) were asserted to be responsible for smoking related diseases. However, no major assertions were made that phenols, polonium- 210, or the N-nitrosamines were derived from flavorants, casing materials, or humectants. Some investigators did report that several ciliastats were derived from added sugars and glycerol. The ciliastat proposal was drastically diminished in importance by the findings in the 1960 s that only a relatively small proportion of the ciliastats reached the smoker's cilia. During that time, pertinent skills and competencies in research on tobacco smoke composition, particularly the PAH fraction, have been developed. Such skills permitted the isolation in crystalline form of 14 PAHs and the quantitation of these and many other PAHs. They were also used to put in perspective the pyrogenesis of PAHs from a) specific tobacco components, b) additives, and c) processed tobaccos (<b>reconstituted</b> <b>tobacco</b> sheet [RTS], expanded tobacco). R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJRT) pioneered the use of RTS (1953) and expanded tobaccos (1969) in cigarette blends and generated much previously unpublished data on the effect of such processed tobaccos on MSS composition...|$|E
