40|$|M. Com. (Marketing Management) The {{marketing}} research {{industry is a}} highly competitive environment with over one hundred marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> competing for business in the South African market. Literature suggests {{that one of the}} biggest challenges the industry faces is poor positioning. Marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> are seen as data suppliers rather than business or strategic thought partners. This is mainly the result of marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> traditionally providing masses of data with no or limited insights, practical use and strategic value (also known as actionability of research results). This state of affairs in the industry needs to be addressed, otherwise marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> will become less profitable and effective data / research information suppliers. To warrant future business and increased revenues, marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> need to position themselves as professionals who can deliver actionable research results that assist clients strategically. Literature suggests various methods in which marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> can achieve this; amongst which data visualisation and storytelling are identified as two such methods to deliver actionable research results which impact clients’ business. Therefore, the primary research objective of this study was to uncover the strategic use of data visualisation and storytelling by marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> in quantitative <b>research</b> reports. To address this objective, this study was conducted in two phases, first literature on the topic was presented, followed by an empirical study. The empirical study independently followed an exploratory and descriptive research design where two samples were used. The main study (qualitative phase) sampled individuals, working for South African marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms,</b> who oversee teams who create quantitative research reports by means of indepth interviews; and the small-scale complementary study (quantitative phase) sampled clients of marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> who receive these quantitative reports by means of an computer-administered, Internet-based survey. The studies were conducted sequentially; the small-scale complementary study followed after the main study had been completed. The Morse and Field approach was used to analyse the empirical research results of the main study which indicated that marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> do not claim to have a traditional approach to quantitative reporting; the focus is not on data supply, but rather on providing actionable research results to clients which adds value to their business decision-making. The results also indicate that marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> use storytelling to deliver actionable research so as to increase the strategic value thereof, while data visualisation is not used strategically. The results of the small-scale complementary study indicated that although 62 % of clients feel that current quantitative research reports (received from marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms)</b> can be used to make strategic decisions, clients also feel that quantitative research reports need improvement regarding the delivery of strategic and actionable research reports. The exploration of the current quantitative reporting landscape and the evaluation of whether South African marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> strategically use data visualisation and storytelling, have helped in identifying barriers to adoption of these methods and recommended how these could be overcome; it also identified specific measures to bridge the gap between data supply and strategic (actionable) research. The study found that marketing <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> should continue and strengthen their focus on actionable research as client demand therefor will continue; this can be achieved through a number of ways such as by focusing on understanding the client’s business, demonstrating thought leadership, being future focused, strengthening storytelling capabilities and developing / possibly investing in data visualisation capabilities...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{implications}} of innovation and social interactions on economic growth in a stylized endogenous growth model with heterogeneous <b>research</b> <b>firms.</b> A large number of <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> decide whether to innovate or not, by taking into account what competitors (i. e., other firms) do. This {{is due to the}} fact that their profits partly depend on an externality related to the share of firms which actively engage in research activities. Such a share of innovative firms also determines the evolution of technology in the macroeconomy, which ultimately drives economic growth. We show that when the externality effect is strong enough multiple BGP equilibria may exist. In such a framework, the economy may face a low growth trap suggesting that it may end up in a situation of slow long-run growth; however, such an outcome may be fully solved by government intervention. We also show that whenever multiple BGP exist, they are metastable meaning that the economy may cyclically fluctuate between the low and high BGP as a result of shocks affecting the individual behavior of <b>research</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the use of}} {{the term}} 'market research' in a contemporary context. Although the term is well established as an industry definition its use and meaning have become increasingly contested. This study brings together empirical data from a range of sources that reflect key stakeholders in market <b>research,</b> including <b>research</b> <b>firms,</b> academic <b>research</b> and data on wider use of the term. Findings suggest that amongst these key stakeholders the term 'market research' has become increasingly marginalised. Few of the leading <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> use this term to describe their core activity and data suggests that wider use of the term has declined over the last decade. Where 'market research' is used the term is typically demoted to describing a set of skills rather than a strategic concepts around adding value. A number of explanations are explored for this, including isomorphism amongst <b>research</b> <b>firms,</b> the role of research in generating value and the broader economic context in which research takes place. Finally, given the growing commercial importance of research the paper considers the question of whether continuing use of the term is beneficial...|$|R
