40|$|In {{a two-year}} field experiment, we studied {{the extent of}} damage caused by <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> (Eurydema spp.) on the frame leaves and the outer leaves of cabbage heads in {{relation}} to genotype color. We established that the extent of damage varied with genotype color. In both years of the experiment, the affinity of Eurydema spp. toward green genotypes was significantly greater on the first four assessment dates (from the third decade of May to the third decade of June), while on the remaining dates (from the third decade of July to the second decade of August) we did not establish any differences between the white and <b>red</b> genotypes. <b>Cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> first appeared on white cabbage genotypes. The antioxidative potential conditioned by the content of anthocyanins was significantly higher on the <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> genotypes. Research shows that higher antioxidative potential is related to a lower extent of damage caused by Eurydema spp. The average value of antioxidative potential in the cabbage varieties was 0. 58 mmol/ 100 g of the sample, while in the hybrids it was 0. 47 ± 0. 01 mmol/ 100 g. We confirmed significant differences in values of antioxidative potential between red (0. 68 mmol/ 100 g) and white (0. 48 mmol/ 100 g) cabbage genotypes. Between mid-late (0. 55 mmol/ 100 g) and mid-early (0. 53 mmol/ 100 g) cabbage genotypes we did not establish differences in antioxidative potential levels, while the average value of this parameter in the early genotypes (0. 46 mmol/ 100 g) was significantly low. We established that the color of plants (cabbage) {{represents one of the}} successful factors of antixenosis and has the potential for reducing the damage caused by <b>cabbage</b> stink <b>bugs</b> in environmentally acceptable systems of cabbage production...|$|R

The {{study showed that}} <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice (RC) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-induced inflammation of splenocytes via increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 10 and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6 secretions. The maximum absorption peaks of RC and its heated products, but not activated charcoal-adsorbed products, appeared at 280 nm with a small shoulder around 310 - 330 nm while there existed a minor peak at 560 nm (range from 480 to 630 nm), reflecting <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice included phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. The lyophilized powder of chromatographic fractions F 2, F 3, and F 4 through Sephadex LH- 20 column were rich in phenolics (5. 9 +/- 0. 2 %, 4. 4 +/- 0. 0 %, and 3. 9 +/- 0. 0 %, respectively) and flavonoids (1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, and 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 %, respectively). The results suggest that anti-inflammatory pigment compounds in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice were heat stable. Further analysis of chromatograms from H PLC suggests malvidin glycosides including malvidin 3 -glucoside (oenin), malvidin 5 -glucoside and malvidin 3, 5 -diglucoside in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice could inhibit IL- 6 secretion of LPS-stimulated splenocytes.

40|$|Genistein (GNT), an isoflavone, {{is used in}} the {{clinical}} treatment of various health disorders. GNT is found in primary food source plants and some medical plants. However, studies on the functions of GNT in plants are rarely reported. In this study, we demonstrated that GNT {{plays an important role in}} promoting anthocyanin accumulation in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage.</b> GNT solutions (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/L) as foliar fertilizers were applied to <b>red</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Consequently, anthocyanin accumulation in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> increased in a light-dependent manner. GNT solution at 30 mg/L exhibited the optimal effect on anthocyanin accumulation, which was twice that of the control. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that GNT application upregulated the expression of all structural genes, contributing to anthocyanin biosynthesis under light conditions. Under dark conditions, GNT exerted no significant promotive effect on anthocyanin accumulation; only early biosynthetic genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis responded to GNT. The promotive effect of GNT on anthocyanin biosynthesis is directly attributable to the regulation of structural gene expression. Transcription factors exhibited no response to GNT. The levels of anthocyanin in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> positively correlated with the enzyme activities of antioxidant systems. This finding correlation suggested that the promotive effect of GNT on anthocyanin levels was correlated with improved antioxidant activity in the <b>red</b> <b>cabbage...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{estimate}} the shelf life of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts (stored at 4 and 10 °C), {{the numbers of}} total aerobic bacteria were determined during storage. Parameters for the Gompertz model were determined and the shelf life was predicted using a modified Gompertz equation. The estimated shelf lives of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts packed with polyolefin film and polyamide/polyamide/polyethylene (PA/PA/PE) film at 4 °C were 49. 4 and 52. 3 h, respectively, whereas those of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts packed with polyolefin film and PA/PA/PE film at 10 °C were 19. 7 and 22. 6, respectively. The shelf life prediction equation was appropriate, based on the statistical analysis of the accuracy factor, bias factor, and mean square error. On the other hand, for <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts treated with aqueous ClO 2 /fumaric acid and UV-C then packed with polyolefin film or PA/PA/PE film, the shelf life was predicted to be longer than 168 h.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on anthocyanin extraction from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> using water as a solvent. Mashed cabbage was placed in a batch treatment chamber and subjected to PEF (2. 5 kV/cm electric field strength; 15 μs pulse width and 50 pulses, specific energy 15. 63 J/g). Extracted anthocyanin concentrations (16 to 889 μg/mL) were determined using HPLC. Heat and light stabilities of the control and PEF-treated samples, having approximately the same initial concentrations, were studied. PEF treatments enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> by 2. 15 times with a higher proportion of nonacylated forms than the control (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The heat and light stabilities of the PEF-treated samples and control samples were not significantly different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Practical Application: An innovative pretreatment technology, pulsed electric field processing, enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> by 2. 15 times.

40|$|Application of {{high voltage}} pulsed {{electric}} fields (PEF) to plant tissues increases porosity {{of the plant}} cells, enhancing juice extraction from fruits and vegetables. Red cabbage and beetroot are rich sources of bioactive compounds anthocyanins and betalains, respectively. Pulsed electric field (red cabbage: 1 kV/cm electric field strength, 0. 66 µF and 20 pulses; red beets: 1. 5 kV/cm electric field strength, 0. 66 µF and 20 pulses) was applied to whole <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> and beetroot to enhance juice extraction. Total polyphenols, anthocyanins (<b>red</b> <b>cabbage),</b> betalains (beetroot) and total antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH) of the extracted juice was determined. The bioactivity of the juices on colon cancer cell line HCT- 116 (p 53 +/+ and p 53 -/-) were analyzed. The anti-proliferative activity, apoptosis and cytotoxicity were determined. Pulsed electric field treatment increased (p ≤ 0. 01) juice extraction, total phenolics, anthocyanins (<b>red</b> <b>cabbage),</b> betalains (beetroots) and antioxidant activity of both <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> and beetroot juice compared to non-PEF extracted samples.
