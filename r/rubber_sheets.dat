2500|$|After {{considerable}} experimentation, Denys Bliss at Hovercraft Development Ltd. {{found the}} solution to this problem. Instead of using two separate <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> to form the skirt, a single sheet of rubber was bent into a U shape to provide both sides, with slots cut {{into the bottom of the}} U forming the annular vent. When deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design, air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well, keeping the channel open. Although there was some deformation of the curtain, the airflow within the skirt was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady. Over time, this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt, known as [...] "fingers".|$|E

Therefore, a calibration equation for predicting moisture content was created by near infrared (NIR) technique {{in order to develop}} a more fair trading system in Thailand. Spectra were recorded in two systems. One was measurement on each <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> and the other was on a pile of sheets.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} resistivity {{characteristics of}} Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills for robotic hand tactile sensing application. These materials are suitable {{to be used}} as transducer in tactile sensing applications. Therefore, the thesis highlights the potential of these two materials as a tactile sensing transducer and later describes the best design parameters for them to be applied as a tactile sensor. In the thesis, the tactile sensing mechanism that includes the operating principle and hardware architecture of the sensor are explained. The experimental setup to determine the fundamental properties of Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is presented. Resistivity behavior is of the major factors in choosing Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over the other materials. These materials resistivity need to be tested to ascertain its viability as a tactile sensor. The parameters are voltage supply, the separation gap and sensor construction. The results show the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is better in term of reproducibility and stability of the resistance values as compared to the Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS). However in terms of the sensitivity, Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS) is better in comparison with the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills whereby it can cover lower loading range when compared to QTC Pills. However, since the reproducibility of Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS); 5. 05 Q standard deviation is lower than the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills; 2. 110. standard deviation, it is more preferable to choose the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over Conductive <b>Rubber</b> <b>Sheet</b> (CRS). Furthermore with 5 V supply voltage and 0. 5 mm separation gap, the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills can perform well similar to the 25 V supply voltage. Hence, with the superiority attributes shown, Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills are preferred materials for tactile sensor...|$|R

50|$|The mil fabric {{reinforcement}} {{can be applied}} on the rubber products with different processes. For straight hoses the most used processes are braiding, spiralling, knitting and wrapping. The first three processes have in common that multiple strands of fibres are applied to the product simultaneously on a predetermined pattern in an automated process. The fourth process comprises manual or semi-automated wrapping of <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets</b> reinforced with fabric plies. For the reinforcement of complex shaped rubber products like bellows most manufacturers use these fabric reinforced <b>rubber</b> <b>sheets.</b> These sheets are made by calendering of rubber onto pre-woven fabric plies. The products are manufactured by wrapping (mostly manually) these sheets around a mandrel until enough rubber and reinforcement is applied. However, the disadvantage of using these sheets {{is that it is}} impossible to control the positioning of the individual fibres of the fabric when applied on complex shapes. Therefore, no geodesic paths can be achieved and therefore also no isotensoid loading is possible. To obtain isotensoide loading on a complex shape, the shape must have an isotensoideal profile and geodesic positioning of the fibre structure is required. This can be achieved by using automated winding processes like filament winding or spiralling.|$|E

Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material has become widely accepted as a mouthguard material; however, many studies indicate the necessity of improving the impact absorption ability by considering the design and developing new materials. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the shock-absorbing ability of a novel dual component material comprising EVA and porous rubber with that of EVA alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of samples were tested: Group 1  = EVA (thickness, 4  mm), Group 2  = type 1 material (2 -mm thick porous <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> sandwiched between two sheets of 1 -mm thick EVA sheets), and Group 3  = type 2 material (1 -mm thick porous <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> sandwiched between EVA sheets with 1 and 2 -mm thickness, respectively). Shock absorption was determined by means of a hammer impact testing device equipped with strain gauge, accelerator, and load cell. RESULTS: The value of shock-absorbing ability of group 2 (40. 6  ±  12. 5 %) was significantly higher than those of group 1 (15. 6  ±  2. 1 %) and group 3 (21. 2  ±  9. 2 %). The material with thicker <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> showed significantly higher shock-absorbing ability compared with that of the material with thinner <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The novel dual material was superior to conventional EVA material in shock-absorbing ability depending on the thickness of porous rubber, and it may be potentially effective as mouthguard material, in particular, for patients wearing implant-supported constructions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study and develop a mathematical model of essential parameters affecting drying process in terms of equilibrium moisture content (EMC), apparent density, percentage ofvoid fraction, specific heat capacity and effective diffusion coefficient (D) for three kinds of natural rubber. Three raw natural rubber samples in this work used crumb rubber, rubber stick and <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> with aninitial moisture content ranging between 30 and 45 % wet-basis that were normally used for producing the standardized Thai rubber (STR) block rubber and air dried <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet</b> (ADS). The results show that theapparent density and specific heat of all natural rubber samples were linearly dependent on the moisture content whilst the percentage of void fraction of natural rubber was inversely related to moisture content. The isotherm EMC equations formulated by the Herderson model for the crumb rubber and rubber stick were the best fitting with the experimental values, and for the <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet.</b> The isotherm EMC equationusing the Halsey model was the most appropriable to the experimental results. In addition, the effective diffusion coefficients of all natural rubber materials, which were the function of drying temperature and drying time, were in range of 10 - 6 - 10 - 7 m 2 /hr. However, prediction of the evolution of moisture content ofthin-layer drying under the condition of drying temperatures of 40 - 70 oC (rubber stick and <b>rubber</b> <b>sheet)</b> and 100 - 130 oC (crumb rubber) could be explained by the empirical model, which was the function of drying temperature and drying time...|$|R
