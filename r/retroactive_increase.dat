40|$|Demand {{correlation}} among two interacting items {{is common}} in real-life markets. Sometimes demand of the first item would trigger additional demand toward the second item, but not vice versa. For items with decreasing demand in time, the longer is the selling period, the less the demand and the higher the inventory cost. This paper develops the related inventory model during which two deteriorating items are considered under the circumstances of <b>retroactive</b> <b>increasing</b> (decreasing) holding cost step function of storage time and two possible distinct selling periods as well. A sufficient condition to minimize total inventory cost per unit time is anticipated, via suitable control of the selling period. Ultimately, {{in response to the}} structure of holding cost, an efficient methodology for determining optimal selling periods is presented and demonstrated by numerical examples...|$|R

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local government: Major reductions in annual pension contribution costs for employees hired on or after July 1, 2009, offset to an unknown extent by increases in costs for other forms of public employee compensation.

Preschool-aged children and adults participated in a three-phased associative learning paradigm containing stimuli that were either unique or repeated across phases.

40|$|Abstract: Inventory {{models in}} which the demand rate depends on the {{inventory}} level {{are based on the}} common real-life observation that greater product availability tends to stimulate more sales. Previous models incorporating stock-level dependent demand rate assume that the holding cost is constant for the entire inventory cycle. In this model we will discuss a stock-level dependent demand rate and a storage-time dependent holding cost and also the variable ordering cost. The holding cost per unit of the item per unit time is assumed to be an increasing function of the time spent in storage. Two time-dependent holding cost step functions are considered: <b>Retroactive</b> holding cost <b>increase,</b> and incremental holding cost increase. Procedures are developed for determining the optimal order quantity and the optimal cycle time for both cost structures...|$|R

Such a policy seemed to contradict the UK Government's commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and to many EU directives and had many consequences, including an attempt to make the <b>increase</b> <b>retroactive,</b> with one organization being presented with a Â£16,000 back tax bill. This change in the rate of excise duty effectively removed any commercial incentive to use SVO/PPO, regardless of its desirability on environmental grounds; unless waste vegetable oil can be obtained free of charge, the combined price of SVO/PPO and taxation for its use usually exceeded the price of mineral diesel. HMRC's interpretation is widely challenged by the SVO/PPO industry and the UK pure Plant Oil Association (UKPPOA) was formed to represent the interests of people using vegetable oil as fuel and to lobby parliament.|$|R
5000|$|MUNACA tabled its {{proposal}} for a first collective agreement in August 1995. [...] In late summer 1996, MUNACA requested {{the appointment of a}} conciliator due to stalled negotiations and a multi-year salary freeze. [...] Conciliation began on September 17, 1996, but the conciliator stated that an impasse had been reached on April 9, 1997 over issues of salary and job security, leading McGill to call in an arbitrator with the authority to set the terms of an agreement. [...] In 1998, MUNACA members voted to engage in pressure campaign, including sizeable protests supported by fellow unions SEIU Local 800 (property services) and AGSEM (teaching assistants). [...] Meanwhile, attrition reduced the size of the union by 500. In February 1999, MUNACA members voted overwhelmingly in favor of a contract which included a <b>retroactive</b> 3.5% salary <b>increase</b> with 1% progression followed by a 1.5% increase with 1.5% progression. The contract eliminated discretionary merit increases, placed greater (but not exclusive) weight on seniority in job selection, and included a compromise on employment security.

5000|$|Key {{provisions}} include:(1) Giving consumers {{enough time}} to pay their bills. Credit card companies have to give consumers at least 21 days to pay {{from the time the}} bill is mailed. Credit card companies can not [...] "trap" [...] consumers by setting payment deadlines on the weekend or {{in the middle of the}} day, or changing their payment deadlines each month.(2) No <b>retroactive</b> rate <b>increases.</b> Credit card companies must give consumers at least 45 days notice if their rates are about to go up, and can not change any terms of the contract within a year. Low introductory rates must last at least six months.(3) Easier to pay down debt. Credit card companies must apply payments to a consumer's highest interest rate balances first. Statements must show consumers how long it would take to pay off their existing balance if the consumer made only the minimum payment, and must show the payment amount and total interest cost to pay off the entire balance in 36 months.(4) Eliminates [...] "fee harvester cards." [...] The act restricts fees on low-balance cards sold to cardholders with bad credit. For many of these cards, the up-front fees charged exceeded the remaining credit. The act also restricts the fees that can be charged for gift cards and other prepaid cards. (5) Eliminates excessive marketing to young people. Consumers under the age of 21 must prove that they have an independent income or get a co-signer before applying for a credit card. The Act also prevents credit card companies from mailing offers to consumers under 21 unless they [...] "opt in," [...] and prohibits companies from wooing students with T-shirts, free pizza and other free gifts at university-sponsored events.|$|R
30|$|The holding cost is {{explicitly}} {{assumed to be}} varying over time in only few inventory models. Giri et al. (1996) considered a generalized EOQ model for deteriorating items here in which the demand rate, deterioration rate, holding cost and ordering cost are all assumed to be continuous functions of time. Ferguson et al. (2007) considered {{a variation of the}} economic order quantity (EOQ) model where cumulative holding cost is a nonlinear function of time. They showed how it is an approximation of the optimal order quantity for perishable goods, such as milk, and produce, sold in small to medium size grocery stores where there are delivery surcharges due to infrequent ordering, and managers frequently utilize markdowns to stabilize demand as the productâ€™s expiration date nears (Ferguson et al. 2007). Also, they showed how the holding cost curve parameters can be estimated via a regression approach from the productâ€™s usual holding cost (storage plus capital costs), lifetime, and markdown policy (Ferguson et al. 2007). Alfares (2007) considered the inventory policy for an item with a stock level-dependent demand rate and a storage time-dependent holding cost. The holding cost per unit of the item per unit time is assumed to be an increasing function of the time spent in storage. Two time-dependent holding cost step functions are considered: <b>retroactive</b> holding cost <b>increase,</b> and incremental holding cost increase. Procedures are developed for determining the optimal order quantity and the optimal cycle time for both cost structures. Ray and Chaudhuri (1997) took the time value of money into account in analyzing an inventory system with stock-dependent demand rate and shortages. Two types of inflation rates are considered: internal (company) inflation, and external (general economy) inflation. Shao et al. (2000) determined the optimum quality target for a manufacturing process where several grades of customer specifications may be sold. Since rejected goods could be stored and sold later to another customer, variable holding costs are considered in the model. Beltran and krass (2002) analyzed a version of the dynamic lot size (DLS) model where demands can be positive and negative and disposals of excess inventory are allowed. Assuming deterministic time-varying demands and concave holding costs, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed for this finite time horizon problem. Goh (1992) apparently provides the only existing inventory model in which the demand is stock dependent and the holding cost is time dependent. Actually, he considered two types of holding cost variation: (1) a nonlinear function of storage time and (2) a nonlinear function of storage level (Goh 1992).|$|R
