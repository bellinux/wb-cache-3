40|$|The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) is {{a hybrid}} finite element {{formulation}} that can alleviate {{many of the}} drawbacks from the traditional Lagrangian-based and Eulerian-based finite element simulations, which is developed through combining modern algorithms for Lagrangian hydrodynamics, meshing technology and remap methods developed for high-resolution Eulerian methods. Lagrangian-based finite element formulations is that the computational system moves with the material and main drawback {{is that it will}} face severe problems to deal with strong distortions in the computational domain. Eulerian-based finite element formulations is that the computational system is a prior fixed in space and unable to deal easily with fluids undergo large distortions at the interface. The use of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) computer codes has been an enabling technology for many important applications. When using the ALE technique in engineering simulations, the computational mesh inside the domains can move arbitrarily to optimize the shapes of elements, while the mesh on the boundaries and interfaces of the domains can move along with materials to precisely track the boundaries and interfaces of a multi-material system. In automotive CAE durability analysis, simulation of dynamic stress and fatigue life of fuel <b>tank</b> <b>straps</b> is a complex problem. Typically a fuel tank is held with fuel <b>tank</b> <b>straps.</b> Its movement lies in the domain of nonlinear large rotation dynamics. Moreover, the sloshing behavior in the fuel tank makes the problem even more intricate. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the advantage of ALE method in simulating fuel sloshing through fuel tank and fuel <b>tank</b> <b>strap</b> movement under proving ground conditions using the nonlinear large rotation dynamic method with RADIOSS, a commercial code. After the stress distribution of the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>strap</b> is achieved, a commercial fatigue code, nCode DesignLife, is used to predict the fatigue life of the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>straps.</b> In this research, the stress distribution of the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>strap</b> can be predicted with Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Method (ALE) to simulate fuel sloshing which plays critical role in fuel mass redistribution and the stress variation with time. A commercial fatigue code, nCode DesignLife, is used to predict the fatigue life of the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>straps.</b> The analyses have accurately predicted the crack initiation location and sequence in the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>straps,</b> and show good correlation with test. The utilization of this method can give design direction to minimize the iteration of lab testing and expedite the design period...|$|R

50|$|The {{documentary}} {{is based}} around the Evel Knievel Days event in Butte, Montana. The presenter, Richard Hammond, spends four days with former motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel. Knievel, by now 69 years old, had become very ill, requiring an oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>strapped</b> {{up to him}} constantly to aid with breathing. 48 hours before the film crew arrived, Knievel had a stroke. At several points during filming, Knievel cuts the interview short and leaves before Hammond has finished asking questions.|$|R
50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or scuba tank to a buoyancy compensator or backplate. The name is derived from the cam action of the buckle to tighten and secure the strap. Also known as a cam band or <b>tank</b> <b>strap.</b> Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking cam lever that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released cam locks the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|R

50|$|The PSLV {{has four}} stages using {{solid and liquid}} {{propulsion}} systems alternately. The first stage, {{one of the largest}} solid rocket boosters in the world, carries 138 tonnes of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene-bound (HTPB) propellant and develops a maximum thrust of about 4,800 kN. The 2.8-m diameter motor case is made of maraging steel and has an empty mass of 30,200 kg. Pitch and yaw control during first stage flight is provided by the Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control System (SITVC), which injects an aqueous solution of strontium perchlorate into the nozzle to produce asymmetric thrust. The solution is stored in two cylindrical aluminium <b>tanks</b> <b>strapped</b> to the solid rocket motor and pressurised with nitrogen. Roll control is provided by two small liquid engines {{on opposite sides of the}} stage, the Roll Control Thrusters (RCT).|$|R

50|$|The process {{involves}} {{moving the}} strip past precision-profiled slotted tools made to an exact shape, or past plain cutting tools. The tools are all usually made of tungsten carbide-based compounds. In early machines, {{it was necessary}} to precisely position the strip relative to the cutting tools, but newer machines use a floating suspension technology which enables tools to locate by material contact. This allows mutual initial positioning differences up to approximately 12 mm followed by resilient automatic engagement. Products using this technology directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strip, rotogravure plates, cable and hose clamps, gas <b>tank</b> <b>straps,</b> and window counterbalance springs.

50|$|Located an hour {{north of}} Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast, Weeki Wachee Springs hosts its famous mermaid {{show in the}} natural springs there. In 1946, Newton Perry, a former U.S. Navy man who trained SEALS to swim {{underwater}} in World War II, scouted out Weeki Wachee as a good site for a new business. The spring was full of old rusted refrigerators and abandoned cars. The junk was cleared out and Newt experimented with underwater breathing hoses and invented a method of breathing underwater from a free-flowing air hose supplying oxygen from an air compressor, rather than from a <b>tank</b> <b>strapped</b> onto the back. With the air hose, humans could {{give the appearance of}} thriving twenty feet underwater with no breathing apparatus. An 18-seat theater was built into the limestone, submerged six feet {{below the surface of the}} spring, so viewers could look right into the water.|$|R
50|$|On July 6, 2010, he {{told his}} wife {{that he was going}} for a {{dialysis}} treatment, the last time that his wife would ever see him. Based on a reconstruction of his travels over the next few days, he stopped off at a motel in Knoxville, Tennessee one night and was in Manhattan by the next day, where he had the oil in his Cadillac changed at a garage on 145th Street, near his mother's apartment. The afternoon of July 9, he wore a red shirt and a cap, and entered Serar, a Madison Avenue clothing store located at 46th Street. After asking for a pair of pants to match his jacket, he pulled out a handgun in one hand, while wielding a cane in the other and having an oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>strapped</b> to his body and connected to his nose. A customer in the store ran out, and Williams fired his gun damaging some shelving and a number of suits. Witnesses saw him cross the street to his getaway car, a black Cadillac with Alabama license plates.|$|R

5000|$|On July 6, 2013, a fire {{broke out}} at the East Hernando Library location. The fire was deemed {{suspicious}} {{due to the fact}} that some of the wicker furniture from inside the library had been piled up against the back porch door. Two weeks later the Hernando County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Division of State Fire Marshal received a confession from a suspect who had been previously reported to be on the scene at the time of the fire. The suspect had made his presence known at the scene of the fire by claiming he was going to school to become a volunteer fire fighter and was there to assist with putting out the fire - he also arrived in a fire suit and an oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>strapped</b> to his back. The smoke and water damage from this incident has been estimated at $500,000. This estimation includes $250,000 in damages to the building and another $250,000 to the books. Eighteen thousand books were damaged by either smoke or water during the incident. The suspect accepted a plea deal with the following terms: 8 years in prison, pay back roughly $590,000 to Travelers Insurance and $25,000 to Hernando County.|$|R
50|$|The Slime Blower is {{seen and}} {{developed}} in the movie Ghostbusters II; this piece of equipment is a metal <b>tank</b> <b>strapped</b> {{to the back of}} its user, with an attached sprayer used to project streams of the psychomagnetheric mood slime that has been reinforced with positive emotions so as to neutralize its negatively reinforced counterparts. In Ghostbusters: The Video Game, the slime blower is modified to shoot positively charged slime, and can also shoot slime tethers, the slime tether in turn can be attached to one object, then the other end to another solid surface to pull that heavy object (also used to open heavy doors) which usually would be difficult to move without use of some tremendous amount of force, so the slime tether helps get the job done. The Ghostbusters can also attach one end of a slime tether to a ghost, then attach the other end to a nearby already deployed ghost trap allowing for a quicker trapping of a ghost. A toy slime blower was released with the Kenner Real Ghostbusters toy line. In the Ghostbusters comics, the Ecto-Splat is a flamethrower-like device that fires a hard jet of ectoplasm, which can damage or dissipate ghosts..|$|R
50|$|Reilly Tyne {{is the son}} of Ben Reilly (Spider-Man's clone) and Elizabeth Tyne. Before {{he reached}} his teens, his {{inherited}} powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration. Kaine, the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a <b>regeneration</b> <b>tank</b> to slow the process. Kaine's efforts were for two goals: to resurrect Daredevil, who had previously died saving Kaine, and to heal Tyne. Kaine summoned the demon Zarathos, which attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities. Through meditation and concentration, Tyne eventually learned to project a human appearance, but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age. Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil. He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.|$|R

50|$|The {{increased}} agricultural {{business was}} shortly overshadowed by discovery {{of oil in}} the Santa Maria Valley. By 1902 the railroad had converted its engines to burn oil and was <b>strapping</b> <b>tanks</b> from standard gauge cars onto their flatcars at the rate of ten per month. The railway's three 2-6-0 locomotives were inadequate to move all the oil to storage tanks near San Luis Bay. Five new Baldwin 2-8-0s were delivered by 1906 as the freight car fleet expanded to two hundred cars. The Betteravia branch was electrified in 1906 and extended to Guadalupe in 1909. Another electrified branch was built in 1910 to serve an oil refinery near Sisquoc. Three center-cab electric locomotives worked the branches with a center-door interurban car built by Cincinnati Car Company in 1912.|$|R
40|$|The orbital {{cryogenic}} {{lifetime of}} dewars {{is driven by}} the internal heat load. The heat load on the cryogen tank of a cryostat is given by two major effects: radiation and conduction. Radiation is minimized by using vapour cooled radiation shields with multilayer insulation on them {{as well as on the}} cryogen tank. Conduction is coming from all parts which have direct connection between the warm and cold ends. There are three basic conduction contributors: harness, piping, and tank support structure. The design of all these elements is usually optimized in order to fulfill their specific tasks with minimum heat transfer. The biggest conduction contributor of these three elements in a cryostat with a conventional <b>strap</b> type <b>tank</b> support is actually the tank support which must be designed to withstand the high dynamic loads during launch and, in some specific cases, also during landing. Even if the <b>tank</b> support <b>straps</b> are optimized to the lowest possible heat conduction by minimizing the cross sectional area and by a proper selection of low conductive materials their thermal conduction contribution to the cryogen heat load is still the biggest. It is therefore worthwhile to undertake technical efforts to reduce the cryogen tank support heat conduction as far as possible. The ultimate goal would be to eliminate their conduction completely on orbit where, due to zero-g conditions, in many applications no real tank support is required. (orig.)

50|$|June 1943: Siebe Gorman were {{contracted}} by the 79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom) {{to design}} specialist apparatus {{for use by}} the Duplex Drive Tank crews.

40|$|This study investigates various {{insulation}} thicknesses {{requirements for}} double-walled spherical pressure vessels for {{the storage of}} cryogenic liquids. The inner tank is suspended from the outer <b>tank</b> by <b>straps</b> or cables and the annular space between the tanks is filled with insulation. The outer tank is not subjected to the freezing temperatures and is thus {{assumed to be a}} standard carbon steel sphere. In the Finite Element Analysis model of the system, one dimensional analysis was employed. This is due to the assumption that temperature gradient does only exist along the spherical radial direction. In the developed model, once the thickness of the inner shell has been determined based on relevant standards and codes—ASME Sec VIII Div 1 or 2, BS 5500 etc and the thickness of the outer shell is known; the required insulation material thicknesses were calculated for different insulating materials. Set of equations resulting from Finite Element Analysis were solved with computer programme code which was written in FORTRAN 90 programming language. The results obtained are validated by analytical method. The results showed no significant difference (P > 0. 05) with values obtained through analytical method. The thicknesses for different insulating materials in-between inner and outer tank shells were compared. The results showed that as the insulating material thickness was increased, the heat flux into the stored product was decreasing and at a certain thickness; it started increasing. The insulating thickness at which this happens is termed as critical thickness of insulating material—the thickness of insulation at which the heat influx to the stored products is minimal; this would therefore reduce boil-off of the stored cryogenic product. High thermal conductivity insulating materials need to be thicker than lower thermal conductivity insulating materials if the system is conditioned to have the same heat flux into the stored product for all insulating materials. In the simulation, different insulating material gives different minimal heat influx into the stored products...|$|R
