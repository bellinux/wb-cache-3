50|$|In the DSM process, {{cyclohexane}} was {{heated to}} about 155 °C (311 °F) before passing {{into a series}} of six reactors. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.8 kg/cm2 gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig). In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing {{a small percentage of the}} cyclohexane to oxidise and produce cyclohexanone, some cyclohexanol also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350 mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through nominal 28-inch bore (DN 700 mm) stub pipes with inset bellows. The inlet to each reactor was baffled so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe. The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the <b>reactor</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E

This master thesis has evaluated three different design considerations of the methanol synthesis loop using Honeywell's general purpose process simulator UniSim Design (R 380 Build 14027) combined with MathWorks programming language MATLAB. The three configurations are Lurgis methanol <b>reactor</b> <b>loop</b> as built on Tjeldbergodden, the use of interstage methanol removal by the means of condensation and Lurgis MegaMethanol configuration. 	 It was shown that the base case simulation of Lurgis <b>reactor</b> <b>loop,</b> using kinetics from Vanden Bussche and Froment (1996), gave reasonable results compared to Tjeldbergodden methanol plant. For the interstage methanol removal configuration {{it was found that}} the two reactors should be of equal length, 7. 25 m, and that a cooling water temperature of 250 degrees C in the first reactor and 255 degrees C in the second reactor produced the highest amount of methanol. When operating with a recycle ratio of 2, this configuration had the potential of a net present worth of 47 million dollars compared to the base case over a 10 year horizon.

40|$|The Early Flight Fission Test Facility (EFF-TF) was {{established}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to provide a capability for performing hardware-directed activities to support multiple in-space nuclear reactor concepts by using a non-nuclear test methodology. This includes fabrication and testing at both the module/component level and near prototypic reactor configurations. The EFF-TF is currently supporting an effort to develop an affordable fission surface power (AFSP) system that could be deployed on the Lunar surface. The AFSP system is presently based on a pumped liquid metal-cooled (Sodium-Potassium eutectic, NaK- 78) reactor design. This design {{was derived from the}} only fission system that the United States has deployed for space operation, the Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) 10 A reactor, which was launched in 1965. Two prototypical components recently tested at MSFC were a pair of Stirling power conversion units that would be used in a reactor system to convert heat to electricity, and an annular linear induction pump (ALIP) that uses travelling electromagnetic fields to pump the liquid metal coolant through the <b>reactor</b> <b>loop.</b> First ever tests were conducted at MSFC to determine baseline performance of a pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors using NaK as the hot side working fluid. A special test rig was designed and constructed and testing was conducted inside a vacuum chamber at MSFC. This test rig delivered pumped NaK for the hot end temperature to the Stirlings and water as the working fluid on the cold end temperature. These test were conducted through a hot end temperature range between 400 to 550 C in increments of 50 C and a cold end temperature range from 30 to 70 C in 20 C increments. Piston amplitudes were varied from 6 to 1 1 mm in. 5 mm increments. A maximum of 2240 Watts electric was produced at the design point of 550 hot end, 40 C cold end with a piston amplitude of 10. 5 mm. This power level was reached at a gross thermal efficiency of 28 %. A baseline performance map {{was established}} for the pair of 1 kW Stirling convertors. The performance data will then be used for design modification to the Stirling convertors. The ALIP tested at MSFC has no moving parts and no direct electrical connections to the liquid metal containing components. Pressure is developed by the interaction of the magnetic field produced by the stator and the current which flows {{as a result of the}} voltage induced in the liquid metal contained in the pump duct. Flow is controlled by variation of the voltage supplied to the pump windings. Under steady-state conditions, pump performance is measured for flow rates from 0. 5 - 4. 3 kg/s. The pressure rise developed by the pump to support these flow rates is roughly 5 - 65 kPa. The RMS input voltage (phase-to-phase voltage) ranges from 5 - 120 V, while the frequency can be varied arbitrarily up to 60 Hz. Performance is quantified at different loop temperature levels from 50 C up to 650 C, which is the peak operating temperature of the proposed AFSP reactor. The transient response of the pump is also evaluated to determine its behavior during startup and shut-down procedures...|$|E

The radiograph of this weld indicates the presence of a 3 / 8 in. transverse defect. The majority of the welds showed indications of porosity. (J. R. D. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} internal airlift <b>loop</b> <b>reactor</b> with continuous slurry phases was explored {{to investigate}} the local bubble size and the local mass transfer properties. A mathematical model was derived to simulate the bubble size in every flow region. Also, a new method was developed to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration. INSTRUCTION In order to meet different industrial processes, many types of modified gas-liquid-solid hybrid reactors have emerged in recent years. In this study, an experimental apparatus was employed as a cold model of a novel hybrid reactor designed for hydrate formation, F-T and methanol syntheses, and so on. As an important base of optimization and scale-up of the hybrid reactor, the local hydrodynamics and local mass transfer property was investigated. The hybrid reactor mainly includes three parts: spray-impinge part, perforated plate part, and modified internal airlift <b>loop</b> <b>reactor</b> (MIALR) part. The focus was mainly placed on the MIALR part. Most literatures published were addressed on the internal airlift <b>loop</b> <b>reactor</b> (IALR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{advanced}} 3 Keymaster simulation platform and RELAP 5 simulation code are introduced. At the same time, the AP 1000 nuclear <b>reactor</b> and primary <b>loop</b> modeling method {{is discussed in}} detail based on Remlap 5 and 3 Keymaster simulation platform. The typical Relap 5 nasalization cells of AP 1000 nuclear <b>reactor</b> and primary <b>loop</b> system are showed in Fig. 1. The Fig. 2 shows the AP 1000 reactor coolant system model. Fig. 3 shows the AP 1000 reactor core and pressure vessel model. Fig. 4 shows the AP 1000 nuclear reactor steam generator model...|$|R
