50|$|On January 7, 1927, AT&T {{initiated}} the first transatlantic commercial telephone service, linking London and New York. AT&T's transmitter was at Radio Central, and their receiver was in Houlton, Maine. The <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>signal</b> from Radio Central was {{received by the}} British General Post Office's receiver facility in Cupar, Scotland.|$|E
50|$|More {{important}} for the future, the coherer could not detect AM (radio) transmissions. As a simple switch that registered {{the presence or absence}} of radio waves, the coherer could detect the on-off keying of wireless telegraphy transmitters, but it could not demodulate (rectify) the waveforms of AM <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>signals,</b> which began to be experimented with in the first years of the 20th century. This problem was solved by the rectification capability of Reginald Fessenden's hot wire barretter and electrolytic detector. These in turn were replaced by the crystal detector around 1906, and then around 1912 by vacuum tube technologies such as John Ambrose Fleming's thermionic diode and Lee De Forest's Audion (triode) tube.|$|R
