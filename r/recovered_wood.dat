40|$|Issue: <b>Recovered</b> <b>wood</b> waste {{frequently}} contains non-wood contaminants that escape traditional contaminant removal systems. These pervasive contaminants {{might be}} a problem for the end user’s manufacturing process. Furthermore, they devalue the marketability of the resulting feedstocks. Screening techniques might not be effective because of dimensional similarities with the acceptable product. Manual sorting techniques might be ineffective and labor extensive. To produce the cleanest product, a processing facility must maintain a series of contaminant removal systems that are capable of effectively removing the contaminants. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the use of equipment that separates materials according to differences in density.

These contaminants can create problems for the processor and end user alike.

The following types of magnetic separation devices are described below: Stationary, Non Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: These are large permanent plate or electro-magnets designed to be suspended over a conveyor belt. These stationary, non self-cleaning magnets pull tramp metal out of wood waste as it passes underneath. To avoid excessive clean-up, the suspended magnets should be installed in areas where tramp metal volume is relatively small. So, they are generally inefficient for most applications at a wood waste processing facility. Since the overhead magnets work against gravity, they must be stronger than magnets underneath material flow. Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: A large permanent plate or electro-magnet.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in cascading materials recovered from buildings {{as the amount of}} construction and demolition waste (C&DW) has been increasing. In Finland, cascading wood from building {{can be one of the}} effective approaches considering that there are a lot of wooden buildings, which are now due for renovation or demolition. From this point, investigating the available amount, as well as the potential for cascading, is significant. However, the statistics available to discuss the potential are limited at the moment. Therefore, this study aimed to obtain the required data through a case study of a building demolition and to analyze the potential of cascading wood from the building. The case study building was a wooden building (Kindergarten) in Porvoo. The possible amount for cascading was calculated before the demolition and compared with the amount after the demolition. Following this, the wood recovered from the building was assessed from different perspectives. Through the data gathered, the potential amount for cascading was obtained and the amounts were compared in terms of the cross-section and the location where each <b>recovered</b> <b>wood</b> piece was used. The results revealed that each <b>recovered</b> <b>wood</b> piece showed different behavior in the extent of damage, regardless of the dimension. In addition, wood with better condition was recovered in the independent parts such as the roof and exterior cladding, which also showed different behavior by location. These results indicated that the cascading potential for <b>recovered</b> <b>wood</b> should be discussed in terms of both cross-section and location. Through the further investigation, even smaller cross-section such as the 1 ”× 4 ” from the roof board and the 1 ”× 4 ” and 1 ”× 6 ” with paint from the exterior cladding showed a high cascading potential thanks to the reasonable recovered condition. Moreover, it could be observed that the paint was not necessarily critical for cascading unless it is hazardous. These results demonstrated the potential of the extension of a target for cascading <b>recovered</b> <b>wood</b> not only to wooden building but also other types of buildings with concrete or steel structures. It was also discussed that technological aspects such as the demolition method and building design extensively affected the potential. At the same time, however, it was suggested that minor changes in the details could be applicable to improve them for the enhancement of the potential. To raise the reliability of the results from this study, more case studies with different types of buildings were recommended. In addition, more accurate cost comparison and environmental assessment including whole lifecycle would be beneficial to drive the industry in the direction to cascading more materials recovered from building in general...|$|E

40|$|Dirt {{and grit}} are common {{contaminants}} in <b>recovered</b> <b>wood</b> waste that resist removal by mechanical screening.

For example, the presence of dirt and grit in composite panel board feedstocks causes excessive equipment wear in the manufacturing plant {{as well as for}} the end users of panel board products. For the manufacturing plant, dirt and grit causes refiner plates in the size reduction equipment to wear down at a faster rate than normal. For the end-user, dirt and grit embedded in the panel board causes saw blades to dull more rapidly. Dirt and grit can also reduce the brightness of a panel board which may be a problem for end users who overlay the board with thin melamines or other coatings.

The following pesticides were determined: PCP, lindane, dichlofluanide, tolylfluanide, propiconazole, tebuconazole, IPBC (iodine-propyl-butyl-carbamate), K-HDO ((N-Cyclohexyl-diazeniumdioxy) -potassium) and fenoxycarb. The {{first step was to}} show that such compounds can be vaporized under moderate conditions. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was capable for sampling and enrichment. The reference analytics was made by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both, waste wood, in this case window frames from reconstruction work, and self-prepared doped wood samples were utilized. For analyzing the complex mixture of vaporized native and artificial ingredients of the lignocellulose material a chromatographic pre-separation was necessary. Hence, the second step was to study the behavior of active substances in the analysis with GC-FAIMS to clarify which peaks in positive and negative mode are dedicated to wood preservatives. At least one strong signal from every selected active compound was located for clear identification. With that knowledge, FAIMS was successfully applied for the distinction of natural and treated wood samples.

40|$|Issue: A {{priority}} in <b>recovering</b> <b>wood</b> waste from any source is to minimize additional contaminants {{in the course}} of preparing the material for processing. Handling or storing wood waste on bare ground, crushed rock, or asphalt paved surfaces are common practices. However, these practices introduce dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants into the wood waste material. Even the quality of the cleanest materials are downgraded. This degradation is more detrimental to the cleaner and higher value wood waste than the lower value wood waste. Lower quality wood waste leads to lower market value and greater contamination removal requirements for the facility and end-user. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using clean concrete surfaces for front-end storage and material handling of wood waste. A well maintained concrete surface minimizes dirt, grit, rock, and other contaminants to downgrade the quality of the material. Consider the following issues when handling and storing wood waste materials on concrete surfaces: Operational. Concrete surfaces are ideal for wood waste dumping, rough sorting, bulk reduction (by means of rolling stock compaction), and storage because the smooth surface prevents unwanted dirt and rock to mix with the wood waste material.
