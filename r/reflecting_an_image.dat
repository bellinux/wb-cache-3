Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, <b>reflecting</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of her younger self.

50|$|The line {{of sight}} of the {{telescope}} needed to be exactly perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This could be done by sighting a distant, stationary object, lifting and reversing the telescope on its bearings, and again sighting the object. If the crosshairs did not intersect the object, the {{line of sight}} was halfway between the new position of the crosshairs and the distant object; the crosshairs were adjusted accordingly and the process repeated as necessary. Also, if the rotation axis was known to be perfectly horizontal, the telescope could be directed downward at a basin of mercury, and the crosshairs illuminated. The mercury acted as a perfectly horizontal mirror, <b>reflecting</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the crosshairs back up the telescope tube. The crosshairs could then be adjusted until coincident with their reflection, and the line of sight was then perpendicular to the axis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the underlying dimensions of trustworthiness of financial service providers in the Indian retail banking sector and to model trustworthiness as a set of second-order factors. The study replicates and extends the work of Ennew and Sekhon in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach – Using the trustworthiness scale developed by Ennew and Sekhon this study identifies six first-order factors of trustworthiness for retail bankers in India using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Then the study modeled trustworthiness as a set of three second-order factors using second-order confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The first-order factors obtained for trustworthiness of retail bankers are customer orientation, integrity and honesty, communication and similarity, shared values, expertise, and ability and consistency. The second-order confirmatory factor analysis resulted in three higher order factors namely, competency, openness and benevolence. Practical implications – The various dimensions of trustworthiness should be viewed as levers for improving a bank's trustworthiness in the minds of its current customers. At the same time, these dimensions will help them in <b>reflecting</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of trustworthiness in the minds of its potential customers. Establishment of trustworthiness as an element of corporate image will provide competitive advantage to the service firms and improve their financial performance. Originality/value – The research tests for the reliability and validity of the trustworthiness scale of Ennew and Sekhon. This study provides a window to the dimensions on which retail bank customers in an emerging economy such as India perceive a retail bank's trustworthiness. Furthermore, this study is an attempt to model trustworthiness as a set of second-order factors...|$|E

By means of this approach the construction size can be reduced, because the focal lengths of the optical units of the individual channels can be significantly smaller, which in turn also enables a weight reduction of the system.

50|$|Dr. Heidegger's friends become {{cautiously}} intrigued. They wish {{to taste}} the water, hoping it will restore their youth and give {{them an opportunity to}} live life again, free from the mistakes they made when they were young. As Heidegger watches, they anxiously drink the water. Their youth restored, they begin acting as fatuously as they did in their prime. Soon, the three men of the group begin competing for the attentions of the now-youthful and beautiful widow.

50|$|Conventional diving {{is limited}} to shallow waters. Remotely {{sampling}} deeper sediments of high water content is often unreliable due to sampler bow waves, compaction upon impact, or variably disrupted surface sediment features (Somerfield and Clarke 1997). In 1971, Rhoads and Cande described an instrument {{to address the problems}} of adequately observing and collecting silty sediments. Their remote sampling equipment introduced the field of in situ vertical sediment profile imagery and what are now commonly called SPI cameras. The device mainly consists of a wedge-shaped box mounted in a frame. The box has an oblique face made of transparent acrylic and a downward-looking camera (Figure 1). Weights force the wedge and its internal mirror into the sediments. The mirror, at 45° to the transparent section, <b>reflects</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the pierced sediment-water interface to the underwater camera, like a periscope. In order to remain rigid at depth, the wedge is filled with distilled water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Reflexology {{is a kind}} of {{assisting}} physical care through massaging or applying {{pressure to}} parts of the feet where will <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of the human body in order to improve general health of the human. Based on this principle, we propose a new application of 7 -DOF(degree of freedom) redundant manipulator to do the massaging work for human feet with the tactile sensor equipped to the end-effector. To facilitate the flexible and dexterous manipulation of redundant manipulator, the hybrid impedance control is adopted and extended to include the null space motion, not only to generate a desired motion of the end-effector, but also manage the contact force between the end-effector and the human feet. In order to improve the safety and comfortability, the reactive forces of the tactile sensor cells are monitored and recorded. A real massaging experiment is carried out on the human feet and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I examine {{the concept of}} sexual offenses in Swedish {{criminal}} law: How is the sexuality of sexual offenses constructed? The material analyzed consists of preparatory works and case law on sexual offenses. Inspired by law professor Katherine M. Franke, the analysis is theoretically grounded in two diverse understandings of sexuality: Sexuality as erotic and sexuality as a dense transfer point for relations of power. In the article I argue that the sexuality of sexual offenses – {{such as it is}} constructed in Swedish criminal law on sexual offences – <b>reflects</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> of sexuality as pleasurable and mutual. Hence, it is a sexuality created as erotic. Further, a consequence of this construction of sexuality is discussed in the article, namely that sexuality as erotic renders invisible the many different ways in which sexuality is used as a tool in relations of power. Finally, different theoretical understandings of the relation between gender and sexual violations in criminal law are shortly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} used by Robbie Cooper for Immersion {{is inspired by}} a method developed by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Known as the Interrotron method, Morris used the process to interview people directly through the camera lens. A modified autocue, the Interrotron uses a one-way mirror to <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> <b>image</b> towards the viewer whilst they gaze into the camera. Morris connected a live video feed of himself into the Interrotron so he could ask questions and the interviewee could retain direct eye contact with him, whilst expressing themselves straight to the camera and the audience. Cooper adapted this approach, plugging video games consoles and computers into the autocue, as well as creating a studio environment which he has described as an [...] "anti-shoot", in which the attention of subjects is diverted away from {{the purpose of the}} activity. In 2011 Cooper worked as a consultant on the Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass movie [...] "Visitors", which used the technique extensively.|$|R
