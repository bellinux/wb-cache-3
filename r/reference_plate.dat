While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a <b>reference</b> <b>plate</b> with the actors, and then without them to add in the skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E
50|$|Plate motions, {{both those}} {{observable}} {{now and in}} the past, are referred ideally to a reference frame that allows other plate motions to be calculated. For example, a central plate, such as the African plate, may have the motions of adjacent plates referred to it. By composition of reconstructions, additional plates can be reconstructed to the central plate. In turn, the <b>reference</b> <b>plate</b> may be reconstructed, together with the other plates, to another reference frame, such as the earth's magnetic field, as determined from paleomagnetic measurements of rocks of known age. A global hotspot reference frame has been postulated (see, e.g., W. Jason Morgan) but there is now evidence that not all hotspots are necessarily fixed in their locations relative to one another or the earth's spin axis. However, there are groups of such hotspots that appear to be fixed within the constraints of available data, within particular mesoplates.|$|E

40|$|Several {{factors are}} {{investigated}} that normally cause variation in zone diameters in conventional disc plate diffusion assay procedures. Of these factors {{the most serious}} is the unequal exposure of the individual plates at top or bottom of stacks to temperatures above and below room temperature. This unequal temperature exposure is avoided by novel handling and incubation procedures. A major variable, but one which can be controlled, is the varying time interval between pouring seeded agar {{and the time of}} applying the pads with antibiotic to the plates. This influence of time of setting and the effects of several other sequential operations are combined into a composite variable. This variable is then accounted for and normalized by interposing “external” <b>reference</b> <b>plates</b> set with a reference solution in the sequence of approximately 100 <b>plates.</b> No “internal” <b>reference</b> zones are employed.

METHODS: Results of high vaginal swab cultures processed in a standard manner on plates containing equal halves of Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and CA were compared. Non-Candida albicans yeast isolates were further speciated with API 20 C AUX or API 32 C.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{constructed}} a semi-dynamic subduction zone model in a 3 D spherical shell and shown some applications. Our model enables the slab to subduct by imposing velocities {{in a small}} boundary region so {{that the number of}} finite volumes needed is smaller than that required for a complex slab rheology to achieve subduction-like features, such as the narrow low viscosity shear zone (Billen and Hirth, 2005). Additionally, the model can easily incorporate observations such as the geometry of the shallow part of the slab and plate boundary. The model can also include the over-riding plate, which is not considered in the “free subduction” model (e.g., Schellart et al., 2007; Morra et al., 2009) but is sometimes important (Yamato et al., 2009). However, the model also has a number of limitations, such as an inability to handle more than two plates. In this study, we assume that the pole of both plate motions coincides, although this is not true in general. In theory, such a case could be handled by splitting the plate motion into the motion relative to the <b>reference</b> <b>plate</b> and the absolute motion of the <b>reference</b> <b>plate.</b> In practice, however, this will make the calculations difficult because of the complex boundary conditions. Despite these difficulties, our model is useful for understanding the character of subduction zones and can be applied for a particular pair of plates, such as the Pacific plate and slowly moving Eurasia plate.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} of {{a substance}} {{consists of two}} phases. The one phase {{is caused by the}} composition and structure of d substance and the other phase is affected by volume, surface roughness, and surface area of emitter. It must be noted that polymers have many kinds of compositions and structures. On this study We measured the total normal emissive powers of these polymer films and the <b>reference</b> <b>plate</b> at around 300 K by using a specially made apparatus. Emissivity of a polymer film can be determined by comparing the film with the <b>reference</b> <b>plate</b> in the emissive power under the same conditions. The relationship between the emissivity of polymer films and their thickness bears a characteristic feature according to their compositions and structures. Infrared absorption spectra can be used to explain this relationship since a good infrared absorber is also a good infrared emitter. Study for the emissivity of polymers is important not only to define one of the thermophysical properties of polymers, but a 1 so to utilize the emissive properties of these materials in an effective way. In the area of the technfcal applications of polymers, investigations are being made on surface temperature measurements, in melt-spinning and in film production by remote sensing. The use of polymers in solar energy collectors, greenhouses, and the drying of polymers by radiation have been of special interest in commercial applications.

The SIBRE (spectral Infrared Bidirectional Reflectance and Emissivity) system and a TIR system for measuring spectral directional-hemispherical emissivity have been completed and tested successfully. Optical properties and performance features of key components (including spectrometer, and TIR source) of these systems have been characterized by integrated use of local standards (blackbody and <b>reference</b> <b>plates).</b> The stabilization of the spectrometer performance was improved by a custom designed and built liquid cooling system. Methods and procedures for measuring spectral TIR BRDF and directional-hemispheric emissivity with these two systems have been verified in sample measurements.

The measured spectral emissivities of water surface are very close to the calculated values based on well established water refractive index values in published papers.
