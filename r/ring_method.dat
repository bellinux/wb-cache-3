Therapy is performed while floating horizontally in the water, with rings or floats supporting the neck, arms, pelvis, and knees. The extremities are used as levers to activate the trunk muscles.|$|E

5000|$|Bad Ragaz <b>Ring</b> <b>Method</b> (BRRM) {{gets its}} name from the famous Bad Ragaz natural spring and {{wellness}} spa in eastern Switzerland. [...] "Ring" [...] refers to the rings or floats that are used to support the patient at the water surface. BRRM combines early techniques of aquatic exercise, developed in the 1930s by German physician Knupfer, with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques developed in the 1950s and 1960s by American neurophysiologist Herman Kabat and his assistants Margaret Knott and Dorothy Voss. Dr Knupfer originally adapted land exercises to water, using floats to support the patient while the therapist acts as a fixed point for movement. Knott and Voss applied PNF extensively for therapeutic exercise and began presenting their techniques in workshops in the 1950s; PNF courses began to be taught at major universities during the 1960s; and subsequently PNF became a widely accepted technique used extensively by physical therapists, other health professionals, and athletes. Adaptation of PNF for use in aquatic therapy took place between the early 1960s and 1990 at Bad Ragaz, initially by Dr W.M. Zinn and Nele Ipsen, and later by Bridget Davies and Beatrice Egger.|$|E
