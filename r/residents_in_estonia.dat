Former Prime Minister of Estonia Mart Laar attempted to correct him, pointing out that all permanent <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> have the right to vote (but not to be elected) in local elections. However van der Linden referred to reports of the Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.|$|E

50|$|The Estonian Swedes, are a Swedish-speaking {{linguistic}} minority traditionally {{residing in the}} coastal areas and islands {{of what is now}} western and northern Estonia. The beginning of the continuous settlement of Estonian Swedes in these areas (known as Aiboland) dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when their Swedish-speaking ancestors arrived <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> from what is now Sweden and Finland. Almost all of Estonia's Swedish-speaking minority fled to Sweden during World War II, and only the descendants of a few individuals who opted to stay are permanently <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> today.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of Swedish-speaking permanent <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> {{what is now}} Estonia (Estonian Swedes) was first documented in the 14th century, and possibly {{dates back to the}} Viking Age. There were an estimated 12,000 Swedes <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> <b>in</b> 1563, mainly distributed along the coastal regions and islands. Estonia was under Swedish rule 1558 - 1710, after which the territory was ceded to Russia in the 1721 Treaty of Nystad. In 1781, 1,300 Estonian Swedes of the island of Hiiumaa (Dagö) were forced to move to New Russia (today Ukraine) by Catherine II of Russia, where they formed Gammalsvenskby (Old Swedish Village). According to the 1934 census, there were 7,641 Estonian Swedes (Swedish speaking, 0.7% of the population <b>in</b> <b>Estonia),</b> making Swedes the third largest national minority <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> after Russians and Germans. During World War II, almost the entire community of Estonian Swedes fled to Sweden. Today there are, at most, a few hundred Estonian Swedes living <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> and a few hundred in Ukraine, with the estimates varying widely depending on who identifies, or can be identified, as a Swede. Many of them are living <b>in</b> northwestern mainland <b>Estonia</b> and on adjacent islands and on the island of Ruhnu (Runö) in the Gulf of Riga.|$|R
40|$|A {{difference}} in prepausal lengthening was found when the unscripted speech of Estonians living in Sweden {{for more than}} 50 - 60 years was {{compared to that of}} Estonians <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> Vowel durations <b>in</b> CVCV words in prepausal and non-prepausal position were measured. In Estonian, the vowel of the first, stressed syllable can be short (Q 1), long (Q 2) or overlong (Q 3) while duration of the second syllable vowel is inversely proportional to the quantity degree of the first. For both groups of speakers, prepausal lengthening was strongest in the final syllable of the word. A lengthening was found also in the penultimate stressed syllable, but with one exception: the Q 2 vowel of the speakers living <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The reason may have been the relatively small {{difference in}} duration between Q 2 and Q 3. The Swedish-Estonian speakers had a prepausal lengthening pattern resembling that of Swedish which in some cases resulted in a considerable durational overlap between Q 2 and Q 3...|$|R
40|$|This article studies processes, {{policies}} and practices for geography and history education <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The analysis covers the societal transformation period in an ethnically divided society from the 1980 s to the early 2000 s characterized by Estonia’s disintegration from the Soviet Union towards the integration to the European Union and NATO. Geography and history education curricula, textbooks and related {{policies and}} practices promoted a particular national time-space by supporting the belongingness of Estonia into Europe, rejecting connections towards Russia and suggesting a division between ethnic Estonians and ethnically non-Estonian <b>residents</b> of <b>Estonia.</b> <b>In</b> geography and history textbooks, the Russian-speaking population, comprising then {{almost a third of}} the entire population of Estonia, was divided into non-loyal, semi-loyal and loyal groups of whom only the latter could be integrated in the Estonian time-space. The formal education policies for geography and history supported Estonia’s disintegration from the Soviet past and pawed way to integration to the western political and economic structures. However, challenging market and sensitive cultural contexts created peculiar, alternative and sometimes opposing local practices in geography and history education...|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} {{experiences of}} female {{breast cancer patients}} diagnosed in 1968 - 1981 in Finland and <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> were compared. The series consisted of 18, 729 patients in Finland and 4100 <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The overall estimated 5 -year relative survival rate was 67. 3 % in Finland and 55. 9 % <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> The stage-adjusted 5 -year relative survival rate <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> was 63. 4 % (the Finnish rates used as a standard). Older patients in Finland had much higher survival rates than older patients <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> There was a clear difference in the stage distribution <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> between older and younger age groups, with non-localized cases occurring in older age groups. No such difference was noticed in Finland.
