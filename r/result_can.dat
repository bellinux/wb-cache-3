5|$|This {{gravitational}} redshift <b>result</b> <b>can</b> {{be derived from}} the assumptions of special relativity and the equivalence principle; the full theory of general relativity is not required.|$|E
5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, can help determine if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer <b>result</b> <b>can</b> rule out a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Some correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require {{visitors}} to either cut their bras {{and remove the}} underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry.

25|$|Unitary {{representations}} {{are automatically}} semisimple, since Maschke's <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be proven {{by taking the}} orthogonal complement of a subrepresentation.

25|$|An {{operation}} can {{be legal}} in principle, but the <b>result</b> <b>can</b> {{be impossible to}} represent in the specified format, because the exponent is too large or too small to encode in the exponent field.

25|$|Also in the 17th century, Girard Desargues, {{motivated}} by the theory of perspective, introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity.

25|$|Using the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem {{many of the}} {{standard}} elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions.

25|$|A map graph is a graph {{formed from}} {{a set of}} finitely many simply-connected interior-disjoint regions in the plane by {{connecting}} two regions when they share at least one boundary point.

25|$|The {{experiment}} of Frederick Thomas Trouton (1902). A condenser {{was brought}} parallel to Earth's motion, {{and it was}} assumed that momentum is produced when the condenser is charged. The negative <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be explained by Lorentz's theory, according to which the electromagnetic momentum compensates the momentum due to Earth's motion. Lorentz could also show, that the sensitivity of the apparatus was much too low to observe such an effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{classification}} model (classifier or diagnosis) is {{a mapping}} of instances between certain classes/groups. The classifier or diagnosis <b>result</b> <b>can</b> {{be a real}} value (continuous output), {{in which case the}} classifier boundary between classes must be determined by a threshold value (for instance, to determine whether a person has hypertension based on a blood pressure measure). Or it can be a discrete class label, indicating one of the classes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} results obtained for Yang–Mills theory is asymptotic freedom. This <b>result</b> <b>can</b> be obtained by assuming that the coupling constant g is small (so small nonlinearities), as for high energies, and applying perturbation theory. The relevance of this result {{is due to the fact}} that a Yang–Mills theory that describes strong interaction and asymptotic freedom permits proper treatment of experimental results coming from deep inelastic scattering.|$|E
