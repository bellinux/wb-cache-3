Characterizing the color variances between contiguous objects in an image, CVAAO can effectively describe the principal colors and texture {{distribution of the}} image and is insensitive to distortion and scale variations of images. Based on CVAAO, a CVAAO-based image <b>retrieval</b> <b>method</b> is constructed. When given a full image, the CVAAO-based image <b>retrieval</b> <b>method</b> delivers the database images most similar to the full image to the user. This paper also presents a CVAAO-based ROI image <b>retrieval</b> <b>method.</b> When given a clip, the CVAAO-based ROI image <b>retrieval</b> <b>method</b> submits to the user a database image containing a target region most similar to the clip.
