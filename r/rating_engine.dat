40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} enabling charging for composed services comprised of services offered by multiple providers. In the framework <b>rating</b> <b>engines</b> may generate charge information for individual services and provide this {{information upon request}} to other <b>rating</b> <b>engines</b> when these services are used {{as part of a}} composed service. <b>Rating</b> <b>engines</b> additionally employ a two-phase rating process which allows potentially complex business agreements between providers to be reflected in composed service charges. Charges can vary depending on the context in which a service is executed, for example, as part of a composed service which includes services offered by a partner provider. Crucially, the process allows <b>rating</b> <b>engines</b> to calculate these varying charges without having to be manually pre-configured with details of the structure of individual composed services. In the paper we provide an overview of the framework, specifying in detail the rating process and inter-rating engine communications, and describe via an example its deployment in a distributed environment supporting the execution of composed services...|$|R

50|$|Portal Software {{developed}} a billing and revenue software suite (Portal Infranet) primarily targeted at telecommunications companies and ISPs.

In order to address the telecommunications market, Portal software acquired the InteGrate software from Solution42, a German company which had a history in high-performance telecommunications Rating.

In daily life we see applications such as word processors or mail clients; in OSS terms we would regard an application as something such as a CRM component, a billing system or an inventory solution - although we also understand that these can be decomposed to some extent - for example a billing system will include a number of smaller applications, such as a <b>rating</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of various {{compounds}} on the oxidation of butane was proposed to see if any correlation could be found between the thermal behavior of such reactions and the effect of the same compounds when added to fuel used in an octane <b>rating</b> <b>engine.</b> Fuels for internal combustion engines differ markedly {{in the way in which}} they burn within the cylinder. Some burn in such a manner that the engine operates smoothly; others cause what is generally known as knocking. Although a great amount of work has been done investigating this matter and many theories proposed, the exact cause of the knocking is unknown. The work done has been largely of two types: (1) use of knock rating engines and (2) studies of the oxidation of hydrocarbons. A very complete review of the work done and theories proposed has been presented by Davis (3) and Ogilvie (7). Only a very brief discussion of the oxidation of hydrocarbons will be given here.

40|$|Many {{computer}} science researchers are pursuing {{the vision of}} service-oriented software architectures through which end-users can seamlessly access customised, potentially disposable services to aid them carry out a myriad of everyday tasks. Full realisation of this vision requires deployment of facilities for the dynamic discovery, composition, interoperation and execution monitoring of preexisting networked software services, possibly administered by different organisations or originated by multiple developers. Significant research efforts are addressing the development of frameworks and process-oriented techniques for service composition, much of it focussing on specification of services in terms of formal process semantics. Although increasingly powerful methodologies, languages and algorithms supporting the construction, execution and adaptation of dynamically composed services have emerged, {{little attention has been}} paid to the supporting infrastructure necessary for their widespread deployment. In particular, accounting systems target charging of services on a one-by-one basis; they do not consider the possibility that services can be collectively orchestrated in an arbitrary manner to fulfil changing requirements. Existing accounting systems, including their rating engines, typically are manually configured to account for specific services at the time those services are initially deployed. However, in environments where services can be dynamically composed this approach is no longer possible: service compositions are created and executed within a short time span, so there is no time for manual configuration of appropriate accounting operations. Accounting operations must be automatically configured when service compositions are initially constructed, or subsequently modified. In this paper we present a two-phase rating process incorporating an algorithm that generation of charge for dynamically composed services. The algorithm treats composed services as a tree structure in which groups of services comprise a composed service which can itself be part of a group of services comprising a composed service at the next level upwards of the tree. The tree is traversed in a depth first fashion, in order to attribute charges to all composed services. To do so the algorithm calculates changes in charges for those services based on the presence or lack of presence of named services in the group of service comprising that composed service. Application of this algorithm enables the <b>rating</b> <b>engine</b> to generate charges for services that are dynamically composed and for which the <b>rating</b> <b>engine</b> can have no prior knowledge. This method also provides a means to closely map real-world business relationships between service providers to the charges applied when their services are used together...|$|E
