5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants {{were some of the}} most literate in Europe, and consequently had access to the European egalitarian and radical ideas that culminated in the Revolutions of 1848. The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among the disadvantaged, many of whom looked to the U.S. to <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> republican ideals.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E

5|$|During production, Tabata {{and the new}} {{development}} staff used experience from a failed attempt to develop an eighth-generation console sequel to Type-0 when handling the new hardware. While using Luminous Studio for games other than XV was considered during production, the engine's technology manager Julien Merceron advised against it until it has been proven and released in a finished form. While CGI cutscenes created by dedicated Square Enix subsidiary Visual Works were present throughout its lifetime, there were far fewer than originally planned in the final game. The team instead relied on real-time cutscenes as much as possible, except for scenes with a scale too great to use real-time graphics. The transition to next-generation hardware enabled the team to better <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> original vision for the game, as conveyed in the original reveal trailer. Visual Works also {{worked closely with the}} team during development of 3D modelling systems, due to their previous experiences with such technology in cutscene development.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, persistent organic pollutants and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the car, right next to Andy.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging in some respects, and easy in others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
5|$|Development of Silent Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VII {{was officially}} {{announced}} in February 1996. Square {{president and chief}} executive officer Tomoyuki Takechi was fairly confident about Japanese players making the game a commercial success despite it being on a new platform. A playable demo was included on a disc giveaway at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, dubbed Square's Preview Extra: Final Fantasy VII & Siggraph '95 Works. The disc also included the early test footage Square created using characters from Final Fantasy VI. The initial release date was at some point in 1996, but to properly <b>realize</b> <b>their</b> vision, Square postponed the release date almost a full year. Final Fantasy VII was released on January 31, 1997. It was published in Japan by Square. A re-release of the game based on its Western version, titled Final Fantasy VII International, was released on October 2, 1997. This improved International version would kickstart the trend for Square to create an updated version for Japanese release, based on the enhanced Western versions. The International version was re-released as a physical disc as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package on December 18, 2012.|$|E
