50|$|For the coded RF signals, a <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> is utilized. Generally, a <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{a device}} that detects changes of light in {{quantities}} and provides a corresponding output. One application of <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> is the compensated <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> system. This system can control the level of light at a workplace. The ratio of {{the light at the}} <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> to the level of controlled light at the workplace is maintained substantially constant as daylight entering the room varies. In decoding process, a <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> is used to detect the RF signal and then output the decoded signal. In general, the RF signals steamed from electric filters are first converted from binary digit to octal digit(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). The octal signals are then detected by the <b>light</b> <b>sensors.</b> The sensors respond by developing corresponding digital, electrical signals which are hence decoded to apprise the viewer of the transmitted message or are applied to external equipment such as a calculator, a computer, a hard copy machine or other devices appropriate for the particular occasion.|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of {{the capabilities of the}} Mica mote <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> is currently limited. To determine how much information data from the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> reveals about the environment, we performed a series of experiments designed to test the sensitivity of the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> to the time of day, the presence/absence of close objects, and different colors. Measuring the ambient light alone, we discovered that the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> can provide an approximate gauge of the time of day (i. e., morning, noon, evening). Depending on the object size, there is a definite range within which an object’s presence can be detected by the sensor motes. Beyond that range, the object cannot be clearly detected. The <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> can also distinguish between different colored environments. Finally, using a six-sided sensor, we can determine the direction of a light source. We discuss these findings in this paper, as well as the limitations of the mote <b>light</b> <b>sensors.</b> 1...|$|R

He suggested Formula One <b>rain</b> <b>lights</b> provided by McLaren Electronic Systems were brighter than those employed in the World Endurance Championship. Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing <b>rain</b> <b>lights</b> contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing <b>rain</b> <b>lights</b> at the rear of their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Polysomnography (PSG) in {{the home}} has {{advantages}} over in-laboratory PSG, but one important disadvantage is the inability of current devices to record lights off (Loff) and on times and thus important indices such as sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency cannot be determined. This study evaluates {{the characteristics of a}} prototype <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> (Compumedics) used with a portable PSG device (SomtePSG, Compumedics), and its utility {{in the home}} where light conditions are uncontrolled and it is impractical to calibrate the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> to the conditions in each individual home. Methods: Three examples of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> were exposed to incandescent light at a range of controlled light levels to determine their signal characteristics. Twenty-four home PSGs were analysed to explore the characteristics of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> signal in the home. Results: The table below shows the results for the sensor signal characteristics. The <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> allowed a discernable Loff to be identified in 19 of 24 home PSGs, and in these 19, the mean difference between patient reported and <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> Loff was 1. 2 min (SD 16. 6, range - 23 to + 50). Discussion: The <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> signals were found to have good sensitivity and linearity, low drift and record a range of lux appropriate for the home setting. When used in home PSG, these <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> were able to establish Loff in the majority of PSGs. The wide range of differences between patient reported and sensor Loff demonstrates the importance of objective determination of Loff in home PSG, particularly for studies where accurate measurements of Loff dependant indices such as sleep onset latency are needed...|$|R

However, using this technology for dye based <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> in polymer based systems offers several advantages compared to classical devices. A printable <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> could be easily integrated into current smart label fabrication processes. Moreover, printable <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> combined with novel conductive polymers could solve reliability issues resulting from bonding processes. In this paper {{we report on the}} fabrication of dye based <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> using Ruthenium 535 -bis-TBA as active dye and Iodide solution as charge transporting layer. A prototype has been developed and tested successfully. In order to improve the technology towards smart label integration, silica gel has been used to harden the Iodide liquid electrolyte. Depending on the silica gel concentrations, different stiffness levels can be achieved. Whereas the first <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> prototypes have been made on glass substrates, the new ones are based on polymer substrates. The polymer foil KAPTON by Du Pont has been used as substrate. Special care has to be taken regarding the preparation of the transparent electrodes. The transparent conductive oxide (TCO) Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), which has been used as transparent electrode, has to be cured at elevated temperatures. In conclusion we have shown that dye based <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> can be used for the integration into smart labels.

40|$|Abstract. The Spatial Sensitivity Function (SSF) {{is used to}} {{quantify}} a detector’s sensitivity to a spatially-distributed input signal. By weighting the incoming signal with the SSF and integrating, the overall scalar response of the detector can be estimated. This project focuses on estimating the SSF of a <b>light</b> intensity <b>sensor</b> consisting of a photodiode. This <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> has been used previously in the Knuth Cyberphysics Laboratory on a robotic arm that performs its own experiments to locate a white circle in a dark field (Knuth et al., 2007). To use the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> to learn about its surroundings, the robot’s inference software {{must be able to}} model and predict the <b>light</b> <b>sensor’s</b> response to a hypothesized stimulus. Previous models of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> treated it as a point sensor and ignored its spatial characteristics. Here we propose a parametric approach where the SSF is described by a mixture of Gaussians (MOG). By performing controlled calibration experiments with known stimulus inputs, we used nested sampling to estimate the SSF of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> using an MOG model with the number of Gaussians ranging from one to five. By comparing the evidence computed for each MOG model, we found that one Gaussian is sufficient to describe the SSF to the accuracy we require. Future work will involve incorporating this more accurate SSF into the Bayesian machine learning software for the robotic system and studying how this detailed information about the properties of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> will improve robot’s ability to learn...|$|R
40|$|To whom {{has always}} been with me [...] . Personal control with {{occupancy}} and daylight adaptation is considered in a lighting system with multiple luminaires. Each luminaire {{is equipped with a}} co-located occupancy <b>sensor</b> and <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> that respectively provide local occupancy and illumination information to a central controller. Users may also provide control inputs to indicate a desired illuminance value. Using sensor feedback and user input, the central controller determines dimming values of the luminaires using an optimization framework. The cost function consists of a weighted sum of illumination errors at <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> and the power consumption of the system. The optimum dimming values are determined by solving an unconstrained optimization and a constrained optimization. The constrained solution is solved with the constraints that the illuminance value at the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> are above the reference set-point at the <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> and the dimming levels are within physical allowable limits. Different approaches to determine the set-points at <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> associated with multiple user illumination requests are considered. The performance of the proposed controllers is compared with a reference stand-alone controller under different simulation scenarios in an open-plan office lighting system. Table of content...|$|R
