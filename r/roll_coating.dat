40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} study of dynamic wetting in metering and pre-metered forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> shows that the dimensionless applicator flow rate λA, is the key parameter as it defines whether dynamic failure occurs by air entrainment (λA>λA, trans) or cascade (λA< λA, trans). λA, trans is the flow rate when the regime switches from metering to pre-metered and λA, min, the minimum flow rate in the pre-metered regime. When Ca was varied in the range 0. 2 → 5, λA, trans and λA, min were in the range 1. 40 → 1. 29 and 1. 20 → 1. 18 respectively. These values compare very well with theoretical predictions. The air entrainment speeds V*M {{were found to be}} similar to the corresponding speeds V*plunging, measured in plunging tape flow but the cascade speeds V**M can be smaller or larger depending on λA. This led to exploring hydrodynamic assistance and drawing an analogy with curtain coating, which was supported by the data. It was also observed that cascade occurred in the pre-metered regime because the dynamic wetting line XD, moves near the minimum gap position just as in reverse <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b> Indeed the cascade speeds conform to correlations developed for reverse <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b> Finally the study gives data on XD, and compares them with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Gravure <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> is a {{technique}} used to coat fluids {{of a wide range}} of viscosities (up to 1500 mPa s) onto substrates at speeds of up to 900 m/min (Booth, 1970, 1990). Coat thicknesses in the range of less than 1 micron up to 50 microns can be achieved, making this a versatile process which is finding application across a growing number of market sectors. Gravure <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> differs from many of the conventional <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> techniques in that one of the rolls is patterned with a surface engraving (the ‘gravure’ or ‘anilox’ pattern). Both the shape and the size of the gravure pattern can be varied which affects the final properties of the coating. The term ‘gravure roll coating’ covers a number of distinct gravure coating arrangements. Two common variants of these are direct gravure coating and offset gravure coating, see Figure 1. Direct gravure coating is where the fluid transfer takes place directly from the gravure roll to the web, whilst in offset gravure coating, fluid is transferred first from the gravure roll to a smooth deformable roll (often termed the applicator roll), and then from the deformable roll to the web. Whilst both are described as gravure coating processes, the fluid mechanics of these two processes are very different and will be described separately. Gravure ‘coating’ is distinct from gravure ‘printing’ (or roto-gravure), in that gravure coating is designed to give uniform coverage on the substrate whilst gravure printing is designed to print specifi c patterns. The quality of gravure coating can be defi ned in terms of the thickness and variation of the coating, whilst the quality of gravure printing will include quantifi cation of print characteristics such as resolution and edge definition. This article will focus on gravure coating, but many of the emerging markets, for example in the manufacture of electronic products such as solar cells, require both large areas of uniform coating but with good edge definition. This article will first describe the range of gravure cells available and typical manufacturing techniques, together with the important parameters that specify the gravure roller, before describing in more detail the two distinct gravure <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> processes...|$|E

40|$|YesThis {{experimental}} study of forward gravure coating considers the effects of operating variables on air entrainment, ribbing instabilities and {{the thickness of the}} film formed. The data show that this coating method can yield very thin films of thickness of order of 15 - 20 % at most of the equivalent cell depth of a gravure roller. Air free and non ribbed stable uniform films can however only be obtained in a narrow window of operating conditions at very low substrate capillary number (CaS ~ 0. 02) equivalent to substrate speeds typically less than 20 m/min. The paper draws a similarity with flow features observed with smooth forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> and slide coating. It is shown that the onset of ribbing and the flux distribution between the gravure roller and the substrate at the exit of the nip obey approximately the same rules as in smooth forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating,</b> whereas the onset of air entrainment actually corresponds to a low-flow limit of coatability similar to that observed in slide coating...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of a coating operation is to transfer a defect free liquid film onto a continuous substrate {{in order to}} meet the requirements of the final products. Mainly two concerns govern the process. The first concern is the economics of the process and the second concern is the quality of the coated film. The economics of the process are dictated by the speed of coating and the film thickness. Clearly, higher speeds mean better productivity hence less cost of operation and thinner films are desirable because less material is being used. Quality is governed by film uniformity and integrity, indicating that the film will perform as designed. Film defects such as streaks or tiny air bubbles are indication that the film properties are not uniform rendering it unacceptable to customers. One of the most versatile coating systems to achieve thin films at high speeds is reverse <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> which has been used for a long time all over the world. At low speed, typically 1 m/s, this coating operation is inherently stable and with small gaps of order 100 microns can ii lead to film thickness of order 30 - 50 microns. Much research, theoretical and experimental, has been devoted to this coating flow but only at low speeds and for large gaps (> 100 microns). There are no comprehensive data how very thin films, 20 microns and less (particularly lower limits in the region of 5 microns) can be achieved at high speeds, of 2 or more metres per second. This study is concerned precisely with this aim, that of investigating the effect of large speeds and small roller gaps (rollers nearly touching or in elastohydrodynamic contact) to achieve the very thin films desired by modern applications (electronics, medical and others). In order to achieve this aim, a rig was designed and built to enable to understand the effect of various coating conditions and liquid properties on the metered film thickness and coating instability. To achieve thin films at high speeds, small roll gap and low viscosity are needed, however flow instabilities will develop under these conditions. To achieve stable coating window at high speeds high surface tension is needed. It was found that the roll gap and the viscosity have complicated effect on the coating window. In the case of low viscosity liquid (7 mPa. s), small roll gaps are needed, whereas in the case of high viscosity liquid (more than 30 mPa. s), large gaps are needed. It was found that Weber number is better describer for ribbing instability in rigid reverse <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> unlike in rigid forward <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> in which capillary number is the one. In addition the potential of reverse deformable <b>roll</b> <b>coating</b> (rolls in elastohydrodynamic contact) was investigated in order to achieve much thinner films at higher speeds. As a result of the investigation of reverse deformable <b>roll</b> <b>coating,</b> it was found that there is a possibility to get much thinner stable films at much higher speeds compared to reverse rigid <b>roll</b> <b>coating.</b> The liquid transfer from an applicator roller to a PET film was investigated in this study. It was found that air stagnation at downstream meniscus and air entrainment at upstream meniscus depend on the liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension and coating conditions such as web tension and wrap angle of web. As a result, wet film instability also depends on liquid properties and coating conditions. It was found that air stagnation causes streaks on the wet film and air entrainment caused bubbles on the wet film. To get a stable wet film, it was found that suitable viscosity and high surface tension were needed. TOYOB...|$|E
