In 1939, while resident at the Göttingen Observatory, he received his doctorate with a thesis titled Influence of a <b>resisting</b> <b>agent</b> in the dynamics of dense stellar systems (Einfluß eines widerstehenden Mittels in der Dynamik dichter Sternsysteme). He obtained a scholarship to Edinburgh University in Scotland, which was arranged with the help of British theoretical cosmologist Dr George C. McVittie, which was due to start in 1 October 1939 but which had to be cancelled because of the start of World War II in September 1939. On 1 May 1940 he started work at Hamburg Observatory, but later in that year was drafted into the Signal Corps (Nachrichtentruppe). On 15 May 1941 he was posted to Inspektorate 7, the cipher bureau of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) high command, although as an astronomer he knew nothing about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Professor Otto Heckmann, director of the Hamburg Observatory, tried to lure him back to continue working on problems specifically related to war work that he had been occupied with before he was drafted: tables of air and ship navigation, aerodynamic problems for aeroplanes traveling at speeds over 1300 km/hour as well as rockets flying at speeds of more than 3000 km/hour. These were purely solutions to differential equations which were allocated to various institutions for solving.|$|E
40|$|Diagonal grids {{are one of}} the {{commonly}} used structural forms. Roof and floor system bridge ship decks, elevated highway and raft foundations are examples of structures for which diagonal grids may provide suitable solutions. Diagonal grids belong to a family of flat grids and their structural behaviour, like that of all flat grids, is mainly governed by bending. The members of a diagonal grid, therefore, essentially work in bending and their flexural rigidity is the main load <b>resisting</b> <b>agent.</b> Another two types of rigidities affecting the behaviour of flat grids are toroional and shearing rigidities. The nature of the effects of those rigidities, however, have not, in the past, been clearly understood and their importance has boon usually underestimated. This thesis presents an attempt to study the effects of these rigidities on the magnitudes and distribution of internal forces and displacements in diagonal grids. The material of the thesis is arranged in the following manner: The preliminary definitions and relations and the background to the subject are given in chapter one. Chapter two contains a description of the work involved in the analysis and the results of the analysis {{of a large number of}} diagonal grids. The conclusions obtained from these analytical, results are given in chapter five. An account of the experimental investigations is given in chapter four. In chapter three, the concept of vector and matrix norms is employed to develop an original technique which is used to estimate the changes in the internal forces and displacements of flat grids due to variations in the torsional or shearing rigidities. Furthermore. it is shown that the scope of this technique is not confined to the matter under consideration and the idea may be applied to many other problems of structural analysis. In particular, subject to the conditions described in the text, the technique will provide a new and powerful means for structural optimization processes and it may even find uses in disciplines other than structural analysis...|$|E

Fifty percent lethality 2 days postirradiation (LD 50 / 2) in wild-type 1 -day-old adult fruit flies was 1238 Gy for males and 1339 Gy for females. We ob-served a significant age-dependent decline in the radiation re-sistance of both males and females. Radiation damage is pos-tulated to occur by the generation of oxygen radicals.

40|$|Both chronic {{and acute}} dermal wounds are {{susceptible}} to infection due to sterile loss of the innate barrier function of the skin and dermal appendages, facilitating the development of microbial communities, referred to as biofilms, within the wound environment.

The aim of this review {{is to provide a}} summary of published papers detailing biofilms in wounds, the effect they have on infection and wound healing, and detailing methods employed for their detection. The studies highlighted within this paper provide evidence that biofilms reside within the chronic wound and represent an important mechanism underlying the observed, delayed healing and infection. The reasons for this include both protease activity and immunological suppression. Furthermore, a lack of responsiveness to an array of antimicrobial agents has been due to the biofilms’ ability to inherently <b>resist</b> antimicrobial <b>agents.</b> It is imperative that effective strategies are developed, tested prospectively, and employed in chronic wounds to support the healing process and to reduce infection rates.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa is {{a common}} cause of chronic airway infections in individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis (CF). After prolonged colonization of the CF lung, P. aeruginosa becomes highly resistant to host clearance and antibiotic treatment; therefore, understanding how this bacterium evolves during chronic infection is important for identifying beneficial adaptations that could be targeted therapeutically. To identify potential adaptive traits of P. aeruginosa during chronic infection, we carried out global transcriptomic profiling of chronological clonal isolates obtained from 3 individuals with CF. Isolates were collected sequentially over periods ranging from 3 months to 8 years, representing up to 39, 000 in vivo generations. We identified 24 genes that were commonly regulated by all 3 P. aeruginosa lineages, including several genes encoding traits previously shown to be important for in vivo growth. Our results reveal that parallel evolution occurs in the CF lung and that at least a proportion of the traits identified are beneficial for P. aeruginosa chronic colonization of the CF lung. IMPORTANCE Deadly diseases like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis {{are the result of}} long-term chronic infections. Pathogens that cause chronic infections adapt to the host environment, avoiding the immune response and <b>resisting</b> antimicrobial <b>agents.</b> Studies of pathogen adaptation are therefore important for understanding how the efficacy of current therapeutics may change upon prolonged infection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative {{bacterium}} that causes melioidosis, {{was reported to}} produce biofilm. As the disease causes high relapse rate {{when compared to other}} bacterial infections, it therefore might be due to the reactivation of the biofilm forming bacteria which also provided resistance to antimicrobial agents. However, the mechanism on how biofilm can provide tolerance to antimicrobials is still unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The change in resistance of B. pseudomallei to doxycycline, ceftazidime, imipenem, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole during biofilm formation were measured as minimum biofilm elimination concentration (MBEC) in 50 soil and clinical isolates and also in capsule, flagellin, LPS and biofilm mutants. Almost all planktonic isolates were susceptible to all agents studied. In contrast, when they were grown in the condition that induced biofilm formation, they were markedly resistant to all antimicrobial agents even though the amount of biofilm production was not the same. The capsule and O-side chains of LPS mutants had no effect on biofilm formation whereas the flagellin-defective mutant markedly reduced in biofilm production. No alteration of LPS profiles was observed when susceptible form was changed to resistance. The higher amount of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) was detected in the high biofilm-producing isolates. Interestingly, the biofilm mutant which produced a very low amount of biofilm and was sensitive to antimicrobial <b>agents</b> significantly <b>resisted</b> those <b>agents</b> when grown in biofilm inducing condition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The possible drug resistance mechanism of biofilm mutants and other isolates is not by having biofilm but rather from some factors that up-regulated when biofilm formation genes were stimulated. The understanding of genes related to this situation may lead us to prevent B. pseudomallei biofilms leading to the relapse of melioidosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of antibiotic resistant bacteria motivates prospective research towards discovery of new antimicrobial active substances. There are, however, controversies concerning the cost-effectiveness of such research {{with regards to the}} description of new substances with novel cellular interactions, or description of new uses of existing substances to overcome resistance. Although examination of bacteria isolated from remote locations with limited exposure to humans has revealed an absence of antibiotic resistance genes, it is accepted that antibiotic resistance genes were both abundant and diverse in ancient living organisms, as detected in DNA recovered from Pleistocene deposits (30, 000 years ago). Indeed, even before the first clinical use of antibiotics more than 60 years ago, resistant organisms had been isolated. Bacteria can exhibit different strategies for resistance against antibiotics. New genetic information may lead to the modification of protein structure affecting the antibiotic carriage into the cell, enzymatic inactivation of drugs, or even modification of cellular structure interfering in the drug-bacteria interaction. There are still plenty of new genes out there in the environment that can be appropriated by putative pathogenic bacteria to <b>resist</b> antimicrobial <b>agents.</b> On the other hand, there are compounds with antibiotic activity just waiting to be discovered. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are molecules which are wide-spread in all forms of life, from multi-cellular organisms to bacterial cells used to interfere with microbial growth.

Bone marrow adherent cell types, collectively referred to as stromal cells, appear to be key players in such escape, mainly because CLL malignant cells, which rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis when cultured in vitro, survive, migrate, and <b>resist</b> cytotoxic <b>agents</b> in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. CLL displays variable clinical courses according to well-defined prognostic factors induced on malignant B-cells (CLL cells) or expressed by the transformed bone marrow stromal microenvironment. Particularly, a critical pathogenic role is played by proinflammatory factors, adhesion molecules, and signaling molecules involved in cell fate and stemness, such as Notch, Wnt, sonic Hedgehog, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), protein kinase B (Akt), and the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) family of regulator proteins. As herein discussed, these molecules probably form a complex network favoring CLL cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance to anticancer therapy. Characterizing the sets of signaling pathways involved in the interactions between stromal cells and CLL cells may provide new tools for CLL clinical phenotyping and for re-sensitizing chemotherapy resistant cells.

40|$|Viroids {{are small}} "naked" {{infectious}} RNA molecules that are pathogens of higher plants. The {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTV) {{is composed of}} a covalently closed circular RNA molecule containing 359 ribonucleotides. The properties of PSTV were compared with those of the scrapie agent, which causes a degenerative neurological disease in animals. PSTV was inactivated by ribonuclease digestion, psoralen photoadduct formation, Zn 2 + -catalyzed hydrolysis, and chemical modification with NH 2 OH. The scrapie <b>agent</b> <b>resisted</b> inactivation by these procedures, which modify nucleic acids. The scrapie agent was inactivated by proteinase K and trypsin digestion, chemical modification with diethylpyrocarbonate, and by exposure to phenol, NaDodSO 4, KSCN, or urea. PSTV resisted inactivation by these procedures, which modify proteins. Earlier evidence suggested that the scrapie agent is smaller than PSTV. Its small size seems to preclude the presence of a genome coding for the protein(s) of a putative capsid. The properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from both viroids and viruses and have prompted the introduction of the term "prion" to denote a small proteinaceous infectious particle that resists inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the renewed {{interest}} in cultural heritage has encouraged researchers in various disciplines to study the technical properties of natural construction materials and the causes, processes and effects of weathering on exposed stone surfaces. For the ready availability, good workability and aesthetic and physicalmechanical characteristics of the many different varieties, calcarenite rocks have always been used with loadbearing and decorative functions, both for constructions of historic and architectonic interest, and in more basic buildings. The durability of these rocks, defined as the property of natural building stone to <b>resist</b> the weathering <b>agents</b> {{in the course of}} time and conserve its appearance and characteristics of strength, is however not the same in the different varieties, being controlled strongly by depositional fabric and diagenetic processes. In this context, the comparison between the analysis of the microfacies, decay patterns and physical-mechanical characters of different fresh and weathered varieties has made it possible to elaborate some considerations on the relations between fabric and technical properties of calcarenites and to evaluate qualitatively the effect of individual textural elements on the response of the stone to the weathering action...|$|R
30|$|Despite these {{differences}} between SBcas 3.3 and KP- 43, easily explainable by the their low similarity (33 % identity, 49 % similarity), these proteins share several features {{in addition to}} the fact that they are produced as large precursors with N-ter parts playing the role of intramolecular chaperones. Both SBcas 3.3 and KP- 43 have a preference for an alkaline pH (optimum: respectively 9 – 10 and 11 – 12) and for relatively high temperatures (optimum: respectively 50 and 60 °C). Interestingly, SBcas 3.3 is also highly resistant to the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. Most subtilisin-like proteases are rapidly inactivated in the presence of 50 mM H 2 O 2 (1.7 g/l), notably because of oxidation of a conserved methionine residue adjacent to the catalytic serine (Nonaka et al. 2004). Though SBcas 3.3 contains this conserved methionine, it resists H 2 O 2 concentrations much higher than 50 mM, and its activity is even enhanced up to 10 g/l H 2 O 2 (0.29 M), in contrast to other oxidant-stable proteases such as AprX from Virgibacillus sp. SK 37 (Phrommao et al. 2011). The ability to <b>resist</b> oxidizing <b>agents</b> is particularly sought in the detergent industry, which uses oxidants as bleaching agents in an increasing number of products. Several proteases currently used have been genetically engineered to meet this performance requirement, but results are not entirely satisfactory and better enzymes are still sought (Maurer 2004). Though SBcas 3.3 meets almost all the requirements for this particular application of proteases (temperature and pH preferences, oxidant stability, detergent resistance), its strict calcium dependence is incompatible with use in most current bleach-based detergents, as these generally contain chelating agents to improve the efficiency of anionic detergents. Crystallographic analysis of SBcas 3.3 will help understand the determinants of its marked resistance to detergents, denaturing agents, and oxidants, and should be a useful tool for the rational design of a new protein with a minimized calcium requirement.|$|R

Aquaculture is the world worth coming expansion to compensate the shortage in animal protein. Feed in aquaculture {{plays an important role in}} the production cycle and exert threshold on both practical and economic aspects. Feed additive sectors are expanding day after day to achieve better growth and health for fish and shrimp and to meet the potential requirements of the culturists. Probiotic proved its successes in human and animal feeding practices and recently gained attention in aquaculture; it has beneficial effects in diseases control and competes with various environmental stressors as well as to promote the growth of the cultured organisms. Probiotics have the privilege to manipulate the non-specific innate immunity among fishes, hence help them into <b>resist</b> many pathogenic <b>agents</b> and are actively used worldwide. The present review is an informative compilation of the probiotics, their mode of action and their useful effects on fishes.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{insightful}} work in {{the political economy of}} the world-system area has been produced by researchers whose extensive fieldwork offers them deep familiarity with people and locales. Few other methods are as useful to understand the impacts of structural change on daily life and the ways <b>agents</b> <b>resist,</b> alter, and shape emerging structures. Yet such structural fieldwork is marginalized by the over-reliance of pedagogical materials on social constructionist, social psychological, or interactionist perspectives and also in world-systems research and writing by the privileging of long durée historical or quantitative cross-national methods. This paper introduces the concept of structural fieldwork to describe a qualitative field methodology in which the researcher is self-consciously guided by considerations emerging out of macro-sociological theories. We identify four advantages of structural fieldwork: the illumination of powers multiple dimensions; examination of agency and its boundaries or limitations within broad political and economic structures; attention to nuances of change and durability, spatial and temporal specificities, and processes of change and durability; and challenging and extending social theory. These advantages are illustrated in select examples from existing literature and by discussion of the two authors fieldwork-based research. The paper concludes that explicit attention to fieldwork may strengthen political economy and world-systems research and also de-marginalize political economy informed by structural fieldwork...|$|R
