50|$|After a {{successful}} launch and orbit, the space capsule has a warning light indicating {{a heat shield}} problem. Mission control decides to land it after three orbits instead of seven. Katherine understands the situation and concurs that they should leave the <b>retro-rocket</b> attached to heat shield for reentry to which Harrison agrees immediately.

5000|$|In practice, this is {{accomplished}} by matching {{the rotation of the}} surface below, by reaching a particular altitude where the orbital speed almost matches the rotation below, in an equatorial orbit. As the speed decreases slowly, then an additional boost would be needed to increase the speed back to a matching speed, or a <b>retro-rocket</b> could be fired to slow the speed when too fast.|$|E
50|$|In March 1964, the DMSP program office {{approved}} {{plans to}} develop a more powerful Thor Burner 2 launch vehicle. Burner 2 used a Thiokol Star 37B motor (TE-M-364-2). Star 37, from which Star 37B was derived, had originally been developed {{to serve as the}} Surveyor lunar lander <b>retro-rocket.</b> Star 37B weighed 718 kg loaded and produced about 4.59 tonnes of thrust for 42 seconds. The Burner 2 stage was fitted with 3-axis control by Boeing, allowing it to coast without spin stabilization after separating from Thor.|$|E
50|$|On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard {{became the}} first American in space, {{launched}} in a ballistic trajectory on Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7. Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin, {{he was the first}} person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft's attitude and <b>retro-rocket</b> firing. After his successful return, Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
50|$|Finally {{the last}} day of the mission arrived and the crew stored {{everything}} for reentry. The <b>retro-rockets</b> worked perfectly after 14 days in space. They landed within 6.4 nmi km of the targeted landing point.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second stage}} {{propellant}} tanks were lengthened for longer burn time and unnecessary vernier engines and <b>retro-rockets</b> were removed. Because {{the second stage}} engine had had issues with combustion instability, it was equipped with baffled injectors.|$|R
50|$|The Mars 2 descent module {{was mounted}} on the bus/orbiter {{opposite}} the propulsion system. It consisted of a spherical 1.2 m diameter landing capsule, a 2.9 m diameter conical aerodynamic braking shield, a parachute system and <b>retro-rockets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Propulsion for midcourse {{maneuvers}} was {{supplied by}} a monopropellant (anhydrous hydrazine) 225 N <b>retro-rocket.</b> The hydrazine was ignited using nitrogen tetroxide and aluminium oxide pellets, and thrust direction {{was controlled by}} four jet vanes situated below the thrust chamber. Attitude control with a 1 degree pointing error was maintained by a system of nitrogen gas jets. The Sun and Earth were used as references for attitude stabilization. Overall timing and control was performed by a digital Central Computer and Sequencer. Thermal control was achieved {{through the use of}} passive reflecting and absorbing surfaces, thermal shields, and movable louvers.|$|E

50|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which {{employed a}} scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer {{mounted on a}} 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50-milliwatt transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and 6 silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed {{to land on the}} Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the <b>retro-rocket.</b>|$|E

50|$|In space, solarnauts Harris, Asher and Camp fire {{a smaller}} probe through a {{prominence}} and succeed in capturing fragments of matter. However, {{by the time}} that the probe docks with the main module, the ever-intensifying solar radiation has caused Sun Probes <b>retro-rockets</b> to fail, locking the craft in a collision course with the Sun.|$|R
50|$|The {{possibility}} that the perchlorate was a contaminant brought from Earth has been eliminated by several lines of evidence. The Phoenix <b>retro-rockets</b> used ultra pure hydrazine and launch propellants consisted of ammonium perchlorate. Sensors on board Phoenix found no traces of ammonium, and thus the perchlorate in the quantities present in all three soil samples is indigenous to the Martian soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus included: (1) a vidicon television camera, which {{employed a}} scan mechanism that yielded one complete frame in 10 s; (2) a gamma-ray spectrometer in a 300 mm sphere {{mounted on a}} 1.8 m boom; (3) a radar altimeter; and (4) a seismometer to be rough-landed on the lunar surface. The seismometer was encased in the lunar capsule along with an amplifier, a 50 mW transmitter, voltage control, a turnstile antenna, and six silver-cadmium batteries capable of operating the lunar capsule transmitter for 30 days, all designed {{to land on the}} Moon at 130 to 160 km/h (80 to 100 mph). The instrument package floated in a layer of freon within the balsawood sphere. The radar altimeter would be used for reflectivity studies, but was also designed to initiate capsule separation and ignite the <b>retro-rocket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Magnesium-thorium alloys {{have been}} used in several {{military}} applications, particularly in missile construction. The most noted example of this is the ramjet components in the CIM-10 Bomarc missile and Lockheed D-21 drone, which implemented thoriated magnesium in their engine construction. This is due to thoriated magnesium alloys being lightweight, having high strength, and creep resistance up to 350 Â°C. But, these alloys are no longer used due to radiation concerns involving thorium's radioactivity. This has resulted in several missiles being removed from public display. Similarly, the structure of the Equipment and <b>Retro-Rocket</b> Modules of the Gemini spacecraft (the white-painted portions) were made of thoriated magnesium for their strength-to-weight ratio and thermal properties. These were not part of the inhabited cabin, though the radiator tubing, whose silicone coolant flowed through the cabin, was also made of the same material. All examples burned up in the atmosphere upon reentry.|$|E
50|$|The Voskhod {{spacecraft}} {{were basically}} Vostok spacecraft with a backup, solid-fuel <b>retro-rocket</b> added {{onto the top}} of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok cosmonaut's position. Because of the cramped conditions, the cosmonauts also had to go on a diet to fit in their couches. A solid-fuel braking rocket was also added to the space capsule's parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok space capsule, no ejection seats were fitted in the Voskhod; the cosmonauts had to land inside the descent module. Aside from that, the Vostok booster had lacked sufficient payload capacity to support the extra weight of a retrorocket package, however the larger upper stage used on the 11A57 launch vehicle meant that this was no longer an issue. As there was no launch escape system, the mission could not be aborted until three minutes after liftoff when the payload shroud was jettisoned and so a low-altitude booster accident would have meant the loss of the crew. As the cosmonauts rode the gantry elevator to {{the top of the}} launch vehicle, they could look across the steppe which was strewn with debris from previous failed R-7 launches, a grim reminder of what could potentially happen on their flight.|$|E
25|$|Star Fox {{possesses}} certain unique {{elements that}} differentiate {{it from the}} standard scrolling shooter. Most scrolling shooters force the player forward at a constant speed. While this is also true for Star Fox, there are thrusters and <b>retro-rockets</b> on the Arwing that allow the player to temporarily speed up and slow down. These {{can be used to}} maneuver around enemy attacks and other obstacles.|$|R
50|$|The {{physics of}} tidal forces are explained, and the {{possibilities}} of orbital tethers to accelerate payloads into higher orbits (or indeed de-orbit shuttles without <b>retro-rockets)</b> are woven into a hard science fiction thriller.

40|$|The {{development}} is described of an interface, the Titan Payload Adapter (TPA), between a Space Transportation System (STS) deployable payload and an expendable launch vehicle (ELV). Separate ascent and separation constraint systems allow a payload with integral trunnions {{to retain its}} originally designed, boost-phase load structure, yet also allow the expendable booster vehicle to separate from the payload via <b>retro-rockets.</b> Design requirements as well as development problems and their solutions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} drag and aerodynamic heating to the spacecraft during Jovian aerocapture have been conducted.

The results show the estimated heat loads could be within allowable heat load when proper ablation heat shield technique is applied. Also, the results shows Jovian aerocapture could save total mass of spacecraft or could increase payload of spacecraft compared with <b>retro-rocket</b> blowing for space flight to Jupiter...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to answer}} basic {{questions}} regarding {{the origin of the}} Solar System will motivate robotic sample return missions to destinations like Pluto, its satellite Charon, and objects in the Kuiper belt. To keep the mission duration short enough to be of interest, sample return from objects farther out in the Solar System requires increasingly higher return velocities. A sample return mission involves several complicated steps to reach an object and obtain a sample, but only the interplanetary return phase of the mission is addressed in this paper. Radioisotope electric propulsion is explored in this parametric study as a means to propel small, dedicated return vehicles for transferring kilogram-size samples from deep space to Earth. Return times for both Earth orbital rendezvous and faster, direct atmospheric re-entry trajectories are calculated for objects as far away as 100 AU. Chemical <b>retro-rocket</b> braking at Earth is compared to radioisotope electric propulsion but the limited deceleration capability of chemical rockets forces the return trajectories to be much slower...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In January, 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission landed two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, on {{the surface}} of Mars. Several {{autonomous}} navigation capabilities were employed in space {{for the first time in}} this mission. In the Entry, Descent, and Land-ing (EDL) phase, both landers used a vision system called the Descent Image Motion Esti-mation System (DIMES) to estimate horizontal velocity during the last 2000 meters (m) of descent, by tracking features on the ground with a downlooking camera, in order to control <b>retro-rocket</b> firing to reduce horizontal velocity before impact. During surface operations, the rovers navigate autonomously using stereo vision for local terrain mapping and a local, reactive planning algorithm called Grid-based Estimation of Surface Traversability Applied to Local Terrain (GESTALT) for obstacle avoidance. In areas of high slip, stereo vision-based visual odometry has been used to estimate rover motion. As of mid-June, Spirit had traversed 3405 m, of which 1253 m were done autonomously; Opportunity had traversed 1264 m, of which 224 m were autonomous. These results have contributed substantially to the success of the mission and paved the way for increased levels of autonomy in future missions. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} three innovative concepts for {{a mobile}} lunar base. These concept combine design research for habitat architecture, mobility systems, habitability, radiation protection, human factors, and {{living and working}} environments on the lunar surface. The mobile lunar base presents several key advantages over conventional static base notions. These advantages concern landing zone safety, the requirement to move modules over the lunar surface, {{and the ability to}} stage mobile reconnaissance with effective systemic redundancy. All of these concerns lead to the consideration of a mobile walking habitat module and base design. The key issues involve landing zone safety, the ability to transport habitat modules across the surface, and providing reliability and redundancy to exploration traverses in pressurized vehicles. With self-ambulating lunar base modules, it will be feasible to have each module separate itself from its <b>retro-rocket</b> thruster unit, and walk five to ten km away from the LZ to a pre-selected site. These mobile modules can operate in an autonomous or teleoperated mode to navigate the lunar surface. At the site of the base, the mobile modules can combine together; make pressure port connections among themselves, to create a multi-module pressurized lunar base...|$|E
