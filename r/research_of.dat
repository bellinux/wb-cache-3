5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported <b>research</b> <b>of</b> the mechanics of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E
5|$|An {{explanation}} {{put forward}} by the Russian Government appeared {{to be that the}} deaths of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya were intended to embarrass President Putin.

5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the <b>research</b> <b>of</b> Schaefer at General Electric, {{the concept}} of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes {{gathered}} momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal {{was to try to}} weaken hurricanes.|$|E
