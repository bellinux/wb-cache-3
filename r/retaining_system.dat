50|$|The first {{application}} of soil nailing was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near Versailles, France. Soil nails {{were used to}} stabilize an 18 m high slope consisting of sandy soil. This method {{proved to be more}} cost-effective, {{while at the same time}} cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods. Germany was the next country to investigate soil nailing. From 1975 to 1981 the University of Karlsruhe and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program. This program conducted full scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design. The United States first used soil nailing in 1976 for the support of a 13.7 m deep foundation excavation in dense silty sands. Soil nailing was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. This <b>retaining</b> <b>system</b> was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.|$|E

5000|$|In 1970, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} announcement of System/370, {{the next generation of}} mainframes after System/360, a new system was announced, called RETAIN/370. This system was designed for use by special Technical Support Centers located in regional centers, rather than by the branch office. This new system was designed to support display terminals, rather than the old typewriter-based ones. A special version of the 2915 display, originally designed for the airline reservations systems, such as SABRE, was used. The 2915 was a small keyboard-display driven by a large electronic controller and data interchange unit, the IBM 2948. Each 2948 supported up to 31 display terminals, which had to be located within a few hundred feet. The cost of this display system, with its large controller, prevented the 2915 terminals from being utilized in branch offices. Thus, the use of regional support centers for this <b>system.</b> The older <b>RETAIN</b> <b>system</b> continued to be used for several years afterwards, running in parallel with RETAIN/370, still providing direct support to branch-office terminals.
