They {{were among the first}} open lesbians to appear on television in the US, and debated long-held stereotypes about gays with Susskind. A week after her appearance on the David Susskind Show, a middle-aged couple approached Gittings in the supermarket to claim, [...] "You made me <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> gay people love each other just the way Arnold and I do." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Reed, {{a friend}} of the band, set up the drums and {{lighting}} when touring with the band. Reed's father, Lawrence R. Reed drew the Minotaur with a sword on the album's cover. Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was taken}} by surprise," [...] Sir Allan continued. [...] "Since you left me I have been picturing all manner of horrible things. Have <b>you</b> fully <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may be arrested at any moment on this frightful charge?" ...|$|R
500|$|VH1 named [...] "Vision of Love" [...] the 14th {{greatest}} {{song of the}} 1990s. About.com ranked it fourth on its top ten pop hits of 1990 {{list and}} 28th on its top 100 pop songs of the 1990s list. Entertainment Weekly included it on their [...] "10 Great (and 10 Grating) Karaoke Songs" [...] list as a grating karaoke song, saying: [...] "You cannot do this song. Seriously. Tackling this lung-crusher might seem like a fun challenge, but three minutes, five octaves, and one 10-second note later, you will <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did not conquer 'Vision of Love.' 'Vision of Love' conquered you." [...] USA Today critic Elysa Gardner picked [...] "Vision of Love" [...] {{as one of the}} most intriguing tracks, saying that it is still Mariah's best song. T. Field and a research team discovered that [...] "Vision of Love" [...] is one of the songs that has physiological and biochemical effects on depressed female adolescents. R singer Beyoncé said that she began doing vocal [...] "runs" [...] after listening to [...] "Vision of Love" [...] for the first time. Similarly, pop singers Rihanna and Christina Aguilera cited the song and Carey as big influences in her career as a singer. In an interview during the early stages of her career, Aguilera said [...] "I've totally looked up to Mariah since 'Vision of Love' came out." [...] Kelly Clarkson also cited [...] "Vision of Love" [...] as an influence on her singing career after performing the song on her first choir solo performance as a kid.|$|E
500|$|Graduation {{opens on}} a sparse note with [...] "Good Morning", {{beginning}} with an echoed, metronomic cowbell beat and a thumping bassline melded with a simple, arpeggiating synthesizer drone. The drone is drowned {{by the music}} that arrives at the chorus, which is a conflation of ambient synths and an astral backing choir crafted from a non-verbal vocal sample of [...] "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" [...] by Elton John. [...] "Good Morning" [...] eventually concludes with the voice of Jay-Z reiterating lyrics from [...] "The Ruler's Back", the rapper's own opening track of his sixth studio album The Blueprint. The production for [...] "Champion" [...] features intermittent drops and 808-handclaps and expresses a slight jazz-rock influence, eschewing guitars and trumpets in favor of breezy synths. During the verses, West raps over a constant loop of the words [...] "their eyes" [...] while the chopped-up hook is formed from the question, [...] "Did you <b>realize,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a champion?" [...] Both phrases are recontextualized from a line lifted from [...] "Kid Charlemagne" [...] by Steely Dan. The song also sports a reggae-inspired bridge delivered by Connie Mitchell in a distinct toasting vocal style. The soul-fired track [...] "I Wonder" [...] starts off with its piano-based refrain, which contains samples of [...] "My Song" [...] by British poet Labi Siffre. It then proceeds to morph into a myriad of interlaced synths that are impacted by distorted snare drum strokes and ethereal electronic keyboards. During the bridge, the chord progression changes and the song adopts a heavy string section that emulates the melody of its synths. The composition then enters an instrumental passage and finishes off with a sweeping string arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Revolutionary {{pamphlets}} {{littered the}} streets of the city. One called [...] "Russia Did It" [...] proclaimed: [...] "The Russians have shown you the way out. What {{are you going to do}} about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up, <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and the boss have nothing in common, that the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers, must take over the control of your jobs, and through them, the control over your lives instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week, so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil.|$|E
50|$|The show {{is based}} on H.G. Wells's novel Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul. Steele played Arthur Kipps, an orphan who {{unexpectedly}} inherits a fortune, and climbs the social ladder before losing everything and <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> just can't buy happiness.|$|R
50|$|According to Amy, {{the song}} was {{inspired}} {{as a result of}} a long-distance relationship breakup. To her the song is about <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are better off moving on from a lost relationship, letting go of what you don't need and standing on your own two feet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} not heavily promoted, and Hayden did not {{undertake}} an extensive concert tour to support it.

2500|$|In 1947, Soros {{immigrated to}} England {{and became a}} student at the London School of Economics. While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} £40 from a Quaker charity. In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, [...] "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew how to make money?" [...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank." [...] That job was an entry-level position in Singer & Friedlander.|$|E
2500|$|... "Better on the Other Side" [...] is a pop-ballad {{song that}} is four minutes thirty-six seconds long. The songs lyrics {{pertain to the}} {{influence}} of Jackson and his worldwide appeal and effect, as well as reflecting on their own personal memories of Jackson. The song instruments include a piano and a bass drop. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] opens with a piano-accompanied soundscape starts off with Diddy [...] "testifying" [...] about Jackson's influence with the lyrics, [...] "I believed I can do anything," [...] he says. [...] "You made the world dance. You made the music come to life." [...] Then a [...] "thunderous bass drops" [...] in, led by Brown's vocals on the chorus, [...] "This the type of song that makes the angels cry/ Look up in the sky and I wonder why/ Why you had to go, go/ I know it's better on the other side." [...] The song concludes with one last statement from Diddy, [...] "People can say what they want about you. We gonna remember the miracles that you showed us. Through your music, through your dance. You were the one that made us <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the world. Through us your legacy lives on, Mike Jackson." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{journalist}} Carlos Lozada {{wrote in}} a review that on reading the book, it was [...] "striking to see the full argument unfold and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't {{have to be a}} zealot to imagine some version of it happening". He concluded: [...] "Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. It may be too late." [...] Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the London Evening Standard writing: [...] "His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more." [...] New York Journal of Books contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: [...] "The Case for Impeachment is a good backdrop for conversations that will likely remain a part of our national dialogue for some time – or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought." [...] AM Joy host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a [...] "fascinating book," [...] particularly because Lichtman {{had been one of the}} only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election. Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe called the book [...] "liberal catnip".|$|E
5000|$|Barenaked Ladies frontman, Ed Robertson {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "Say What You Want is a celebration of letting go. It’s about feeling confident, and <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can’t control what other people do or say, you can only control how you react to it. It’s a very triumphant song for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was very}} {{sensible}} of you," [...] she declared knocking the ash from her cigarette. [...] "There is no use wearing oneself out fighting a hopeless battle. <b>You</b> know now <b>that</b> {{there are things}} in life which {{are not to be}} found in your passionless corner among the hills. <b>You</b> have <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe a duty to yourself." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{high cost}} of Titanic's set made it {{impossible}} for the show to have traditional out of town tryouts. [...] Titanic opened at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1997 to mixed reviews. The New Yorker's was a positive assessment from the New York press: [...] "It seemed a foregone conclusion that the show would be a failure; a musical about history's most tragic maiden voyage, in which fifteen hundred people lost their lives, was obviously preposterous.... Astonishingly, Titanic manages to be grave and entertaining, somber and joyful; little by little you <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{in the presence of a}} genuine addition to American musical theatre." [...] The show was championed by Rosie O'Donnell, who talked about the show daily on her television show, inviting the cast to perform musical numbers and giving theatre tickets to the members of her studio audiences. This publicity, along with the show's strong showing at the Tony Awards, sweeping all five categories in which it was nominated including Best Score, Best Book, and Best Musical, enabled it to outlast its competition. [...] It ran for 804 performances and 26 previews, toured America for three years, and has had national and international productions ever since. The most recent 2013 Southwark Theatre production in London swept all the Off-West End Awards as Best Musical Production.|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} his mother just now," [...] admonished the coroner. [...] "We want your {{statement}} first. You <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are on oath?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I saw <b>you</b> I <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were willing}} to forgive me; <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were coming to say so; that no thought of {{lowering}} me first was in your mind; that yours was a love above the littleness of ordinary people: and the adorableness of it filled me with a glorious joy; I saw in that moment what woman in her highest development is capable of, and that the noblest is the most womanly." ...|$|R
2500|$|Grohl {{stated that}} it was [...] "a song about <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are the source of}} all of the {{problems}} in a relationship and you love the other person so much, you want to free them of the problem, which is actually yourself. It was a riff that turned into another riff that turned into another riff and ended up being a nice little power punk song." ...|$|R
6000|$|Breckenridge considered. [...] "No, sir. The one man I am bitter against is Clavering. Now, it {{may sound}} presumptuous, and not come very well from me, but I believe that Clavering, for his own purposes, forced your hand, and I had a certain respect for you, if only because of your thoroughness. You see, one can't help <b>realizing</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can look at every {{question}} quite differently." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{everybody}} knows you, my dear," [...] said the Fox-King. [...] "Don't you <b>realize</b> <b>that?</b> <b>You</b> are quite an important personage since Princess Ozma of Oz made you her friend." ...|$|E

5000|$|Life's Too Good was {{released}} to largely positive reviews, receiving acclaim from the British and American press. John Dougan of AllMusic praised Björk's vocals, and considered that the album [...] "lived {{up to all}} the advance hype." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice wrote that the band's [...] "sense of mischief isn't just playful—it's experimental and a little wicked. It's also so imperfectly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to infer it out from underneath their breathy swoops, willful shifts and starts, and translated lyrics--so imperfectly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> most of their fans, critics included, barely notice it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To {{warn you}} of your danger. I'm {{something}} of a hard proposition myself, but I don't believe in killing people... that is, unnecessarily.
