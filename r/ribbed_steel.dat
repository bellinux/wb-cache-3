Nine beams {{strengthened}} with helical <b>rib</b> <b>steel</b> wire near-surface mounted(NSM) in {{the concrete}} cover under monotonous loads are tested, and cyclic loading, security, delay and bending deformation of reinforced concrete beams are systematically studied.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} 13 beams with nonprestressed and prestressed helical <b>rib</b> <b>steel</b> wire bonded in sawed grooves {{in the concrete}} cover under monotonous loads based {{on the lack of}} old strengthening methods. The prestressing, stressing process, first-crack load, steel-yielding load, ultimate load at failure and deformation are systematically studied. The results from the tests show that this new strengthening technique using helical <b>rib</b> <b>steel</b> wire bonding in the concrete cover is an efficient method, which can overcome the problems with peeling of the strengthening material when the surface bonded FRP laminates, also overcome the shortages of nonprestressed beams. The prestressed beams exhibited higher first-crack load, higher steel-yielding load, as well as a larger deformation capacity as compared to nonprestressed strengthened beams, which is important for a construction s lifetime; the fatigue behavior will improve and as a consequence the crack widths will be smaller, which can result in increased durability, which should indicate a more advantageous behavior in the service limit state (SLS). However, the ultimate load at failure is as high as nonprestressed beams, but in relation not as large as for the cracking and yielding. The ultimate load at failure is also higher as compared to non strengthened beams. The results provide a reference for engineering application...|$|R

The study investigated the effects of the section sizes which ranged from 12 mm to 25 mm diameters, chemical composition of the steel as process variables and resulting microstructures on the mechanical properties of the rolled <b>ribbed</b> medium carbon <b>steel</b> were carried out. Here the as received rolled <b>ribbed</b> medium carbon <b>steel</b> were analysed to determine the chemical composition using spectrometric analyser and they were then machined using lathe machine to tensile, impact and hardness tests and micro structural samples. These samples were used to determine the tensile, hardness, impact properties of rolled <b>ribbed</b> medium carbon <b>steel.</b> The micro structural analysed were also studied. It was found from the studies that the percentage carbon content has great influence on the mechanical properties of the materials as they all increased with increase in carbon content except impact strength which decreased with increase in carbon content. The diameters of the rods also have great effect on the mechanical properties of the materials since the rate of cooling is a function of size of the rod. The study is relevant to steel industries that produced rolled <b>ribbed</b> medium carbon <b>steel</b> and structural engineers that mad...|$|R
