The result proved in my case, however, as it has probably proved in those of most men, that Providence did not consider me of sufficient importance to give me audible information of what was about to happen. So strong was this impression to the last, notwithstanding, that on our return, when the vessel passed the spot where the evil-omened prediction was uttered, I caught myself muttering involuntarily, [...] "---- is a false prophet; I have come back!" ...|$|R

40|$|Afterimage is a {{collection}} of poems based mostly on black and white family photographs from the past two centuries, roughly 1870 to 1990. Many of the poems, particularly the first section, trace the immigration of a rural German Mennonite family from Russia to Kansas and Oklahoma in the 19 th century, however, around half of the total poems relate the author’s personal experiences trying to establish various homes in suburban Minnesota, Ohio, and Nebraska in the late 20 th century. By reimagining the story in these photographs—or <b>remembering</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> personal and interviewed accounts—a narrative begins to emerge of cultural integration and identification in America, specifically in the Great Plains and Midwest. ^ Morning Glory is part memoir, part cultural exploration on the history of gardening, and part environmental treatise. At the core of the book is the author’s time spent growing up gardening with his mother in Minnesota, how this has lead to them being closer in adulthood, and culminates in the discovery of the lineage of fear, distrust, and solitude within his family that he innately exhibits. This darker side of his mother’s family—of poverty, religious fundamentalism, and an abusive stepfather—is paralleled with an exploration of global culture in the natural world, specifically, through gardening. By looking at our attitudes toward nature, manifested by its exploitation, manipulation, and our artistic interpretation of it, he compares this outward struggle with our humanity to an inward struggle with loss, confusion, self-doubt, isolation, and longing. Our violence toward the planet comes from the same root as our violence toward ourselves. Many nature writers and critics—such as Michael Pollan, Jack Turner, and Terry Tempest Williams—suggest we need to recreate or find a metaphor that links culture to the natural world, that the answer to our ecological and social crises is to get more culture into our relation to the earth; through the personal story of family and the exploration of various religions, philosophies, literatures, and garden history, Morning Glory does just that. ...|$|R

The second panel contains the inscriptions: AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN AND IN THE MORNING WE WILL <b>REMEMBER</b> <b>THEM,</b> taken <b>from</b> the work of Laurence Binyon, and FREEDOM IS THE SURE POSSESSION OF THOSE ALONE WHO HAVE COURAGE TO DEFEND IT, from Pericles, as well as, in the lower portion, an armoured figure holding a flambeau, and, in the upper part, St. George slaying the dragon.

Beneath Lady Justice in this panel is the heroic figure of Canada wearing armour and helmet and holding the laurel wreath of victory, but looking mournfully at the Book of Remembrance, and behind her are two other persons, one symbolising Canadian motherhood and the other First Nations.

60|$|I was {{not knowing}} his {{works for the}} first time; no one perhaps does that, such is the {{multiplicity}} of the copies of them; and I vividly <b>remembered</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> my acquaintance with the originals four decades before, as I had remembered the Michelangelos; but in their presence and {{in the presence of}} so many other masterpieces in the different rooms, with their horrible miracles and atrocious martyrdoms, I realized as for the first time what a bloody religion ours was. It was such relief, such rest, to go from those broilings and beheadings and crucifixions and Sayings and stabbings into the long, tranquil aisles of the museum where the marble men and women, created for earthly immortality by Greek art, welcomed me to their serenity and sanity. The earlier gods might have been the devils which the early Christians fancied them, but they did not look it; they did not look as if it was they that had loosed the terrors upon mankind out of which the true faith has but barely struggled at last, now when its relaxing grasp seems slipping from the human mind. I remembered those peaceful pagans so perfectly that I could have gone confidently to this or that and hailed him friend; and though I might not have liked to claim the acquaintance of all of them in the flesh, in the marble I fled to it as refuge from the cruel visions of Christian art. If this is perhaps saying too much, I wish also to hedge from the wholesale censure of my fellow-sight-seers which I may have seemed to imply. They did not prevail so clutteringly in the sculpture galleries as in the Sistine Chapel and the Stanze. One could have the statues as much to one's self as one liked; there were courts with murmuring fountains in them; and there was a view of Rome from a certain window, where no fellow-tourist intruded between one and the innumerable roofs and domes and towers, and the heights beyond whose snows there was nothing but blue sky. It was a beautiful morning, with a sun mild as English summer, which did not prevent the afternoon from turning cold with wind and raining and hailing and snowing. This in turn did not keep off a fine red sunset, with an evening star of glittering silver that brightened as the sunset faded. At Rome the weather can be of as many minds in March as in April at New York.|$|R

Stoltzman's first {{exposure}} to music came through his father, an avid fan of big band music. Stoltzman's father played the big band music of the 1940s {{at home on the}} radio and performed in a dance band during his spare time. Stoltzman began studying the clarinet at the age of eight with a teacher at a local school, and he began playing with his father in the Stewart Memorial United Presbyterian Sunday School Orchestra and at community functions within a few years. When Stoltzman was in junior high school, he began developing the jazz techniques of improvisation and enjoyed jamming with his father at home. Benny Goodman was his earliest musical mentor, and remained a strong influence throughout his career. Stoltzman told Allan Kozinn of the New York Times, [...] "(When) I was seven years old ... I found these wonderful cylindrical objects in a nice leather case. I enjoyed playing with them ... and I vaguely <b>remember</b> dangling <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the second-story window of our house.

But instead of punishing me, he decided that I had an interest in the instrument and rented an indestructible metal clarinet for me to start on." ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} (modeled after J. Deese's 1959 study) revealed remarkable {{levels of}} false recall and false recognition in a list learning paradigm. In Experiment 1, subjects studied lists of 12 words (e. g., bed, rest, awake); each list {{was composed of}} associates of 1 nonpresented word (e. g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40 % {{of the time and}} were later recognized with high confidence. In Experiment 2, a false recall rate of 55 % was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, subjects produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened. False memories—either remembering events that never happened, or <b>remembering</b> <b>them</b> quite differently <b>from</b> the way they happened—have recently captured the attention of both psychologists and the public at large.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of modality (method of presentation) on false memory. It was hypothesized that an auditory format (audio tape) would produce a significantly greater incidence of false memory than a visual format (PowerPoint). A convenience sample of 33 undergraduate students participated in this experiment. The participants either viewed a set of word lists on a PowerPoint presentation or listened to the same word lists on audio tape. Each list {{was followed by a}} 2 -minute recognition task. An independent samples t-test revealed no significant differences in recognition between the two modalities. Our memory has a key, pervasive role in our everyday lives, and remembering is something we engage in everyday but most of us may think little about the process. In the case of false mem-ory, there exists a deeper, more elusive process at work. The erroneous remembering that is associated with false memories is ultimately a deception from within, an innate capacity that we all possess. False memories are defined as “either remembering events that never happened, or <b>remembering</b> <b>them</b> quite different-ly <b>from</b> the way they happened ” (Roediger & McDermott, 1995) ...|$|R
