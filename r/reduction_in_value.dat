60|$|Mr. Lincoln {{moved to}} reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. He stated to the House {{that he had made}} this motion for the purpose of obtaining an {{opportunity}} {{to say a few words}} in relation to a point raised in the course of the debate on this bill, which he would now proceed to make if in order. The point in the case to which he referred arose on the amendment that was submitted by the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Collamer] in Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, and which was afterward renewed in the House, in relation to the question whether the reserved sections, which, by some bills heretofore passed, by which an appropriation of land had been made to Wisconsin, had been enhanced in value, should be reduced to the minimum price of the public lands. The question of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of those sections was to him at this time a matter very nearly of indifference. He was inclined to desire that Wisconsin should be obliged by having it reduced. But the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. C. B. Smith], the chairman of the Committee on Territories, yesterday associated that question with the general question, which is now to some extent agitated in Congress, of making appropriations of alternate sections of land to aid the States in making internal improvements, and enhancing the price of the sections reserved, and the gentleman from Indiana took ground against that policy. He did not make any special argument in favor of Wisconsin, but he took ground generally against the policy of giving alternate sections of land, and enhancing the price of the reserved sections. Now he [Mr. Lincoln] did not at this time take the floor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on the general subject. He rose simply to protest against the doctrine which the gentleman from Indiana had avowed in the course of what he [Mr. Lincoln] could not but consider an unsound argument.|$|E

40|$|Central European {{forests are}} {{generally}} multifunctional; the same forest areas {{are used for}} timber production and recreation. In frequently visited areas damage to trees can be observed. We developed a method to estimate the actual <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> timber <b>value</b> due to recreation-induced damage. The method was tested in two suburban (oak-hornbeam and beech) forests sustainably maintained by a selective management system and with free access in northwestern Switzerland. Considering the total forest areas, 9. 4 % of oak trees and 23. 0 % of beech trees were damaged by recreational activities. The resulting <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> timber <b>value</b> averaged 19 and 53 (sic) ha(- 1) a(- 1) in the two forests. The annual <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> timber <b>value</b> due to recreation-induced damage can account for up to 16 % of the total proceeds.

40|$|Few {{communities}} welcome federally subsidized housing, {{with one}} of the most commonly voiced fears being <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> property <b>values.</b> Yet there is little empirical evidence that subsidized housing depresses neighborhood property values. This paper estimates and compares the neighborhood impacts of a broad range of federally-subsidized, rental housing programs, using rich data for New York City and a difference-in-difference specification of a hedonic regression model. We find that federally-subsidized developments have not typically led to <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> property <b>values</b> and have <b>in</b> fact led to increases in many cases. Impacts are highly sensitive to scale, though patterns vary across programs. *We are grateful to the MacArthur Foundation for their generous financial support. We are also grateful to Wayne Few communities welcome federally subsidized housing. Indeed, community opposition to such housing projects can be fierce, {{with one of}} the most commonly voiced fears being <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> property <b>values.</b> Yet there is little empirical support for the notion that subsidized housing depresses neighborhood property values, and economic theory offers uncertain predictions about whethe...|$|R

50|$|This {{refers to}} the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of {{equipments}} as it becomes older and more obsolete. For example, if a printer has a potential useful life span of 5 years, the amount {{that it can be}} sold for will decrease each year. Therefore, this value in depreciation is calculated as a manufacturing overhead. Moreover, this also applies to vehicles as they tend to depreciate in value significantly after the first year. When calculating manufacturing overheads, accountants mainly use two methods: straight-line method and declining balance method.|$|E

50|$|Bastiat and Austrian theorists argue a {{subjective}} theory of value, {{which holds that}} the value of a product is determined by its consumer or owner. Therefore, if the window had a negative value, it is because the owner already wished it broken. If the proverbial window was old, and the newer proverbial window had a greater value (determined by the shopkeeper's own valuation), then the net increase in value in the economy was the difference between the value of the old and new window. Bastiat and Austrian economists also believe that depreciation and other losses of the value of goods reduce the net value in the economy by the amount of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of the goods.|$|E

On January 27, 2010, a federal judge refused to dismiss a class action lawsuit against Chase for freezing HELOC loans.
