40|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{has become}} the key {{instrument}} for marine conservation in European seas. We review its implementation, focusing on cetacean biodiversity, using the examples of Spain and the <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Convention,</b> OSPAR. The MSFD has been widely criticised for legal vagueness, lack of coordination, uncertainty about funding, and poor governance; its future role within EU Integrated Maritime Policy remains unclear. Nevertheless, the first stages of the process have run broadly to schedule: current status, environmental objectives and indicators have been described and the design of monitoring programmes is in progress, drawing on experience with other environmental legislation. The MSFD is now entering its critical phase, with lack of funding for monitoring, limited scope for management interventions, and uncertainty about how conservation objectives will be reconciled {{with the needs of}} other marine and maritime sectors, being among the main concerns. Clarity in governance, about the roles of the EU, Member States, Regional Seas Conventions and stakeholders, is needed to ensure success. However, even if (as seems likely) good environmental status cannot be achieved by 2020, significant steps will have been taken to place environmental sustainability centre-stage in the development of Integrated Maritime Policy for EU seas.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} avenues for the {{ecosystem}} approach to {{management in the}} Baltic Sea Region. This region {{is one of the}} most contaminated water bodies in the world, although the first <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Convention</b> was created here and theregion has a long history of cooperation and environmental protection. The current environmental governance arrangements are examined with specific focuson governance structures, cross-sectoral integration and ecological boundaries. The ecosystem approach to management as both a tool and vision of holistic management of natural resources is traced through the evolution of environmental governance, as well as its manifestation in contemporary environmental policies in the region. It is found that the major EU directives, as well as HELCOM polices, promote the ecosystem approach and that its presence has increased inrecent years; it is now the major guiding principle in European marine governance. However, the governance structures impede implementation indifferent ways. The environmental problem areas in the region all require different governance arrangements, thus obstructing a holistic approach. The environmental problems per se also affect each other, necessitating far-reaching sectoral integration and cross-border cooperation, which at present is the major obstacle regarding implementation. The contemporary trends combining solid regionalisation through HELCOM with increased Europeanisation and macro regionalisation by different EU initiatives offer some promise, but the cross sectoral impediments must be resolved if the ecosystem approach is to become apractical approach and not just a policy principle...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{governance}} in European seas is at a crossroad aiming towards implementation of eco-system based marine management (EBMM) through integration of different EU policies or directives {{to protect the}} environment, {{while at the same}} time expected to facilitate growth and employment in support of the blue economy. This article shows that the governance landscape at the <b>regional</b> <b>sea</b> level is very complex, fragmented and faced with several dilemmas. It examines the present governance structures in the four European seas (Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Seas and North East Atlantic Ocean). It is argued that the implementation of EBMM at the <b>regional</b> <b>sea</b> level is characterized by a highly fragmented European governance system where there is lack of coordination between relevant DGs within the European Commission, between EU, International organisations, <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions</b> and the Member States and between sectoral governance arrangements that should provide sectoral management measures that support EBMM. The article develops suggestions for a nested governance system in which institutions, policies, laws and sectors are nested into a tiered, internally consistent and mutually re-enforcing planning and decision-making system. Developing institutional interaction and soft modes of governance between the EU, the <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions,</b> Member States and the governance arrangements of the different marine sectors will be crucial in evolving towards such a nested governance system for EBMM. Moreover, there is no one size fits all approach in implementing EBMM, which means that for each European Sea a context-dependent nested governance system should be developed...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the institutional ambiguity {{that exists between}} the European, Regional and Member State levels {{in the implementation of}} the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The two main reasons for the emergence of institutional ambiguity are (1) the MSFD being a framework directive and (2) Member States are required to coordinate the implementation of the MFSD through the <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions.</b> Institutional ambiguity refers to the interference zone between different institutional settings that come together in new policy practices. New rules of the game are needed to bring these institutional settings together and the room to manoeuvre for the actors who negotiate these rules is a defining feature of institutional ambiguity. This article analyses the institutional ambiguity associated with MSFD implementation on the European and regional level for four European Seas: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. The results indicate different levels of institutional ambiguity {{in each of the four}} regions, with the lowest level of ambiguity in the Baltic Sea and the highest in the Mediterranean Sea. Institutional ambiguity also exists on the European level, as coordination efforts have not resulted in clear directions for the implementation of the MSFD as yet. The level of institutional ambiguity is influenced by the relative number of EU member states bordering the particular sea and whether they consider implementation of the MFSD to be urgent. Member States bordering the Mediterranean and the Black Seas lack the support of <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions</b> in addition to receiving limited direction from the European level...|$|R
30|$|Biomarkers are molecular, biochemical, {{cellular}} {{and physiological}} indicators of contaminant stress measured in organisms resident or exposed in situ {{in a specific}} location. They {{are used in the}} monitoring programmes of <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Conventions</b> and more recently in the MSFD to identify the impact from substances or combinations of substances not previously identified to be of concern, study trends and identify regions of decreased environmental quality [15]. Contrary to bioassays but similar to the ecological/community-based tools, biomarkers are analysed on field-exposed, usually resident, organisms. The sampling step is therefore primarily focused on the organisms that should to be examined. However, active monitoring based on caged organisms {{can also be used to}} measure biomarkers.|$|R

40|$|A Catalogue of Marine Biodiversity Indicators was {{developed}} {{with the aim}} of providing the basis for assessing the environmental status of the marine ecosystems. Useful for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), this catalogue allows the navigation of a database of indicators mostly related to biological diversity, non-indigenous species, food webs, and seafloor integrity. Over 600 indicators were compiled, which were developed and used in the framework of different initiatives (e. g. EU policies, research projects) and in national and international contexts (e. g. <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Conventions,</b> and assessments in non-European seas). The catalogue reflects the current scientific capability to address environmental assessment needs by providing a broad coverage of the most relevant indicators for marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. The available indicators are reviewed according to their typology, data requirements, development status, geographical coverage, relevance to habitats or biodiversity components, and related human pressures. Through this comprehensive overview, we discuss the potential of the current set of indicators {{in a wide range of}} contexts, from large-scale to local environmental programs, and we also address shortcomings in light of current needs. Developed by the DEVOTES Project, the catalogue is freely available through the DEVOTool software application, which provides browsing and query options for the associated metadata. The tool allows extraction of ranked indicator lists best fulfilling selected criteria, enabling users to search for suitable indicators to address a particular biodiversity component, ecosystem feature, habitat or pressure in a marine area of interest. This tool is useful for EU Member States, <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions,</b> the European Commission, non-governmental organizations, managers, scientists and any person interested in marine environmental assessment.

40|$|Background The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; EC, 2008) is {{an ambitious}} European policy {{instrument}} {{that aims to}} achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) in the 5, 720, 000 km 2 of European seas by 2020, using an Ecosystem Approach. GES is to be assessed using 11 descriptors and up to 56 indicators (European Commission, 2010), and the goal is for clean, healthy and productive seas that are the basis for marine-based development, known as Blue-Growth. The MSFD {{is one of many}} policy instruments, such as the Water Framework Directive, the Common Fisheries Policy and the Habitats Directive that, together, should result in “Healthy Oceans and Productive Ecosystems – HOPE”. Re- searchers working together with stakeholders such as the Member States environmental agencies, the European Environmental Agency, and the <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions,</b> are to provide the scientific knowledge basis for the implementation of the MSFD.

30|$|In Europe, {{several of}} the tools {{described}} in the report are already used for both marine and limnic applications [7, 8].

Bioassays are used for example to support risk assessment and management of contaminated sediments and provide decision support for reducing the release of toxic substances into the environment (e.g. in the evaluation of dredged sediments that are considered for sea disposal and whole effluent assessments in the permitting process). They are also used in broad screening of different pollutant sources (such as sewage treatment plant effluents). Other applications include, for example, alarm systems directly triggering control measures (e.g. closing drinking water intakes).

For organic contaminants, concentrations progressively increased from Iceland, to the offshore North Sea, to the coastal seas, and were highest in estuaries. Metals had a more complex distribution, reflecting local anthropogenic inputs, natural sources and hydrological conditions. Use of internationally recognised assessment criteria indicated that at no site were concentrations of all contaminants at background and that concentrations of some contaminants were of significant concern in all areas, except the central North Sea...|$|R

The MSFD provisions foresee the consideration of contaminants that are not covered by the WFD, but entail a significant risk to, or via, the marine environment. A close collaboration with <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions</b> is crucial, as contaminants cross national and EU borders. Chemical substances occurring in the marine environment might derive from specific sea-based sources, such as shipping, mariculture, offshore oil and gas production, marine renewable energy devices, seabed mining, dredging of sediments, dumping of dredged material and historical dumping. This report consists of a scientific review of the literature to compile a list of marine specific contaminants potentially entering the marine environ-ment from these sea-based sources. It also provides an overview of the environmental policy instruments and frameworks in place to oversee and regulate these substances within the EU. The resulting list should support Member States in setting-up of monitoring approaches, including hotspots screening, and therefore, help guide the selection of relevant substances for MSFD Descriptor 8 implementation and also contribute to the work done in RSCs.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires EU Member States to draft a program of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES). Central argument of this paper, based on {{an analysis of the}} unique, holistic character of the MSFD, is that social and political factors are having a major influence on this MSFD implementation process. More specifically, four potential impediments have been identified that are curtailing the drive towards the effective {{implementation of}} the scheme advanced by the Directive. First, scientific uncertainty about aggregated ecological pressure and drivers in relation to the different sectors clouds the definition of national programmes of measures and this in turn may lead to implementation-drift in achieving GES. Second, the scale of the ecosystem is different from the political and socio-economic scales of individual, sectoral decision-making and activities. Third, policy coordination is required on several levels, i. e. at the EU level, within the <b>Regional</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Conventions,</b> at national level and between these three levels. Finally, the coming together of both stakeholder involvement organized for the MSFD and those of existing, sectoral policy domains makes fair and efficient stakeholder involvement challenging. This paper concludes that more attention should be rendered to establishing appropriate coordination and communication structures, which facilitate greater engagement with the different Directorates-General in the European Commission, the European Council and the Parliament, the Member States, sectoral decision making institutions as well as stakeholder interest groups...|$|R
40|$|Through {{implementing}} environmental Directives, Europe {{has moved}} towards coordinated and integrated catchment-to-coast management, following the most novel legislation on ecosystem-based approaches worldwide. This novel joint synthesis of this direction {{allows us to}} regard the Water Framework Directive (WFD) as a ¿deconstructing structural approach¿ whereas the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is a ¿holistic functional approach¿, i. e. the WFD has split the ecosystem into several biological quality elements, then it compares the structure of these (such as species complement) individually before combining them and attempting to determine the overall condition. In contrast the MSFD concentrates {{on the set of}} 11 descriptors which together summarize {{the way in which the}} whole system functions. In addition, the WFD implementation has been left to the Member States, and hence we then need a detailed intercalibration exercise to compare the outputs. In contrast, MSFD is a more top-down approach in which the European Commission has created a task group approach for a cross-Europe agreement before implementation. We emphasize that both Directives are frameworks on which many other directives are linked but that they need to be fully and seamlessly integrated to give a land to open sea system of assessment and management. Hence, by taking account of the experience gained in the WFD implementation, together with that from <b>regional</b> <b>sea</b> <b>conventions,</b> such as OSPAR (North East Atlantic) or HELCOM (Baltic Sea), we propose in this contribution an integrative approach for the environmental status assessment, within the MSFD.

40|$|Marine litter is {{a global}} concern {{with a range of}} {{problems}} associated to it, as recognised by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Marine litter can impact organisms at different levels of biological organization and habitats {{in a number of ways}} namely: through entanglement in, or ingestion of, litter items by individuals, resulting in death and/or severe suffering; through chemical and microbial transfer; as a vector for transport of biota and by altering or modifying assemblages of species. Marine litter is a threat not only to marine species and ecosystems but also carries a risk to human health and has significant implications to human welfare, impacting negatively vital economic sectors such as tourism, fisheries, aquaculture or energy supply and bringing economic losses to individuals, enterprises and communities. This technical report aims to provide clear insight about the major negative impacts from marine litter by describing the mechanisms of harm. Further it provides reflexions about the evidence for harm from marine litter to biota comprising the underlying aspect of animal welfare while also considering the socioeconomic effects, including the influence of marine litter on ecosystem services. General conclusions highlight that understanding the risks and uncertainties with regard to the harm caused by marine litter is closely associated with the precautionary principle. The collected evidence in this report can be regarded as a supporting step to define harm and to provide an evidence base for the various actions needed to be implemented by decision-makers. This improved knowledge about the scale of the harmful effects of marine litter will further support EU Member States (MSs) and <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Conventions</b> (RSCs) to implement their programme of measures, regional action plans and assessments.

40|$|The transboundary {{nature of}} the marine {{environment}} requires concerted actions among neighbouring countries to improve its quality in an effective way. Coordination at international level is particularly important during the implementation of environmental policies aimed at reducing the widespread pressures derived from activities, such as shipping and fishing. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect and improve {{the status of a}} wide range of ecosystem components with a regional focus, promoting cooperation among countries and integration with other environmental policies. In 2014, the European Commission assessed the level of adequacy, consistency and coherence achieved by Member States during the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD and hence this paper focuses on the cross-border coherence and coordination within one marine region in order to achieve the goals of the Directive. In particular, it identifies and analyses the main differences among the results of the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD across the North-East Atlantic region. This analysis shows that, in general, the use of existing data, methodologies and targets from related environmental policies corresponds to the higher levels of coherence among countries while a limited use of such policies produces less coherence. This suggests that the European Commission, <b>Regional</b> <b>Seas</b> <b>Conventions</b> and Member States should work together to identify the real connection between the MSFD and other policies to make a proper use of existing data and approaches and to harmonise different policy objectives. In particular, the review shows what might be termed a ‘paradox of coherence’ amongst Member States where coherence of action has to be achieved within a European policy of subsidiarity, the act of Member States having control over the way they implement framework directives. This can be regarded as a fundamental flaw in having a ‘Framework Directive’ instead of the greater control in a ‘Directive’...|$|R
