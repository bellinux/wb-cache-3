40|$|<b>Recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> can {{be defined}} as the whole of {{procedures}} designed to set up physical-chemical actions, at an industrial scale, that perform the recovery of materials and end-use products that result from the collection of household or industrial wastes. The materials to be recovered and recycled, obviously, influence both processing technologies and plant layouts. In this section an in-depth analysis of the problems arising when suitable <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> must be designed, implemented, and set up is presented with particular reference to paper, glass, metals, plastics, and textiles (not organics or Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste). <b>Recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> must be approached from a processing perspective, that is, by defining a sequence of steps and actions where the waste flow stream feed, and the different products resulting from the different sequential processing steps, are handled in order to produce one or more outputs of materials to reuse. Obviously, processing strategies and equipment must be selected with both low environmental impact and positive economic perspectives in mind. Dealing withwaste often means dealing with complex products, that is, products constituted of one or more materials of interest but also of polluting material. The economic value, per unit of weight, of the materials to recover is usually low: <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> thus must assure high production, while minimizing plant investments and management costs. From this perspective, a full characterization of the input waste streams and complete control of the different phases of the recycling process are a key issue when <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> are selected and applied. In this section, for each of the different materials, methodologies, procedures, and logics are presented to preliminarily identify and quantitatively assess <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> according to the characteristics of the materials to be recovered...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the eco-efficiency of three different <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) waste, and to identify the preferable and most efficient solution. Recycling via mechanical shredding, microwave pyrolysis and subcritical solvolysis is compared and comprehensive primary data on energy demand and process throughput are examined. Following an ecological and economic assessment, the results are normalized and summarized into three single-score indicators. To decide which solution is most efficient, economic and ecological data are plotted on an eco-efficiency portfolio. The achieved results demonstrate that the eco-efficiency of the <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> investigated is entirely positive on an industrial scale, and that the efficient use of CFRPs across the entire life cycle is possible. The material recycling of CFRP waste is consequently a promising topic for future development. The use of recycled material a s conductivity additives in secondary applications can be considered as a valuable option for all three technologies, although the benefits of recycling are strongly dependent on the quality and quantity of the recycled material. Depending on the resources substituted in a secondary application, different <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> offer considerable advantages. To ensure a consistently high quality of output materials on an industrial scale, specific process parameters have to be identified, for which, further research is necessary...|$|R

40|$|AbstractComposite {{materials}} made {{of glass}} and carbon fibres have revolutionised many industries. Demand for composites is experiencing rapid growth and global demand is expected to double. As demand for composites grows {{it is clear that}} waste management will become an important issue for businesses. Technically composite materials evoke difficult recycling challenges due to the heterogeneity of their composition. As current waste management practices in composites are dominated by landfilling, governments and businesses themselves foresee that this will need to change in the future. The recycling of composites will {{play a vital role in}} the future especially for the aerospace, automotive, construction and marine sectors. These industries will require different recycling options for their products based on compliance with current legislation, the business model as well as cost effectiveness. In order to be able to evaluate waste management strategies for composites, a review of <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> has been conducted based on technology readiness levels and waste management hierarchy. This paper analyses 56 research projects to identify growing trends in composite <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> with pyrolysis, solvolysis and mechanical grinding as the most prominent <b>technologies.</b> These <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> attained high scores on the waste management hierarchy (either recycling or reuse applications) suggesting potential development as future viable alternatives to composite landfilling. The research concluded that recycling as a waste management strategy is most popular exploration area. It was found mechanical grinding to be most mature for glass fibre applications while pyrolysis has been most mature in the context of carbon fibre. The paper also highlights the need to understand the use of reclaimed material as important assessment element of recycling efforts. This paper contributes to the widening and systematising knowledge on maturity and understanding composites <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} cycle is {{the series of}} stages that nuclear fuel {{materials}} go through in a cradle to grave framework. The Once Through Cycle (OTC) is the current fuel cycle implemented in the United States; in which an appropriate form of the fuel is irradiated through a nuclear reactor only once before it is disposed of as waste. The discharged fuel contains materials that can be suitable for use as fuel. Thus, different types of fuel <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> may be introduced in order to more fully utilize the energy potential of the fuel, or reduce the environmental impacts and proliferation concerns about the discarded fuel materials. Nuclear fuel cycle systems analysis is applied in this paper to attain {{a better understanding of}} the strengths and weaknesses of fuel cycle alternatives. Through the use of the nuclear fuel cycle analysis code CAFCA (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycle Analysis), the impact of a number of <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> and the associated fuel cycle options is explored in the context of the U. S. energy scenario over 100 years. Particular focus is given to the quantification of Uranium utilization, the amount of Transuranic Material (TRU) generated and the economics of the different options compared to the base-line case, the OTC option. It is concluded that LWRs and the OTC are likely to dominate the nuclear energy supply system for the period considered due to limitations on availability of TRU to initiate <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies.</b> While the introduction of U- 235 initiated fast reactors can accelerate their penetration of the nuclear energy system, their higher capital cost may lead to continued preference for the LWR-OTC cycle.

50|$|Historically, {{there has}} not been any volume use for scrap tires other than burning that has been able {{to keep up with the}} volume of waste {{generated}} yearly. Tires produce the same energy as petroleum and approximately 25% more energy than coal. Burning tires is lower on the hierarchy of reducing waste than recycling, but it is better than placing the tire waste in a landfill or dump, where there is a possibility for uncontrolled tire fires or the harboring of disease vectors such as mosquitoes. Tire Derived Fuel is an interim solution to the scrap tire waste problem. Advances in tire <b>recycling</b> <b>technology</b> might one day provide a solution other than burning by reusing tire derived material in high volume applications.|$|E
50|$|Byron Elton, the CEO and President of Carbon Sciences, {{explained}} in a report with Newsweek {{that they are in}} the developmental stages of a carbon <b>recycling</b> <b>technology</b> that involves capturing the greenhouse gas, , and transforming it into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, methanol, propane, and butane. The main process involves taking the oxygen molecules out of water and carbon dioxide in a biocatalytic process. The remaining carbon monoxide and hydrogen are then combined to make basic hydrocarbons using the Fischer-Tropsch process. These hydrocarbons are then transformed into a variety of fuels. In {{the early stages of the}} technology the process required pure carbon dioxide and pure water. However, updates to the technology will allow it to be placed at the output of a large emitter, such as a power plant, where many other elements and compounds are present. Their catalyst was developed in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. If the methane is obtained from a landfill, the process would completely utilize recycled compounds. The end product would be much cleaner than natural fuels because it would not contain smog-causing air pollutants.|$|E
