5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to medication.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E

5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Russian Federation {{had one of}} {{the highest}} levels of {{psychiatric}} beds per capita in Europe at 113.2 per 100,000 population, or more than 161,000 beds. In 2014, Russia has 104.8 beds per 100,000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services. Persons who do not <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long-term social care institutions (internats) wherein they remain indefinitely. The internats are managed by oblast Social Protection ministries. Russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999, and their number amounted to 505 by 2013. The internats provided places for approximately 125,000 people in 2007. In 2013, Russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146,000 people, according to the consolidated data of the Department of Social Protection of Moscow and the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Russian Federation. It is supposed that the number of beds in internats is increasing at the same rate with which the number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals. Lyubov Vinogradova of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia provides the different figure of 122,091 or 85.5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection (internats) per 100,000 population in 2013 and says that Russia is high on Europe's list of the number of places in the institutions. Vinogradova states that many regions have the catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats, her words point out to the need {{to increase the number of}} places there and to the fact that the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia is forcing transinstitutionalization—relocating the mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats.|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{caused by}} the buildup of uric acid (gout and renal symptoms) <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to treatment with drugs such as allopurinol that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. Lesch Nyhan Syndrome does not respond to allopurinol treatment. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to treatment. There is no cure, but many patients live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms.|$|E

25|$|If it {{has spread}} {{outside of the}} kidneys, often into the lymph nodes, the lungs or the main vein of the kidney, then {{multiple}} therapies are used including surgery and medications.

In early stage cases, cryotherapy and surgery are the preferred options.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} {{epithelial}} ovarian carcinoma, about two-thirds, have a serous carcinoma, though this proportion is estimated {{as high as}} 80%. Low-grade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically <b>respond</b> <b>well</b> to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the Fallopian tube. Histologically, serous adenocarcinomas have psammoma bodies. Low-grade serous adenocarcinomas resemble Fallopian tube epithelium, whereas high-grade serous adenocarcinomas show anaplasia and nuclear atypia.|$|E
