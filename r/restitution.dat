Siegelman was sentenced on the same day to seven years and four months in prison, <b>restitution</b> of $181,325 to the state, three years probation, a $50,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service upon his release.

During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the <b>restitution</b> of property and assets seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal property and assets of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 francs respectively; totaling to an estimated $ billion today.
