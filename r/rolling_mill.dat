5|$|On the city's {{north side}} the Youngstown Steel Heritage Foundation is {{constructing}} the Tod Engine Heritage Park, featuring {{a collection of}} steel industry equipment and artifacts. The main exhibit is a 1914 William Tod Co. <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> steam engine that was built in Youngstown and used at the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Brier Hill Works. The Tod Engine {{is one of three}} remaining <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> engines in the United States and is a Mechanical and Materials Engineering Landmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} discoverer of Cleveland Ironstone, {{the mining}} engineer John Vaughan, ran a <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> {{for the company}} before leaving to found the major rival firm Bolckow Vaughan.

5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E

However, ABB and Simens motor often have very high sale prices so that some <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> cannot afford. They need {{domestic}} large-size motors instead of ABB motors. Currently, those <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> can buy from domestic motor manufacturers which can produce such large-size motors.|$|R

5|$|In 1827 a <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> {{capable of}} 100 tons of bar iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron puddling process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|MD151 {{enters the}} city of Baltimore just west of its {{intersection}} with <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Road and Kane Street. The state highway passes under I-95, a Norfolk Southern Railway railyard, and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. At North Point Road, MD151's name changes to Erdman Avenue and the highway veers west to pass under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The state highway veers northwest at its crossing of I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) just before the highway's cloverleaf interchange with US40 (Pulaski Highway), which also includes a ramp from southbound MD151 to southbound I-895. Connections between eastbound US40 and northbound MD151 are made via Mapleton Avenue just east of I-895. MD151 continues northwest concurrent with US40Truck as a six-lane boulevard between the Armistead Gardens neighborhood {{to the east and}} industrial facilities on the west. The state highway passes by Archbishop Curley High School and through the Belair-Edison neighborhood before reaching its northern terminus at US1 (Belair Road), onto which US40Truck turns west. Erdman Avenue continues northwest as a two-lane street along the eastern edge of Clifton Park to MD147 (Harford Road).|$|E

25|$|William Dickie owned a mill on Buck Run at Sadsbury {{shortly after}} 1722. Historically, {{there were six}} or seven papermills on the stream in one township. One of these mills, the Rokeby Papermill, {{was said to be}} at the same {{location}} as the first <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> in the United States. Two rolling mills known as the Rokeby <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> and the Laurel <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> also historically existed on the stream. The former was built in 1795 and the latter was built in 1825. The Laurel <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> was located at the mouth of Buck Run. Additionally, a slitting mill constructed by Isaac Pennock was constructed on the stream.|$|E

25|$|Fuller {{returned}} to Cleveland in 1880. He bought back his old company from Chisholm, renaming it the Union <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Co. The following year, Fuller and partner Paul P. Condit formed Condit, Fuller & Co. This new firm marketed the {{iron and steel}} Fuller's mills were producing. Henry Chisholm, who had retained ownership of the Emma Furnace, spun it off as the Newburg Furnace Co. in January 1882. Fuller purchased it in August 1883 and made it part of the Union <b>Rolling</b> <b>Mill</b> Co. again.|$|E

40|$|The interstand tension {{coupling}} {{effect and}} strip gauge variation {{passed on to}} next stand with time delay are the main causes for regenerative chatter in tandem <b>rolling</b> <b>mills.</b> To study the effect of different factors on the stability of tandem <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> different models considering different interstand factors were built. Through stability analysis of these models by employing the Lyapunov indirect method and integral criterion, more detailed and quantitative explanation is put forward to regenerative chatter mechanism in rolling. To study the time delay effect as a single factor on the stability of tandem <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> stability charts of the chatter model including the time delay effect and model neglecting the delay time were compared. The {{results show that the}} time delay effect reduces the critical velocity of multistand mills slightly in the big picture. But it alters the relationship between two adjacent stands by worsening the downstream stand stability. To get preferable rolling process parameter configuration for the tandem <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> the time delay effect in rolling must be involved...|$|R

By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop.
