50|$|One {{drawback}} {{of using}} source-synchronous clocking {{is the creation}} of a separate clock-domain at the <b>receiving</b> <b>device,</b> namely the clock-domain of the strobe generated by the transmitting device. This strobe clock-domain is often not synchronous to the core clock domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> For proper operation of the received data with other data already present in the device, an additional stage of synchronization logic is required to transfer the received data into the core clock-domain of the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> This stage can often be found alongside source synchronous logic. This usually results in greater system complexity compared to globally clocked systems, but the benefits are generally much greater than this increase in complexity.|$|R
50|$|An iBeacon {{deployment}} {{consists of}} one or more iBeacon devices that transmit their own unique identification number to the local area. Software on a receiving device may then look up the iBeacon and perform various functions, such as notifying the user. <b>Receiving</b> <b>devices</b> can also connect to the iBeacons to retrieve values from iBeacon's GATT (generic attribute profile) service. iBeacons do not push notifications to <b>receiving</b> <b>devices</b> (other than their own identity). However, mobile software can use signals received from iBeacons to trigger their own push notifications.|$|E
50|$|In digital transmission, {{bit slip}} {{is the loss}} or gain of a bit or bits, caused by clock drift - {{variations}} in the respective clock rates of the transmitting and <b>receiving</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{baud rate}} {{detection}} on UART (ABR, autobaud) {{refers to the}} process by which a <b>receiving</b> <b>device</b> (such as a modem) determines the speed, code level, start bit, and stop bits of incoming data by examining the first character, usually a preselected sign-on character (syncword). ABR allows the <b>receiving</b> <b>device</b> to accept data from a variety of transmitting devices operating at different speeds without needing to establish data rates in advance.|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} networking, the Link Control Protocol (LCP) forms {{part of the}} Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), {{within the}} family of Internet protocols. In setting up PPP communications, both the sending and <b>receiving</b> <b>devices</b> send out LCP packets to determine {{the standards of the}} ensuing data transmission.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{maintain}} timing between transmitting and <b>receiving</b> <b>devices</b> is to employ an asynchronous protocol such as start-stop. Alternatively, bit slip can be prevented by using a self-clocking signal (such as a signal modulated using OQPSK) or using a line coding such as Manchester encoding.|$|E
