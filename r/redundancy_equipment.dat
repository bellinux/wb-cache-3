40|$|Estimates of {{the energy}} {{intensity}} of the Internet diverge by several orders of magnitude. We present existing assessments and identify diverging definitions of the system boundary as {{the main reason for}} this large spread. The decision of whether or not to include end devices influences the result by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. If end devices are excluded, customer premises equipment (CPE) and access networks have a dominant influence. Of less influence is the consideration of cooling equipment and other overhead, <b>redundancy</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the amplifiers in the optical fibers. We argue against the inclusion of end devices when assessing the energy intensity of the Internet, but in favor of including CPE, access networks, <b>redundancy</b> <b>equipment,</b> cooling and other overhead as well as optical fibers. We further show that the intensities of the metro and core network are best modeled as energy per data, while the intensity of CPE and access networks are best modeled as energy per time (i. e., power), making overall assessments challenging. The chapter concludes with a formula for the energy intensity of CPE and access networks. The formula is presented both in generic form as well as with concrete estimates of the average case to be used in quick assessments by practitioners. The following chapter develops a similar formula for the core and edge networks.

This research aimed to develop a tool to assist process plants with deciding on the best approach to use between increasing the <b>redundancy</b> of bottleneck <b>equipment</b> or to improve on the management of integrated logistic support principles like supply support, maintenance strategy and inventory management. It also made use of a case study process plant to analyse and improve the maintenance system around bottleneck centrifugal pumps. A decision making tool (framework) was developed and presented to assist with decision making around the stated problem. A survey conducted also affirmed the need for such a tool in industry. The decision of installing an extra pump per set to increase redundancy or to improve on the ILS of maintenance is split between 48 % against the installation and 43 % supporting the idea. This is an indication of how contentious this issue is without doing the proper analysis and using the right tools of decision making. Most decisions in industry are made on an emotional viewpoint based on the “head-aches” certain equipment gives. It was discovered that the case study plant utilises a run-to-failure philosophy on bottleneck pumps. This philosophy lead to production losses of 14 days over a 23 months span, equating to R 33, 2 million rand loss compared to R 2, 2 million sample period cycle cost of increasing redundancy...|$|R

These devices (both primary sensors & digital interfaces), which are typically very compact, have already been analysed & described by a WG of SC A 3 (publication imminent). However, even though digital communication methods are being used more often for new substations and for the modernisation of existing installations, the interface between high voltage equipment and low voltage equipment (so called " 0 / 1 interface") remains predominantly classical (100 V/√ 3, 1 or 5 A). To promote digital communication for this " 0 / 1 interface " and to obtain all the advantages of Information Technology, the development of a "Stand Alone Merging Unit " (SAMU) is under widespread consideration.

Power quality, reliability and availability have emerged as key issues for the successful operation of a data centre. Investigations are carried out into emerging technologies and their application in data centre power distribution systems for cellular {{networks in}} Africa. Best practices are applied to develop a power distribution system (PDS) with the objective of achieving optimal reliability and availability. Analytical techniques are applied to determine and compare the reliability and availability of various power systems. Minimal cut set simulations identify system weak points and confirm component selection. Components’ inherent characteristics (CIC) and system connectivity topology (SCT) are key factors in the improvement of data centre availability. The analysis practices can be used by engineers and managers as a basis for informed decision making in determining power system reliability and the availability of an existing or a new data centre design. Weak points in the PDS of a data centre causing downtime are identified through analysis, and accurate solutions can be determined to prevent or minimise downtime. System connectivity topology (SCT) techniques were identified that could increase the reliability and availability of data centres for cellular networks in Africa. These techniques include multiple incomers from the utility company, redundancy levels of critical equipment and parallel distribution paths. Two case studies were carried out on data centres for a cellular network, one in Nigeria and one in Cameroon.

This trend is likely to be even more important in the future. Installation and maintenance of underwater production and processing facilities is expensive, complicated and can cause problems. Solutions that facilitate easier maintenance operations, are an essential factor that reduces operating costs over time. SUBPRO is a combined research program between the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and industry partners, that are developing a concept to mitigate these problems. This concept is called "Subsea Gate Box", where one of the goals is to increase production from individual wells within the same well network. To achieve this, each well will be prepared for further processing, before they are commingled in a common manifold. Thereby, each well is to a higher degree accommodated with its own processing equipment. This thesis addresses modular architecture, and investigates solutions that can contribute to achieve a versatile process facility, as well as facilitating for an efficient installation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the Gate Box system. In order to identify important factors that are related to these subjects, and than be able to come with some suggestions, relevant theory and "state of the art"-solutions for existing systems have been investigated. Based on this, a number of requirements and specifications have been stated. Furthermore, these requirements and specifications are the basis for the solutions presented in two different cases, which contain various module architecture and connection systems.

40|$|The {{wind energy}} sector uses a mature yet {{continuously}} improving technology. The reliability of wind turbines and {{the efficiency of}} energy capture are both high, yet continue to improve with new designs, new components and new materials. Even non-technological aspects such as project management, better forecasts of wind energy production and better risks assessment are contributing to increasing the competitiveness of wind power and reducing its overall cost. This is sometimes achieved even if some cost areas can occasionally increase, e. g. capital costs due to the better quality of components. To further increase reliability, scientists and designers require better knowledge of loads, load effects and electrical effects in the mechanical and electrical parts of the turbine. They also require materials and basic components (e. g. electronic components of the electricity subsystems) that can stand higher temperatures and perform better at normal operating temperatures. In some areas reliability is improved through more <b>redundancy</b> of <b>equipment,</b> in particular in control and power electronics. The technological aspects of wind energy include: • Wind turbine components: blades, forgings (e. g. main shafts), castings (e. g. hubs, bearing housings and bed plates), pitch, control and yaw systems, generator, gearbox, bearings and shafts, and power electronics. • Design for manufacture, transport and installation; turbine assembly. • Offshore foundations design and manufacture; and foundations, cable and turbine installation. • Substations: switchgear, transformers, cables, circuit breakers, etc. The world wind market and the European offshore sectors are continuously growing although European onshore wind growth is less significant. Overall, the global annual market remains stable at around 40 GW of installed capacity, but this figure hides huge variations between individual markets. Cumulative installed capacity reached 240 GW {{at the end of}} 2011 and is expected to reach 285 GW {{at the end of the}} current year (2012). The 2011 manufacturers market continued to be dominated by Vestas and, as in 2010, it included four Chinese firms among the top-ten. However, the changes in the Chinese market are very significant as the 2010 market leader Sinovel (and 2 nd worldwide) is now 7 th worldwide. European firms, General Electric (US) and Suzlon (India) have a truly international reach whereas Chinese firms are still confined to the Chinese market. Capital expenditure (CapEx) or cost for wind installations vary greatly worldwide: unit costs in some countries can be triple those in other countries. Overall, 2011 CapEx for onshore wind averaged 1 580 €/kW, if Chinese and Indian installations are excluded (due to different cost methodologies), and the offshore figure reached 3 500 €/kW although from a low installed capacity basis. Operational costs (OpEx) are also very different onshore (21 €/MWh) and offshore (32 €/MWh, figures depend on assumptions such as capacity factors). There is a clear trend to lower prices in both CapEx and OpEx, possibly steeper in onshore than offshore OpEx and with very significant potential in offshore CapEx. This report presents a snapshot of the current situation of the wind sector from a technology and market perspective, and a detailed analysis of the economics of wind. It is the first of a series of annual reports which will not only include annual developments but also specific, one-off research into technology aspects of the wind sector. JRC.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of Virtual Reality ¿ VR ¿ {{is creating a}} computer-based experience normally by means of realistically simulated environments and associated interactions. A realistic, three-dimensional, interactive, real-time computer graphics model is key to 'cheating' someone's sensory perception system and make an individual feel inside, i. e., immersed, into the environment being simulated. Some simulators go beyond the visual experience and include other sensory information devices. Special devices provide {{the interaction between the}} individual and the environment. This interaction is normally tuned for specific application areas or fields of work. For some years the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has done R&D work on the application of VR based techniques to Nuclear Safeguards and Security. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe two VR based demonstrators. The first demonstrator aims at easing the design and planning for the installation of containment and surveillance devices at a nuclear site under Safeguards. In practice, this means choosing the appropriate equipment (e. g., surveillance cameras and optics) and accessories as well as selecting a suitable location in the real environment under surveillance. The Safeguards inspector can iteratively and interactively assess the vulnerability of the designed surveillance system by dynamically simulating different scenarios with moving items and characters, by changing sensor parameters and, if necessary, by introducing <b>redundancy</b> in the <b>equipment.</b> As a consequence, the nuclear inspector can increase her/his confidence in the design, both in terms of robustness and cost-effectiveness. S/he can further make a detailed preparation of the on-site installation, improving therefore the efficiency and reducing costs. The second demonstrator illustrates the use of VR technologies for a border security application, namely the training of customs officers when inspecting cargo trucks. Customs officers are key to the timely detection of illegal materials and sources during transportation and border crossing. The demonstrator follows typical customs procedures workflow, the aim being to let the officer getting acquainted with the use of radiation detection equipment within the context of his/her overall border security task. The demonstrator includes a radiation detector portal and comprises the operation by the customs officer of radiation detection equipment. Finally, in a more general perspective, the paper discusses the different ways that virtual-reality based tools can be used in radiation detection training, while minimising the use of radioactive sources.
