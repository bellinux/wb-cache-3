50|$|The FC (101) was {{the last}} Victor to have an engine with push rods and <b>rockers</b> <b>operating</b> the {{overhead}} <b>valves.</b> Victor FC models had racked up 238,000 sales by late 1967 when the 'Coke bottle'-shaped FD replaced it.|$|R
5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used <b>rockers</b> to <b>operate</b> two <b>valves</b> per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|The unusual {{combustion}} chamber arrangement with its angled valves {{also led to}} an unusual valve train. The block-mounted camshaft operates small wedge shaped rockers, one for each valve. In early models the camshaft acts on a simple pad on the rocker, but for later models this pad {{was replaced by a}} roller follower. The exhaust rockers act directly on the valves, whilst the inlet rockers act on pushrods running up to a second set of longer flat <b>rockers</b> <b>operating</b> the inlet <b>valves.</b> The Rover engine, like many 1940s and earlier British designs, was a small bore, long stroke (undersquare) engine to keep the RAC tax horsepower rating as low as possible, thus keeping the road tax as low as possible. The IOE layout enabled Rover to use larger valves than would normally be possible in a small bore engine, allowing better breathing and better performance.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} motorcycle engines had exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>operated</b> in {{the same}} way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The intake valve was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the intake valve arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and <b>rocker</b> arm to <b>operate</b> the intake <b>valve.</b>|$|R

The Rockers are known as the Nomad Chapter of the Hell's Angels.|$|R

50|$|Manually <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> {{work with}} simple levers or paddles where the {{operator}} applies force to <b>operate</b> the <b>valve.</b> Spring force is sometimes used {{to recover the}} position of valve. Some manual valves utilize either a lever or an external pneumatic or hydraulic signal to return the spool.|$|R

50|$|A {{solenoid valve}} is an electromechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve is {{controlled}} by an electric current through a solenoid: {{in the case of}} a two-port valve the flow is switched on or off; {{in the case of a}} three-port valve, the outflow is switched between the two outlet ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a manifold.|$|R

50|$|Safety during pigging {{relies on}} the strict {{adherence}} to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe <b>valve</b> <b>operating</b> sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to manual and motor <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> and the closure door. The interlocks block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.|$|R
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2½-litre engine has {{inclined}} {{overhead valves}} {{on either side}} of the cylinder head. They are opened by <b>rockers</b> <b>operated</b> by a single overhead camshaft which is driven by double roller chain. The S.U. carburettor is bolted to the cylinder head which may be removed with the valve train without affecting engine timing. The crankshaft has been given four bearings. The pistons are of aluminium and the connecting rods are steel. Cooling water circulates by pump.|$|R
25|$|Diving {{regulators}} use mechanically <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> In {{most cases}} there is ambient pressure feedback to both {{first and second}} stage, except where this is avoided to allow constant mass flow through an orifice in a rebreather, which requires a constant upstream pressure.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{isolation}} groups include the main steamlines, the reactor water cleanup system, the reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system, shutdown cooling, and the residual heat removal system. For pipes which inject {{water into the}} containment, two safety-related check valves are generally used in lieu of motor <b>operated</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves must be tested regularly as well to ensure they do indeed seal and prevent leakage even against high reactor pressures.|$|R
50|$|An {{air-operated}} valve {{is a type}} {{of power}} <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> that uses air pressure against a piston or diaphragm to produce linear or circular movement to operate a valve.Types are 2-way, 3-way and 4-way. The 2 way air-operated valves can be either normally closed or normally opened.|$|R
50|$|B16.44- Manually <b>Operated</b> Metallic Gas <b>Valves</b> for Use in Aboveground Piping Systems up to 5 psi.

40|$|The {{pressure}} wave generator {{is a critical}} component of a pulse tube refrigerator. Conventionally either a solenoid <b>operated</b> electromagnetic <b>valve</b> or a rotary valve driven by a hermetically sealed motor is used for this. In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> for use with pulse tube refrigerators. This, when coupled with an inverter drive (variable frequency drive), forms a versatile pressure wave generator in the range between 1 and 10 Hz. In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of pressure wave generator, refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure wave generators. While the rotary valve based pressure wave generator is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> based pressure wave generator overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R
