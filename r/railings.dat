5|$|Sri Temasek was {{not used}} {{for a number of}} years and fell into disrepair. It then {{underwent}} restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and <b>railings</b> on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on <b>railings,</b> doors and windows were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008.|$|E

5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, Siemens sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside stairs and <b>railings,</b> and moving lights to meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal <b>railings</b> added and the toilets removed. The speed was also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but {{because of the lack of}} capacity at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by Siemens.|$|E

Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E

The park containers Chinese-influenced gardens that include ginkgo trees and bamboo. A children's playground {{is located at the}} north end of the park.|$|E
50|$|An {{entirely new}} roadway deck was {{installed}} in 1987. The new road deck was a bonded post-tensioned concrete deck 90 ft in width. The roadway width remained the same, but the extra deck width allowed the sidewalks to be widened to 9 ft. The 1955 <b>railing</b> was removed, and a precast concrete parapet 2 ft high with 6 ft recessed panels between the balusters was installed.

5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with <b>railings</b> and decking.|$|E
5|$|From {{the north}} of the hall are two further approaches. The Eccleston Approach goes to the village of Eccleston, and {{slightly}} to the west, the Chester Approach bypasses the village, going through Eccleston Hill. Associated with these approaches are further listed buildings. Of these, the major structure is Eccleston Hill Lodge which was designed in 1881–82 by Douglas for the 1stDuke and is listed at GradeII*. This is a three-storey gatehouse tower with multiple attached smaller towers and a steeply hipped roof. The other structures are listed at GradeII and comprise Eccleston Lodge which was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894, its associated gates, piers and wing <b>railings,</b> a sandstone balustered causeway south of the lodge carrying the drive, a house called Eaton Boat, designed by Douglas about 1880, Garden Lodge designed by Waterhouse in 1881–83, a pair of gates, <b>railings</b> and screen walls adjoining the lodge dating from 1881–83 by Waterhouse, Stud Lodge storehouse and domestic offices, designed in 1883 by Douglas, the Stud Riding School, the Stud Stables, the house east of Stud, Eaton Estate Office, designed by Waterhouse in 1880, the North Lodge of 1881 by Waterhouse, the North Lodge gate and post from about 1881 also by Waterhouse, the Garden House of 1893 by Douglas and Minshull, and gates and gate piers to the south of Garden House.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The <b>railings</b> are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
50|$|In 1952, {{according}} to some recent reports, the authorities of the Soviet Union demanded {{the replacement of the}} statue of the angel with a statue of Joseph Stalin.A historic cast-iron <b>railing</b> around the column was removed during the Soviet period. The <b>railing</b> was restored in 2002.|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{gradually}} we {{must learn}} that our strength is to sit still; that to do well and suffer for it, instead of returning evil for evil, and <b>railing</b> for <b>railing,</b> is to show forth the spirit of Christ, and {{to enter into the}} joy of our Lord.|$|R
40|$|The hoard {{containing}} {{components of}} bronze <b>railing</b> {{was discovered in}} trench 7 during excavations at Mediana in 2000. Railing consists of cancelli and herms with busts of deities between them. Railing was constructed {{in such a way}} that it was possible to disassemble and reassemble it. Three cancelli one fragmented semicancellus cast together with herm and herms, one with bust of Aesculapius and other with bust of Luna. It could be concluded that <b>railing</b> consisted of two segments with passage between them. Male deities were represented on the left segment of the <b>railing</b> and female deities on the right segment. Detailed analysis revealed that Aesculapius as well as Luna bear strong mark of classical Greek and Hellenistic art, which experienced some kind of renaissance in the time of Constantine I. It is very probable that we can recognize the portrait of Faustina, Constantine’s wife in the portrait of Luna. According to the historical events the <b>railing</b> could have been produced before 325 AD when Constantine definitively accepted Christianity at Council of Nicaea. It is difficult to say where the <b>railing</b> had been produced. It had been most probably brought to Mediana during the stay of emperor Julian in Niš in 361. The sculptures found in one room of the villa with peristyle had probably been brought at the same time. The apse of triclinium of this villa had most likely been arranged as small shrine with bronze <b>railing</b> at its entrance. The <b>railing</b> was buried in 378 after battle of Adrianople and invasion of Goths in diocese Dacia...|$|R
