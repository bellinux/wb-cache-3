40|$|Abstract. Aluminum-copper alloys offer {{both high}} {{strength}} and excellent ductility {{suitable for a}} number of automotive applications to reduce vehicle weight; however, the alloys are difficult to cast because of their tendency for hot tearing. In this work, semi-solid <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> of an aluminum-copper alloy, B 206, was conducted in constrained rod casting molds to study the feasibility of using the process to reduce or eliminate hot tearing. To demonstrate the feasibility of <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> of the metal slurries, a fluidity test was also conducted. Results show that the hot tearing susceptibility of the aluminum-copper B 206 alloy cast in semi-solid state is lower than those cast in liquid state with high superheat temperatures. The grain size of the semi-solid cast Al-Cu samples appears to be finer than those cast in liquid state with high superheat temperatures. In addition, the metal slurries had sufficient fluidity to fill the molds even with low gravity pressures.

On the other hand, at higher load, mainly adhesive wear along with oxide formation is observed for <b>gravity</b> <b>cast</b> A 356 Al alloy and rheocast A 356 Al alloy, cast using a 45 degrees slope angle.

Accordingly, the rheocast sample, cast using a 60 degrees cooling slope, exhibits a remarkably lower wear rate at higher load compared to <b>gravity</b> <b>cast</b> and 45 degrees slope rheocast samples. This is attributed to the dominance of abrasive wear at higher load in the case of rheocast A 356 Al alloy cast using a 60 degrees slope.

40|$|Magnesium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundance}} element in nature, and it's characterised by a lower density than aluminium. These characteristics confer great potential to magnesium alloys, which are so used for specialised applications, like for military purposes and in the aerospace industry. While some magnesium alloys, including the AM 60 B alloy, are historically associated to high pressure die casting, for such applications the magnesium alloy components are usually produced by the <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> process, in order to minimise the defect's content and to achieve better castings' mechanical properties. Due to the fact that the combination of alloy and casting process represents a niche in the foundry processes panorama, in the literature there's a lack of specific contents regarding these issues. Hence the aim to fill the gap by studying these thematics and by looking for innovations in the <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> process of magnesium alloys. For these purposes, the overall process was analysed with the support of specific software for the numerical simulation of the casting process, to identify the process criticalities and the optimisable variables. The data so obtained were then used to design and build an experimental casting equipment, for foundry light alloys casting, which was subsequently used for the production of reference steps castings by <b>gravity</b> <b>casting.</b> The geometry of the die was designed considering the typical weight and thicknesses of the components produced by the aerospace industry. With the aim to establish a correlation between the process parameters, the resulting microstructure and the castings' final properties, several reference castings were produced by using an AM 60 B magnesium alloys, and then analysed. Static tensile tests and metallographic investigations were carried out on the specimens obtained from different thickness steps of these castings, and the data thus collected were subsequently processed and compared with those resulting from the numerical simulation of the whole casting process, allowing to establish a model to predict the castings' final properties by knowing only the process parameters. An operating protocol to produce, to characterise and to estimate the final properties of light alloy castings (produced by <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> process) was so defined.

The present paper describes the development of enhanced MMCs based on silicon carbide (SiC) foams made by the Schwartzwalder process. Therefore, foams with cell sizes of 30, 45 and 60 ppi (pores per inch) based on pressure less SSiC (sintered SiC) were developed. They were coated with layers of coarse SiC particles, which form a rough strut surface. The ceramic content of the foams could be increased to values of 20 - 30 mass%. Additionally, foam preforms based on clay-bonded SiC (as they are known from molten metal infiltration) were tested. The preforms were infiltrated with aluminium alloys AlSi 9 Cu 3 and AlSi 7 Mg(0. 6) and cast iron EN-GJSA-XNiCr 35 - 5 - 2 and EN-GJL- 250. For aluminium alloys HPC (high pressure die casting) as well as <b>gravity</b> <b>casting</b> was applied, whereas iron was only infiltrated by <b>gravity</b> <b>casting.</b> For HPC an excellent interlocking of metal and preform was observed because of the microporosity of the rough surface of the SSiC foam struts.

Microporosity in the ceramic coating and the typical hollow struts of the foams did not show metal infiltration. Even by use of moderate ceramic volume fractions pressure-infiltrated aluminium matrix composites showed a high specific stiffness of up to E/rho= 42 GPa. cm 3 /g compared to conventional Al or Mg alloys (E/rho = 25 - 27 GPa. cm 3 /g).

A smooth filling was found in all three casting processes, especially the low pressure casting exhibiting a better filling performance than the other two, but the solidification processes were different.
