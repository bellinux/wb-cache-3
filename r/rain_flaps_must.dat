30|$|The first {{description}} of a technique for closing oroantral fistula using a full-thickness palatal flap based on greater palatine artery dates back to Ashley [15]. Advantages of the palatal flap include high vascularity, generous thickness, and quality of tissue. Moreover, this flap is more resilient, less prone to infection, very resistant to lacerations, and {{does not lead to}} lowering of the vestibule. However, the most significant disadvantages are flap necrosis [15], exposed bony surface, pain, and development of surface irregularities as a result of secondary epithelialization post operatively [2]. In 1980, Ehrl employed this technique with wide fistulas of 1  cm in diameter [16]. The technique consists of excising the epithelium from its edges and incising the palatal fibro-mucosa so as to create a flap with a posterior base, supplied by the greater palatine artery. The anterior extension of the <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be wide enough to exceed the diameter of the bony defect and long enough to allow lateral rotation. Tension-free suturing should be performed [8].|$|R

50|$|Contraindications to {{pharyngeal}} flap surgical procedures, thus, include nominal {{measures of}} lateral pharyngeal wall adduction. Patients whose lateral pharyngeal walls negligibly adduct necessitate pharyngeal flaps that are wider in a mediolateral direction than patients with dramatic lateral pharyngeal wall adduction. As such, midsagittal pharyngeal flaps {{designed to be}} wide enough to mitigate palatopharyngeal incompetence in patients with minimal lateral pharyngeal wall adduction {{run the risk of}} being so wide they fail to allow the preservation of bilateral palatopharyngeal ports large enough to safeguard the capacity for nasal respiration. Patients with diminutive bilateral palatopharyngeal ports can postoperatively suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. With this in mind, pharyngeal flap surgical candidates should undertake a preoperative nasoendoscopic examination by an otolaryngologist, plastic surgeon, or speech language pathologist to assess the degree of lateral pharyngeal wall adduction. A preoperative assessment of such adduction can serve as a surgical guide to how wide a pharyngeal <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be to be efficacious.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the complex}} anatomy {{of the head and}} neck, a wide range of pedicled or free <b>flaps</b> <b>must</b> be {{available}} to ensure optimal reconstruction of the various defects resulting from cancer surgery. The supraclavicular artery island flap is a fasciocutaneous flap harvested from the supraclavicular and deltoid regions. The blood supply of this flap is derived from the supraclavicular artery, a direct cutaneous branch of the transverse cervical artery in 93 % of cases or the supraclavicular artery in 7 % of cases. The supraclavicular artery is located in a triangle delineated by the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle medially, the external jugular vein posteriorly, and the median portion of the clavicle anteriorly. This pedicled flap is thin, malleable, and is easily and rapidly harvested with a reliable pedicle and minimal donor site morbidity. It can be used for one-step innervated reconstruction of many types of head and neck defects. It constitutes an alternative to local flaps, while providing equivalent functional results and must {{be an integral part of}} the cancer surgeon's therapeutic armamentarium...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonate Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (BRONJ) is a newly {{recognized}} condition {{reported in}} patients treated with aminobisphosphonates (BF). BRONJ {{is defined as}} the presence of exposed necrotic alveolar bone that does not resolve over a period of 8 weeks in a patient taking bisphosphonates who has not had radiotherapy to the jaw. Treatment protocols have been outlined, but trials and outcomes of treatment and long-term follow-up data are not yet available. In 2004 an expert panel outlined recommendations for the management of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws. Through the histological study of the oral mucosa over the bone necrosis and around the osteonecrosis area in 8 patients affected by BRONJ at III stage, the authors highlight the inappropriateness of the local mucosal flaps to cover the losses of substance of the jaw, BF-related. METHODS: Mucosa tissue was taken from 8 patients, affected by BRONJ, III stage. The samples taken from the mucosa around and over the osteonecrosis area were fixed with formalin and an ematossilina-eosin dichromatic coloring was carried out. RESULTS: The samples of mucosa showed pathognomonic signs of cell suffering that prove that in these patients using local mucosa flaps is inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that only a well vascularized flap as free <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be used to cover the osteonecrosis area in patients with BRONJ stage III. Because of the structural instability of the mucosa in patients suffering of osteonecrosis Bf related the local flaps are prone to ulceration and to relapse...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} reasons were {{suggested}} for herniation at a donor site. First, anatomical defect is related. DCIA flap is harvested with the surrounding muscles to maintain blood supply. Defect of the surrounding muscles causes loss of anatomical barrier, which brings herniation when managed improperly [15]. The <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> include the skin, external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis muscle to keep the perforators. This makes bigger defect size and raises the possibility for herniation. Forrest et al. reported the incidence was 12  % (7 / 59) among osteocutaneous flaps, whereas the incidence was 4  % (1 / 23) among osseous flaps [16]. Second, we consider the general conditions of the patient such as history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, diabetes, gender, constipation, and smoking habits [4, 17]. Especially, obese patients have greater risk of incisional hernia due to increased intra-abdominal pressure [18]. Other perioperative factors including inadequate analgesia, vomiting, and postoperative pneumonia are also considered [4]. Furthermore, the risk of herniation may be exacerbated by denervation of rectus muscle [3]. Internal oblique muscle harvesting may bring this denervation through interruption of motor nerve supply [19]. We can prevent this denervation with precise dissection of the nerves, which lie between the internal oblique and transverse abdominal muscles [19]. In these cases, we consider that the primary reason is improper management of the surrounding muscles. Besides, we take harvesting of the internal oblique muscle, obesity, and previous heavy smoking habits into consideration.|$|R
30|$|We {{present an}} {{expanded}} latissimus dorsi musculocutaneus (LDMC) flap to treat circumferential upper extremity defects via resurfacing and “spiral reconstruction” in 5 patients during a 17 -year period. Five patients with different indications for tissue expansion from burns to congenital hairy nevi were operated. The expansion {{was done in}} a longitudinal direction, and a rectangular tissue expander (TE) was inserted under the LD muscle to expand the flap in a longitudinal direction thereby forming a “long” flap rather than a “wide” one. After excising the circumferential lesion, the expanded “elongated” flap was wrapped spirally around the extremity to cover the defect; the donor site was closed as usual. The 5 patients we treated via LDMC flaps in a spiral fashion were free of complications, and all {{were satisfied with the}} outcome. All the flaps survived and the spiral reconstruction allowed for a tension-free donor site closure and near complete recipient coverage. This technique is indicated for large circumferential extremity skin defects and deformities. Application of expanded LDMC flaps in a spiral fashion can be used by the reconstructive surgeon to resurface large circumferential upper extremity lesions when indicated. The idea of a long and thinned expansion <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be in a longitudinal direction and we need this long expanded and thin flap to “spiral” it around the extremity to cover a large defect. The “spiral” flap coverage introduced here for large circumferential extremity defects enables the surgeon to cover the defect with simultaneous donor site closure and good results.|$|R
40|$|Background. Often when {{planning}} implant therapy, {{there is a}} need to augment or  replace  bone  that  has  been  lost. The alveolar defects may occur as a result of tooth loss due to extraction, advanced periodontal diseases or trauma, long term use of removable appliances, dehiscence and fenestration defects, developmental defects/clefts, congenitally missing teeth and odontogenic cysts and tumors. Insufficient bone volume can be brought about by hard tissue augmentation. This techniques have led to increased predictability in reconstruction of alveolar ridge defects and functional implant placement. Purpose. To describe the methods of hard tissue augmentation which can be done with block grafts (autografts and allografts), particulate grafts (cortical and cancellous), xenografts, or synthetic materials. Review. The reconstruction of a normal alveolar housing, in height and width, is imperative to achieve a harmonious balance between biology, function, and aesthetics. Depending on the size and morphology of the defect, horizontal or vertical, various augmentation procedures can be used. Soft tissue management is a critical aspect of hard tissue augmentation procedures. Incisions, reflection, and manipulation should be designed to optimize blood supply and wound closure. The design and management of mucoperiosteal <b>flaps</b> <b>must</b> consider the increased dimensions of the ridge after augmentation as well as esthetics and approximation of the wound margins. The surgical procedure needs to be executed with utmost care to preserve the maximum vascularity to the flap and minimize tissue injury. Conclusion. Alveolar ridge defects can be classified by using Seibert’s classification or HVC System. The treatment of alveolar ridge defect before implant placement can be done with hard tissue augmentation...|$|R
40|$|Reconstitution of {{eukaryotic}} Okazaki fragment processing implicates both one- and two-nuclease pathways {{for processing}} flap intermediates. In most cases, FEN 1 (flap endonuclease 1) {{is able to}} efficiently cleave short flaps as they form. However, flaps escaping cleavage bind replication protein A (RPA) inhibiting FEN 1. The <b>flaps</b> <b>must</b> then be cleaved by Dna 2 nuclease/helicase before FEN 1 can act. Pif 1 helicase aids creation of long flaps. The pathways were considered connected only in that the products of Dna 2 cleavage are substrates for FEN 1. However, results presented here show that Dna 2, Pif 1, and RPA, the unique proteins of the two-nuclease pathway from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all stimulate FEN 1 acting in the one-nuclease pathway. Stimulation is observed on RNA flaps representing the initial displacement and on short DNA flaps, subsequently displaced. Neither the RNA nor the short DNA flaps can bind the two-nuclease pathway proteins. Instead, direct interactions between FEN 1 and the two-nuclease pathway proteins have been detected. These {{results suggest that the}} proteins are either part of a complex or interact successively with FEN 1 because the level of stimulation would be similar either way. Proteins bound to FEN 1 could be tethered to the flap base by the interaction of FEN 1 with PCNA, potentially improving their availability when flaps become long. These findings also support a model in which cleavage by FEN 1 alone is the preferred pathway, with the first opportunity to complete cleavage, and is stimulated by components of the backup pathway...|$|R

30|$|Reconstruction of {{soft tissue}} defects {{of the foot}} and the lower third of the leg remains a {{challenge}} for trauma and reconstructive surgeons due to poor vascularization and, often, exposure of the calcaneus bone and Achilles tendon. Obtaining weight-bearing repair of these defects requires large flaps with an abundant blood supply and successful anti-infection measures. Ideally, these flaps would fill the dead space and act as a “buffer layer,” accelerating healing. These <b>flaps</b> <b>must</b> be durable, allow a certain range of motion, have a satisfactory shape, retain sensation at the recipient site without loss of the main vessels, and require minimal sacrifice at the donor site. Management options include microsurgical free-flap transfers and pedicled muscle flaps among others, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages. Masquelet et al. [1] first developed the concept of neurocutaneous island flaps based on the cutaneous branches of the vascular axis around a superficial sensory nerve. The distally based flap pedicled with the vascular plexus surrounding the sural nerve has been widely used to fill lower leg, ankle, or foot defects [2 – 12]. However, the core gradients of these flaps, the vascular axis of the sural nerve and/or the lesser saphenous vein, were poorly understood.

Hypersensitivity and beaking of the nail have not been problems. It is difficult to provide satisfactory cover for fingertip amputations in which the stump is shorter volarly than dorsally. This paper describes a local flap which has been helpful in closing such amputations. The flap combines the volar V-Y advancement principle with a technique described by Snow (1967) which produces a well-contoured fingertip with good sensation. When Atasoy (1970) described the very helpful volar triangular V-Y advancement flap for closure of fingertip amputations, {{he noted that the}} flap is not useful in amputations in which the stump is shorter volarly than dorsally, because it cannot be mobilized enough for its leading edge to reach the end of the amputation site dorsally. In 1967 Snow described coverage of distal amputations of fingers by the volar advancement flap previously published by Moberg (1964) for thumb amputations. Although Snow did not stress it in the text of the article, his illustrations show a technique for cupping the distal end of the flap which neatly solves the problem when there is greater volar loss. The dorsal ends of the flap next to the nail bed margins are brought together to form a cup {{of the end of the}} flap (Fig. 1).

40|$|Recently, {{combined}} tissues or flaps {{have been}} used for the repair of extensively massive or wide defects resulting from radical wide resection. To further advance the development of combined tissue transfers, they should be reclassified. Based on our cases with free tissue transfers, we have created a new classification of combined flaps composed of "bridge", "chimeric", "siamese", "mosaic", and "chain-circle" flaps. The bridge flap is fabricated out together of separate flaps with short vascular pedicles. These form a compound flap supplied with a solitary vascular source. The chimeric flap is compounded from multiple different flaps but consists of only a single different tissue form. Each of the flaps is usually supplied by different branches from the same source vessel. It differs from the bridge flap in that the pedicle of each flap or tissue has some length for its movement for transfer. The siamese connected flap has 2 adjacent flaps that are simultaneously elevated, and a disparate vascular pedicle for each <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be reestablished. This connected flap has double isolated pedicles. Themosaic connected flap consists of 2 adjacent flaps that are simultaneously elevated, and the pedicle of the distal flap is anastomosed to the pedicle branch of the proximal flap in the "bridge" fashion. The vascular pedicle of the proximal flap is anastomosed to a single vascular source. The chain-circle flap has 2 or more flaps like the bridge and chimeric flaps, and the distal end of the vascular source is anastomosed to the branch of the recipient vessel. Based on results with our patients, the lateral circumflex femoral system seems to be the most suitable candidate for the axial pedicle of these combined flaps, because the system has several branches of large and small caliber, and several tissue components, such as the vascularized ilium, rectus femoris muscle, gracilis muscle, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and fascia lata, are located nearby...|$|R

At review after 18 to 36 months, after a second arthroscopy in eight cases, 44 ofthe 50 knees had retained significant improvement and 33 were symptom-free. Chondral flaps on the articular surface of the knee, which do not involve bone, were described by O’Don-oghue (I 966), Dandy (198 1) and Johnson-Nurse and Dandy (1985), but there have been no reports on the result of treatment. Chondral <b>flaps</b> <b>must</b> be differentiated from other conditions, including osteochondritis dissecans and articula r cartilage degeneration. Osteochondritis dissecans shows a bony component on radiographs and raw hone can often be seen arthroscopically. Soft degenerative fibrillation of articular cartilage has a distinct appearance (Fig. I) which {{is very different from the}} well-defined chondral flap surrounded by normal articular cartilage. Chondral flaps may be associated with an area of frank degeneration but this is easily recognised by the presence of an area of bare bone. latrogenic chondral flaps have a different shape; the edge of a sharp trocar produces long thin flaps (Fig. 2) in contrast to the thick flaps which produce symptoms. This paper reports a retrospective review of patients in whom chondral flaps (Fig. 3) were the main pathologi-cal lesion diagnosed and treated by arthroscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Significant chondral flaps were seen in 77 knees in 70 patients arthroscoped over a three-year period before November 1983. In 27 knees in 24 patients there had been an additional diagnosis or the arthroscopy had been an urgent one and there had been no previous long-term symptoms. Thus, in 50 knees in 46 patients, a chondral flap had apparently been the sole cause of symptoms. Th...|$|R

In opera-tions done because of chronic ear disease the likelihood of such a cavity can be reduced with proper preopera-tive evaluation and selection of an appropriate surgical approach. 1 In skull base operations most patients have a normal pneumatized mastoid, which {{will result in a}} large postoperative mastoid cavity. Various surgical techniques {{to reduce the size of}} the surgical defect have been developed. Removal of the mastoid tip and floor of the external auditory canal will allow soft tissue from the neck to collapse into the mas-toid, reducing the final size of the cavity. This will occasionally result in retraction of the lower ear into the surgical defect. Palva 2 - 4 has described a number of local soft-tissue flaps to help reduce cavity size. The most popular ÒPalvaÓ flap is a periosteal flap based on the concha of the ear, which is then folded into the mastoid cavity. 2 - 5 This flap can also be based posteriorly on the mastoid cortex and temporal artery. An anterior superiorly based temporalis muscle flap can be rotated in the cavity but may narrow the meatus of the cavity. 6 - 8 An inferior periosteal flap based on the sternocleidomastoid muscle is also useful. Blaine and Sismanis 9 recently reported the use of the inferiorly based sternocleidomastoid muscle flap for cavity reduction. Frequently a number of techniques and flaps are combined to help reduce cavity size. These all use periosteum and muscle, which must heal by secondary intention. The postauricular myocutaneous (PMC) flap uses a postauricular skin, periosteal sternocleidomastoid mus-cle, and soft tissue paddle based on the auricular branch of the occipital artery. 10, 11 This not only helps to reduce cavity size but also promotes more rapid epithelializa-tion of the cavity. Preoperative plans to use the PMC <b>flap</b> <b>must</b> be made to plan incision lines...|$|R
40|$|The noise {{technology}} {{relating to}} blown-flap systems is reviewed. There are three general sources of noise: turbomachinery, airframe, {{and the interaction}} noise of the jet blowing on the flaps. The latter noise-source area is the most critical and the main subject dicussed. Characteristics of lower surface blown and upper surface blown systems are described, including noise spectra, directivity, jet velocity characteristics, aircraft geometric variation effects, and aircraft forward speed effects. Noise reduction concepts are described, including slowing down the jet flow field by devices and engine cycle modifications, structural geometry and shielding modifications, local flow field modifications of the passive and active type, and the absorption of noise. It is concluded that, while there has been considerable progress {{in the past several}} years, low noise characteristics in blown <b>flap</b> aircraft <b>must</b> be largely built in by better application of low noise principles during the design...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of the free fibular <b>flap</b> operation, clinicians <b>must</b> be aware of the risk of complications because there are multiple factors that could result in rhabdomyolysis, such as duration of the operation, position of the subject, and existing conditions of diabetes and hypertension. Therefore, close monitoring of certain measures is required, and it is recommended that procedures may be divided into two or three stages to avoid prolonged muscle compression when prolonged surgical time is anticipated. Once a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is confirmed, a prompt treatment plan should be made and applied as soon as possible. This will increase the chance of a full recovery for the patient who is exhibiting symptoms of rhabdomyolysis.|$|R
