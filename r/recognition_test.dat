25|$|Researchers {{investigated}} {{the role of}} spatial memory and visual memory {{in the ability to}} complete arithmetic word problems. Children in the study completed the Corsi Block Task (forward and backward series) and a spatial matrix task, as well as a visual memory task called the house <b>recognition</b> <b>test.</b> Poor problem-solvers were impaired on the Corsi Block Tasks and the spatial matrix task, but performed normally on the house <b>recognition</b> <b>test</b> when compared to normally achieving children. The experiment demonstrated that poor problem solving is related specifically to deficient processing of spatial information.|$|E

2500|$|Ease-of-Recognition Judgments: This type of JOL {{predicts the}} {{likelihood}} of future recognition. Subjects are given a list of words and asked to make judgments concerning their later ability to recognize these words as old or new in a <b>recognition</b> <b>test.</b> This helps determine their ability to recognize the words after acquisition.|$|E
50|$|Explicit {{effects are}} {{measured}} by recall or <b>recognition</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjects {{are asked to}} name the products {{that he or she}} noticed (free recall). This survey can be also aided by giving additional information like a specific product category. At <b>recognition</b> <b>tests,</b> a selection of products is shown to the interviewed person, who then needs to select the ones that he has seen before.|$|R
50|$|The rhinal cortex is {{proposed}} {{to be part}} of the neural circuit for explicit memory.Studies comparing the results of selective lesions to the hippocampus and to the rhinal cortex, found that lesions to the hippocampus only did not cause impairment on object <b>recognitions</b> <b>tests,</b> but lesions to the rhinal cortex only, caused severe anterograde and retrograde impairments on object <b>recognition</b> <b>tests.</b> The conclusion was that object recognition (semantic memory) depends on the rhinal cortex.|$|R
50|$|The {{robustness}} of the DRM {{effect and}} {{the simplicity of}} the experimental methods were welcomed in an area of research where small effects and elaborate stimuli were the norm. Furthermore, this paradigm allowed researchers to move past their reliance on <b>recognition</b> <b>tests</b> for false memories. Recall tests are better at showing false memories than <b>recognition</b> <b>tests</b> because subjects are required to access and recall the memory in full themselves, rather than being able to rely on some sense of familiarity. Roediger and McDermott were able to demonstrate a robust effect using recall tests as well as <b>recognition</b> <b>tests,</b> while employing simple word-list stimuli. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the experiments were able to show that subjects not only confidently recognised the nonpresented word, but that they consciously remembered this lure appearing on the list, rather than relying on some feeling of familiarity to make an ‘old’ judgement.|$|R
2500|$|The second main type {{of memory}} is {{implicit}} memory or unconscious memory, {{which refers to}} the changes in performance or behavior that are produced by previous experiences but without any conscious recollection of those experiences. [...] An {{example of this is}} a <b>recognition</b> <b>test,</b> where patients are asked to determine, after surgery, which of a selection of words could be heard to during the surgery. [...] The following scenario is an example. [...] Patients were exposed during anesthesia to a list of words containing the word [...] "pension". Postoperatively, when they were presented with the three-letter word stem PEN___ and were asked to supply the first word that came to their minds beginning with those letters, they gave the word [...] "pension" [...] more often than [...] "pencil" [...] or [...] "peninsula" [...] or others.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were a few}} {{primarily}} {{right hemisphere}} tasks Genie did not perform well on. On one memory for design test she scored at a [...] "borderline" [...] level in October 1975, although she {{did not make the}} mistakes typical of patients with brain damage. In addition, on a Benton Visual Retention Test and an associated facial <b>recognition</b> <b>test</b> Genie's scores were far lower than any average scores for people without brain damage. Although these contrasted with observations of Genie in everyday situations, researchers wrote that they anticipated these results. Curtiss' explanation was that these tasks likely require use of both hemispheres, noting that previous results on the memory for design test found a negative impact from abnormal brain function in either hemisphere, and that these would therefore be very difficult for Genie since she exclusively used her right hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|Odor {{recognition}} {{is the most}} common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor <b>recognition</b> <b>test</b> participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. [...] More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a delay period is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) {{is the same as the}} one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition decisions that are made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may enhance memory for olfactory stimuli. [...] There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for perceptual information as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels.|$|E

As different emotions may be expressed in different ways, a fixed modality-specific dominance measured by some rules for all people or emotions is not enough.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example of}} this is empirically shown, specifically, in a study by Morris and {{associates}} (1977) using semantic and rhyme tasks. In a standard <b>recognition</b> <b>test,</b> memory was better following semantic processing compared to rhyme processing (the levels-of-processing effect). However, in a rhyming <b>recognition</b> <b>test,</b> memory was better for those who engaged in rhyme processing compared to semantic processing.|$|E

5000|$|Standardizing facial {{memory and}} {{perception}} testing is key for ensuring accurate diagnosis of prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia. Many face perception and memory tests {{have been developed}} and used by researchers in the past including the Warrington Recognition Memory for Faces, Benton Facial <b>Recognition</b> <b>Test</b> and later, The Cambridge Face Perception Test and Cambridge Face Memory Test, which were developed {{in order to address}} the shortcomings of the first two tests. [...] The Warrington Recognition Memory tests [...] "contain abundant non-internal facial feature information" [...] and the Benton Facial <b>Recognition</b> <b>Test</b> allows the test subject to [...] "rely on feature matching strategies using the hairline and eyebrows rather than recognizing the facial configuration".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Recognition</b> <b>tests</b> do {{not require}} {{participants}} to produce a word from memory. Instead participants are literally shown a word, and are asked to report {{whether it was a}} word that appeared during the study phase. <b>Recognition</b> <b>tests</b> typically show all of the studied words and a number of non-studied words, the lures. Researchers measure how often participants correctly recognize studied items, and how often they incorrectly recognize lures. The difference between these two proportions is a statistic measuring one's ability to discriminate between studied and non-studied items, and has been used to represent RIF. [...] Reaction time is also used to represent RIF, where slower reaction times are thought to represent more RIF due to difficulty in recognizing the studied item.|$|R

40|$|The word-frequency mirror effect (more {{hits and}} fewer false alarms for low-frequency than for {{high-frequency}} words) has intrigued memory researchers, and multiple accounts {{have been offered}} to explain the result. In this study, participants were differentially familiarized to various pseudowords in a familiarization phase that spanned multiple weeks. <b>Recognition</b> <b>tests</b> given {{during the first week}} of familiarization replicated a result of W. T. Maddox and W. K. Estes (1997) that failed to show the classic word-frequency mirror effect for pseudowords; however, <b>recognition</b> <b>tests</b> given toward the end of training showed the classic mirror pattern. In addition, a stimulus-frequency mirror effect for 2 ̆ 2 remember 2 ̆ 2 vs. 2 ̆ 2 know 2 ̆ 2 judgments was obtained. These data are consistent with an account of the mirror effect that posits the involvement of dual processes for episodic recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} "phonetically balanced lists" or "PB-word lists" {{are often}} used related to the material intended for speech audiometry testing. This thesis looks into how these expressions {{can be related to}} the word material used in speech audiometry for speech <b>recognition</b> <b>testing.</b> The study concludes that phonemic balance, if any, is the preferred concept when describing the existing word lists. Further more the study shows that attempts to approximate a phonemic balance in word material intended for speech <b>recognition</b> <b>testing</b> has little relevance. Finally the study also indicates that word difficulty, word frequency and commonness has an impact on the recognition scores. These factors may be more relevant to consider {{in the development of a}} new material, but further research is needed before any conclusions can be drawn in relations to the material used for speech audiometry testing.

40|$|Neural {{oscillations}} in the theta band {{have repeatedly}} {{been implicated in}} successful memory encoding and retrieval. Several {{recent studies have shown}} that memory retrieval can be facilitated by reactivating memories during their consolidation during sleep. However, it is still unknown whether reactivation during sleep also enhances subsequent retrieval-related neural oscillations. We have recently demonstrated that foreign vocabulary cues presented during sleep improve later recall of the associated translations. Here, we examined the effect of cueing foreign vocabulary during sleep on oscillatory activity during subsequent <b>recognition</b> <b>testing</b> after sleep. We show that those words that were replayed during sleep after learning (cued words) elicited stronger centroparietal theta activity during recognition as compared to noncued words. The reactivation-induced increase in theta oscillations during later <b>recognition</b> <b>testing</b> might reflect a strengthening of individual memory traces and the integration of the newly learned words into the mental lexicon by cueing during sleep...|$|R
