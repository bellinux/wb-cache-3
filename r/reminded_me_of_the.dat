Its copper dome <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. —Gwyneth Lewis ...|$|E
500|$|The {{composer}} Granville Bantock was enlisted as musical {{director in}} 1897 at the ballroom to provide music each weekday {{for six hours}} of ballroom dancing. To begin with, as the tower was being erected, {{he was in charge}} of a [...] "semi-military band" [...] that played outdoors with the fear that the tower might fall upon him and his players. Bantock is quoted as saying, [...] "The noise of the riveting of the tower while we were playing... <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anvil music in Das Rheingold". Bantock often played for the workmen during their lunch breaks, when they could frequently be heard saying, [...] "play it again, guv'nor".|$|E
500|$|Flaming Pie is {{the tenth}} solo studio album by Paul McCartney {{under his own}} name, first {{released}} in 1997. His first studio album in over four years, it was mostly recorded following McCartney's involvement in the highly successful Beatles Anthology project. The album was recorded in several locations over two years, 1995 and 1997, featuring two songs dating from 1992. The album featured several of McCartney's family members and friends, most notably McCartney's son, James McCartney. In Flaming Pies liner notes, McCartney said: [...] " [...] <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Beatles' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs.

500|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel {{called the}} LP [...] "probably the most {{valuable}} contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver", praising it for being completely dissimilar from anything the Beatles had done. The magazine Cheetah gave the album a rave review, observing that [...] "the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its Rousseau-like animals and forest, and {{the smoke from the}} cabin chimney spelling out the title.... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood." [...] Journalist Richard Goldstein remembers his review for The New York Times: [...] "I was struck by its fragile melodies and their relationship to sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now 'hushed with wonder,' <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fauré Requiem, but they were utterly American." ...|$|E

Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene lauded Räikkönen's drive as [...] "absolutely spectacular", adding: [...] "If you look at the overtake around the outside of [...] Ricciardo, he <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver from the old times.

[...] Lewis Hamilton rued his second unfortunate start incident in a row, which he described as [...] "perhaps [...] more painful" [...] than the incident at the previous race.

500|$|While the {{hurricane}} was passing nearby, Grand Turk reported winds of 120mph (193km/h). According to a ship {{report in the}} region, [...] "The force of the wind... could only {{be judged by the}} noise made by the storm, which <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York subway going full speed passing switches." [...] Winds approached 120mph (193km/h) at Nassau before the anemometer failed. In addition to the winds, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, totaling 9in (228mm) in Nassau. As in Puerto Rico, authorities in the Bahamas had ample warning of {{the hurricane}}'s approach, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. Two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in Grand Turk, although the crews were saved. A sloop traversing from Ambergris Caye to Grand Turk was lost, killing all 18people on board. The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Bahamas, mostly to property and crops.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was [...] "a film of sensitivity, {{observation}} and humor – a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less {{taken by the}} maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well... If you still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, {{you should know that}} this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it.

2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, {{the man who wrote}} 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
