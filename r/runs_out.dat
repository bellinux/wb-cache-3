5|$|As in the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with. Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time, allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost. At certain points, an inactive character's life bar may flash, giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in. If the life bar of either of a player's fighters <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> that player loses the round. If time <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round.|$|E

5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|At E3 2012, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land, which hosts Luigi's Ghost Mansion, a multiplayer minigame based on Luigi's Mansion. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to drain the energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time <b>runs</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Last Man Standing: Similar to Deathmatch, the player's {{objective}} is to remain alive longer than their opponents, putting an emphasis on number of deaths rather than kills. Players start with all weapons (except the Redeemer) available, fully loaded, and have a set number of lives. Power-ups, including health and ammunition packs, are unavailable. Once a player <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> of lives, they lose.|$|E

50|$|Unlike some horror films, the character's weapons can <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of bullets, the {{chainsaw}} will <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of gas and, while {{magic is}} the only way to win the game, the character can <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of power. The character can die easily, hence use of the save game feature is suggested.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E

5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> their bank is reduced by half.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the percentage of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits made by patients who recently <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of their inhaled short-acting beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids and to characterize this understudied patient population. A secondary analysis was performed of data from four ED-based multicenter studies of acute asthma during 1996 – 1998 (n 64 EDs). In each study, consecutive adult patients, aged 18 – 54 years, with acute asthma underwent a structured interview that assessed running out of inhaled medications. The analytic cohort comprised 1095 adults. Overall, 324 patients (30 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 27 – 32 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of either of their inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids during the week before their index ED visit; 311 (28 %; 95 % CI, 26 – 31 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists per se. Among a subset of 518 patients on inhaled corticosteroids, 55 patients (11 %; 95 % CI, 8 – 14 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids. In the multivariable model, predictors of running out of an asthma medication were male sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, no insurance, lower household income, and use of EDs as the preferred source of asthma prescriptions (all p 0. 05). Among patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of medications, 49 % (95 % CI, 43 – 55 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled beta-agonists and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 – 84 %) <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of inhaled corticosteroids, before onset of their acute asthma symptoms. In 1095 adult ED patients with acute asthma, we found that 30 % <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of their inhaled asthma medications before the ED visit. Asthma patients who <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of medications had sociodemographic characteristics that may help with identification of preventable ED visits. Multifacete...|$|R
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake <b>runs</b> <b>out</b> of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer <b>runs</b> <b>out,</b> their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} restart the game from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel.

If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
