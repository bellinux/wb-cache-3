In {{some parts}} of their range, green turtles {{maintain}} grazing plots in seagrass beds by regular <b>regrazing.</b> The effects of simulated repeated grazing on subtropical seagrasses in Moreton Bay, Australia were investigated in a manipulative experiment over summer. Three seagrass species were subjected to two different clipping frequencies (simulating turtle cropping) and compared with unclipped controls over a 3. 5 -month summer period for the effects on seagrass biomass, leaf size and regrowth rates and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and starch content. The order of the seagrass species ’ relative tolerance to simulated grazing was Halophila ovalis>Zostera capricorni>Cymodocea serrulata. Frequent <b>regrazing</b> of the green turtle’s preferred seagrass, H. ovalis, resulted {{in an increase in}} leaf regrowth rate so that standing biomass of leaves and total plant material was maintained, suggesting an increase in productivity. Furthermore, whole-plant concentrations of WSC increased significantly in clipped H. ovalis plants relative to unclipped controls. In contrast, leaf biomass of the seagrass species less preferred by turtles, Z. capricorni andC. serrulata, decreased in response to repeated leaf removal relative to controls, despite maintenance of leaf regrowth rates. C. serrulata responded to repeated clippingwith a reduction in leaf size and a decrease in rhizomeWSC concentration. Z. capricorni also produced fewer and smaller new leaves. The ability of the preferred species,H. ovalis, to increase production of nutrient-rich standing crop in response to <b>regrazing</b> has major implications for green turtles and other seagrass grazers...|$|E

40|$|Grazing herbivores are {{a common}} tool in wetland {{conservation}} management. This thesis studied the effects of continuous grazing by livestock in the freshwater meadow/fen wetland Steinsvika in Southeast Norway. By visual assessment and biological monitoring, soil surface properties, condition of grasses, signs of animal presence and other points of interest were observed and registered. Registrations were conducted through five transects in one month intervals throughout the grazing season of 2012. Results showed that under continuous grazing at low stock density, livestock overgraze patches of grass by <b>regrazing</b> fresh regrowth. This leads to reduced resilience of palatable plants, giving competitive advantage to unpalatable species. In populations of unpalatable species, woody species find refuge to develop, and wetlands most likely move towards a new successional level of shrub. The thesis discusses suggestions on how future grazing of wetlands can be conducted as an ecosystem approach. By subdividing the wetland into homogeneous vegetation zones and flood prone areas, and controlling density and duration of grazing, livestock may provide more predictable results, when management goals is to keep succession at a specific level. This way of managed grazing may influence bird habitats, wanted and unwanted species, nutrient runoff as well as animal welfare and performance in a more considerate way than when managing livestock merely based on stocking density per grazing period (140 days) ...|$|E
50|$|Similar to ruminants, such as {{cattle and}} sheep, alpacas have only lower teeth {{at the front}} of their mouths; therefore, they do not pull grass up by the roots. Rotating {{pastures}} is still important, though, as alpacas have a tendency to <b>regraze</b> an area repeatedly. Alpacas are fiber-producing animals; they {{do not need to be}} slaughtered to reap their product, and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly.|$|R
40|$|Patterns of grazing on {{individual}} crested wheatgrass plants were studied using scale maps of plant basal outlines within randomly located plots. The occurrence and extent (part of plant grazed, stubble height) of grazing on each plant was recorded on the maps at {{two and three}} day intervals throughout a grazing treatment. Allometric equations for estimating phytomass from plant photosynthetic volume were generated using nonlinear regression analysis. Equations were specific to year. The percent weight remaining in the stubble of a grazed plant was estimated using a second-order polynomial equation relating cumulative percent plant height to cumulative percent plant weight. A modified bootstrap analysis was used due to the autocorrelated nature of these data. These equations were used to estimate the percent biomass grazed from individual plants. The presence of standing dead culms substantially reduced the severity of grazing {{on individual}} crested wheatgrass plants. This effect was most pronounced for large plants. The deterrence effect of xiii standing dead culms declined as plants matured, but remained an important factor affecting grazing severity. The pattern of grazing on crested wheatgrass plants was examined under three grazing systems: 1) continuous season-long grazing (CSLG), 2) high intensity grazing (approximately 60 percent utilization in eight days), and 3) short duration grazing. For all grazing treatments, a lower proportion of small plants was grazed than medium and large. Only under CSLG were small plants grazed more severely than large plants. Under all ocher grazing treatments, medium and large plants were grazed as severely as small plants. The proportion of plants <b>regrazed</b> was low when grazing began at the boot phenological stage and regrowth was minimal. It was higher when grazing began at later phenological stages, presumably due {{to the presence of}} regrowth. The proportion of small grazed plants that were <b>regrazed</b> was much lower than the proportion of large grazed plants that were <b>regrazed.</b> The re grazing event, however, involved, on average, more of the previously ungrazed portion of a plant than the part which had been grazed before. These results indicate that grazing of regrowth on crested wheatgrass pastures under CSLG may not be a serious problem...|$|R
