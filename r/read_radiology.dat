30|$|Radiologists are {{frequently}} interrupted during {{the interpretation of}} medical images. The current research provides the first attempt to quantify {{the effect of these}} interruptions using an experimental design. In our study, we found that interruptions lead to a significant increase in task completion time. Through the use of eye-tracking, we were able to determine that this inefficiency is driven by impaired memory for previously searched areas of the image. In natural settings, these results translate to longer patient turnaround times and increase the cost of providing and receiving healthcare. By establishing a causal link between interruptions and productivity loss, we aim to encourage healthcare providers to reduce unnecessary interruptions in <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> rooms. In addition, our eye-tracking results hint at potential interventions, such as eye-tracking feedback, that may help lower the cost of unavoidable interruptions.|$|R

30|$|Interruptions {{have been}} {{identified}} as a prevalent and potentially harmful occurrence in <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> rooms. A recent workflow analysis found that radiologists are interrupted once every 12.1 min on average during regular business hours (Ratwani, Wang, Fong, & Cooper, 2016). These interruptions are primarily in the form of medical questions during in-person or phone-call interactions. During after-hours radiology, interruptions may be even more common. At many academic institutions, after-hours phone calls are handled by a single radiology resident (Balint et al., 2014). A recent study found that on-call radiologists receive an average of 72 phone calls during a typical 12 -h overnight shift (Yu, Kansagra, & Mongan, 2014). This rate of interruption equates to a 59 % chance of being interrupted by a phone call for every 10 min spent reading a computed tomography (CT) scan. In a separate analysis of after-hours reading environments, increases in phone-call volume were associated with {{an increase in the number}} of errors made by radiology residents (Balint et al., 2014). Similarly, interruptions have been linked to medical errors in other tasks, such as dispensing medication (Westbrook, Woods, Rob, Dunsmuir, & Day, 2010).|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionThere is no {{established}} {{consensus on}} the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} traumatic fracture-dislocation of the femoral head – largely due to the rarity of this injury. HypothesisAnalysis of a large series of fracture-dislocations of the femoral head using a single coherent classification should enable the means of diagnosis and treatment of fracture-dislocations of the femoral head to be specified. ObjectivesThe hypothesis was tested by analyzing a retrospective series of 110 patients charts admitted between 1972 and 2008, using Pipkin's classification and an alternative new one, Chiron's classification. Material and methodsThe series comprised 21 women and 89 men; mean age: 37. 1 years. Dislocation was posterior in 102 cases and anterior in eight. Associated lesions comprised 46 fractures of the acetabulum and four of the femoral neck. Classification following Pipkin and Chiron was based on double <b>reading</b> of <b>radiology</b> documents from 102 patients. Treatment was exclusively conservative in 32 cases, and surgical in 78, with 51 posterior, 19 anterior and four medial approaches and four arthroscopic procedures. Surgery comprised osteosynthesis of the femoral head in 30 cases and of the acetabulum in 16, removal of fragments in 40 cases and total hip replacement (THR) in five cases as a primary treatment. ResultsMean follow-up was 37 months. THR was performed in 25 cases: five as a primary treatment and 20 secondarily, 15 of which were performed within the first 6 months. Significant predictive factors for THR were: old age, Chiron grade 3, and femoral neck fracture. The THR and non-THR groups differed on the Chiron but not on the Pipkin classification {{at the time of the}} injury. Specific treatments were not predictive of evolution. Fragment removal was more often by a posterior than an anterior or medial approach. ConclusionThe Chiron classification showed prognostic value for evolution to THR; to be reproducible, it needs to be based on CT data. No particular mode of treatment emerged as preferable. Better initial lesion analysis should enable prognosis and target indications. Level of evidenceLevel IV Retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|The {{vigilance}} decrement {{describes a}} decrease in sensitivity or increase in specificity with time on task. It has been observed {{in a variety of}} repetitive visual tasks, but little is known about these patterns in radiologists. We investigated whether there is systematic variation in performance {{over the course of a}} <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> session. We re-analyzed data from six previous lesion-enriched radiology studies. Studies featured 8 – 22 participants assessing 27 – 100 cases (including mammograms, chest CT, chest x-ray, and bone x-ray) in a reading session. Changes in performance and speed as the reading session progressed were analyzed using mixed effects models. Time taken per case decreased 9 – 23 % as the reading session progressed (p[*]<[*] 0. 005 for every study). There was a sensitivity decrease or specificity increase over the course of reading 100 chest x-rays (p[*]=[*] 0. 005), 60 bone fracture x-rays (p[*]=[*] 0. 03), and 100 chest CT scans (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). This effect was not found in the shorter mammography sessions with 27 or 50 cases. We found evidence supporting the hypothesis that behavior and performance may change over the course of reading an enriched test set. Further research is required to ascertain whether this effect is present in radiological practice...|$|R
40|$|For softcopy-reading of mammograms, a room {{illuminance}} of 10 lx {{is recommended}} in standard procedures. Room illuminance affects both the maximal monitor contrast {{and the global}} luminance adaptation of the visual system. A radiologist observer has to adapt to low luminance levels, when entering the reading room. Since the observer's sensitivity to low-contrast patterns depends on adaptation state and processes, it would be expected that the contrast sensitivity is lower {{at the beginning of}} a reading session. We investigated the effect of an initial time of dark adaptation on the contrast sensitivity. A study with eight observers was conducted in the context of mammographic softcopy-reading. Using Gabor patterns with varying spatial frequency, orientation, and contrast level as stimuli in an orientation discrimination task, the intra-observer contrast sensitivity was determined for foveal vision. Before performing the discrimination task, the observers adapted for two min utes to an average illuminance of 450 lx. Thereafter, contrast thresholds were repeatedly measured at 10 lx room illuminance over a course of 15 minutes. The results show no significant variations in contrast sensitivity during the 15 minutes period. Thus, it can be concluded that taking an initial adaptation time does not affect the perception of lowcontrast objects in mammographic images presented in the typical softcopy-reading environment. Therefore, the reading performance would not be negatively influenced when the observer started immediately with reading of mammograms. The results can be used to optimize the workflow in the <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> room...|$|R
30|$|Given the {{relationship}} between interruptions and errors observed in other types of tasks, it is somewhat surprising {{that we did not}} find this effect (Altmann, Trafton, & Hambrick, 2014; Li, Blandford, Cairns, & Young, 2008; Westbrook et al., 2010). In applied settings, interruptions have most often been studied in sequential computer tasks, where errors are typically step omissions or repetitions (Trafton, Altmann, & Ratwani, 2011). However, very little research has been done in the realm of visual search, which has fundamentally different types of errors. One possible explanation for our results is that participants engaged in a speed/accuracy tradeoff in which errors were prevented by sacrificing time. This type of tradeoff can be experimentally induced in an interrupted data-entry task by extending the resumption lag or manipulating the time-cost penalty (Brumby, Cox, & Back, 2013). In our task, participants were instructed to be as accurate as possible and no emphasis or constraints were placed on completion time. Although search was impaired in the moments following the interruption, the same degree of lung coverage could be achieved by spending more time on the image as a whole. Unfortunately, unconstrained time is a luxury that is not available in the <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> room and institutions are often evaluated on their report-turnaround time. If there is a finite amount of time available for each case, the reader might terminate search prematurely and miss diagnostically relevant information. Future studies will aim to shed light on {{the relationship}} between speed and accuracy costs in interrupted medical image search.|$|R
40|$|To {{define the}} {{diagnostic}} precision of non-specialized readers in {{the detection of}} type 2 endoleaks (T 2 EL) in arterial versus venous phase acquisitions, and to evaluate an approach for radiation dose reduction. The pre-discharge and final follow-up multi-slice CT angiographies of 167 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Image data were separated into an arterial and a venous phase <b>reading</b> set. Two <b>radiology</b> residents assessed the reading sets {{for the presence of}} a T 2 EL, feeding vessels, and aneurysm sac size. Findings were compared with a standard of reference established by two experts in interventional radiology. The effective dose was calculated. Overall, experts detected 131 T 2 ELs, and 331 feeding vessels in 334 examinations. Persistent T 2 ELs causing aneurysm sac growth > 5 mm were detected in 20 patients. Radiation in arterial and venous phases contributed to a mean of 58. 6 % and 39. 0 % of the total effective dose. Findings of reader 1 and 2 showed comparable sensitivities in arterial sets of 80. 9 versus 85. 5 (p = 0. 09), and in venous sets of 73. 3 versus 79. 4 (p = 0. 15), respectively. Reader 1 and 2 achieved a significant higher detection rate of feeding vessels with arterial compared to venous set (p = 0. 04, p < 0. 01). Both readers correctly identified T 2 ELs with growing aneurysm sac in all cases, independent of the acquisition phase. Arterial acquisitions enable non-specialized readers an accurate detection of T 2 ELs, and a significant better identification of feeding vessels. Based on our results, it seems reasonable to eliminate venous phase acquisitions...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Background and Significance The first physician to encounter a child with an elbow fracture is usually the emergency medicine (EM) physician. Many hospitals may {{not have access to}} immediate orthopedic consultation or “real-time” <b>radiology</b> <b>reads,</b> therefore, EM physicians have a great responsibility for an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, many EM physicians have little training in pediatric orthopedic injuries. The elbow's anatomy and radiographic features of the growing elbow increase the difficulty in determining an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment. Inaccurate interpretation of elbow fractures in children may lead to unnecessary or improper medical decisions. Accurate interpretation is especially important in rural settings where patients may need transportation to facilities with higher levels of care. Research Question This study aims to survey EM physicians and determine if certain elbow fractures are diagnosed inaccurately more frequently and if some physician characteristics share a relationship with the accuracy of diagnosis of pediatric fractures. The characteristics include area of specialization, annual ED volume, years of experience post residency training, and working in an academic versus non-academic department. Different types of fractures, including type 1 supracondylar, type 2 supracondylar, type 3 supracondylar, medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon along with uninjured elbows were evaluated to determine if a particular type was misdiagnosed more frequently. Methods A 16 -question multiple-choice paper survey was distributed to physicians working in academic and non-academic centers within adult or pediatric emergency departments. Questions included radiographs and asked the physician to determine which fracture existed, if any.

40|$|The 21 st {{century has}} brought {{numerous}} {{changes to the}} clinical reading (i. e., image or virtual pathology slide interpretation) environment of pathologists and {{it will continue to}} change even more dramatically as information and communication technologies (ICTs) become more widespread in the integrated healthcare enterprise. The extent to which these changes impact the practicing pathologist differ {{as a function of the}} technology under consideration, but digital "virtual slides" and the viewing of images on computer monitors instead of glass slides through a microscope clearly represents a significant change in the way that pathologists extract information from these images and render diagnostic decisions. One of the major challenges facing pathologists in this new era is how to best optimize the pathology workstation, the reading environment and the new and varied types of information available in order to ensure efficient and accurate processing of this information. Although workstations can be stand-alone units with images imported via external storage devices, this scenario is becoming less common as pathology departments connect to information highways within their hospitals and to external sites. Picture Archiving and Communications systems are no longer confined to radiology departments but are serving the entire integrated healthcare enterprise, including pathology. In radiology, the workstation is often referred to as the "cockpit" with a "digital dashboard" and the reading room as the "control room. " Although pathology has yet to "go digital" to the extent that radiology has, lessons derived from <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> "cockpits" can be quite valuable in setting up the digital pathology reading room. In this article, we describe the concept of the digital dashboard and provide some recent examples of informatics-based applications that have been shown to improve the workflow and quality in digital reading environments...|$|R
30|$|One {{limitation}} to {{this study}} is the unrealistic nature of the interruption task. Radiologists {{are not likely to be}} interrupted with an urgent call to solve math problems. They are far more likely to be interrupted by a phone call from a colleague with a question about another patient (Ratwani et al., 2016). In order to resolve the question, the radiologist might pull up medical images from another patient, which would effectively interleave two or more visual search tasks. The interruptions in our study were limited in frequency to once per image and relatively short in duration (~ 40 s for easy interruptions compared to 2.4 min in the real world, according to Ratwani et al., 2016). Furthermore, real cases typically consist of several images and much larger CT scans than the images used in our study. As the number and size of the images increases, interruptions likely become more frequent and recovery might become more difficult. The effects we observed in our study were fairly small. However, these factors suggest that our interruptions may have been relatively less disruptive than the interruptions that occur in the <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> room. Nonetheless, further work is needed to determine how the magnitude of the interruption cost is influenced by these factors in applied settings. Another limitation of this study is that our participants were undergraduate students with no medical experience. The characterization of expert search through volumetric images is still in its infancy, but there is substantial literature demonstrating that radiologists search through 2 D medical images in a qualitatively different manner than novices (for a review, see Krupinski, 2000). Radiologists also benefit from being more familiar and comfortable with interpreting medical images, which might allow task-relevant information to be more strongly encoded for later recall. Although it is unlikely that experts are immune to the effects of interruption, this research should be considered with this limitation in mind until more ecologically valid studies are completed using experts.|$|R
3000|$|Radiology {{has always}} been {{categorised}} as a medical specialty that mainly provides support to clinicians. There {{are only a few}} other medical specialties that are also seen as supportive, such as pathology and anaesthesiology. However, these other specialties have always had a completely different position within the hospital environment compared with radiology. They have 100  % direct contact to patients or patient-related specimens and they also have a specialist knowledge which is undisputed and recognised as unique. No clinician will try to read tissue specimens or perform his own general sedation; apart from the fact that this would lead to a serious malpractice case, it is just not done. However, a clinician reading radiological images is very common and sometimes the reporting by the radiologist is only an economic formality. In 2009, Dr. Rafel Tappouni presented a survey, held in his own hospital at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) about how clinicians deal with radiology reports [1]. More than 90  % of the respondents said they were comfortable interpreting X-rays; in 55.3  % all of the time and 35.8  % some of the time. More than half said they were equally competent at interpreting computed tomography (CT) exams, with 31.4  % for any CT exam and 37.2  % for selective exams only. Depending on the type of exam, between 60  % and 73  % of the respondents <b>read</b> the entire <b>radiology</b> report that they received. I am afraid these data have probably not improved over the years. What it says is that around 40  % of clinicians only value the pictures but do not need the report with it. How often a report is not read and a clinician solely relies on [...] his own interpretation is unknown. In 2000, Margulis and Sunshine [2] wrote about this development which may lead to the risk that clinician specialists may come to believe that radiologists do not contribute sufficiently to the care of patients to justify their presence.|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there exists}} no {{strategy}} for evaluating digital <b>radiology</b> <b>reading</b> rooms. This {{is of concern}} since the number of symptomatic radiologists suffering from work related musculoskeletal problems {{seems to be on}} the rise. Work related musculoskeletal complaints {{have been shown to be}} related to workstation set up, chair settings, monitor placement and other issues related to the computer workstation. Due to the visually intensive nature of the work of radiologists working with digital medical images, it is also important to look at factors in the ambient environment, such as lighting. A checklist was developed to evaluate environmental factors in the work environment of radiologists. The checklist contained 39 questions divided into sections on display screens, input devices, workstation and workstation accessories, chair and ambient conditions. The items in the checklist were taken from checklists and educational material published for example by independent researchers, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and the Canadian Standards Association. Answer options for each item consisted of factual statements, measurements, rating or a simple description. Some answer options included images for postural comparison. The checklist was not accompanied by a scoring sheet, but items that, if answered in a particular way, could be classified as ?Ergonomic Issues? were identified in the checklist instructions and layout. To evaluate the checklist, a mailing survey was sent to practicing radiologists, hospital administrators, ergonomists and other health and safety professionals. In the survey, respondents were asked four questions, both open ended and closed-ended, relating to the usability, layout and overall comprehensiveness of the checklist. The experts were also encouraged to provide general comments on the checklist. Twelve non-factual items or items that required rating or subjective scoring were tested with multiple rater agreement (interrater reliability) and by percent agreement between participants and between participants and an ergonomist. The individual items were tested by asking participants to base their answers based on a series of standardized images depicting a model radiologist performing various tasks, such as reading an image from a computer monitor, use a computer mouse and telephone. Twenty one participants, aged 18 - 58 years old completed the Interrater reliability - Individual Item Test. Six were male and 15 female. Eight participants were experts, or had background in ergonomics, facility planning and management or similar human-environment relations fields. The Interrater reliability of the items tested was. 50 (p< 0. 05) for the experts, and 0. 10 for the novices (p< 0. 05). When the results of participant agreement for individual items were analyzed, four items had consistently lower agreement. Three of these items were modified in accordance with expert feedback and one was excluded from the final version of the checklist. The final version of the checklist contained 43 items. Limitations to this study include the design of the individual item test, not utilizing realistic situation with participants actually observing a radiologist at work, but basing their ratings off images that were not consistent in terms of posture and content. Further limitations also include the limited number of expert feedback received. In spite of the idea that invested experts would provide good feedback, it would prove beneficial to know why some experts chose not to participate. Future research directions include a more comprehensive test of the checklist, both including the entire checklist as well as testing the checklist in actual digital reading rooms. An interesting application of this type of environmental checklist is to adapt it for computer based use, utilizing either portable hospital computer workstations or palm pilots would enable synchronization of information in a centralized facility database as well as instant access to results and possibly feedback. It would be very interesting to see an interactive version of this checklist developed and tested in the future. This is particularly relevant with hospital environments becoming increasingly a digital workplace...|$|R
