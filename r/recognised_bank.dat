Her cabin was all stuck round with glaring coloured prints of the Virgin--the Virgin of Newfoundland, they called her. Harvey found his French of no <b>recognised</b> <b>Bank</b> brand, and his conversation was limited to nods and grins. But Tom Platt waved his arms and got along swimmingly. The captain gave him a drink of unspeakable gin, and the opera-comique crew, with their hairy throats, red caps, and long knives, greeted him as a brother. Then the trade began. They had tobacco, plenty of it--American, that had never paid duty to France. They wanted chocolate and crackers. Harvey rowed back to arrange with the cook and Disko, who owned the stores, and on his return the cocoa-tins and cracker-bags were counted out by the Frenchman's wheel. It looked like a piratical division of loot; but Tom Platt {{came out of it}} roped with black pigtail and stuffed with cakes of chewing and smoking tobacco. Then those jovial mariners swung off into the mist, and the last Harvey heard was a gay chorus: ...|$|E

In Australia, {{there is only one}} device available that can assist blind people recognise their notes.

This paper discusses a new device, the MoneyTalker that takes advantage of the largely different colours and patterns on each Australian bank note and recognises the notes electronically, using the reflection and transmission properties of light. Different coloured lights are transmitted through the inserted note and the corresponding sensors detect distinct ranges of values depending on the colour of the note. Various classification algorithms were studied and the final algorithm was chosen based on accuracy and speed of recognition. The MoneyTalker has shown an accuracy of more than 99 %. A blind subject has tested the device and believes that it is usable, compact and affordable. Based on the devices that are available currently in Australia, the MoneyTalker is an effective alternative in terms of accuracy and usability.

40|$|I {{have two}} aims with this paper. Firstly, I {{would like to}} extract lessons for theory and policy from Japan’s {{experience}} with banking crises. As such, this paper falls {{into the body of}} research on banking crises, recent works within which include Caprio and Klingebiel (1996), Caprio et al. (2005), Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2005), Werner (2005), Beck et al. (2006), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2008). Secondly, I aim to gain insights into the link between the banking sector and the economy (which are again of importance for both theory and policy). This is an important topic that has slowly but steadily grown to a substantial body of literature. Many authors <b>recognise</b> that <b>banks</b> are ‘special’ in some way (Fama, 1985, Bossone, 1999, James and Smith, 2000, Ashcraft, 2005), and that the link between the banking sector and the economy is of great importance (King and Levine, 1996, Levine, 1997). However, the precise details of just what makes banks special, as well as the precise nature of their link to the economy have remained unclear or at least disputed. Analysing crises may help elucidate these issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose a model to assess risk for banks. Its main innovation is to incorporate endogenous interaction between <b>banks,</b> <b>recognising</b> that the actual risk to which an individual bank is exposed also depends on its interaction with other banks and other private sector agents. To this end, we develop a two-period general equilibrium model with three active heterogeneous banks, incomplete markets, and endogenous default. The setting of three heterogeneous banks allows us to study not only interaction between any two individual banks, but also their interaction with the rest of the banks in the banking system. We show that the model is analytically tractable and can be calibrated against real UK banking data and therefore can be implemented as a risk assessment tool for financial regulators and central banks. We address the impact of monetary and regulatory policy as well as credit and capital shocks in the real and financial sectors. ...|$|R

On Tuesday, 10 November 2015, Dino Melaye, a Nigerian senator representing Kogi West, raised a motion that the {{operation of}} the treasury single account (TSA) be investigated for possible corruption. He claimed that [...] "the appointment of REMITA, an e-collection agent, is a gross violation of section 162 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution and the banks and other Financial Institutions Act." [...] He claimed the constitution only <b>recognised</b> a <b>banking</b> institution to be the collector of government funds, that Remita was not a bank.The provision of the Constitution cited by Melaye states, “the federation shall maintain a special account to be called the federation account into which all revenues collected by the government of the federation except the proceeds from the personal income tax of the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Federation, the Nigeria Police Force, the ministry or department of government charged with foreign affairs and the residents of the FCT, Abuja.” According to Melaye, the total inflow of 1% commission charged and received by SystemSpecs for all revenue collected on behalf of the government from the various ministries, departments and agencies to be 25 billion Naira as of November, 2015 was fraud and must be returned to the account of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

40|$|Asset prices offer useful {{information}} for monetary policymakers in the short-term, yet their significant relationship to primary policy-indicators is debated. In one view bubbles {{are difficult to}} <b>recognise</b> and central <b>banks</b> should act just against the adverse consequences of their unwinding. The opposite view advocates ‘pre-emptive’ monetary policy as financial imbalances accumulate aiming to forestall such consequences. After reviewing the debate, we evaluate ‘pre-emptive’ monetary policy when financial stability is an explicit objective replacing the output-gap. Modelling a game between a central bank and the financial sector similar to Barro and Gordon (1983), we examine monetary policy under commitment and discretion. In contrast to the relevant literature, we conclude that pre-emptive monetary policy succeeds in better controlling inflation, anchoring inflation expectations and imposing more discipline to the financial sector when committed to a rule. The model is extended to incorporate incomplete information about the policy objectives. We evaluate the effect of vagueness about the central bank’s preferences for financial stability in the behaviour of the central bank and the financial sector, and how reputation-building affects the conduct of discretionary policy. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our conclusions {{in the light of}} the global financial crisis initiated in August 2007...|$|R
40|$|Any {{economic}} activity {{calls for the}} exercise of moral judgement. There are some economic activities that actively promote collective benefit as a primary or secondary aim, and there are others that aim to increase {{the value of a}} firm. Investment decisions always have collective impact, but collective returns may be ignored or considered less important in company management if the objective is the maximisation of shareholder wealth. The allocative function exercised by banks in their credit activity may take this into account. Some banks nowadays focus on social profile, while others integrate the traditional approach with this new sensibility. But unfortunately banking regulations governing stability and soundness of the financial system make no mention of the social profile. The New Basel Capital Accord was an opportunity to <b>recognise</b> that a <b>bank's</b> objectives may not consist only of the maximisation of shareholder wealth. But it was a missed opportunity, in that it gave advantages to traditional commercial banks and not to banks focussing on collective goals. This paper puts forward proposals for integrating the Basel II framework with profiles of collective bank credit policy. Social credit evaluation methods could help to identify those ethical banks which are more successful in meeting collective objectives. A sustainable credit appraisal methodology could have been examined by the Basel Committee and could have incentivated sustainable banking by giving it specific advantages...|$|R
