5000|$|To load a tape, an {{operator}} would remove the protective ring (frequently called a [...] "tape seal belt" [...] because its {{purpose was to}} prevent humidity and dust on the media) from {{the outside of the}} tape reel and install the tape on the supply hub, then thread the tape leader through the various <b>roller</b> <b>assemblies</b> and onto the take-up reel, installing three or four winds of tape to provide enough friction for the take-up motor to be able to pull the tape. The operator then initiated an automatic sequence, often by a single press of a button, that would start the vacuum system, then move the tape forward until the beginning-of-tape (BOT) foil strip was detected by an optical sensor in the tape path. The control electronics would then indicate to the controlling computer that the unit was ready for operation.|$|R

Special fire trap rollers for nitrate were also available, to comply with fire regulations in some jurisdictions. Separate magnetic and analog optical audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components. The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad <b>roller</b> <b>assemblies,</b> reel spindles and the lens, {{and in some cases}} making minor adjustments to the lamphouse. This procedure can be completed by a competent projectionist in 5-10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.|$|R

50|$|In the {{conventional}} arrangement, the front roller is mounted centrally, {{forward of the}} chimney. In order to allow enough clearance from the boiler (and hence a larger front roll), the smokebox is extended forward substantially at the top to incorporate a support plate on which to mount the bearing for the <b>roller</b> <b>assembly.</b> This gives the distinctive, hooded look {{to the front of}} a steam roller. It also necessitates a different design of smokebox door - it has to hinge up or down, rather than opening sideways, due to the limited access available. Access to the boiler tubes for cleaning is limited and the brush usually has to be inserted through the small gap between the top of the roll and the fork.|$|E

50|$|Fine {{pulverized}} coal exits the outlet section through multiple discharge coal pipes {{leading to the}} burners, while oversized coal particles are rejected {{and returned to the}} grinding zone for further grinding.Pyrites and extraneous dense impurity material fall through the nozzle ring and are plowed, by scraper blades attached to the grinding table, into the pyrites chamber to be removed.Mechanically, the vertical roller mill is categorized as an applied force mill. There are three grinding <b>roller</b> wheel <b>assemblies</b> in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each <b>roller</b> wheel <b>assembly</b> rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and <b>roller</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|R

40|$|A Shuttle type of {{aircraft}} (10) with an escape hatch (12) has an arcuately shaped pole housing (16) attachable to an interior wall and ceiling with its open end adjacent to the escape hatch. The pole housing 16 contains a telescopically arranged and arcuately shaped primary pole member (22) and extension pole member (23) which are guided by <b>roller</b> <b>assemblies</b> (30, 35). The extension pole member (23) is slidable and extendable relative to the primary pole member (22). For actuation, a spring actuated system includes a spring (52) in the pole housing. A locking member (90) engages both pole members (22, 23) through notch portions (85, 86) in the pole members. The locking member selectively releases the extension pole member (23) and the primary pole member (22). An internal one-way clutch or anti-return mechanism prevents retraction of the extension pole member from an extended position. Shock absorbers (54) (150, 152) are for absoring {{the energy of the}} springs. A manual backup deployment system is provided which includes a canted ring (104) biased by a spring member (108). A lever member (100) with a slot and pin connection (102) permits the mechanical manipulation of the canted ring to move the primary pole member.

40|$|The {{importance}} of cable driven APMs (Automated People Movers) {{has become much}} higher in the recent years, for hourly capacities up to nearly 8 - 9 thousand passengers per direction. This is due also to their undeniably competitive energy consumption per passenger and per km since {{they do not need}} to be provided with a motor on board and - consequently - neither the mechanical transmission to the wheels nor a structure suitable for such weights; this leaves power transmission to a mechanical component with small inertia, such as a steel wire rope. However, in any rope transport system based on a carrying-hauling rope, a relevant part of energy losses comes from rollers and related <b>roller</b> <b>assemblies,</b> in particular from the interaction between the metal rope and the rubber on rollers. So, having the possibility to quantify and, possibly, reduce their contribution to energy losses may result in positive effect on the overall energy performance of APMs. The temperature of rubber increases under cyclic loads; this is due to hysteresis losses and low rubber thermal conductivity. This paper presents a new procedure to assess the generation of heat in the ropeway roller with rubber band. The procedure consists in assessing hysteresis loss, i. e. the dissipated energy within the rubber band, by an analytical procedure. The model works with a limited number of data and without direct experimental measures on the rubber compound, which would be hardly feasible in practice. The dissipated energy obtained was used as an input for steady state thermal analysis. Verification of the proposed procedure was performed by comparing the simulation results to the data obtained experimentally during the periodical tests that have been developed in various plants. This model allows obtaining a preliminary value about the actual roller energy consumption, in order to provide a better comparison between different urban transport systems in terms of energy consumption...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines.

40|$|Surface {{wear and}} {{spalling}} phenomena {{are the most}} important factors affecting roller bearing performance and operational lifetime, in terms of number of cycles the bearing can operate. Although bearing life has been traditionally defined by the onset of spalling, as specified by international standard ISO 281, this definition does not always reflect the real operational conditions, since bearing wear can also represent a failure criterion when excessive run-out occurs. In such cases, bearing life needs to be predicted according to the amount of bearing run-out resulting from wear due to load and number of cycles. In the current study, the wear phenomenon has been modeled using the Archard wear and Lemaitre damage models, both included in a numerical simulation of a <b>roller</b> bearing <b>assembly.</b> Wear and damage models, along with the results of accelerated life experiments, have been used to develop a reliable method enabling bearing life prediction with a minimal number of material characterization tests.

The concept was analyzed using closed-form and finite element techniques, to size structural members for a range of joint diameters and to determine necessary equivalent stiffnesses for the roller assemblies. Also, a mass study of the system was conducted to determine its practicality, and maximum loads in the joint were identified. To obtain the optimum balance between high stiffness and low structural mass {{in the design of the}} rotary joint, it is necessary to maximize the diameter of the annular ring within operational constraints (i. e., shuttle cargo bay size). Further, a rotary joint designed with the largest possible ring diameter will result in minimum operational loads in both the roller assemblies and the transition truss members while also allowing minimum design stiffnesses for the roller assemblies...|$|E
