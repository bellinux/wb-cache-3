25|$|A load on a {{framework}} {{is a system}} of forces on the vertices (represented as vectors). A stress is a special case of a load, in which equal and opposite forces are applied to the two endpoints of each edge (which may be imagined as a spring) and the forces formed in this way are added at each vertex. Every stress is an equilibrium load, a load that does not impose any translational force on the whole system (the sum of its force vectors is zero) nor any <b>rotational</b> <b>force.</b> A linear dependence among the rows of the rigidity matrix may be represented as a self-stress, an assignment of equal and opposite forces to the endpoints of each edge that is not identically zero but that adds to zero at every vertex. Thus, a set of edges forms an independent set in the rigidity matroid {{if and only if}} it has no self-stress.|$|E

[...] The amount of <b>rotational</b> <b>force</b> is thought to be the major component in concussion and its severity.

2500|$|Torque {{is defined}} mathematically as {{the rate of}} change of angular {{momentum}} of an object. The definition of torque states that {{one or both of the}} angular velocity or the moment of inertia of an object are changing. Moment is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied forces to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called torque in physics). For example, a <b>rotational</b> <b>force</b> applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a torque. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a bending moment), but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not called a torque. [...] Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a torque.|$|E

The obtained results provide a clear indication that the <b>rotational</b> drag <b>force</b> can be successfully applied to explaining a wide variety of observational phenomena ranging from flat rotational curves of galaxies and Tully- Fisher relation to origination of spiral galactic arms, galactic bars, and galactic warps as well as anomalous Pioneer 10 / 11 acceleration and possibly high-velocity galactic clouds.
