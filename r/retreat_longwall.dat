Stress relief occurred in the tailgate pillars following the passage of the longwall face.

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes an}} application of numerical methods for the prediction of strata methane flow into mine workings around a longwall coal face employing methane drainage. This method of methane prediction was developed by solving the time-dependent gas flow equation using the finite element analysis. Having obtained the gas pressure distribution throughout the finite element mesh, a mass flow equation was derived to calculate methane flow rate for a given mining boundary. A computer program for the prediction of methane flow was then developed by devising appropriate modifications and additions to a finite element package originally written for heat flow by PAFEC limited. Stress analysis was also carried out {{in order to provide}} an understanding of stress fields around a longwall face to evaluate the induced permeabilities under these stress fields. Three main routines of the original package required modifications to accommodate the solution of a different equation. These were element routines, solution routines and flux calculation routines.

40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of <b>retreat</b> <b>longwall</b> mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model.

40|$|Abutments form {{due to the}} {{redistribution}} of stresses around excavations. In longwall mining, these stresses can redistribute {{in front of the}} longwall panel (front abutment), over the chain pillars and intersections (side abutments) and into the goaf (goaf abutments). Front abutments are a key factor for barrier pillar design and can significantly affect secondary support performance. Front abutments for single seam mining operations can be detected using empirical methods, however these methods are not useful for multiple seam mining operations. This paper investigates the effects multiple seam mining has on the extent of the front abutment, requiring the secondary support to be installed well ahead of the <b>retreating</b> <b>longwall</b> face. This paper focuses on the examination of longwall abutments by analysing GEL extensometer data in order to identify the point where the total displacement exceeds 3 mm. Preliminary results suggest that the remnant pillars located in upper workings increase the detection distance by 125 % and the goaf abutments in the upper workings decrease the total range by 50 %.

For situations where the roof may be subjected to tensile horizontal stress, immediate support by equally spaced short vertical tendons is required.

40|$|Longwall mining has {{historically}} been considered an application for only deep reserves. This {{has changed in the}} recent past as longwall has become competitive with surface mining. Many resources marked for stripping now lie in the domain of longwall. Today, the best longwall mines compete with strip mines operating in even the lowest stripping ratios. Longwall mining has become more widely applicable than it ever {{has been in the past}} and it is now generally considered the method of choice in situations where high levels of coal production are required. But the best way to use longwall mining has become less certain with the opportunities that highwall access provides. Wall-to-wall mining is the use of <b>retreating</b> <b>longwall</b> developed from and retreating toward a highwall. As a surface mine reaches its ultimate highwall, the opportunity for longwall punch mining or wall-to-wall mining is obvious. There are several clear operating advantages to operating a longwall in this way and where highwalls are available, the best economic decision will generally favor planning a direct approach. Yet wall-to-wall is not applicable in every situation even when highwalls are available. Moreover, the advantages of wall-to-wall mining do not always justify the cost of trenching or box cuts to access coal. However, many tactical advantages of operating from the highwall can be realized with the use of specially equipped blind drilled or raised bored shafts.

In addition, the cross-measure bore-holes on panel B were drilled parallel to the face, whereas those on panel A were drilled at a 45 O angle with respect to the longwall axis. The studies show that the cross-measure system captured 71 pct of the methane generated by longwall mining on panel A. On panel B, the sur- face gob hole dominated over the cross-measure system for about 700 ft (213 m) after it was intercepted. Beyond that point, the cross-measure system dominated. About 93 pct of the methane generated on panel B was captured by the two systems. Cross-measure boreholes that were drilled parallel to the face were as effective as boreholes oriented 45 " with respect to the longwall axis.

BACKGROUND Present longwall practice Longwall mining is a capital intensive inflexible system which can yield very high production when things go right. It is generally suitable for operation in geologically uniform situations where the panel width can be maintained and where the panel length is adequate to justify the cost of moving the machinery between panels. It is limited in the range of height in which {{it can be used to}} those that permit miners to work safely. This means about 1. 5 to 4. 0 m, or higher if top level caving is used.

40|$|Punch {{longwall}} mining {{takes advantage of}} the final highwall exposure in an open cut coal mine, driving gateroads straight into the targeted coal seam then <b>retreating</b> the <b>longwall</b> back to just short of the highwall. A designed barrier pillar remains between the final longwall position and the highwall, which is subject to redistributed ground stresses. Material is strained to magnitudes unlike those typically measured in open-cut mining, and unlike typical longwall ground behaviour, the highwall was observed to strain in an opposite direction to the longwall caved and subsidence zone. Mine personnel and equipment may become exposed to the unstable highwall rockfall hazards, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanism and implementing appropriate controls. This paper describes the assessments undertaken through radar, survey prism and Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) monitoring, as well as geotechnical inspection and analysis. Initial results show highwall movement is directly correlated with longwall goafing and any delayed ground movements are more related to the rate of retreat, the type of goafing behaviour and the influence of strata deteriorating in other locations along the face of the highwall. This paper also describes climatic conditions as the primary limitation with radar monitoring. In addition, diurnal steel mesh movement was measured with changing atmospheric temperature. Steel mesh is usually installed as ground support above portal entries to the underground workings. By filtering out any measured mesh movement, true trends of strata deformation in these areas can be identified. Recommendations are made for efficient and reliable radar data acquisition. Further recommendations are made to restrict people and plant access to a safe standoff from the highwall as the longwall approaches the final retreat position within the panel. Effective monitoring of highwall performance throughout the <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> to establish stable trends will enable continued, safe access to these locations...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{models have been}} developed based upon field data collected from a longwall mine in New South Wales, Australia to study the behaviour of goaf gas flow in both active and sealed goaf areas. A base CFD model was built to represent the goaf situations when the active <b>longwall</b> <b>retreats</b> near the finish-offline. Results from the base model were calibrated and compared against field goaf gas monitoring data. The base model was then used to carry out parametric studies to investigate a number of operational scenarios {{and their impact on}} goaf gas behaviour. CFD modelling results indicate that the overall goaf gas flow pattern changes as the operating <b>longwall</b> <b>retreats</b> towards finish-offline. In all cases, oxygen penetration into the active goaf remains high, reaching 15 per cent or higher, even at some 800 m behind the longwall face. The modelling results also indicated that {{it would be difficult for}} early detection of an active goaf heating (on the maingate side) based upon CO readings in the return airflow, as the main stream of the gaseous product will be flowing into the sealed deep goafs in adjacent longwall (LW) panels. Monitoring points (such as tube bundles and bag sampling points) should be selected at deep seated seals along the active goaf so that abnormal CO or C 2 H 6 readings can be picked up for early detection and location of potential heating spots; goaf inertisation can be better achieved by injecting inert gas such as nitrogen at deeper points (3 ̆e 200 m) behind the operating longwall; the injection of in-seam drainage methane into the goaf areas will only have a limited impact on goaf inertisation as much of the injected methane will migrate towards deep and higher parts of the goaf due to its buoyancy effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{longwall}} gateroad roof support for roadway development and panel extraction has typically relied on past panel experience. If strata conditions {{and depth of}} cover are reasonably uniform, this approach has merit. However, as geological or geotechnical conditions vary {{the need for a}} more rigorous design is required to provide safe working conditions and the calculations and justification for compliance and statutory purposes. Current roadway roof support design approaches have limitations, which have restricted their applicability. Analytical methods are available and are certainly applicable for more massive sedimentary rock-masses, but may not be appropriate when rock-mass yield occurs due to high mininginduced stresses. The application of complex post-yield numerical modelling in a periodic and routine design process for excavation support is currently a contentious issue, which requires better justification and industry understanding of its limitations. Complex post-yield numerical modelling is challenging, time-consuming and expensive, and typically outside the capability and resources of mine site geotechnical engineers. It does, however, have its place and will continue to make important contributions. A design method has been developed incorporating the major geometrical, geological and geotechnical parameters required to specify roof support. It is a hybrid numerical and empirical method called Gateroad Roof Support Model (GRSM), where specification of roof support comes from charts or equations. Empirical design techniques are currently used in Bowen Basin mines and should be used to provide a complementary design. They do not explicitly consider all the parameters and mining situations that GRSM does. In some aspects, GRSM may be considered as a progression of these current empirical methods. GRSM defines suggested roof support densities by linking a rock-mass classification with an index of mining-induced stress, using a large empirical database of Bowen Basin mining experience. Inherent in the development of GRSM is a rock-mass classification scheme applicable to coal measure strata. From numerous schemes assessed, two were considered appropriate. Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR) is an established and robust coal industry standard, and Geological Strength Index (GSI), as it provides rock-mass geomechanical properties. GSI would only be required if additional numerical modelling was conducted. An approximate correlation between GSI global rock-mass strength and CMRR has been presented. An elastic three-dimensional numerical model has been established to calculate an index of mining induced stress, for both roadway development and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat.</b> The model anticipates height of strata caving and fracturing and the process of goaf reconsolidation. To effectively use GRSM {{it is important to be}} able to quickly and accurately calculate a stress index, without having to resort to a numerical model. Equations to calculate stress index have been developed for two situations; roadway development and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat.</b> Installed roof support must be characterised and quantified, both to establish the empirical database and to specify suggested support densities and patterns for a design. An industry standard method of quantifying roof support was adopted as a base template (GRSUP). General design charts, utilising all data points and long-tendon support were also constructed for roadway development and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat.</b> The logistic regression analyses considered three independent variables; roof classification, stress index, and various modifications to GRSUP. The logistic regression analyses indicate that an improved quantification of installed support can be gained by simple modifications to the standard formulation of GRSUP. Initial stable-failure boundaries were determined mathematically using an optimal statistical solution from the logistic regression. The position of the stable/failed boundary can be changed depending on design criteria and specified risk. Considering the probability of a stable outcome more appropriate and conservative stable/failure boundary can be defined. This initial version of GRSM provides suitable estimates of required roof support for both roadway development and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> in the maingate belt-road. It appears to be suitable for a range of immediate roof conditions, including coal. The design method is uncomplicated to apply when using the supplied equations, and can be readily set-up in spreadsheet form. Calculated GRSUP is only a first-pass assessment, and this is all it was ever intended to be. Design optimisation always needs to occur, based on local conditions and experience...|$|R

A significant problem that must be solved {{in order to achieve}} continuous autonomous mining in longwall coal mines is the measurement of small changes in the position or orientation of specific sections of mining equipment over extended operational periods.

The cases include five failures where major rock falls occurred in front of the shields, and six even more serious failures involving major overburden weighting. This suggests two room failure mechanisms The first is a roof fall type failure caused by loading of the immediate roof at the face as the fender narrows. The second is a weighting type failure caused by the inability of the roof to bridge the recovery room and face area, and affecting rock well above the immediate roof The data indicate that the roof fall type of failure is less likely when intensive roof reinforcement (bolts, cables, and trusses) is employed together with higher-capacity shields The overburden weighting failures, in contrast, occurred when the roof was weak and little standing support was use...|$|R

Whilst ALTS {{formed the basis for}} the secondary roof support strategy for the vast bulk of the tailgate, there were two particular aspects associated with TG 802 that required the use other design techniques both in combination with and in addition to ALTS. Firstly, the gateroad development associated with Grasstree is based on a 3 -heading rather than the typical 2 -heading configuration employed by Australian Collieries (upon which the ALTS database was formulated). To cater for this in assessing tailgate serviceability, ALTS was combined with its US counterpart ALPS (Analysis of Pillar Stability).

40|$|AbstractDeep oxygen ingress {{into the}} goaf {{can lead to}} {{spontaneous}} heatings particularly during face stoppage or slow face retreat in the panel. This requires the deployment of proactive goaf inertisation strategies based upon detailed understanding of goaf gas flow patterns and distribution characteristics. An integrated approach combining goaf gas monitoring, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and field trials {{has been used for}} the development of effective goaf inertisation strategies in underground coal mines. CFD simulations indicate that inert gas injection close to the face is ineffective even at higher flow rates in the order of 1. 0 to 2. 0 m 3 /s. Inert gas needs to be injected at 200 m to 400 m behind the face at the rate of about 0. 5 m 3 /s to achieve effective goaf inertisation in most cases. Proactive inertisation strategies developed {{during the course of the}} study were highly successful in reducing oxygen ingress into the goaf and in achieving effective goaf inertisation by reducing oxygen levels below 5 % at 200 m behind the face. The study also indicates that just injecting inert gas into the goaf does not ensure prevention of heating incidents in the entire length of panels or all longwall panels. A number of parameters such as panel ventilation system, goaf caving conditions, and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> rate and goaf gas drainage can make a specific inertisation strategy ineffective and the inertisation strategies need to be modified based on the specific conditions at the mine sites...|$|R

The purpose of these back-analyses was to quantify the impact of cover depth and panel width on shield performance. Recently developed shield load cycle analysis theories were used to quantify the interaction between shields and strata. A load cycle is the change in support pressure with time from the initial setting of the shield against the roof until the subsequent release and movement of the support, which typically corresponds to a single shear. Historical shield pressure data from five longwall mines in Australia and Europe were back-analysed, together with strata delay data for the longwall faces. An assessment of the geology of the near-seam overburden was also made for each site. The longwall panels incorporated cover depths ranging from 50 to 770 m and panel widths ranging between 168 to 319 m. Use was made of {{a modified version of the}} longwall visual analysis (LVA) software that was specifically extended for this project and provided maps of the critical load cycle parameters implicit to the utilised analysis methodology. The major extension of the software involved presenting the outputs on the basis of individual load cycles for every shield as opposed to a time or chainage basis, thus allowing load cycle analysis to be carried out. In total about 6. 5 km of <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> and over 2 000 000 individual load cycles were back-analysed.

TG 802). In most instances the ALTS (Analysis of Longwall Tailgate Serviceability) Design Methodology can be directly applied to undertake such an assessment. Whilst ALTS {{formed the basis for}} the secondary roof support strategy for the vast bulk of the tailgate, there were two particular aspects associated with TG 802 that required the use other design techniques both in combination with and in addition to ALTS. Firstly, the gateroad development associated with Grasstree is based on a 3 -heading rather than the typical 2 - heading configuration employed by Australian Collieries (upon which the ALTS database was formulated). To cater for this in assessing tailgate serviceability, ALTS was combined with its US counterpart ALPS (Analysis of Pillar Stability). Secondly, the installation face of LW 802 was located approximately 260 m inbye of the start of LW 801 and due to the tailgate’s orientation and direction of <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> in relation to the major horizontal stress direction, a significant stress concentration acting across the tailgate roof was predicted as the face of LW 802 approached and passed the installation face of LW 801. This situation is sometimes referred to as a “Super Stress Notch”. An analytical approach was adopted when assessing the secondary roof support requirements associated with this section of TG 802. While this paper summarises the process by which the secondary roof support strategy was developed and subsequently implemented for TG 802, the paper primarily focuses on three issues 1) characterisation of the roof, 2) the analytical design procedure associated with the “Super Stress Notch” zone and 3) what roadway performance outcome constitutes a successful design...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the mining}} {{industry}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{goals is to}} establish a standard monitoring device that will primarily monitor gas levels and airflow side by side in real-time to assist as mine safety triggers and in Ventilation Air Methane (VAM) monitoring purposes. Unlike in most Australian mines, continuous real-time air velocity and gas monitoring has been practiced in South African coal mines for over three decades. Envisaged benefits from real-time velocity monitoring over current monthly manual ventilation monitoring are, viz., consistent and continued diagnosis of underground environment and managing catastrophic risks such as fires, explosions, and spontaneous combustion through gas make values; ability to determine real-time carbon monoxide, methane and other noxious gas make, estimation and reconciliation of specific gas emissions during panel development and <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat,</b> determining goaf capture efficiency, accurate determination of heat loads and air cooling capacity, and improving the confidence in ventilation air methane (VAM) emission data. Currently, industry is faced with the persistent and complex challenge of obtaining a 2 ̆ 7 reference true gas monitor 2 ̆ 7 for ‘accuracy’ determination of quintessential VAM parameters, viz., CH 4, CO 2, air velocity, and temperature. Despite, supplier or external reviewer’s claims, that one monitoring system is superior than the other in terms of its measurement ‘accuracy’, i. e., when compared with the “true measurement device”, in almost all cases, validating these claims was not possible due to lack of data evidence. Therefore, use of measurement system/s that are deemed to provide a practically acceptable, reliable and safe system to provide transparent measurement data is important. Underground operators are often faced with the famous and simple audit question on an important area of ‘accuracy’, i. e., the difference between ‘true’ value and measured value. There are suggestions of “slight inaccuracies” are being acceptable but currently, no such guidance or value exists. None of the studies or available guidance documents provides guidance on choice of an ‘accurate’ instrument for VAM monitoring. For example, it is acceptable to have an air velocity measurement error of 5 to ± 20...|$|R
40|$|Barapukuria {{coal mine}} (BCM) {{is located at}} Dinajpur district, NW Bangladesh. Total area is about 6. 68 km 2 and coal was {{encountered}} at a depth ranging between 118 and 509 m. Six major coal seams (seam I to seam VI) were identified at BCM, of which, thickest one is the seam-VI (~ 36 m). The estimated coal reserves is about 390 million tons and of this, nearly 64 million tons of coal is extractable. The annual production of coal is about 1 million ton. In this study several parameters were used to explore minimization of accidents and improvement of coal production in BCM. Considering the geological, hydrological and other technical parameters, longwall mining method is applied for extraction of coal. <b>Longwall</b> <b>retreating</b> mining method is also applied for extraction of coal from single face with the operational area protected by self-advancing hydraulic powered roof support (HPRS) system. These supports are moved forward causing the roof behind them to form an extensive abandoned area named goaf, which may lead to collapse with air blast. Coal in BCM is extracted from seam VI, using a multislice Longwall top coal caving method. Average ventilated air composition is ~ 20. 94 % oxygen, ~ 79. 00 % nitrogen, ~ 0. 04 % carbon monoxide, and minor water steam with huge dust. Production of coal was completed from 12 Longwall faces of 1 st slice from seam VI. During production period several accidents and troubles within BCM have occurred. Poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide were detected during/after development of 1110 Longwall face, which increases up to 6000 ppm, therefore, sealed-off the face with mining equipments. During the development of belt gate roadway of 1101 Longwall face, maximum temperature and humidity increases up to 37 oC and 100 %, respectively. Miners of BCM experienced some difficulties to work in that adverse environment. Air return roadway temperature was always 40 to 41 oC in 1101 Longwall face during production period, faces temperature 46 oC, water flow 600 m 3 /hr and humidity 100 %. Due to roof-fall, toxic gas and very high temperature and humidity in the face 1105 and 1108, some miners were highly injured and died. Therefore, taking necessary safety and risk measures during development of face and roadway in BCM, production will be sustained by controlling roof-fall. Strata pressure of every faces is monitor regularly through electromagnetic emission detector as well as changing sufficient ventilation system, accidents of BCM could be controlled. Adding earth filling materials (e. g. sand, silt etc.) in to the vacuum goaf area, air blast accident should be reduced and surface subsidence would also be controlled. Considering all the problems of 1 st slice and initiating extra caution for face development accident in BCM may reduce in 2 nd slice and overall production may be increased significantly...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{classification}} system for German coal mining {{is the result}} of approximately 100 years of experience in roadway development and longwall mining. It is also based on different research projects covered by national and European research programs. Over the past 30 years, more then 600, 000 m of road-ways have been driven and employed for mining activities. To properly describe the German rock mass {{classification system}}, therefore, it is useful {{to take a look at}} the main geomechanical preferences and common support systems. The decision about the most effective development technique and support system is based on a synthesis of rock mass classification and geomechanical analysis. The properties of surrounding rock, the in situ stress, and the influence of mining activities in several seams at each German mine must be considered for the evaluation of the expected deformation of the roadway. The mine layout, the requirements of ventilation and fire prevention, as well as the need to maintain emergency escape routes for the miners, require that the gate roads remain usable after the passage of the longwall face in most cases. Moreover, the gate roads must be maintained despite the high stresses that are applied during <b>longwall</b> <b>retreat</b> mining. Therefore, gate road design must address a broad spectrum of potential deformation environments. In the past, when gate roads were supported solely with yielding steel arches, lithologic descriptions of the surrounding strata conditions were adequate for the dimensioning of support and the prediction of the roadway deformation. The current conditions of multiple-seam mining at depths of up to 1, 700 m require combined support systems, including pattern bolting and backfilled steel arches. Rock bolt support is used for development, after which (typically 50 - 100 m outby the face) the steel arches are installed and backfilled with building material (concrete) in order to achieve an optimized development rate. The rock mass classification system described below was developed especially for the conditions of German hard-coal mining. It includes the stress distribution caused by multiseam workings (including crossing goaf edges of former longwalls), as well as in situ stresses due to greatdepth and the presence of tectonic faults. It is based on the evaluation of four parameters: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical analysis of drill cores 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical observation of the development face 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Geotechnical classification of tectonic structures (faults) 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Standard classification derived from geotechnical assessment and evaluation of stress conditions (using numerical modeling for stress calculation) ROCK STRENGTH One of the most important input parameters for describing strata conditions is the strength of the rock. The German classification system is based on a description of lithotypes. This method has been used successfully since the 1950 s and is based mainly on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of the material. An evaluation of the rock strength observed in a survey of approximately 82, 500 samples of rock core yielded the results shown in Figure 1. The three most common coal measure rock types are mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Each shows a specific mean UCS level and a different spread between the minimum and maximum values. Sandstones, in particular, have a wide spectrum of compressive strength, ranging from approximately 40 MPa to greater than 130 MPa, with an average of 85 MPa. The causes of this wide range include different sedimento-logical preconditions, facies, and digenetic processes. [...|$|R
40|$|Mining beneath ground water, reservoirs, rivers, {{seas and}} {{harbours}} {{has been successfully}} carried out in numerous countries for many decades. The risks and engineering considerations have been refined over {{a long time to}} enable safety and geotechnical outcomes to be defined and adequately controlled. The experience in Australia has been a prolonged debate over three decades between the mining industry and numerous sectionalised Government Departments. The first major step forward was the Reynolds Inquiry recommendations in the 19702 ̆ 7 s which determined the limitations to which mining could proceed under stored waters. In 1978, the NSW Government enacted the Dam Safety Act and established a Dams Safety Committee to oversee applications of mining within these areas. Over 3 years from 1990 - 1992 South Bulli worked with the Dam Safety Committee to gain approval for mining the restricted zone beneath Cataract Reservoir for the ongoing viability of its operations. This was the first real test of the recommendations that were handed down by Justice Reynolds Inquiry, and the entire area was divided into zones to determine more accurately some of the engineering factors of subsidence, stress, strain and how the geometry of mine design interacted. These zones would be approved depending on the results of monitoring these parameters in a controlled manner. This thesis analyses the results to date from Stage I and partial Stage II extraction zones and has been used to supplement reports to the Dam Safety Committee. Mining to date has consisted of the extraction of 2. 5 million tonnes of raw coal, via development of 30 km of underground roadways within the Cataract area (six longwalls developed), and the extraction of four longwall panels, each of 110 m width, separated by 66 m wide coal pillars which provide support to the overlying strata. A wide-ranging monitoring programme has been developed and implemented on the surface, in the overburden, and the mine workings, which includes;- • Surface Geological Mapping • Underground Mapping • Geophysical Surveys • In-Seam Longhole Drilling • Surface Subsidence • Surface and Sub-Surface Strains • Groundwater • Mine Water Inflow/Outflow. Pillar Stability The results from these programs confirm that the strata response to mining operations has been very small, which is very close to original expectations. This is significant in that greater confidence can now be placed in the 2 ̆ 2 Stage II 2 ̆ 2 design. Since the initial predictions were made, various additional work has been carried out. The most significant of these investigations have been reported and discussed in this thesis and contribute to the high confidence in the Stage II mine design. Stage II Application was to develop and extract the next seven mini-longwall blocks, from Longwall 508 up to and including Longwall 514. The mine layout is essentially the same as the Stage I Application, with <b>longwalls</b> <b>retreating</b> approximately from East to West, and development of panels progressing northward. The main change in layout is an increase in extraction width from the current 110 m to 120 m from Longwalls 511 onwards, and a decrease in chain pillar width from an existing value of 66 m to 60 m. The - reduction in pillar width is in line with the reduction of cover depth, consistent with the Reynold 2 ̆ 7 s Inquiry guidelines. Work described gives a high level of confidence in the assertion that the proposed layout is still conservative and will not threaten the integrity of the Reservoir. This will be confirmed by continuing the existing monitoring and investigation programs, and supplementing them by additional programs to cater for the requirements of the Stage II. The proposed Stage II Monitoring programs are detailed elsewhere in this thesis. The predicted values of surface subsidence and strain for both Stage I and II are detailed below where: a) maximum subsidence will go from 200 mm (Stage I) to 280 mm (Stage II) b) maximum tensile strain will go from 0. 6 mm/ m (Stage I) to 0. 8 mm/m (Stage II) c) maximum compressive strain will go from 0. 6 mm/m (Stage I) to 1. 2 mm/m (Stage II). The most important of these parameters is tensile strain. Test work carried out has indicated that the tensile strain failure of the base of the reservoir (in the Hawkesbury Sandstone) is between 3. 0 and 7. 0 mm/m, which is at least 3. 5 times greater than the anticipated strain, and is a sufficient factor of safety to protect the reservoir. As all mining at South Bulli is now concentrated in the Cataract area, continuity of production is vital if the viability of the mine is to be maintained. The Stage II layout extends the mine life by 2. 5 years, providing an annual export revenue of 65 million...|$|R
