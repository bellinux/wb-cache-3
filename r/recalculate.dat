5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than <b>recalculate</b> what that image would be.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} to <b>recalculate</b> the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to <b>recalculate</b> its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} and analyze a technique for selectively <b>recalculating</b> 2 D signed distance field values. Only field points whose values {{could possibly have}} changed are <b>recalculated,</b> thereby realizing significant time savings over <b>recalculating</b> all values for the entire field. This technique works by assuming that the zero iso-contour of the field has been changed, {{and that it is}} known what the new zero iso-contour will be. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to <b>recalculate</b> portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to <b>recalculate</b> its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Panzer Army's {{offensive}} forced Stavka to <b>recalculate</b> its intentions for Operation Saturn, and on 13 December Stalin and Stavka {{authorized the}} redeployment of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front, {{where it would}} be ready to be used against German forces on 15 December. This army had a strength of roughly 90,000 soldiers, organized into three guards rifle corps (the 1st, 13th and 2nd). Operation Saturn was redesigned into Operation Little Saturn, which limited the scope of the attack to breaking through the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear. The offensive was also changed from a southward push to a drive in a southeastern direction, and the start date was pushed back to 16 December. In the meantime, the 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces {{in the vicinity of the}} Alksay River, trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army.|$|E

For Galaxy and Aliens, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly.

Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and while considering ways to remove Keen's parents during the introduction for Galaxy, came up with a stun gun which would leave behind permanently stunned enemies, which appeared in all three episodes made in 1991. Additionally, music, which was missing in prior Keen games, was added to Aliens, composed by Bobby Prince.|$|E

5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically <b>recalculate</b> seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E

25|$|On 24 March 2011, the Austrian Meteorological Service report {{estimated}} {{the total amount}} of caesium-137 released into the air as of 19 March based on extrapolating data from several days of ideal observation at a handful of worldwide CTBTO radionuclide measuring facilities. The agency estimated an average being 5,000TBq daily. Over the course of the disaster, Chernobyl put out a total of 85,000TBq of caesium-137. However, later reporting on 12 April estimated total caesium releases at 6,100TBq to 12,000TBq, respectively by NISA and NSC – about 2–4kg. On 23 April, NSC updated this number to 0.14TBq per hour of caesium-137 on 5 April, but did not <b>recalculate</b> the entire release estimate.|$|E

25|$|Babbage's {{motivation}} to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation {{has been a}} commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account {{of the origin of}} the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to <b>recalculate</b> some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.|$|E
25|$|Many {{training}} {{agencies such}} as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the value written on the cylinder by the gas blender, the scuba diver must either <b>recalculate</b> his or her bottom times with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen partial pressure before taking delivery), and finally a calculation of the maximum operating depth for that fill/cylinder. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations (for example, personalized cylinders for each diver must generally be kept track of on dive boats with nitrox, {{which is not the}} case with generic compressed air cylinders).|$|E

In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction. SPC meteorologists began to <b>recalculate</b> model data during the morning {{to account for the}} stronger wind profiles caused by the jet streak; the data acknowledged that thunderstorms would occur within the Central Plains, but disagreed on the exact area of greatest severe weather risk.|$|E
