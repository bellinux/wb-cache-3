5000|$|An {{isothermal}} titration calorimeter {{is composed}} of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermally conducting and chemically inert material such as Hastelloy alloy or gold, surrounded by an adiabatic jacket.

Prior to addition of ligand, a constant power (<1 mW) {{is applied to the}} <b>reference</b> <b>cell.</b> This directs a feedback circuit, activating a heater located on the sample cell. During the experiment, ligand is titrated into the sample cell in precisely known aliquots, causing heat to be either taken up or evolved (depending {{on the nature of the}} reaction). Measurements consist of the time-dependent input of power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference cells.|$|E

50|$|The {{wide-band}} O2 sensor looks {{similar in}} appearance {{to the regular}} zirconia O2 sensor. Its inner construction and operation are totally different, however. The wide-band O2 sensor is composed of two inner layers called the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> and the pump cell. The ECM’s AFR sensor circuitry always tries to keep a perfect air/fuel ratio inside a special monitoring chamber (diffusion chamber or pump-cell circuit) by way of controlling its current. The AFR sensor uses dedicated electronic circuitry to set a pumping current in the sensor’s pump cell. In other words, if the air/fuel mixture is lean, the pump cell circuit voltage momentarily goes low and the ECM immediately regulates the current going through {{it in order to}} maintain a set voltage value or stoichiometric ratio inside the diffusion chamber. The pump cell then discharges the excess oxygen through the diffusion gap by means of the current created in the pump-cell circuit. The ECM senses the current and widens injector pulsation accordingly to add fuel.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{progress}} on gas sensing using real-time correlation spectroscopy, where a gas {{is used to}} "recognise" its own spectral absorption lines. Our recent results on methane detection using pressure modulation spectrometry are shown, and a new method of modulating the absorption of the gas in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> section of an ammonia detection system is reported for the first time. The basic concept of correlation spectrometry involves the passage of light sequentially through two gas cells, a <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> containing a known quantity of the gas to be detected, and a sampling cell where {{the presence of the}} gas is to be determined. An optical signal passing sequentially through the cells will suffer absorption in each of the cells. If the absorption in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> is periodically modulated, then the total absorption depends on whether the gas absorption lines in the sampling cell correlate with those in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> gas. If the absorption lines of the gases do not correlate strongly, then the modulation index of the optical signal is essentially unaffected by the presence of the different gas in the sampling cell. Therefore, the concentration of a specific gas in the sampling cell can be quantified by this means. Pressure modulation of the gas within the <b>reference</b> <b>cell</b> is achieved by the use of a novel acoustic resonator. This device provides a reasonable pressure ratio whilst being compact and easily driven. Unlike previous piston-compressors, the high modulation frequency of the resonator improves the tolerance to transients in the optical signal produced by the passage of dust through the optical beam. The system can be tailored to detect a desired gas by changing the reference gas and a broadband section filter. Results for methane are presented in this paper. A novel method for detection of ammonia gas is reported for the first time. This involves Stark modulation of the gas in the <b>reference</b> <b>cell,</b> by the application of an electric field. This method is applicable to gases with strong electric dipole moments, such as NH 3, CO 2, NOx and HCl...|$|E
