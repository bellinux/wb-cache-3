5000|$|Virginia and Marge {{decide to}} try to reform Bill. Bill attends church with them, but later shows up drunk for supper. Virginia tells Bill {{about the death of}} [...] "Gramps," [...] her {{maternal}} grandfather, who was a well-known Gloucester fishing schooner captain. Bill tells her his dream is to captain the We're Here, a Gloucester schooner docked in San Pedro, and Virginia gives him Gramps' captain's telescope {{as a symbol of the}} dream. To make it come true, Bill and Pico get a job on a tuna boat and return to find that Virginia and Marge have rehabilitated his rundown boat in the month he has been gone. When Bill collects his pay, he gets much less than expected and suspects that Kelly is cheating the fisherman by under-weighing the catch. Bill confronts one of Kelly's henchmen and cajoles a bribe to keep his [...] "big mouth" [...] shut. Bill is about to accept the money when he sees Virginia bringing the other cheated fishermen to watch him stand up to Kelly. To save face, Bill refuses the bribe and throws the henchman into the harbor. Virginia takes his wages for safekeeping, but Bill gets drunk anyway to celebrate his new status as a hero, and Kelly scuttles his boat after he passes out.As Bill and Pico work to raise their boat, Virginia is horrified to see that the We're here is being sold at auction. Bill imprudently offers the highest bid. He uses his fishing money for a deposit and has ten days to pay off the balance. Bill wants to sail the We're Here to the South Sea Islands and charms Marge into giving him the money to pay the balance, hinting that they might get married. The other fishermen want Bill to convert the We're Here into a <b>reefer</b> <b>ship</b> and offer to finance it. Bill pretends to accept the offer, but uses it to leverage another bribe from Kelly, needing cash to buy goods for trade in the South Seas. Virginia discovers what is happening, and disillusioned, calls Aunt Letty to take her home. When Marge comes to get Virginia's clothes, Bill returns the telescope. A conscience-stricken Bill decides to keep his promise to the fishermen. Pop, an investor, comes aboard, and Marge stows away as cook to keep Bill honest. Bill arrives at the fishing grounds as Kelly is again trying to intimidate the fishermen and gives Kelly his money back. Kelly and his gang sneak aboard the fish-laden We're Here to scuttle her, but Pop discovers the invaders. Bill's makeshift crew capture the gang and put them to work to successfully weather a bad storm. Virginia and the telescope are waiting back at San Pedro. where Bill and a suddenly bashful Marge wed.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{optimizing}} hull forms {{with respect to}} their hydrodynamic performance in calm and rough water is presented. The method is based on an initial optimization of a parent hull form for seakeeping and the improvement of the resulting optimum hull form for calm water resistance. In {{the first part of the}} method, variant hull forms differing from a parent in the main dimensions and/or in one or more hull form parameters, such as C-WP, LCF, C-B, LCB, KB, C-P, are automatically generated and their seakeeping qualities evaluated. When appropriate ranges for the principal characteristics and parameters of the hull form under investigation are prescribed, a formal optimization procedure is used to obtain the variant with the best seakeeping behavior. The weighted sum of the resonant values of selected ship responses for a number of ship speeds and headings in regular waves forms the objective function. The Hooke and Jeeves algorithm is used to accomplish the optimization. The procedure results in a set of trends regarding the proposed variations of the selected hull form parameters, within the specified constraints. These trends are then applied on the parent hull to derive an optimized hull form with fair lines. Subsequently, this hull form can be locally modified to improve its calm water resistance or, as it should be done, its propulsion characteristics. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two cases: a conventional <b>reefer</b> <b>ship</b> and a naval destroyer. Scaled models of the parent and the optimized hull forms have been tested for calm water resistance and seakeeping. In both cases the validity of the methodology is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Acropora palmata {{fragments}} {{generated by}} the Fortuna <b>Reefer</b> <b>ship</b> grounding off Mona Island were examined over six years. Fragments (n= 1857) were secured to the reef or dead standing colonies (skeletons) using wire within {{three months of the}} grounding. After six years, 20. 3 % (377) of the restored fragments were living, 56 % died and 23. 7 % were detached and removed. Surviving fragments had live tissue covering an average of 60 % of upper branch surfaces, although 30 % had little partial mortality (< 5 %), 22 % exhibited resheeting over previously exposed skeleton, and 30 % had tissue that expanded onto the substrate or skeletons. Surviving fragments (58 %) produced new branches (1 - 30 per fragment), with a mean length of 21 cm (maximum = 73 cm). The most important source of mortality was overgrowth by a boring sponge (Cliona spp., 20 %). Partial tissue loss also resulted from wire abrasion (73 %), predation by corallivorous gastropods, diseases, algal interactions, and damselfish algal lawns. Fragment size, depth and location of attachment were the most important factors affecting survival. Fragments that died were smaller (59 cm) than surviving fragments (79 cm). Fragments at 3 - 4 m depth, secured to the reef, and oriented upright had the highest survivorship, lowest amount of partial tissue loss and the greatest extent of new growth. Attaching fragments to skeletons may be beneficial in that it reduces time required to restore high relief habitat, but survivorship may be compromised in locations with bioeroding sponges, as these appear to preferentially colonize skeletons and consequently overgrow fragments...|$|E
40|$|A {{lengthening}} of {{a specialized}} <b>reefer</b> <b>ship</b> {{has been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} if it is economically viable or not. The ship type considered is the Crown class specialized reefer ships, where the Crown Topaz and the Crown Ruby are used as reference ships for this study. In order to determine whether a lengthening is economically viable or not, a conceptual design of the lengthened ship has been done. Costs related to the conversion and income due to the increased cargo capacity are calculated and compared in order to determine when the investment for the conversion reaches break-even. The ship is lengthened by an open-top section of 28 m, a lengthening from 152 m to 180 m. This results in an increased displacement of the ship which results in a greater cargo capacity. The extension allows for 108 extra FEU high cube refrigerated containers with a gross weight of 30 tonnes. The open-top section and necessary reinforcements are dimensioned according to the requirements of the Classification Society NKK in order to calculate the added weight and costs for the conversion. The result shows an increase in resistance of about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and loaded to 80 % of DWT, which is the most common load case for the reference ship. The fuel consumption thereby increases by 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots. The extra cargo capacity of 108 containers corresponds to an increase in container capacity of 154 % and about 31 % of the total paying cargo capacity, while the increase in fuel consumption for the main machinery is about 15 % for a cruising speed of 19 knots and the extra auxiliary engine contributes to an increase of 40 % in fuel consumption for the auxiliary engines. Costs for the conversion and loss due to off-hire time are summarized to 5. 025 M. USD. The extra income for the containers is calculated to 7715 USD per day with a freight rate of 2500 USD per container. With the fuel oil price of today of 595 USD/tonne and the increased port tariffs due to the conversion, the investment will reach break-even in 4 years. Even if the fuel oil price increases about 8. 7 % to 647 USD/tonne the investment will reach break-even after 4 ½ years in operation. If the ships operates within a trade similar to the Coman-trade and with an income of 3000 USD per container the investment will reach break-even after about 2 ½ years with a fuel oil price of 595 USD/tonne and 3 years with a fuel oil price of 647 USD/tonne. Since the Crown class fleet has an average age of 16 years today, the conversion has to be implemented early to make the investment profitable before the ships are ready to be scrapped...|$|E
