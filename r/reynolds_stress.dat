40|$|Turbulence {{modeling}} is {{a critical}} component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising alternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses.</b> The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating {{the merits of the}} proposed method. Improvement of RANS modeled <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the ultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e. g., velocity field, drag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> obtained therefrom.

40|$|The {{development}} of an anisotropic modification of linear and nonlinear models of turbulence is presented. This modification departs from the observation {{that there are some}} regions of fluid domains in which the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> do not depend on the magnitude of the mean flow gradients. The model is based on the hypothesis that actions of fluctuating motion on mean motion are almost exclusively due to large turbulent eddies, and that the latter contain the same kinetic energy of the small eddies of mean flow. The contribution of large turbulent eddies to the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> is then modeled by a linear combination of an iso-tropic term and an anisotropic term. The latter is obtained by multiplying a quote of the turbulent kinetic energy by a normalized redistribution tensor. The performance of the model is tested by calculating the <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> in a fully developed turbulent channel flow and simulating the separated turbulent flow over a backward-facing step, and a fully developed turbulent flow in a squared duct. The results show that the modified models improve the prediction of the normal <b>Reynolds</b> <b>stresses</b> in a bidimensional channel and of the reattachment point in a backward-facing step. On the other hand, these models do not improve the prediction of secondary flows in a squared duct...|$|R
