5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The <b>runtime</b> {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases <b>runtime</b> for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|Optimally, the speedup from parallelization {{would be}} linear—doubling {{the number of}} {{processing}} elements should halve the <b>runtime,</b> and doubling it a second time should again halve the <b>runtime.</b> However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speedup. Most {{of them have a}} near-linear speedup for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.|$|E
30|$|The lookup map is disseminated {{and kept}} {{consistent}} between all <b>runtimes</b> either via a pub-sub for client <b>runtimes</b> or gossip scheme for actor hosting <b>runtimes.</b> Both these methods of synchronisation achieve eventual consistency, therefore {{there is the}} possibility that calls may be made to no longer existing endpoints or <b>runtimes</b> may not yet be aware of newly instantiated endpoints. Again, the circuit breaker mechanism is intended to lessen the significant of this issue.|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{is still}} one of the most {{important}} subtasks when designing a VLSI circuit. However, more and more elements on a chip increase simulation <b>runtimes.</b> Especially on transistor level with highly accurate element modelling, long simulation <b>runtimes</b> of typically several hours delay the design process. One possibility to reduce these <b>runtimes</b> is to divide the circuit into several partitions and to simulate the partitions in parallel. But the success of such a parallel simulation is heavily depending on the quality of the partitioning. This paper presents a new approach for partitioning VLSI circuits on transistor level and gives <b>runtimes</b> of parallel simulations of large industrial circuits. The resulting <b>runtimes</b> show considerable improvement compared to a known partitioning method, the Node Tearing method [10]...|$|R
5|$|From {{start to}} finish the {{production}} of Pareh cost 75,000 gulden (approximately US$ 51,000), 20times {{as much as a}} regular local production. After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of <b>runtime.</b>|$|E
5|$|HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) {{developed}} at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly {{known as an}} intermediate language), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at <b>runtime</b> by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6× performance improvements.|$|E

30|$|Immeditally {{obvious from}} Table  1 {{is that the}} <b>runtimes</b> for RAPID are much shorter than the typical <b>runtimes</b> for NBODY 6, {{sometimes}} by factors of a few hundred. Slightly more surprising is that the RAPID <b>runtimes</b> {{also tend to be}} shorter than the <b>runtimes</b> for CMC. This largely arises from the improved treatment of the cluster center in RAPID. As will be shown in the next section, RAPID reproduces the less-dense core radii of the full N-body models better than CMC, with the latter producing core radii 2 – 4 times smaller and more compact than NBODY 6. Because the timestep of the MC is dominated by the relaxation in the densest region of the cluster, the more compact CMC models require many more timesteps to resolve the deep core collapses, resulting the longer <b>runtimes.</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{originally}} editing Donnie Darko in 2001, Kelly {{was required}} to keep the final film shorter than two hours, with its final <b>runtime</b> coming to 113 minutes. With more freedom in 2004, his director's cut is 20 minutes longer than the original release. Most of the deleted scenes that had been included as extras on the Donnie Darko DVD were added to narrative, bringing the <b>runtime</b> {{to a total of}} 133 minutes. Such scenes include additional sequences with Donnie and his parents, Donnie's therapist Dr Thurman telling him that his drugs are placebos, and his English teacher Karen Pomeroy teaching Watership Down to her class. Close-up shots of Donnie's eyeballs were included, as well as footage of waves crashing on a beach, and a scene in which Donnie and Gretchen play the 1986 arcade game Out Run.|$|E
5|$|Hejlsberg is C#'s {{principal}} {{designer and}} lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously {{involved with the}} design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of the Common Language <b>Runtime</b> (CLR), which, in turn, drove {{the design of the}} C# language itself.|$|E
5|$|In North America, {{the film}} had its {{expansion}} alongside the openings of Monster Trucks, The Bye Bye Man and Sleepless, {{as well as}} the wide expansions of Live by Night and Patriots Day, and was expected to gross $4–6million from 747 theaters in its four-day MLK opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $1.9million (a four-day total of $2.3million), finishing 15th at the box office. Deadline.com attributed the film's low opening to its 161-minute <b>runtime</b> and lack of major award nominations to create buzz.|$|E

40|$|Computational grids {{are seen}} as the future {{emergent}} computing infrastructures. Their programming {{requires the use of}} several paradigms that are implemented through communication middleware and <b>runtimes.</b> However some of these middleware systems and <b>runtimes</b> are unable to take benefit of specific networking technologies available in grid infrastructures. In this paper, we describe an open integration framework that allows several communication middleware and <b>runtimes</b> to efficiently share the networking resources. Such framework encourages grid programmers to use the most suited communication paradigms for their applications independently from the underlying networks. Therefore, there is no obstacle to deploy the applications on a specific grid configuration...|$|R

5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient <b>runtime</b> code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target <b>runtime</b> was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that nothing could possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E

Len Walter, who had edited episodes for Series One, reprised his role for Thunderbirds Are Go. The workprint of the film ran more than 15 minutes over the maximum <b>runtime</b> permitted by United Artists, forcing Walter to cut several minor scenes that were not essential to the plot.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been {{extensive}} research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case <b>runtime</b> guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation.
