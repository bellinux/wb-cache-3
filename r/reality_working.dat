2500|$|Hitchcock {{followed}} Vertigo {{with three}} more successful films, {{which are also}} recognised as among his best films: North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). In North by Northwest, Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is hotly pursued across the United States by enemy agents, apparently one of them being Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who is in <b>reality</b> <b>working</b> undercover. During its opening two-week run at Radio City Music Hall, the film grossed $404,056, setting a record in that theater's non-holiday gross. At that time, Time magazine called the film [...] "smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining." [...] A. H. Weiler of The New York Times made it a [...] "Critic's Pick" [...] {{and said it was}} the [...] "year's most scenic, intriguing and merriest chase"; Weiler complimented the two leads: [...] Cary Grant, a veteran member of the Hitchcock acting varsity, was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam. He handles the grimaces, the surprised look, the quick smile ... and all the derring-do with professional aplomb and grace. In casting Eva Marie Saint as his romantic vis-à-vis, Mr. Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress heretofore. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer.|$|E

5000|$|Director Don Taylor {{initially}} {{planned a}} representational {{setting for the}} film; Verona, Milan and the forest were all to be realistic. However, {{he changed his mind}} early in preproduction and had production designer Barbara Gosnold go in the opposite direction - a stylised setting. To this end, the forest is composed of metal poles with bits of green tinsel and brown sticks stuck to them (the cast and crew referred to the set as [...] "Christmas at Selfridges"). Whilst the set for Verona remained relatively realistic, that for Milan featured young actors dressed like cherubs as extras. This was to convey the idea that the characters lived in a 'Garden of Courtly Love', which was slightly divorced from everyday <b>reality.</b> <b>Working</b> in tandem with this idea, upon Proteus' arrival in Milan, after meeting Silvia, he is left alone on stage, and the weather suddenly changes from calm and sunny to cloudy and windy, accompanied by a thunderclap. The implication being that Proteus has brought a darkness within him into the garden of courtly delights previously experienced by Silvia.|$|E
