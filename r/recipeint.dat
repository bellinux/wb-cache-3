2500|$|Clerk {{was born}} on 28 October 1862 at Aburi, about forty-five minutes {{north-east}} of the Ghanaian capital, Accra. N. T. Clerk was a second generation descendant of the historic Clerk family of Accra, Ghana. His father was Alexander Worthy Clerk, a Jamaican Moravian missionary who {{was among the first}} group of West Indians, recruited by the Danish minister, the Reverend Andreas Riis of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society in 1843. Riis lived in the Gold Coast from 1832 to 1845. His mother, Pauline Hesse was from the Gold Coast, and was of German and Ga-Dangme descent. He studied at Basel Mission primary and middle schools in Aburi, followed by pedagogy and theology training at the Basel Mission Seminary (now Presbyterian College of Education) at Akropong, in the state of Akuapem, 32 miles (51km) north-north-east of Accra, where he showed strong interest in Christian missionary work. The Basel missionaries founded the Akropong seminary in 1848 as the second oldest higher educational institution in West Africa after Fourah Bay College, established in 1827.With the aid of a bursary awarded by the Basel Mission, Clerk pursued further studies at the Basel Mission Seminary in Basel, Switzerland (...) between 1884 and 1888, where he received advanced instruction in theology, philosophy and linguistics, with special emphasis on philology. Clerk was the second African to be educated in Europe by the Basel Mission after the missionary, David Asante who had earlier completed his training in 1862. The Basel mission also had a holistic and rigorous skills-based approach to educating its students. This was geared towards teaching them the survival know-how to especially endure harsh terrains during Christian missionary fieldwork. In this regard, N. T. Clerk received additional practical training in geography and cartography, botany, as well as basic medicine, anatomy and surgery. During this period, he spent a year (1884 -1885) in Schorndorf, about 42 miles (26km) east of Stuttgart, Germany, [...] living with and studying under the award-winning , [...] who had earlier been influential in the translation of the Bible into the Twi language with the help of two Akan linguists and missionaries, David Asante and Theophilus Opoku. [...] Christaller was a two-time <b>recipeint</b> (1876; 1882) of the most prestigious linguistics prize, The Prix Volney, awarded since 1822, by the Institut de France [...] "to recognize work in general and comparative linguistics."At Basel, Clerk suffered a nervous breakdown halfway through his studies but recovered quickly. He passed his final examinations, was consecrated in the Basel Minster as a missionary and in July 1888 ordained a minister at Korntal, situated at the northwestern border ofStuttgart of the German state of [...] He returned to his homeland, Gold Coast in October 1888.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{irradiation}} of mice with ultraviolet (UV) light {{produces a}} systemic alteration of an immunologic nature. This alteration is detectable in mice long before primary skin cancers induced by UV light begin to appear. The alteration {{results in the}} failure of UV-irradiated mice to reject highly antigenic, transplanted UV-induced tumors that are rejected by unirradiated syngeneic recipients. The immunologic aspect of this systemic alteration was demonstrated by transferring lymphoid cells from UV-irradiated mice to lethally x-irradiated recipients. These <b>recipeints</b> were unable to resist a later challenge with a syngeneic UV-induced tumor, whereas those given lymphoid cells from normal donors were resistant to tumor growth. Parabiosis of normal mice with UV-irradiated mice, followed by tumor challenge of both parabionts with a UV-induced tumor, resulted {{in the growth of}} the challenge tumors in both UV-irradiated and unirradiated mice. Splenic lymphocytes from tumor-implanted UV-treated mice were not cytotoxic in vitro against UV-induced tumors, whereas under identical conditions cells from tumor-implanted, unirradiated mice were highly cytotoxic. Our findings suggest that repeated UV irradiation can circumvent an immunologic mechanism that might otherwise destroy nascent UV-induced primary tumors that are strongly antigenic...|$|R
5000|$|NYBC {{maintains}} {{close relationships}} with both New York City's Police Department (NYPD) and Fire Department (FDNY). Among NYBC's largest donor groups is the NYPD, which donated more than 11,000 pints of blood through November 2015. At the same time, the FDNY participates with NYBC in the [...] "Be The Match Program" [...] {{operated by the}} National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). More than 8,000 FDNY members are on the potential donor list, and 179 members have already given this life saving gift to those in need. FDNY members represent more than 10% of all NYBC bone marrow donors. Each year, at an annual induction ceremony hosted by FDNY and NYBC at FDNY headquarters, donors and their recipients meet for the first time. In 2016, Firefighter Mike Wilson was introduced to a recipient from Erie, Pennsylvania, who received his lifesaving bone marrow to treat her acute myeloid leukemia (AML), while Firefighter Frank Perdue met a recipient diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia, a rare chronic blood disorder. In 2015, firefighter Michael McCauley of Staten Island met his <b>recipeint,</b> a United States Marine Sergeant who saw combat in Iraq, and who was subsequently diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through FDNY’s participation in NYBC’s program, McCauley’s bone marrow is credited with saving the recipient's life.|$|E

40|$|Isogeneic or {{allogeneic}} thyroid glands {{were implanted}} into thyroidectomized <b>recipeint</b> rats. These grafts, either fresh or cultured, {{were placed in}} hamstring muscle pocket or under the renal capsule. Survival and function of the grafts were evaluated by: restoration of normal levels of serum thyroxine, weight gain, kidney transamidinase (a thyroxine-induced enzyme), and histological appearance of re-excised implants. A isografts, fresh and cultured, functioned well as ectopic thyroid glands, though restoration of normal serum thyroxine levels was more rapid for the fresh implants. Fresh allografts functioned transiently but then failed due to rejection. No function was detected for cultured allografts, and rejection was seen histologically. The rat thyroid allograft therefore differs from the rat parathyroid allograft, which often can function for several months despite histological evidence of rejection. Maintenance in tissue culture prior to implantation {{does not appear to}} alter the longterm immunogenicity of either organ...|$|E
40|$|A {{selection}} procedure was devised to select for mutants of Escherichia coli K- 12 with enhanced rates of spontaneous frameshift mutation. Three types of mutants were isolated. Two of the mutations apparently represent alleles of previously isolated mutL 13 and mutS 3. The third type of mutation, represented by two alleles, lies between lysA and thyA, {{and has been}} designated mutR. mutR increases the rate of spontaneous frameshift mutation and also the rate of base substitution mutations. The mutator phenotype is recessive. Reversion of a lac amber mutation located on an episome is increased {{in the presence of}} the mutator, indicating that mutR can act in trans. No change in sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C could be found when mutR 34 was compared to the isogenic mutR+ strain. The mutator's activity was little affected by the type of medium in which the strain was grown. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools were normal in mutR 34. Intergenic recombination frequencies were the same in mutR and mutR and mutR+ strains, but a two- to threefold increase in intragenic recombination was observed in Hfr times Fminus crosses when the <b>recipeint</b> was mutR 34 as compared with mutR+. This increase appeared independent of the distance between the two markers within the gene in which the crossover took place...|$|E
40|$|A stable virulent donor strain (EA 178 R 1 - 99) of Erwinia amylovora can transfer, by {{conjugation}} {{during a}} 3 -h mating period, the gene or genes which determine(s) plant virulence to avirulent recipient strains (EA 178 -M 64 S 1 and EA 178 -M 173 S 1) of Escherichia amylovora. The virulence of over 200 recombinant clones was tested; {{they all were}} as virulent on immature Bartlett pear fruits (and, in the smaller series of strains tested, also, on Pyracantha twigs) as was the parent donor strain. Although the avirulent <b>recipeint</b> strains are amino acid auxotrophs, addition of the required amino acids to the inocula in plant virulence trials does not of itself restore virulence. Two small series of prototrophic revertant clones were selected from the auxotrophic avirulent recipient strains; only nine of the 21 prototrophic revertant clones regained virulence, whereas the other 12 prototrophic revertant clones remained avirulent, again suggesting a lack of parallelism between nutritional status and virulence in this system. Preliminary interrupted mating trials, carried out at 15 -min intervals over 3 h, show that ser is transferred during the first 15 min, that pro starts entering at about 75 min (and with a higher frequency later), and that lac (originating from an integrated Escherichia coli F'lac) enters {{toward the end of}} the 3 -h mating period and at a reduced frequency compared to the other markers. The gene or genes which determine(s) plant virulence in this Escherichia amylovora donor strain appear(s) to be transferred readily and seemingly completely to recipient strains during the first 15 min of a 3 -h mating period. Exposure of the virulent donor strain to acridine orange or ethidium bromide does not result in loss of virulence, suggesting (but, of course, not proving conclusively) that the determinant(s) of virulence in Escherichia amylovora might be chromosomal rather than extrachromosomal...|$|E
