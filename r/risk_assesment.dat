Aim: The aim is to compare the salivary levels of Bifidobacteria in children who are caries free with that of early childhood caries (ECC) and severe ECC (S-ECC). Materials and Methods: Saliva was collected using the tongue-loop method from a total of 60 children between the age group of 3 – 5 years and they were further divided into 3 groups. In addition, the age and gender of the children, sugar amount in diet, sugar frequency in diet, were recorded. Results: Bifidobacteria was isolated from all the three groups, but more were from S-ECC, followed by ECC and very few cases of caries-free children and was found to statistically significant (P < 0. 001).

The distribution of CAC across the strata and the association between diabetes and CAC were examined. ResultsCompared with nondiabetic individuals (n = 29, 829), those with diabetes (n = 1, 075) had higher median CAC scores across all but two age groups (women 40 to 44 years old and men and women ≥ 70 years old). Overall, the likelihood of having a CAC score in the highest age/gender quartile was 70 % greater for diabetic individuals than for their nondiabetic counterparts.
