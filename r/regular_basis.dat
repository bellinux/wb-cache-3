Instead of expanding the function on a <b>regular</b> wavelet <b>basis,</b> we expand it on the basis jk (G), j, k} warped with the design. This allows to perform a very stable and computable thresholding algorithm. We investigate the properties of this new basis. In particular, we prove that if the design has a property of Muckenhoupt type, this new basis has a behavior quite similar to a <b>regular</b> wavelet <b>basis.</b> This enables us {{to prove that the}} associated thresholding procedure achieves rates of convergence which have been proved to be minimax in the uniform design case...|$|R
