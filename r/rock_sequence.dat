25|$|The geology of Wales {{is complex}} and varied; its study has been of {{considerable}} historical significance {{in the development of}} geology as a science. All geological periods from the Cryogenian (late Precambrian) to the Jurassic are represented at outcrops, whilst younger sedimentary rocks occur beneath the seas immediately off the Welsh coast. The effects of two mountain-building episodes have left their mark in the faulting and folding of much of the Palaeozoic <b>rock</b> <b>sequence.</b> Superficial deposits and landforms created during the present Quaternary period by water and ice are also plentiful and contribute to a remarkably diverse landscape of mountains, hills and coastal plains.|$|E
25|$|Man has mined {{metals and}} metal ores in Wales for millennia. There are Bronze Age copper {{workings}} on the Great Orme near Llandudno and at Parys Mountain on Anglesey. Gold has been obtained since pre-Roman times {{at places like}} Dolaucothi. Lead and zinc were intensively mined in the Cwmystwyth area of mid Wales and a lead mine operated at Minera near Wrexham from the Middle Ages until the early twentieth century. In Victorian times the Sygun Copper Mine was opened near Beddgelert in Snowdonia. Ironstone is {{a component of the}} Lower Coal Measures <b>rock</b> <b>sequence</b> and where it outcrops along the northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield, it was extensively worked for the production of iron and was important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales.|$|E
25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The <b>rock</b> <b>sequence</b> formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|E

50|$|The Narryer Gneiss Terrane {{is divided}} into four major <b>rock</b> <b>sequences</b> (Myers 1990); the Dugel Gneiss, Meeberrie Gneiss, Manfred Complex, and {{unassigned}} polydeformed leucocratic gneisses and metasediments.|$|R
50|$|In geology, tectono{{stratigraphy}} is stratigraphy that refers {{either to}} <b>rock</b> <b>sequences</b> in which large-scale layering {{is caused by}} the stacking of thrust sheets, or nappes, in areas of thrust tectonics or to the effects of tectonics on lithostratigraphy.|$|R
25|$|In 1832 Dr Thomas Lloyd, a Ludlow {{doctor and}} amateur geologist, met Roderick Murchison at Ludford Corner {{to study the}} rocks exposed along the River Teme and on Whitcliffe, {{advancing}} Murchison's theory for a Silurian System {{that he was to}} publish in 1839. Immediately above the topmost layer of the marine <b>rock</b> <b>sequence</b> forming Murchison's Silurian period was a thin layer of dark sand containing numerous remains of early fish, especially their scales, along with plant debris, spores and microscopic mites. In contrast to the underlying sediments of the Ludlow Series which were deposited in a shallow warm sea some 400 million years ago, the Ludlow Bone Bed represents terrestrial (land) conditions and thus a fundamental change in the landscape. At the time, this was believed to be the earliest occurrence of life on land. Murchison thus took the Ludlow Bone Bed as the base of his Devonian Period, although over a century later this boundary was to be moved a little higher, the overlying rocks being ascribed to the Pridoli. The science of geology has taken a number of local names from these studies and now applies them worldwide, in recognition of the importance of this area to scientific understanding, for example Ludlow Series and Whitcliffe Formation. The site is now an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and still attracts international studies.|$|E

500|$|As of 2008 {{only two}} {{in-depth}} {{studies of the}} mix of fossils {{in any part of}} the Burgess Shale had been published, by Simon Conway Morris in 1986 and by Caron and Jackson in 2008. Caron and Jackson commented that Conway Morris had to rely on a set of specimens that may not have been representative, since their excavators discarded specimens they found uninteresting; and for which the exact level in the <b>rock</b> <b>sequence</b> had not been recorded, making chronological analyses impossible. Both studies noted that the set of species in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed (Conway Morris, 1986) and its expanded version the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Caron and Jackson, 2008) was different from those found {{in other parts of the}} Burgess Shale; and Conway Morris commented that faunas at most other Burgess Shale sites resembled those of the Raymond Quarry, which is above and therefore more recent than the Greater Phyllopod Bed (abbreviated [...] "GPB").|$|E
50|$|A {{consequence}} of this approach to the Phanerozoic periods is that the ages of their beginnings and ends can change {{from time to time}} as the absolute age of the chosen <b>rock</b> <b>sequences,</b> which define them, is more precisely determined.|$|R

500|$|Only in the {{southern}} part of the Radstock Syncline have coals of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures been worked, mainly at the Newbury and Vobster collieries in the southeast and in the New Rock and Moorewood pits to the southwest. Only in the eastern part of Pensford Syncline have coals of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures been worked, at the Globe Pit in the Newton St Loe area in the 19th century. The Variscan orogeny involved lateral compression of the <b>rock</b> <b>sequence</b> resulting in the tight folding, fracturing and faulting of the sandstone and mudstone strata, and the associated Coal Measures. Along the Radstock Slide Fault the distance between the broken ends of a coal seam can be as much as [...] The complex geology and thin seams gained the field notoriety and three underground explosions, in 1893, 1895 and 1908 were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne coal dust.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Castle {{referred}} to in the 2003 film is an old ruined and abandoned castle, decorated with stone dragons and gargoyles. It is one of the places where Tiger Lily is taken by Captain James Hook.

2500|$|A {{long and}} complex series of {{continental}} collisions known collectively as the Caledonian orogeny {{began in the}} Ordovician and continued through the Silurian into Devonian times. The effect in this area was to cause folding and faulting of the existing <b>rock</b> <b>sequence,</b> most particularly within the Welsh Basin, a process which intensified northwards. Parts of the sequence were subjected to low grade metamorphism, the most significant of which, from an economic point of view, would be the Cambrian and Ordovician slates of North Wales. The northeast to southwest 'grain' {{of much of the}} country was imparted at this time [...] with a series of major fault zones persisting from that time to the present, some of which, particularly in the northwest, are believed to represent terrane boundaries. The siliciclastic deposits of the succeeding Devonian period represent in large part the rapid attrition of the extensive Caledonian Mountain belt created by the Caledonian collision.|$|E
50|$|The basin was {{complex and}} consisted, at {{different}} times, {{of a variety}} of sub-basins separated by blocks across which typically sedimentation continued but resulted in much thinner <b>rock</b> <b>sequences.</b> The term, the 'Pennine Block-and-basin Province' is frequently used in literature to describe the situation which prevailed particularly during the lower Carboniferous.|$|R
25|$|The south eastern band {{comprises}} the mudstones and wackes of the Windermere Supergroup and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups.

5000|$|The geology of the High Weald {{consists}} {{largely of}} a series of hard standstone strata, underlain by heavy clays, giving rise to a combination which occurs across the Weald of sandstone ridges and clay vales.
