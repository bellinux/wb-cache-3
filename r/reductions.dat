The missionaries employed the strategy of gathering the often nomadic indigenous populations in larger communities called <b>reductions</b> in order to more effectively Christianize them. This policy sprang from the colonial legal view of the “Indian” as a minor, who had to be protected and guided by European missionaries so as not to succumb to sin. <b>Reductions</b> generally were construed as instruments to enable the natives adopt European lifestyles and values; {{this was not the case}} in the Jesuit <b>reductions,</b> however, where the Jesuits allowed the inhabitants to retain many pre-colonial cultural practices.|$|E
