There have also been reports that this same unit {{had been used to}} guard the mining operations in Arlit by the French mining conglomerate Areva NC, or that it (and the rebel movement) had been created by the government itself in order to <b>ratchet</b> <b>up</b> tension in the region and thereby secure Western military aid.|$|E
25|$|Contact with or {{manipulation}} of scoring elements (such as targets or ramps) scores {{points for the}} player. Electrical switches embedded in the scoring elements detect contact and relay this information to the scoring mechanism. Older pinball machines used an electromechanical system for scoring wherein a pulse from a switch would cause a complex mechanism composed of relays to <b>ratchet</b> <b>up</b> the score. In later games these tasks have {{been taken over by}} semiconductor chips and displays are made on electronic segmented or dot-matrix displays (DMD). The first DMD on a pinball machine was used by Checkpoint and features also video mode minigames. MarsaPlay in Spain manufactured a remake of Inder's original Canasta titled New Canasta, with an LCD screen in the backbox in 2010. The Wizard of Oz is the first US pinball machine that used a LCD in the back box. It is not only used for scoring and mini-games but also to display full color videos. Other display innovations on pinball machines include pinball video game hybrids like Baby Pac-Man in 1982 and Granny and the Gators in 1984 and the use of a small color video monitor for scoring and minigames in the backbox of the pinball machine Dakar from manufacturer Mr. Game in 1988 and CGA color monitors in Pinball 2000 in 1999 that utilizes a Pepper's Ghost technique to reflect the monitor in the head of the as well as modifications by the use of ColorDMD that is used to replace the standard mono color DMDs.|$|E

500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to [...] "Cold Comfort", though several characterised it as weaker than previous episodes in the series.

He said that [...] "Cold Comfort" [...] offers [...] "a promising set-up, but ... doesn't unfold {{with the same}} simple, logical elegance as others in the series". Andrew Billen, also writing for The Times, gave the episode three out of five stars, considering it weaker than is typical for Inside No. 9.

But this was not done and, {{for the first time in}} the history of Pakistan, our own security forces not only bombarded a mosque and religious seminary, but also brought in armored personnel carriers, tanks and helicopter gunships in numbers that made you wonder. This shows that all this activity was masterminded by some satanic minds. This incident is tragic, shameful and dangerous.

The film premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with about 1,000 copies. Espinosa and Pérez received positive reviews for their performances from Jessica Oliva of Cine Premiere magazine, who stated that the actors [...] "seem to blend in with their characters. Sofía Espinosa stands out with her voice (singing all the songs), and her physical interpretation and charisma, while Marco Pérez, Sergio Andrade, manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time". Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez and Verónica Sánchez of En Filme were [...] "surprised by [...] performance" [...] as it was [...] "very close to Gloria Trevi's, albeit with a nasally accent, and cadence which lets through the hoarse, sarcastic and melancholic style that permeates on every one of the songs the actress sings. Her acting work and physical resemblance let her move naturally from comedy to pain, loneliness to longing, to the easy smile, to the dance, to the jumps on stage and the twinkle in her eyes". In contrast, David Noh of Film Journal International was not impressed by Espinosa's acting, saying that she [...] "lacks appeal and is quite ordinary in a role that calls for some of the electricity the very young Jennifer Lopez managed to <b>ratchet</b> <b>up</b> in her musical biopic, Selena". Gloria Trevi praised the work of Espinosa in the film, stating that [...] "it is shocking to see yourself on film, the girl [...] did an extraordinary job". Espinosa won the Diosa de Plata and the Ariel Award for Best Actress for Gloria.|$|E

2500|$|While {{he did not}} {{originate}} the term, Charles Darwin {{identified the}} argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction {{of the theory of}} evolution at the outset. In The Origin of Species (1859), he wrote, [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." [...] Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can <b>ratchet</b> <b>up</b> designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Lopez {{limited the}} Commerce Clause {{to things that}} {{directly}} affect interstate commerce, which excludes issues like gun control laws, hate crimes, and other crimes that affect commerce but are {{not directly related to}} commerce. Seminole reinforced the [...] "sovereign immunity of states" [...] doctrine, which makes it difficult to sue states for many things, especially civil rights violations. The Flores [...] "congruence and proportionality" [...] requirement prevents Congress from going too far in requiring states to comply with the Equal Protection Clause, which replaced the ratchet theory advanced in Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966). The ratchet theory held that Congress could <b>ratchet</b> <b>up</b> civil rights beyond what the Court had recognized, but that Congress could not ratchet down judicially recognized rights. An important precedent for Morrison was United States v. Harris (1883), which ruled that the Equal Protection Clause did not apply to a prison lynching because the state action doctrine applies Equal Protection only to state action, not private criminal acts. Since the ratchet principle was replaced with the [...] "congruence and proportionality" [...] principle by Flores, it was easier to revive older precedents for preventing Congress from going beyond what Court interpretations would allow. Critics such as Associate Justice John Paul Stevens accused the Court of judicial activism (i.e., interpreting law to reach a desired conclusion).|$|E
