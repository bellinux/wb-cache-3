40|$|While the {{expectations}} {{for social work}} practitioners to do research have increased, their involvement is still limited.

The study tests the model using data collected from {{a random sample of}} social workers. To a large degree the data support the model. Research self-efficacy has a significant effect on <b>research</b> <b>activity.</b> It is also an important mediating variable for the effect of institutional support on <b>research</b> <b>activity.</b> Although institutional support for research has no direct effect, it has an indirect effect via self-efficacy on <b>research</b> <b>activity.</b> However, <b>research</b> training has no effect on <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> and self-efficacy in research.

5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who {{then moved on to}} the Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to <b>research</b> <b>activities,</b> and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses.

40|$|Background: Team-based {{approaches}} to research capacity building (RCB) {{may be an}} efficient means to promote allied health <b>research</b> participation and <b>activity.</b> In order to tailor such interventions, {{a clearer understanding of}} current patterns of research participation within allied health teams is needed. Different self-report measures exist which evaluate a team’s research capacity and participation, as well as associated barriers and motivators. However, it remains unclear how such measures are associated with a team’s actual <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> (e. g., journal publications, funding received). In response, this observational study aimed to identify the <b>research</b> <b>activity,</b> self-reported success, and motivations and barriers to undertaking research of eight allied health professional (AHP) teams and to explore whether any relationships exist between the self-reported measures and actual <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> within each team. Methods: A total of 95 AHPs from eight teams completed the research capacity and culture survey to evaluate team success, barriers and motivators to undertaking research, and an audit of <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> from January 2013 to August 2014 was undertaken within each team. Kendell’s correlation coefficients were used to determine the association between <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> (i. e., number of journal publications, ethically approved projects and funding received) and the self-reported measures. Results: Seven out of eight teams rated their teams as having average success in research and demonstrated some form of <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> including at least two ethically approved projects. <b>Research</b> <b>activity</b> varied between teams, with funding received ranging from $ 0 to over $ 100, 000, and half the teams not producing any journal publications. Team motivators demonstrated a stronger association with <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> compared to barriers, with the motivator “enhancing team credibility” being significantly associated with funding received. No significant association between self-reported research success and actual <b>research</b> <b>activity</b> was identified. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that self-report measures of research success may not always correspond to actual <b>research</b> <b>activity,</b> and a combination of both these measures may be useful when planning RCB interventions. Variation in activity between teams and organisations should also be considered when tailoring RCB interventions. Reinforcing intrinsically motivating rewards of research may also be useful in promoting research participation for some teams. Griffith Health, School of Allied Health SciencesFull Tex...|$|R

5|$|Queen Maud Land was {{the first}} part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen.

The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892–93 and 1893–94.

5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers {{decided to use}} the bismuth-phosphate process. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to <b>research</b> <b>activities.</b> By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.|$|E
5|$|During Pettit's tenure, the Institute progressed {{into the}} top tier of {{technological}} education institutions.

Faced with a longstanding cultural war over the relative merits of basic research versus applied research, Stelson emphasized the importance of both. An increased focus on <b>research</b> <b>activities</b> allowed more funding for academics, which allowed the school's ranking to start a long and continuing rise from that of the 20s. Stelson simultaneously served as the interim director of the Georgia Tech Research Institute from 1975 to 1976, during which time he reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele—a model that GTRI retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's <b>research</b> <b>activities</b> in Antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base. This gave the advantage that the research was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In 1989, any party to the Treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need for a permanent base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
