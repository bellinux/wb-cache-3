500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007, that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organizers at the last minute. The executive producer of the 2007 VMAs Jesse Ignjatovic contacted Spears since she wanted to start the show in [...] "a very big and dramatic way", and was confident that Spears would deliver and set the tone for the rest of the night. She also said Spears was excited after she was approached by MTV to perform. On September 7, 2007, Spears started rehearsing at the Pearl Theater. An exclusive video from the rehearsal was posted on MTV.com the following day. The performance began with a close-up of the back of Spears's head, and continued with Spears turning to the camera and lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble": [...] "If you're lookin' for trouble, you came to the right place / If you're lookin' for trouble, look <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face." [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The backdrop videos featured images of chandeliers floating and silhouettes of women, which were compared by Gil Kaufman of MTV to the gun barrel and title sequence of the James Bond series. At the end of the performance, Spears smiled and thanked the audience before leaving the stage.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of her musical career, she was told many times she would not make it. At that time and still today, the genre known as {{regional}} Mexican music was and is dominated by men. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine, she stated, [...] "It was hard knocking on those doors to get my music played. One radio programmer in L.A., the meanest {{son of a bitch}} in the world, threw my CD in the trash <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face." [...] Those were the kind of issues Rivera faced as a female trying to crack the regional Mexican genre. She then released the albums We are Rivera and Farewell to Selena independently, the latter a tribute album to Tejano music singer Selena who was murdered in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this written report of my thesis is to discuss the visual element {{presented}} as partial fulfillment of the Master of Fine Arts degree.

The extended scope of the church’s belief system is fueled {{by the media and}} threads itself throughout our politics affecting all women <b>in</b> our culture. <b>My</b> visual work specifically addresses the church’s intrusion into women’s reproductive <b>rights.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> creative work, I juxtapose iconic symbols of the Catholic Church with contraceptives, not only to show the violation of women but also, the way in which power is abused...|$|R
