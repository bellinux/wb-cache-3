50|$|The project {{provides}} 1556 km2 of kharif and 1084 km2 of <b>rabi</b> <b>irrigation</b> in {{districts of}} Sambalpur, Bargarh, Bolangir, and Subarnpur. The water {{released by the}} power plant irrigates another 4360 km2 of CCA in Mahanadi delta. The dam can generate up to 307.5 MW of electrical power through its two power plants at Burla, on the dam's right bank and Chiplima, 22 km downstream from the dam. In addition, the project provides flood protection to 9500 km2 of delta area in district of Cuttack and Puri.|$|E
30|$|I {{hope you}} will take steps to ensure this flowâ€¦ West Bengal is also very much {{concerned}} at the stalemate on augmentation of flow at Farakka which {{is of paramount importance}} for meeting the ultimate requirements of India and Bangladesh. This augmentation is essentially necessary to meet the growing demand for <b>rabi</b> <b>irrigation</b> in the districts of Murshidabad, Nadia and 24 Pargana and parts of Burdwan and Hooghly districts (Government of West Bengal 1981).|$|E
5000|$|Agriculture: It is the {{backbone}} of the economy of the village. Mostly rice is grown, only in Kharif season, because of the poor irrigation facilities. Pulses and groundnut is grown in <b>Rabi</b> season. <b>Irrigation</b> is primarily dependent on rain and two tanks in the village. However, use of groundwater through bore-wells for irrigation is increasingly getting popular and therefore sweet cane and onion are being grown these days, albeit in smaller scale.|$|R
