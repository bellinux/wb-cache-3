40|$|When {{referring}} to persons in talk-in-interaction, interlocutors recruit the particular referential expressions that best satisfy both cultural and interactional contingencies, {{as well as}} the speaker’s own personal objectives. Regular referring practices reveal cultural preferences for choosing particular classes of <b>reference</b> <b>forms</b> for engaging in particular types of activities. When speakers of the northern Australian language Murriny Patha refer to each other, they display a clear preference for associating the referent to the current conversation’s participants. This preference for Association is normally achieved through the use of triangular <b>reference</b> <b>forms</b> such as kinterms. Triangulations are <b>reference</b> <b>forms</b> that link the person being spoken about to another specified person (e. g. Bill’s doctor). Triangulations are frequently used to associate the referent to the current speaker (e. g. my father), to an addressed recipient (your uncle) or co-present other (this bloke’s cousin). Murriny Patha speakers regularly associate key persons to themselves when making authoritative claims about items of business and important events. They frequently draw on kinship links when attempting to bolster their epistemic position. When speakers demonstrate their relatedness to the event’s protagonists, they ground their contribution to the discussion as being informed by appropriate genealogical connections (effectively, ‘I happen to know something about that. He was after all my own uncle’) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>reference</b> <b>form</b> (more technically, {{the least}} marked) of {{certain parts of}} speech is {{normally}} in the nominative case, but this is often not a complete specification of the <b>reference</b> <b>form,</b> as {{it may also be}} necessary to specify the number and gender. Thus the reference or least marked form of an adjective might be the nominative masculine singular. The parts of speech which are often declined and therefore may have a nominative case are nouns, adjectives, pronouns and less frequently numerals and participles. The nominative case often indicates the subject of a verb but sometimes does not indicate any particular relationship with other parts of a sentence. In some languages the nominative case is unmarked, it may be said to be marked by a zero morpheme. Moreover, in most languages with a nominative case, the nominative form is the lemma; that is, it is the <b>reference</b> <b>form</b> used to cite a word, to list it as a dictionary entry, etc.|$|E
