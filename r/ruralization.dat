40|$|Identifying {{factors that}} {{influence}} the diffusion of the Internet is paramount for researchers as well as policy makers in articulating strategies to improve the availability and subsequent use of the Internet. Most existing empirical {{studies have focused on}} this problem by analyzing diffusion data for countries for one fixed year and identified variables affecting the Internet diffusion. These variables, generally, come from the economic, technological, policy, culture, and human capital realms. These results have provided a good “snapshot” of what factors are important towards the diffusion of the Internet and the results tend to vary for studies conducted in different time frames. This paper also addresses, the phenomenon of cross-country dependence – the economic, political, and technological environment of one country affecting other countries- into account in their analyses. This paper, {{for the first time in}} the literature, empirically identifies long-term determinants of the Internet diffusion in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries by considering data for the period 1997 - 2013. It employs a recently-developed technique named “panel co-integration analysis” to model the diffusion of the internet among the SSA countries. The analysis reveals that in SSA countries, the number of telephones, the level of per capita real gross product and the extent of <b>ruralization</b> (conversely, the degree of urbanization) are the key long-term drivers of the diffusion of the Internet.

40|$|Variations in {{the amount}} of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus in the field and {{outbreaks}} of JE were examined. The causes of changes in outbreaks were examined. The following results were obtained. 1. The level of JE virus estimated by positive rates of HI reaction and the 2 -ME reaction of JE of swine tended to decrease from 1972 to 1977, and tended to increase from 1978 to 1980. On the other hand, positive rates of 2 -ME reaction in 1978 - 1980 were higher than those in 1965 - 1971. 2. The number of JE-patients was more than 50 from 1965 to 1967, thereafter it decreased and no JE-patient was detected from 1971 to 1977. Thereafter an outbreak occurred again. Two definite cases and one suspected case were recognized in 1978, one suspeted case in 1979, and one definite case in 1980. 3. One cause of the decrease in JE-patients is that the size of a pigsty has been increased and sanitary conditions have been improved. 4. Discussion was made that the course of the outbreak of JE-patients from 1965 to 1980 was attributed to the amount of JE virus in the field estimated by antibody reaction in swine, the number of Ct, the arrangement of pigsties, the spread of window setting nets, improvement of nutrition, decrease of overwork and <b>ruralization...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{developments}} {{of the twentieth century}} was {{the rise and fall of}} Communist regimes. The Soviet Union, the most prominent Communist state, acts as a model for the development and subsequent disintegration of Communist governments. This model, however, is not appropriate for the current Chinese state. The reform program initiated under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 set in motion certain trends which caused China to diverge from the Soviet model. This paper discusses the significant differences between China and the Soviet Union, with an eye toward assessing the Chinese Communist Party's ability to modernize while avoiding a Soviet-style collapse. The first chapter postulates that the Soviet Union may be used as a model to predict the fate of the Communist Party in China, but dismisses the model based upon factors that are unique to the Chinese experience. The second chapter looks at one of those reasons in detail, analyzing the contrasting movements of urbanization in the Soviet Union versus the <b>ruralization</b> of China, and discusses the political effects of these social movements. The third chapter expands another difference, examining the successes, failures, and political ramifications of economic reforms within China and the USSR. The fourth and final chapter explores the future of China and the fate of the Communist Party, recording the factors that will lead to a continuation of the Party's rule and the components that will undermine the Party's power...|$|E
40|$|Differentiation {{of village}} and {{town in the}} modern society has become a very {{difficult}} problem, because {{of the formation of}} various transitive forms of settlements {{as a consequence of the}} ever increasing influence of the process of industrialization and urbanization. Todate there are the following criteria for differentiation used by different scientific disciplines: linguistic, historical, juridical, urbanistic, statistical, socioprofessional, sociological and combined ones. Every one of them has its advantages and defects. Very often this fact is overlooked as well as the fact that some old criteria can not be applied, especially because of these reasons: the concept of village and town changes in time and space, there is no identical viewpoints on the concept of human society, many authors using already adopted terms put quite, a new social contents into old patterns. This concerns also the conceptions of some sociologists, such as F. Tönnies, W. Sombart, P. Sorokin and others. Contemporary sociological investigations and social development prove that in modern society there are not two but four patterns of human settlments: village, town, urbanized settlement and conurbation. Especially the number and the significance of urbanized settlements grow (workers colonies, suburban residential settlements, mining colonies, etc), as well as conurbations. The conurbations are very significant social phenomenon: according to their internal connections and the level of links they can be technical and organic ones, and according to their pattern two main t 3 qpes can be distinguished: Manchester and Ruhr. Only the concrete sociological investigation can give the real answer to which of these four categories every settlement belongs according to the domination of either the process of urbanization or the process of <b>ruralization...</b>|$|E

On reporting of evidences of HIV infection {{from different parts of}} the country and varied groups, Government launched the National AIDS Control Program (NACP). The program was launched on the foundation of early interventions and Mid-Term Plan, which evolved in three phases over the period of eighteen years. With progression of time, epidemiological situation changed and knowledge/capacity to tackle HIV improved. In the course of the evolution, NACP has moved from the centrally controlled program to district driven. Also different strategies were inducted/refined and many important institutes like Task Force, a high-powered National AIDS Committee, National AIDS Control Board, National AIDS Control Organization, State AIDS Control Societies, Project Support Units/Project Management Units, National Council on AIDS, Department of AIDS Control, Technical Support Unit, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) were created.

40|$|The {{author of}} the article first deals with the town/village dichotomy. He {{points out that the}} town, which now dominates the village economically, {{developed}} only with the industrial revolution. It is the industrial revolution which brought the town its productive domination over the village. Before that, the town was just a centre of consumption and exchange and thus depended on its agrarian surroundings. The author then goes on to discuss the history of urbanization in Yugoslavia. His basic idea is that the territorialization of Yugoslavia 2 ̆ 7 s population came at a rather late stage, and thus the crystallization of Yugoslav towns came as a belated process. Towns developed first in the coastal areas and then (with trade turning towards the continental parts of Europe) in the Pannonian Plain. In the interior, which was under Turkish rule, there developed trade and craft centres of the oriental type. The development of any major centres was prevented by the fragmentation of the national territory and by the orientation towards foreign capitals (Vienna, Graz, Budapest, Salonika, Trieste). The development of major towns was also slowed down by the lack of continuity in Yugoslav urbanization. Urbanization since the war has not moved in the direction of big concentrations of the urban population, either. The spread of urban achievements to rural areas and the large-scale migration of the rural population to towns have helped to reduce the contrasts between town and the country. Due to differences in economic position and political status, the contrast between agricultural and nonagricultural population is perhaps more emphasized in Yugoslavia than in other countries. The second part of the article deals with sociological differences between the urban and the rural way of life, especially those which relate to work, the family, social environment and consumption. That there has not only been an urbanization of the rural areas but also a <b>ruralization</b> of towns {{can be seen from the}} various elements of peasant culture introduced into towns by immigrating peasants. Since more than one third of the population of Yugoslav major towns are immigrant peasants, their influence on life in these towns has been considerable. At the end of the article the author discusses the various forms of this influence...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the influence of traditional values on urban life in Iraq, with special reference to Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. Very much has been said about the function of the city as a social form exerting an independent causal effect on other forms of social organisation and on behaviour. The classical urban sociologists believed that city dwelling was likely to eliminate traditional family construction, kinship system and conventional behaviour. The present study attempts to test these assumptions - through a comparative analysis of three different groups of household heads : urban natives [city born], migrants and villagers [control group]- and to recognize the diffusion of traditional values, norms and customs in urban dwellers' behaviour and attitudes, as reacted in the contacts and social relationships among them. Baghdad has a long urban history, dating back more than a thousand years, although it has declined and been devastated several times during its history. After 1258 A. D, successive invasions by Persian and Ottoman armies destroyed the city and compelled most of its inhabitants to flee, either to other agglomerate centres or to small towns and villages. As a result, Baghdad in the eighteenth century and {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century was no more than a collection of small hamlets. However, the city faced new era of increase and urbanization after the First World War, due to two main factors: a) the rapid and vast increase, in migration from rural to urban areas since the end of second world war; b) the natural increase which reflects the improvement in health economy and education. The process of urbanization in Iraq, particularly Baghdad, has developed even more rapidly in the last four decades, mainly because of successive waves of rural migrants, especially from the southern regions: Mysan, Wasit, Thi-Qar, Muthana and Qadisya. Migrants predominate demographically and socially in the city, and most of the city's inhabitants have a deep-rooted rural background. In moving to the city, they have taken with them the attitudes, values, norms and beliefs of their villages, so that the cities have become, in effect, huge villages. In other words, in Iraqi cities, especially Baghdad, the process of urbanization has not necessarily been accompanied by "urbanism" as a way of life. Thus, in the major cities in Iraq, particularly Baghdad which has more migrants than any other, traditional values are sharply reflected in the social behaviour, and in most aspects of lifestyle. Thus the thesis is concerned with the similarities and differences between the three sets of household heads; it dwells on their rural or urban origins, their education, age, sex, occupation, income and their attitude toward many aspects of social organization. To test the diffusion of traditional characteristics among the indigenous of Baghdad city, in relation to the factors outlined above, the thesis accords priority to four salient issues: a) family organization, including the family structure, power, and authority, women's roles, and patterns of marriage; b) kinship networks in city social life, among those in both rural and urban categories; kinship control over marriage, loyalty and nepotism, mutual aid and obligations. c) attitudes to neighbours and neighbourhood participation and relationships, including the role of neighbours as a source of social control; d) attitude to social time, with reference to differences in social activities, such as work, leisure, punctuality, keeping appointments and general outlook on the dimension of time. These issues might shed light on our assumption that Baghdad city is deeply exposed to what has been called "the <b>ruralization</b> of the city"...|$|E
40|$|En español: En las últimas décadas, la globalización, en tanto proceso de inclusión/exclusión está reavivando la cuestión de las identidades culturales -étnicas, raciales, locales, regionales- y convirtiendo la cultura en espacio estratégico de comprensión de las tensiones que desgarran y recomponen el “estar juntos” (Martin Barbero, 2009). En este escenario, la difusión de nuevos patrones de consumo y hábitos de vida, y la creciente movilidad (migraciones de la ciudad al campo) de la población, modifican la organización del territorio diluyendo la dualidad entre lo rural y lo urbano. Premisa {{fundamental}} para entender el desenvolvimiento de las actividades agropecuarias y el sentido que están cobrando en la actualidad las relaciones entre campo y ciudad. En este contexto, surge el desarrollo de una “nueva ruralidad”; y con ello, el advenimiento de las nuevas características que definen el espacio rural, modificando los esquemas tradicionales que lo constituyen. Las circunstancias demuestran que es imprescindible la búsqueda de sentido en torno a lo que se (re) conoce como “nuevas ruralidades” o “interacciones rural-urbano”. La presentación plantea una discusión en torno a la construcción del objeto de estudio de la comunicación rural, y pone de manifiesto, la urgente necesidad de repensar dicho objeto. Este propósito, supone estudiar y entender las luchas y competencias por imponer y legitimar normas, reglas y definiciones, incluyendo el objeto legitimado como “correcto”. El fluctuante panorama sociocultural obliga a plantear nuevos interrogantes claves, con el propósito de comprender el significado de los fenómenos sociales en la cultura en la que se producen. Se piensa la posición del campo de la comunicación rural en el seno del campo del poder y su evolución en el decurso del tiempo. Para ello, se infieren luchas por construir un objeto legítimo. Se atienden las condiciones de producción de dicho campo y se trata de ubicar los modos de envejecimiento de las posiciones objetos, estudios y teorías (el proceso de construcción de lo nuevo y lo viejo en el campo). La urbanización de lo rural y la ruralización de lo urbano nos enfrentan a un mapa regenerado de procesos sociales en los cuales, en muchos casos, la comunicación que los niega precisa revelar lo que implican en su existencia y diversidad (Cimadevilla, 2002, p. 319). In english: In recent decades, the globalization, as an inclusion/ {{exclusion process}} is reviving {{the question of}} the cultural identities – ethnic, racial, local and regional ones, thus transforming the culture in a strategic area to understand the tensions which tear up and rebuild the concept of “being together” (Martín Barbero, 2009). In this setting, the broadcasting of new consumption patterns and ways of life, and the increasing population movements (migrations from cities to rural areas) have changed the territorial organization, consequently, weakening the duality between the rural and the urban life. That is the essential premise to understand the development of agricultural activities and the relevant meaning that the rural and urban relationships are achieving at present. It is in this setting where a “new rurality” concept emerges along with new features that define the rural area and thereby modifying the traditional patterns that constitute it. The conditions show that the search for meaning is an essential requisite around what is known as “new ruralities” or “rural-urban interactions”. The need for discussion around the construction of the object of study in rural communication aims to demonstrate the diversity of the prevailing views. Besides, it shows the urgent necessity to reconsider the communicational object. This purpose implies the study and understanding of the struggles and the abilities to establish, assert and legitimate norms, rules and definitions, including the object regarded as “correct”. The changing socio-cultural scene makes us outline new and key questions {{in order to understand the}} meaning of the social phenomena in the culture in which they are produced. The position of the rural communication field is thought within the field of power and its evolution is seen at length. That´s why, arguments or disputes to build and frame a legitimate object are expected. The conditions of production of such field are addressed and there is an attempt to place the ways of aging of the object positions, studies and theories (the process of constructing the new and the old in that field). The urbanization of rural life and the <b>ruralization</b> of the urban make us face a restored map of the social processes in which, mostly, the communication that neglects them needs to disclose what they imply in its existence and diversity.
