50|$|When still cameras using 35 mm film, {{originally}} {{used for}} cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish {{them from the}} then commonplace rollfilm cameras. While the term {{could be used for}} a camera larger than a subminiature and smaller than a <b>rollfilm</b> <b>camera,</b> it was mostly used for cameras taking 135 film cassettes, or other 35 mm cassettes.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} cameras {{folded into}} the body and used bellows to protect the light path. The film was put on two spools, one with the negative roll, and one with the positive paper and reagent pods. The film developed inside the camera. The exception to this is the Polaroid Swinger, a hardbody <b>rollfilm</b> <b>camera</b> whose film was {{pulled out of the}} camera body to develop outside the camera. The film for rollfilm cameras was discontinued in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Sheet film {{or glass}} plate holders for medium format <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> can be found, but are of mainly {{historical}} interest. Some <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> have interchangeable backs to accommodate different film types. Some 35mm cameras have motorised backs that hold longer than normal film lengths, with a mechanism that automatically advances the film after each exposure.|$|R
50|$|A few <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> have {{movements}} {{that make them}} as versatile as a sheet film view <b>camera.</b> <b>Rollfilm</b> and instant film backs are available to use {{in place of a}} sheetfilm holder on a single-film camera.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{advances}} in low-cost photography {{made possible by}} Eastman, plate cameras still offered higher-quality prints and remained popular well into the 20th century. To compete with <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras,</b> which offered {{a larger number of}} exposures per loading, many inexpensive plate cameras from this era were equipped with magazines to hold several plates at once. Special backs for plate cameras allowing them to use film packs or rollfilm were also available, as were backs that enabled <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> to use plates.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of films enabled the existing designs for plate cameras {{to be made}} much smaller and for the base-plate to be hinged {{so that it could}} be folded up compressing the bellows. These designs were very compact and small models were dubbed vest pocket <b>cameras.</b> Folding <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras</b> were preceded by folding plate cameras, more compact than other designs.|$|R
50|$|Rangefinder cameras {{have been}} made in all sizes and all film formats over the years, from 35mm through medium format (rollfilm) to large-format press cameras. Until the mid-1950s most were {{generally}} fitted to more expensive models of <b>cameras.</b> Folding bellows <b>rollfilm</b> <b>cameras,</b> such as the Balda Super Baldax or Mess Baldix, the Kodak Retina II, IIa, IIc, IIIc, and IIIC cameras and the Hans Porst Hapo 66e (a cheaper version of the Balda Mess Baldix), were often fitted with rangefinders.|$|R
50|$|Medium-format (<b>rollfilm)</b> {{rangefinder}} <b>cameras</b> {{continue to}} be produced. Recent models include the Mamiya 6 and 7I/7II, the Bronica RF645 and the Fuji G, GF, GS, GW and GSW series.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{introduction}} of <b>rollfilm,</b> folding plate <b>cameras</b> with limited movements as described here were often used. An example is the Goerz Taro-Tenax 9x12cm.|$|R
50|$|Pocket Kodak 1895-1896Pocket Kodaks {{were small}} (2 and 3/16 x 3 x 4 inches) and {{lightweight}} (6 ounces), and took roughly 2 inch exposures on 102 size <b>rollfilm.</b> This <b>camera</b> {{had a new}} feature, a small view box that told how many exposures of film were left. They were first available in 1895 with either black or red leather covering.|$|R
