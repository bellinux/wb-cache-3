The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever,</b> Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and Q fever, Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever,</b> babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E

25|$|Facilities {{improved}} during Soviet times. Education {{and public}} health especially began to see some major changes. In 1913, Nakhchivan only had two hospitals {{with a total of}} 20 beds. The region was plagued by widespread diseases including trachoma and typhus. Malaria, which mostly came from the adjoining Aras River, brought serious harm to the region. At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhchivan's population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and trachoma, typhus, and <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever</b> were completely eliminated.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} week of September 1918, {{retreating}} Armenians from Van came to the Bakubah refugee camp in parties of 1,000 or 2,000, by road and by train.

There were many who died along the road because of weakness and starvation. This went on through September and the first half of October, until about 40,000 had been received in all. Towards the end of September it was decided to raise four battalions from among the Armenians on the lines of an Indian infantry battalion. The 2nd Battalion was established by Van Armenians. The 3rd Battalion was established by Armenians from other regions. The G.O.C. North Persian Force decided to locate the 2nd Battalion around Senna, while the 3rd Battalion moved to Bijar.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{discuss the}} prevalence, {{clinical}} and laboratory presentations of <b>relapse</b> typhoid <b>fever.</b> MethodsAll <b>relapse</b> cases were reviewed {{to identify the}} clinical and laboratory presentation of the <b>relapse</b> typhoid <b>fever.</b> ResultsTwo hundred and forty six patients were admitted to a teaching tertiary hospital in North-eastern state of Malaysia and fourteen (5. 69 %) relapse cases were identified. The duration of relapse after the patient was discharged was (25. 0 ± 9. 9) d. The patients presented with fever, diarrhoea, headache, abdominal pain and constipation. The duration of fever before admission in the initial episode [(8. 6 ± 4. 2) d] was significantly longer than the relapse episode [(5. 0 ± 2. 5) d] (P= 0. 019). Four patients have hepatomegaly in initial episode and ten in relapse episode (P= 0. 852). The defervescence days of initial episodes was (3. 2 ± 2. 2) d, comparing to relapse episode [(2. 0 ± 1. 8) d] which was statistically not significant (P= 0. 124).

25|$|Many {{bacteria}} are parasitic, though since {{the result is}} infection and disease, sometimes leading to death, they are generally thought of as pathogens instead. Parasitic {{bacteria are}} extremely diverse, and infect their hosts {{by a variety of}} routes. To give a few examples, Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; the bacillus's spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. Borrelia, the cause of Lyme disease and <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever,</b> is transmitted by a vector, ticks of the genus Ixodes, from the diseases' reservoirs in animals such as deer. Campylobacter jejuni, a cause of severe enteritis (gut inflammation), is spread by the fecal-oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. Haemophilus influenzae, an agent of bacterial meningitis and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual intercourse.|$|E
500|$|Devotions upon Emergent Occasions, or in full Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and severall {{steps in}} my Sicknes, is a prose {{work by the}} English metaphysical poet and cleric in the Church of England John Donne, {{published}} in 1624. It covers death, rebirth and the Elizabethan concept of sickness as a visit from God, reflecting internal sinfulness. The Devotions were written in December 1623 as Donne recovered from a serious but unknown illness – believed to be <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever</b> or typhus. Having come close to death, he described the illness he had suffered from and his thoughts throughout his recovery with [...] "near super-human speed and concentration". Registered by 9 January, and published soon after, the Devotions {{is one of only}} seven works attributed to Donne which were printed during his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In November 1623, Donne fell seriously ill. London was {{the scene}} of a 'spotted' or <b>relapsing</b> <b>fever,</b> which hit its victims {{unexpectedly}} and left them conscious but physically helpless. What disease Donne suffered from is not known. Writers have suggested typhus as a likely culprit, but Donne's writings on the subject reference multiple diseases. Clara Lander, writing in , suggests that the typhus may have exacerbated the enteritis Donne had suffered from since childhood. Donne was of the opinion – as were many others of the age – that illness reflected a state of internal sinfulness, and constituted a visit from God. Despite being ordered to rest, he insisted that a pen and paper be given to him, and he wrote down his impressions of the disease. After his recovery, in December, these became Devotions upon Emergent Occasions, one of his few published prose works, and also one of only seven printed works of which he acknowledged authorship. Written with [...] "near super-human speed and concentration", the work was registered with the Stationers' Company by 9 January 1624. It was published that year, and again in 1634 and 1638. The full, albeit rarely used, title is Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and severall steps in my Sicknes.|$|E

40|$|Background: In Africa, <b>relapsing</b> <b>fevers</b> are {{neglected}} arthropod-borne infections {{caused by}} closely related Borrelia species. They cause mild to deadly undifferentiated fever particularly severe in pregnant women. Lack of {{a tool to}} genotype these Borrelia organisms limits knowledge regarding their reservoirs and their epidemiology. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genome sequence analysis of Borrelia crocidurae, Borrelia duttonii and Borrelia recurrentis yielded 5 intergenic spacers scattered between 10 chromosomal genes that were incorporated into a multispacer sequence typing (MST) approach. Sequencing these spacers directly from human blood specimens previously found to be infected by B. recurrentis (30 specimens), B. duttonii (17 specimens) and B. crocidurae (13 specimens) resolved these 60 strains and the 3 type strains into 13 species-specific spacer types {{in the presence of}} negative controls. B. crocidurae comprised of 8 spacer types, B. duttonii of 3 spacer types and B. recurrentis of 2 spacer types.

Most rodents are considered keystone species in their ecological communities, hence the survival of many other species in the ecosystem depend on them. From medical point of view, this is particularly important for rodent-dependent pathogens.
