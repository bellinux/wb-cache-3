40|$|Leptasterias spp. are six rayed sea {{stars that}} are found in rocky {{intertidal}} habitats ranging from the California coast to Alaska. In central California, Leptasterias spp. {{can be found in}} a variety of intertidal habitats in mixed populations. There are multiple clades that represent these populations and it is thought that they may vary behaviorally, including habitat preference. To investigate this individuals were collected from Pigeon Point, San Mateo, CA and characterized into two habitat categories according to where they were found: rocky habitat and pool habitat. To test for behavioral variation among habitats, <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> was used as a performance measure. <b>Righting</b> <b>response</b> time was measured in the field and was repeatedly measured in the lab under controlled conditions.

40|$|Incubation {{temperature}} {{has significant}} developmental effects on oviparous animals, including affecting sexual differentiation for several species. Incubation temperature also affects traits that can influence survival, {{a theory that}} is verified in this study for the Northwest Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). We conducted controlled laboratory incubations and experiments to test for an effect of incubation temperature on performance of loggerhead hatchlings. Sixty-eight hatchlings were tested in 2011, and 31 in 2012, produced from eggs incubated at 11 different constant temperatures ranging from 27 ˚C to 33 ˚C. Following their emergence from the eggs, we tested <b>righting</b> <b>response,</b> crawling speed, and conducted a 24 -hour long swim test.

40|$|Leatherback {{hatchling}} fitness on land {{is essential}} for their success in entering the ocean without being predated. Two ways fitness on land may be measured are by how fast hatchlings crawl {{as well as how}} fast their righting responses are when they are flipped onto their carapaces. Hatchlings from certain nests have slower <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> times along with slower crawl times, both of which would increase the odds of predation and hinder the success of hatchlings reaching the ocean. Hatchling crawling speed was determined by timing 12 randomly selected hatchlings from each nest to crawl a distance of two meters. To measure each of the 12 hatchlings’ <b>righting</b> <b>response,</b> hatchlings were laid on their carapace in a standardized divot and timed from the moment it was released from the researcher’s hand to the instant it began crawling after righting. Data were collected from almost 500 hatchlings from more than 40 nests. Fitness and vigor in hatchlings may be an important indication of female fitness.

40|$|Climatic {{warming is}} a global problem and acute thermal {{stressor}} in particular could {{be considered as a}} major stressor for wildlife. Cane toads (Rhinella marina) have expanded their range into warmer regions of Australia and they provide a suitable model species to study the sub-lethal impacts of thermal stressor on the endocrine physiology of amphibians. Presently, there is no information to show that exposure to an acute thermal stressor could initiate a physiological stress (glucocorticoid) response and secondly, the possible effects on reproductive hormones and performance. Answering these questions is important for understanding the impacts of extreme temperature on amphibians. In this study, we experimented on cane toads from Queensland, Australia by acclimating them to mildly warm temperature (25 °C) and then exposing to acute temperature treatments of 30 °, 35 ° or 40 °C (hypothetical acute thermal stressors). We measured acute changes in the stress hormone corticosterone and the reproductive hormone testosterone using standard capture and handling protocol and quantified the metabolites of both hormones non-invasively using urinary enzyme-immunoassays. Furthermore, we measured performance trait (i. e. <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> score) in the control acclimated and the three treatment groups. Corticosterone stress responses increased in all toads during exposure to an acute thermal stressor. Furthermore, exposure to a thermal stressor also decreased testosterone levels in all toads. The duration of the <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> (seconds) was longer for toads that were exposed to 40 °C than to 30 °, 35 ° or 25 °C. The increased corticosterone stress response with increased intensity of the acute thermal stressor suggests that the toads perceived this treatment as a stressor. Furthermore, the results also highlight a potential trade-off with performance and reproductive hormones. Ultimately, exposure acute thermal stressors due to climatic variability could impact amphibians at multiple eco-physiological levels through impacts on endocrine physiology, performance and potentially fitness traits (e. g. reproductive output) ...|$|E

Long-term elevated temperature showed different effects on the three behaviors.

40|$|Background: The nest {{environment}} influences phenotypic {{traits of}} hatchling turtles. Female turtles select nest sites that promote hatchling survival, and alter nesting behaviour {{in response to}} changing environments. Differences in phenotype generated by incubation environment could provide variation in traits that natural selection can act upon. The relationship between incubation temperature in the laboratory and post-hatching phenotype is well documented, but whether incubation in nature generates biologically meaningful levels of phenotypic variation is less well studied. Questions: (1) What are the effects of canopy cover, laying date, and nest depth on incubation temperature? (2) What are the relationships between incubation temperature, egg mass, and hatchling phenotype? (3) What are the sex-specific effects of incubation temperature on phenotypic variation in two turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination? Organisms: Painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) nests and hatchlings from Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Methods: In 2010 and 2011, we measured canopy cover at nests and hourly temperatures within nests throughout incubation. Post-parturition, we measured egg mass of each clutch. After emergence, we measured hatchling <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> (time taken to flip from carapace to plastron), carapace length, and mass. Conclusions: Canopy cover and oviposition date did not affect nest temperature, but nest depth influenced daily temperature variance in snapping turtle nests. However, limited variation in environmental characteristics suggests that a female's ability to select microhabitats that adaptively affect offspring survivorship or phenotype is limited. Female painted turtles with heavier eggs selected nest sites that were warmer. Nest incubation temperature was related to multiple hatchling characteristics. Painted turtle hatchling carapace length {{was positively related to}} mean incubation temperature, but snapping turtle hatchling size was not related to incubation temperature. Painted turtle hatchling <b>righting</b> <b>response</b> was not related to incubation temperature, but snapping turtle hatchlings from warmer nests righted themselves more quickly and hatchlings from nests with greater temperature variance righted more slowly. Our predicted nest sex ratios suggested that warmer nests with heavier eggs would produce female hatchlings. Also, in both species, carapace length was greater for hatchlings from nests predicted to produce females than from nests predicted to produce males. These findings from a natural setting help to inform future research on the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination. 20 page(s...|$|E
