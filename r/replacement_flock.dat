40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Experimental Farm in Żelazna on 289 ewes of the foundation stock, 21 stud rams, 63 <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes and 24 rams intended for further breeding of the Żelazna sheep. All animals were subjected to the identification of the prion protein PrP gene. The lower genetic diversity of alleles and genotypes of scrapie in stud rams (three genotypes and two alleles) and in rams for further breeding (five genotypes and three alleles) than in ewes of the foundation stock (eight genotypes and five alleles) and in <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes (five genotypes and three alleles) was found. In case of <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes, rams for further breeding and stud rams an increasing in the frequency of genotypes and alleles containing the ARR allele was observed as opposed to decreasing in the frequency of alleles: ARQ, AHQ and ARH. In foundation stock ewes during {{the first two years of}} research the not scrapie resistant allele VRQ was observed. In the third year of the study it was completely eliminated from the flock. The obtained results, especially for <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes and rams for further breeding, indicate the legitimacy to conduct breeding work towards increasing the genotypes resistant scrapie. That indicates the validity of the development of breeding program for the Żelazna sheep breed...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella {{infection}} of laying flocks in the UK is predominantly {{a problem of}} the persistent contamination of layer houses and associated wildlife vectors by S. Enteritidis. Methods for its control and elimination include effective cleaning and dis{{infection of}} layer houses between flocks, {{and it is important}} to be able to measure the success of such decontamination. A method for the environmental detection and semi-quantitative enumeration of salmonellae was used and compared with a standard qualitative method, in twelve Salmonella-contaminated caged layer houses before and after cleaning and disinfection. The quantitative technique proved to have comparable sensitivity to the standard method, and additionally provided insights into the numerical Salmonella challenge that <b>replacement</b> <b>flocks</b> would encounter. Elimination of S. Enteritidis was not achieved in any of the premises examined although substantial reductions in the prevalence and numbers of salmonellae were demonstrated, while in others an increase in contamination was observed after cleaning and disinfection. Particular problems with feeders and wildlife vectors were highlighted. The use of a quantitative method assisted the identification of problem areas, such as those with a high initial bacterial load or those experiencing only a modest reduction in bacterial count following decontamination...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is the causative {{agent of}} chronic {{respiratory}} disease in layer chickens. The live MG vaccine strains that are available for use in layer chickens include F, ts- 11 and 6 / 85. The MG vaccine strains ts- 11 and 6 / 85 are safer than F and they {{have little or no}} potential of spreading from bird to bird. However, ts- 11 and 6 / 85 appear to be less efficacious than F-strain. Results from studies suggest that the use of MG vaccine strain F in <b>replacement</b> <b>flocks</b> {{over a period of time}} results in the displacement of the original field strain. Also, reports of MG breaks in layer flocks previously vaccinated with ts- 11 or 6 / 85 have resulted in revaccination of these flocks with F. The continued use of F-strain in displacement and revaccination regimens necessitates the development of more rapid and sensitive field tests that will differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains of MG. In the present study, ts- 11 and F-strain whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting and proteomic methodologies. Differentially expressed protein bands were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The proteins were identified as internal proteins and were predicted to be involved in such cellular processes as carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperone activity, transcription, and translation. The results of this study suggest that proteomics may aid in the characterization of proteins that could contribute to the development and improvement of current MG diagnostic tests...|$|R
500|$|Upland and hill farms provide grazing for hardy breeds {{of cattle}} like Welsh Blacks and for Welsh Mountain sheep.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1969. Bibliography: leaves [157]- 163. ix, 163 l illus., tablesThe {{many changes}} taking place in the economy of Hawaii {{as well as in the}} {{industry}} itself lead to a questioning of the future of the industry in Hawaii. The major objective of the study was to evaluate the competitive position of the Hawaii egg industry with respect to California. A survey of 14 egg ranches on Oahu was conducted from which the cost of producing eggs in Honolulu county was determined. The information gathered provided the basis for studying production factors affecting the competitive position of the Hawaii industry. Four production factors were investigated in depth~ feed cost, <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> cost, labor cost, and the effect of increased flock size. Some of the facts uncovered by the study were: Feed and <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> costs are higher in Hawaii. Most of the differences in cost were due to transportation. Labor cost in Honolulu was significantly higher than the three California counties used for comparison. However, since local producers received higher prices for eggs and poultry meat, net farm income per layer was higher in Hawaii. Increased flock size could reduce production cost per layer, while the attrition of ranches with small flocks could add to the industry's competitive strength. Marketing factors affecting the competitive position of the egg industry were categorized under two groups~ the length and complexity of the marketing channel, and the competitive marketing actions of producers. It was found that transfer cost, which raises the price of production inputs, also raises the price of mainland eggs in Hawaii. The longer, more complex marketing channel of mainland eggs further increases the price of imported eggs. However, in spite of the higher marketing costs, mainland eggs can be sold at lower prices because of the lower cost of production. Current freight rates prohibit the importation of table eggs by air. While it may be physically possible to fly eggs in the cargo holds of the jumbo jets, it is doubtful that untreated shell eggs will be flown to Hawaii. The principal conclusion drawn from the available data is that competitive action by ranchers, advertising laws in Hawaii, and consumers' preferences for local eggs are factors which combine to maintain current competitive strength. Hawaii poultry ranchers will be able to maintain the 95 percent of the fresh egg market in Hawaii...|$|R
40|$|A {{deterministic}} model is developed {{to support the}} tactical and operational replacement decisions at broiler breeder farms. The marginal net revenue approach is applied to determine the optimal replacement age of a flock. The objective function of the model maximizes the annual gross margin over the flock’s production cycle. To calculate the gross margin, future egg production, fertility, or hatchability of the eggs, revenues and variable costs of a flock were estimated. For tactical decisions, the optimal laying length is {{the age at which}} the average gross margin of an average flock is maximal. For operational decisions, a flock should be replaced when the marginal gross margin of a replaceable flock is less than the average gross margin of an average flock. To demonstrate the model, a broiler breeder flock from a Dutch breeder farm was used. A sensitivity analysis showed that the optimal replacement decision, for both tactical and operational management, is sensitive to the decrease in the weekly egg production after the peak and the prices of feed and hatching eggs. The effect of the decrease in weekly fertility after the peak on the replacement decision is related to the payment system for hatching eggs.

40|$|The study {{described}} in this article is concerned with the derivation of an average production function for 50 sheep farms on an area of light land in the Malvern County, Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. It is based on farm survey data for the 1955 / 6 season. The locality of the survey was chosen chiefly because it contained 51, 000 acres of essentially similar soils, the Lismore series, and an adequate number of farms exhibiting a fairly high degree of homogeneity in their management. Although there are variations in farm management in the area, the predominant pattern consists of the maintenance of half bred, threequarter bred, or Romney-cross ewe flocks for the production of Downcross fat lambs. Most of the <b>replacements</b> for ewe <b>flocks</b> are purchased from other areas but some of the larger properties breed their own. The average winter carrying capacity of the sheep farms in the area was 1. 7 ewe equivalents per acre for 1956. The system of farming is practically confined to a pastoral one due to the desiccating effect of the north west Fohn type winds which prevail during the summer. These conditions, combined with a shallow shingly soil, result in unreliable yields of cash crops and small seeds. Livestock Production/Industries, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Northern Gondar to characterize the village chicken production system under urban condition. A cross sectional type of studies were conducted to collect data from November 2010 to April 2011 using questionnaire survey and a simple random sampling techniques, 100 households were included in the survey. The main production objectives of chicken were income generation, household consumption and <b>replacement</b> of the <b>flock.</b> And most of the activities in chicken rearing were carried out by women. The average flock size was 10. 44 chickens with a range of 2 - 18 birds. Most of the birds rested at night in a separated confined chicken house. Chickens in the study area were getting their major feed resources through scavenging with little supplementary feed provision. The major causes of losses of chicken in the study area were disease (47 %), predation (22 %) and mismanagement (31 %). According to respondents, the common signs of disease frequently occurred in their flock were watery and yellowish diarrhoea, closing of eyes, head hangs down, high level of morbidity, depression, droppings of wings, sneezing or coughing, nasal discharge, twisting of head and neck, loss of appetite and mass death. The average number of eggs laid by local hen was 11. 53 eggs/hen/clutch and the hatchability percentage observed in this study was 87. 29 %, which ranged from 57. 1 %- 100 %. The most important constraints of poultry production in the study villages were disease (1 st), predators (2 nd), shortage of supplementary feeds (3 rd), poultry housing problem (4 th) and lack of veterinary health services (5 th).

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study with repeated sampling {{was conducted to}} investigate potential risk factors for Newcastle disease (ND) seropositivity and for incidence of ND virus (NDV) exposure in household flocks of backyard chickens in Eastern Shewa zone, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 260 randomly selected households in 52 villages in Adami Tulu Jido Kombolcha and Ada'a woredas (districts) using a structured questionnaire, and serum samples from chickens were tested for NDV antibodies using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sampling took place during September 2009 and the same households were again sampled in May 2010. Household-level seroprevalence and incidence of NDV exposure were estimated in various ways using serological results from the two samplings, flock dynamics, and farmers' reports of ND in their flocks. The risk factors were assessed using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models. Household-level seroprevalence at the two sampling times was 17. 4 % and 27. 4 %, respectively, and the estimated incidence of household-level NDV exposure during the intervening period ranged between 19. 7 % and 25. 5 %. At the first sampling, reduced frequency of cleaning of poultry waste was associated with increased odds of seropositivity (OR = 4. 78; 95 % CI: 1. 42, 16. 11; P = 0. 01) while hatching at home vs. other sources (buying in replacement birds, receiving as gift or buying fertile eggs) was associated with lower odds of seropositivity, both at the first sampling (OR = 0. 30; 95 % CI: 0. 11, 0. 82; P = 0. 02) and the second sampling (OR = 0. 23; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 52; P < 0. 001). The risk of NDV exposure was shown to be higher with larger flock size {{at the beginning of}} the observation period (OR = 3. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 25, 10. 39; P = 0. 02). Using an open water source (pond or river) for poultry compared to closed sources (tap or borehole) was associated with increased risk of NDV exposure (OR = 3. 14; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 8. 8; P = 0. 03). The use of a grain supplement (OR = 0. 14; 95 % CI: 0. 03, 0. 69; P = 0. 03) and hatching at home for <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> (OR = 0. 23; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 52; P = 0. 005) were associated with a lower risk of NDV exposure. Newcastle disease seroprevalence and incidence of NDV exposure were more heterogeneous between villages than between kebeles (aggregations of villages) and woredas in the study area. Further investigation of village-level risk factors would likely improve our understanding of ND epidemiology in backyard chickens. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three districts of central zone of Tigray, with the aim to assess the socioeconomic characteristics and production environments of local chicken ecotypes, along with farmers’ breeding objectives, breeding practice, and traits of preference for local chickens and to assess the phenotypic characteristics of the local chicken. A total of 242 chicken owners were selected for the study. Nine qualitative and nineteen quantitative traits from 457 chickens were considered. The research finding revealed that village chicken production seems to be an important activity with an average flock size 9. 41 and 8. 98 birds per household in midland and highland agro ecology. The most important chicken production system of the study area is traditional with small feed supplementation. A separate house to keep chicken was practiced in 36. 8 % and 28. 9 % of the respondents in highland and midland area, respectively. About 87. 6 % of the respondents select eggs for incubation and straw was commonly used as bedding material. About 96. 7 % of the respondent use broody hens for incubation and rearing chicks. About 81 % of households participate in chicken and egg marketing as a source of income. Culling is practiced by 78. 9 % of households based on production level of chicken, age, plumage color, ill and bad temperament of hens and cocks. The main breeding objectives of the respondents were meant for household consumption, income generation and for <b>replacement</b> of the <b>flock.</b> The effective population size (Ne) and the rate of inbreeding (ÄF) calculated for the indigenous chicken flock of the study area were 3. 99 and 0. 13, respectively. The selection criteria used for selection of breeding hen were egg size, plumage color, broodiness, disease resistance and hatchability with an average index value of 0. 067, 0. 064, 0. 062, 0. 054, 0. 042. The highest selection criteria used for selection of breeding cock were egg number of the dam, comb type, plumage color, and disease resistance, egg size growth rate with an index value of 0. 053, 0. 052, 0. 045, 0. 044, 0. 041 and 0. 041, respectively. Farmers preferred traits like comb type, plumage color, egg size, broodiness, disease resistance, meat quality, fertility growth, egg number and body size with indices of 0. 169, 0. 156, 0. 137, 0. 117, 0. 114, 0. 113, 0. 108, 0. 096 and 0077, respectively. Reproductive performance study revealed that the overall mean age at first mating of male chickens and the age at first egg of female chickens were 5. 29 and 5. 96 months. Local chicken were mostly normally feathered (hens 97. 8 %, cocks 96 %), red (33 %), grayish (17. 5 %), brownish (17. 3 %) colors. Morph metric measurements indicated that significance differences (P< 0. 05) were observed between agro ecology with respect to breast width, spur length, chest circumferences and shank length. In all parameters, male shows higher significance (P< 0. 001) value than female except breast width and beak width. Multivariate analysis result showed that five PC were extracted that accounted for 58. 45 % of the total variation. The differentiation of highland and midland populations was apparent based on the weights of neck length, beak length, body length, wattle width, body weight, wattle length and height at back traits. The Mahalanobis’ distances between populations shows the smallest and largest distances between highland and midland chicken ecotypes. In conclusion, there is diversity of indigenous chicken population and farmers’ preference for specific traits that may invite to design community based genetic improvement.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a stochastic dynamic model to simulate a pastoral sheep enterprise. The event driven model was constructed using the iconic simulation package, ExtendTM. Events corresponded to the shifting of animals from one paddock to another. Each paddock was represented as a single entity with inherent attributes such as grazing area, sward characteristics and pasture production potential. The rotation sequence for grazing was determined by always allocating the flock of ewes, <b>flock</b> <b>replacements</b> or lambs to the paddock with the greatest pasture mass. Herbage mass was divided into three fractions: leaf, stem and dead. Pasture growth and senescence rates for individual paddocks were calculated from pasture leaf mass. A Micherlich-type function was used to relate leaf mass to total pasture growth. Senescence was assumed to increase linearly with herbage mass. Deterministic or stochastic pasture growth rate data can be generated by the model. Pasture responses to nitrogen were estimated dynamically and moderated for the farm by entering a user-defined response for a standard 50 kg/ha nitrogen application. Animal performance was calculated using average attributes for ewes, ewe hoggets and rams, but lambs were simulated individually. Lamb performance is affected by its date of birth and sex, and this information was generated by a sub-model for mixed-age ewe and ewe hogget reproduction. The potential herbage intake of the sheep was defined by their rumen fill and physiological energy demand, and herbage availability which was defined by pre-grazing green herbage mass and green herbage allowance for rotational grazing and leaf mass for continuous grazing. The grazing time spent in each paddock was derived from a linear interpolation of user-defined herbage allowances for each month of the year. The proportion of leaf, stem and dead material in the diet was calculated according to the proportion of these fractions in the sward and herbage availability. If animals were supplemented they consumed all of the material offered. This caused pasture substitution by decreasing the physiological energy demand and utilising rumen space otherwise taken up by grazed pasture. The partitioning of nutrients by animals was estimated from the ratio between energy intake and energy demand in an animal growth sub-model. This was driven by the DNA, protein and fat content of individual lambs and the average for animals in other sheep classes. Lambs were drafted for sale and graded according to user-defined threshold drafting weights. Carcass weight and fatness (GR) were generated from the live weight and sex of individuals lambs. A genetic optimisation algorithm was developed to optimise the systems control variables incorporated in the model. These were pasture allowance, supplement fed, nitrogen applied and lamb drafting weight. The model was evaluated against three New Zealand "farmlet" grazing experiments. This validation suggested re-parameterisation of the physiological intake limit is needed and that the British equation used to relate intake to leaf mass availability is overly sensible to the pasture conditions found in New Zealand. The model was also used to test the effects of pasture measurement errors on the profitability of a grazing system. Significant differences in profitability occurred when a CV of 40 % in measurement of pasture mass was assumed (Gross margin = $NZ 495 /ha vs. $NZ 542 /ha and $NZ 570 /ha for 20 and 0 % CV in measurement estimations and normal variability in pasture accumulation rates and Gross margin = $NZ 587 /ha, $NZ 576 /ha and $NZ 519 /ha, respectively for 40, 20 and 0 % CV in measurement estimates and no pasture accumulation rate variability). It was concluded that low gains in system performance can be expected by improving the accuracy of measuring pre-grazing herbage mass beyond the level (13 - 16 % CV) provided by the correct use of current measurement techniques...|$|R
