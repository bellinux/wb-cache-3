40|$|For {{crystalline}} silicon {{solar cells}} having an alloyed aluminum back contact, open-circuit voltage increases with aluminum thickness. The increase is {{ascribed to the}} formation of a p+/p "high-low " junction by liquid-phase epitaxy, resulting in increased efficiency for the cell. With thick aluminum layers, the characteristics of the p+ <b>regrown</b> <b>region</b> are in reasonable agreement withpredictions based on the A 1 -Si phase diagram. With thin aluminum layers the junction is nonideal, and the improvement in Voo is much smaller. Pile-up of metallic impurities, at the aluminum/p + interface is attributed to rejection of these impurities during the silicon regrowth process. The formation of back contacts to silicon solar cells by a luminum alloying is well known. Typically, an a luminum layer is fo rmed on the back surface of a p-type silicon wafer, typically by evaporation or sputtering I' 2 or by print-ing of an a luminum paste. 3 -s The contact is subsequently " formed " by an appropriate heat-treatment. Thicker layers of a luminum typically lead to improved cell performance, particularly with respect to open-circuit voltage (Voo) an...|$|E
40|$|The resolidification {{behaviour}} of the microsecond pulsed-laser-melted pool of pure bismuth as {{a function}} of grain size was studied using polarized light microscopy and X-ray diffraction. For single crystals and bicrystals, epitaxial regrowth is the dominant mechanism. For a mixed grain size, regrowth of larger grains dominates the microstructure and can result in the development of texture. Small grain sizes tend to inhibit the epitaxial growth at low-power density level. Formation of microtwins is predominant in the <b>regrown</b> <b>regions</b> when they are surrounded by fine grains...|$|R
