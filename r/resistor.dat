OVERVIEW Linear fixed <b>resistors</b> are classified as film, foil, composition, Power Metal Strip®, and wirewound <b>resistors,</b> depending on the material used. Film <b>resistors</b> can be further subdivided into carbon, metal and thick film <b>resistors.</b> Fig. 1 - Linear fixed <b>resistors</b> technologies Going by sales figures, metal film and thick film <b>resistors</b> are the most widely used types.

50|$|Many topologies {{have been}} used since the {{regulated}} supply was invented. Early technologies included iron-hydrogen <b>resistors,</b> resonant transformers, nonlinear <b>resistors,</b> loading <b>resistors,</b> neon stabiliser tubes, vibrating contact regulators etc.|$|R
5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat {{in a set of}} resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent <b>resistor</b> overheating.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a <b>resistor</b> network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking <b>resistor</b> is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

The {{resistive}} element of thick films is 1000 times thicker than thin films, but the principal difference {{is how the}} film {{is applied to the}} cylinder (axial <b>resistors)</b> or the surface (SMD <b>resistors).</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{successful}} use of embedded <b>resistors</b> in {{many applications}} will {{require that the}} fabricated <b>resistors</b> be trimmed prior to lamination into printed circuit boards to attain required design tolerances. Depending on the application, the economic value of the board being fabricated, and the process used to create the embedded <b>resistors,</b> {{it may also be}} prudent to consider reworking <b>resistors</b> that are incorrectly trimmed or with initial values that are too large (un-trimmable <b>resistors).</b> This paper uses a model of the resistor/board yield coupled with a cost model of the trim and rework processes to identify conditions under which applications should neither trim nor rework, trim but not rework, or perform both trimming and rework of embedded <b>resistors,</b> {{as a function of the}} design tolerance for the <b>resistors</b> and the accuracy with which the embedded <b>resistors</b> can be formed. Example results are presented for several applications ranging from small boards with a high density of embedded <b>resistors</b> to large boards with a low density of embedded <b>resistors.</b> Distinct regions of trimming and rework applicability that are nearly application independent can be identified as a function of design tolerance, printing/plating/etching variation, and the characteristics of the trimming process.

5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (<b>resistor</b> controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|The <b>resistor</b> {{is perhaps}} the {{simplest}} of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive <b>resistor</b> inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, this ballast <b>resistor</b> {{would fail}} and the classic symptom of this failure {{was that the}} engine ran while being cranked (while the <b>resistor</b> was bypassed) but stalled {{immediately}} when cranking ceased (and the <b>resistor</b> was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast <b>resistor</b> as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.|$|E
25|$|Ohm's law {{states that}} the voltage (V) across a <b>resistor</b> is {{proportional}} to the current (I), where the constant of proportionality is the resistance (R).

25|$|Low-resistance {{grounding}} systems use {{a neutral}} grounding <b>resistor</b> (NGR) {{to limit the}} fault current to 25A or greater.

25|$|Resistors {{with higher}} power ratings are {{physically}} larger and may require heat sinks.

Also, unlike thin-film <b>resistors,</b> the resistance value is determined by cutting a helix through the coating rather than by etching. (This is similar to the way carbon <b>resistors</b> are made.) The result is a reasonable tolerance (0.5%, 1%, or 2%) and a temperature coefficient that is generally between 50 and 100 ppm/K. Metal film <b>resistors</b> possess good noise characteristics and low non-linearity due to a low voltage coefficient. Also beneficial are their tight tolerance, low temperature coefficient and long-term stability.|$|R
