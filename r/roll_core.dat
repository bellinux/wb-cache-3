40|$|AbstractA high {{chromium}} (HiCr) iron {{work roll}} broke in three pieces in finishing stand 4 in a compact strip production (CSP) mill of a steel company. This roll breakage was examined {{by means of}} visual inspection, analysis of the mill process data, and chemical and microscopic analysis of a sample from the spheroidal graphite (SG) iron <b>roll</b> <b>core.</b> The roll broke due to inferior quality of the <b>roll</b> <b>core.</b> Due to strong contamination with chromium (1. 5 %), far above the limit for the CSP mill (max. 0. 50 %Cr), the core microstructure contained abundant millimeter-sized (Cr,Fe) -carbide clusters, leading to a poor impact toughness. The quality criteria in the test report were adequate, and depending on the data the mill put the roll in service. Unfortunately, the supplied roll contained incorrect data {{with respect to the}} chromium level (0. 5 %Cr) {{and to a lesser extent}} the Mo levels in the <b>roll</b> <b>core</b> after solidification. If the test certificate had shown the actual core composition, would have been rejected and the roll failure would have been prevented. The paper describes the causes of the roll failure manufactured from high chrome grade steel along with the precautionary measure...|$|E
40|$|This project {{continues}} {{the work of}} Daniel White which culminated in the thesis, "A Hot Strip Mill Work Roll Temperature Model", submitted to Cardiff University in 2007. The current project presents a combined thermal solution, incorporating a transient, two-dimensional model which predicts changes in the circumferentially averaged temperature profile with time, and a static, three-dimensional model which provides high-resolution results near {{the surface of the}} roll and uses the results of the two-dimensional model as boundary conditions. The material properties of both models can now exhibit temperature dependency and boundary conditions at the surface have been improved. The resolution of the static model has been increased dramatically after testing found that the temperature profile was being compromised. The stress models use ABAQUS, a finite element software package, and have been completely redesigned. The stress solution consists of three models, each successive model concentrating more resolution on the roll bite, using the sub-modelling technique. Temperature data is imported from the thermal models, mechanical loads are applied using process data taken from the hot mill database at Port Talbot and residual loads are applied using the best currently available experimental data. Residual and thermal stresses were found to be significant, but the mechanical loads made little difference to the peak or minimum stresses per roll revolution. A brief investigation showed that, for a high-reduction rolling schedule (40 % reduction rates), increasing the work roll oxide layer thickness from 3 μm to 10 μm decreases the cyclic stress range by roughly 100 MPa. Taking account of temperature variability in the material properties also made roughly 100 MPa difference to the stress range. The radial temperature distribution in the roll was shown to have a strong effect on the stresses at the roll surface, with a cold <b>roll</b> <b>core</b> incurring large peak stresses for the same circumferential temperature profile.

In this paper, we explore the control-flow landscape by characterizing mispredictions in four benchmark suites. We find that a third of mispredictions-per- 1 K-instructions (MPKI) come from what we call separable branches: branches with large control-dependent regions (not suitable for if-conversion), whose backward slices do not depend on their control-dependent instructions or have only a short dependence. We propose control-flow decoupling (CFD) to eradicate mispredictions of separable branches. The idea is to separate the loop containing the branch into two loops: the first contains only the branch’s predicate computation and the second contains the branch and its control-dependent instructions. The first loop communicates branch outcomes to the second loop through an architectural queue. Microarchitecturally, the queue resides in the fetch unit to drive timely, non-speculative branching. On a microarchitecture configured similar to Intel’s Sandy Bridge core, CFD increases performance by up to 55 percent, and reduces energy consumption by up to 49 percent (for CFD regions).

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model {{is presented to}} describe possible mechanisms of ice formation on unheated surfaces inside a turbofan engine compression system from fully glaciated ice crystal clouds often formed at high altitude near deep convective weather systems. It is shown from the analysis that generally there could be two distinct types of ice formation: (1) when the "surface freezing fraction" is {{in the range of}} 0 to 1, dominated by the freezing of water melt from fully or partially melted ice crystals, the ice structure is formed from accretion with strong adhesion to the surface, and (2) when the "surface melting fraction" is the range of 0 to 1, dominated by the further melting of ice crystals, the ice structure is formed from accumulation of un-melted ice crystals with relatively weak bonding to the surface. The model captures important qualitative trends of the fundamental ice-crystal icing phenomenon reported earlier (Refs. 1 and 2) from the research collaboration work by NASA and the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada. Further, preliminary analysis of test data from the 2013 full scale turbofan engine ice crystal icing test (Ref. 3) conducted in the NASA Glenn Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) has also suggested that (1) both types of ice formation occurred during the test, and (2) the model has captured some important qualitative trend of turning on (or off) the ice crystal ice formation process in the tested engine low pressure compressor (LPC) targeted area under different icing conditions that ultimately would lead to (or suppress) an engine <b>core</b> <b>roll</b> back (RB) event...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background As {{efforts are}} {{currently}} underway to roll-out insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to populations within malarious areas in Africa, {{there is an}} unprecedented need for data to measure the effectiveness of such programmes in terms of population coverage. This paper examines methodological issues to using household surveys to measure <b>core</b> <b>Roll</b> Back Malaria coverage indicators of ITN possession and use. Methods ITN coverage estimates within Anseba and Gash Barka Provinces from the 2002 Eritrean Demographic and Health Survey, implemented just prior to a large-scale ITN distribution programme, are compared to estimates from the same area from a sub-national Bednet Survey implemented 18 months later in 2003 after the roll-out of the ITN programme. Results Measures of bednet possession were dramatically higher in 2003 compared to 2002. In 2003, 82. 2 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 77. 4 – 87. 0) of households in Anseba and Gash Barka possessed at least one ITN. RBM coverage indicators for ITN use were also dramatically higher in 2003 as compared to 2002, with 76. 1 % (95 % CI 69. 9 – 82. 2) of children under five years old and 52. 4 % (95 % CI 38. 2 – 66. 6) of pregnant women sleeping under ITNs. The ITN distribution programme resulted in a gross increase in ITN use among children and pregnant women of 68. 3 % and 48 % respectively. Conclusion Eritrea has exceeded the Abuja targets of 60 % coverage for ITN household possession and use among children under five years old within two malarious provinces. Results point to several important potential sources of bias that must be considered when interpreting data for ITN coverage over time, including: disparate survey universes and target populations that may include non-malarious areas; poor date recall of bednet procurement and treatment; and differences in timing of surveys with respect to malaria season. </p...|$|R

Many selectin ligands require modification of glycoproteins by leukocyte core 2 � 1, 6 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core 2 GlcNAcT-I). To test {{the role of}} Core 2 GlcNAcT-I for L-selectin ligand biosynthesis, we investigated leukocyte rolling in venules of untreated and TNF-�-treated cremaster muscles and in Peyer’s patch high endothelial venules (HEV) of Core 2 GlcNAcT-I null (core 2 �/ �) mice. In the presence of blocking mAbs against P- and E-selectin, L-selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling was almost completely abolished in cremaster muscle venules of core 2 �/ � mice, but not littermate control mice. By contrast, leukocyte rolling in Peyer’s patch HEV was not significantly different between core 2 �/ � and control mice. To probe L-selectin ligands more directly, we injected L-selectin-coated beads. These beads showed no rolling in cremaster muscle venules of core 2 �/� mice, but significant rolling in controls. In Peyer’s patch HEV, beads coated with a low concentration of L-selectin showed reduced rolling in core 2 �/ � mice. Beads coated with a 10 -fold higher concentration of L-selectin <b>rolled</b> equivalently in <b>core</b> 2 �/ � and control mice. Our data show that endothelial L-selectin ligands relevant for rolling in inflamed microvessels of the cremaster muscle are completely Core 2 GlcNAcT-I dependent.

This knowledge {{is a first step}} to analyze the different events that could happen during these production stages and provides the residual stress fields as well as the final roll microstructure which are interesting data for roll service life. As far as roughing mill work rolls for roughing mills are concerned, current trends in terms of work roll design are forcing the roll producer to go towards higher usable shell thicknesses or increased residual shell thickness after scrap diameter in order to delay potential fatigue phenomena at the shell-core interface. One important parameter could not be evaluated in this study, it concerns the pollutions of the core material by alloying elements of the shell during production, which could affect to some extent the mechanical properties and microstructure of the core. The macroscopic thermo-mechanical-metallurgical Finite Element model used to perform simulations, takes into account coupled effects. Input data parameters are identified by experimental tests such as compression tests at constant strain rate and numerical procedures such as inverse method. After the model presentation, the material data set is commented.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of artificially aging paper <b>rolled</b> onto support <b>cores</b> wrapped with {{isolating}} materials was examined. Oversize paper artifacts often cannot be stored flat due to their size. Therefore, these artifacts may be rolled onto a paper-based support core, which itself is wrapped with a barrier material {{for use as a}} space-saving and long-term archival storage solution. A paper-based support core is made up of a series of paper sheets spiral wound onto one other and bound with an adhesive. Two of the cores chosen for this study were identified as being archival, implying a paper artifact can be rolled directly onto the core for long-term storage without detrimental effect. While both support cores were manufactured with paper that complied with the archival standards outlined by the Library of Congress, one core was bound using sodium silicate while the other was made using a proprietary blend of polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and polyvinyl acetate (PVA). The second two cores were identified as being non-archival. However, they were included in this study as they are occasionally used by conservation professionals. One support core was comprised of kraft paper and an unknown adhesive (supplier not able to identify) while the other consisted of recycled paper and a PVA/acrylic based adhesive. Five isolating layer materials were selected: a polyethylene non-woven film (PE), a multilayered film comprised of polyethylene, aluminum foil, and nylon, a polyethylene terephthalate film (PET), a heavy duty aluminum foil, and a tissue paper containing 3. 5 % calcium carbonate buffer. The effect of no isolating layer was also examined. Whatman no. 1 cotton paper (W 1) was chosen as the model archival paper to be rolled onto each of the 24 support cores.

Tubes were artificially aged at 90 °C and 50 % relative humidity (RH) for up to 24 weeks and sampled at various time points. Changes to the yellowness index (YI) and pH of the W 1 paper were examined to understand how well the isolating layers succeeded as a barrier, preventing transfer of volatile elements from the core to the archival object.
