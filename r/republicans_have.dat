5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the 1850s, Democrats took control of the governorship {{for the duration of the}} Third Party System, with Charles S. Morehead of the Know Nothing Party being the only exception. The election of Republican William O'Connell Bradley in 1895 began the only period of true two-party competition for the governorship; from Bradley's election through 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor of Kentucky. Since 1931, only four <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> served as governor of Kentucky; current governor Matt Bevin, whose term began in 2015, is the most recent.|$|E
5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E

5000|$|Baltimore {{has been}} a Democratic stronghold for over 150 years, with Democrats {{dominating}} every level of government. In virtually all elections, the Democratic primary is the real contest.

5|$|South Dakota {{politics}} are generally {{dominated by the}} Republican Party. Since statehood, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> carried the state's electoral votes in all but five presidential elections: 1896, 1912 (By Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party), 1932, 1936 and 1964. Only Alaska has been carried fewer times by Democrat presidential candidates. Not even George McGovern, the Democratic nominee in 1972 {{as well as a}} native South Dakotan, was able to carry the state. Additionally, a Democrat has not won the governorship since 1974. As of 2016, Republicans hold a 15% voter registration advantage over Democrats and hold large majorities in both the state House of Representatives and Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} obstacle was {{a pivotal}} group of pro-life Democrats led by Bart Stupak who were initially reluctant {{to support the}} bill. The group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition. The Senate bill had not included language that satisfied their concerns, {{but they could not}} address abortion in the reconciliation bill as it would be non-budgetary. Instead, Obama issued Executive Order 13535, reaffirming the principles in the Hyde Amendment. This won the support of Stupak and members of his group and assured the bill's passage. The House passed the Senate bill with a 219–212 vote on March 21, 2010, with 34 Democrats and all 178 Republicans voting against it. The next day, Republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill. Obama signed ACA into law on March 23, 2010. Since passage, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act over sixty times; no such attempt by Republicans has been successful. The amendment bill, The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, cleared the House on March 21; the Senate passed it by reconciliation on March 25, and Obama signed it on March 30.|$|E

25|$|For federal elections, precise {{breakdowns}} {{are unavailable}} for only Manhattan, but {{a majority of}} voters in Riley County have never supported a Democratic candidate for president. <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> carried Riley County every presidential election, except for 1912, when {{a majority of the}} county's voters supported the Progressive candidate Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
25|$|Opposing them, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> the Army of the North, {{led by the}} Colonel Prada, {{with the}} XIV Army Corps led by Francisco Galán (8,000–10,000 men) and the Colonel Linares's XVII Army corps (35,000). The Prada's chief of staff was Francisco Ciutat. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> 180 cannons, one {{squadron}} of Chatos and two flights of Moscas, around 35 aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|As the Democratic nominee, Corzine was {{considered}} to have an inherent advantage in the [...] "blue state" [...] of New Jersey. No <b>Republican</b> <b>has</b> won New Jersey's electoral votes in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Furthermore, prior to the 2009 election, no <b>Republican</b> <b>had</b> won a statewide election in New Jersey since 1997, when Governor Christine Todd Whitman won re-election with 47.1% of the vote. The last Republican to win a statewide election in New Jersey with over 50% of the vote was incumbent Governor Thomas Kean in 1985, who won with 71% of the vote. No <b>Republican</b> <b>has</b> won a U.S. Senate election in New Jersey since liberal Republican Clifford Case in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Opposing them, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> Prada's 14th Army Corps and José García Vayas's 15th Army Corps, {{under the}} overall command of General Mariano Gámir Ulíbarri; {{a total of}} about 80,000 men. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> also 44 {{aircraft}} (mostly slow and old, except 18 Soviet-built fighters). Furthermore, the morale of the Republican troops was low, and Basque soldiers thought that they might surrender to the Italians, in return for their lives.|$|R
25|$|Alaska {{regularly}} supports Republicans {{in presidential}} elections {{and has done}} so since statehood. <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> won the state's electoral college votes {{in all but one}} election that it has participated in (1964). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964, while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. Since 1972, however, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.|$|E

50|$|Bridges was reelected to four {{subsequent}} {{terms in}} 1942, 1948, 1954, and 1960, {{but he did}} not complete his final term due to his death.
