[...] An IGN review said [...] "while there's some really funny moments in this episode, overall I really started to feel that hour running time. Of course, as always, that doesn't make this a bad episode, just not one of their best." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{years into}} their marriage, Charlotte {{gave birth to}} a daughter, Princess Feodora, on 12 May 1879. The new princess was the first {{grandchild}} of the Crown Prince and Princess, as well as the first great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. Charlotte had hated the limitations placed on her while pregnant, and decided this would be her only child, to the dismay of her mother. Following Feodora's birth, Charlotte devoted her time to enjoying society life in Berlin and embarking on long holiday trips. During these trips, Charlotte would often leave her daughter to stay with Vicky, whom she viewed as the source of a convenient nursery. Feodora frequently made long visits to Friedrichshof, her maternal grandmother's estate; on one occasion, Vicky observed that Feodora [...] "is <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> little child, & far easier to manage than her mother".|$|E
500|$|When Lasance {{secured the}} role, he said [...] "Aden causes {{a bit of}} {{mischief}} in the Bay but he's <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guy." [...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking guy with a smile that melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E

500|$|Born in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, Byrom {{started his}} career at the Blackburn Rovers centre of {{excellence}} after being spotted playing for local junior side Oswaldtwistle United {{at the age of}} 14. He progressed through the youth system at Ewood Park, and captained the under–17 side, before graduating into the reserve team after impressing in the FA Youth Cup in 2004. However, he failed to break into the first-team and was subsequently released in 2006. He signed for League Two outfit Accrington Stanley on a six-month contract ahead of the 2006–07 season, after impressing manager John Coleman whilst on trial, a trial which Byrom had requested. He made his debut for the Lancashire side in a 1–1 draw against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy in October 2006. However, Byrom found it difficult to break into the first-team, making one further appearance for Stanley, featuring as a substitute in a 3–3 draw with Shrewsbury Town. He was subsequently released in January 2007, after being deemed surplus to requirements at the Crown Ground. Byrom later stated at this stage in his career he [...] "considered just getting a job and playing for fun", and that his time at Accrington [...] "wasn't <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time for me. I didn't play much".|$|E

[...] In an interview with modern art critic Tyler Green, Wilson further elaborated, [...] "Everyone in Indianapolis has been great to me and respectful and thrilled with what I do, but even people who are against (E Pluribus Unum) seem to still respect me and my work.

2500|$|Brian Foote, Danilova's friend, {{has been}} bought in when she {{realized}} she had too much of ideas to sort them out. [...] "Some of them weren't <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit, as I found out during the process, and by the end I kind of realised that I needed someone to help me along the way. So, it made sense to ask Brian as he's a great friend of mine that also lives in Los Angeles and he has a great studio with lots of resources. He helped oversee the production of the record and made sure that everything was done on time and nothing was missed out during recording and it worked out just perfect", she said. It was easy for her to work with Foote who, understanding that she was a [...] "control freak", tried to [...] "step away a lot". Yet, {{he had a lot of}} [...] "great suggestions about how to change little things to make them more effective", according to Danilova, and also let her use his [...] "amazing synth collection" [...] which helped the songs grow.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but I think it just naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> ska band anyway".|$|E
