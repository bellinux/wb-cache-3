5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly enveloping the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched <b>bulb</b> <b>units,</b> each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each <b>bulb</b> <b>unit</b> has a life of about four years.|$|R

40|$|Single {{olfactory}} <b>bulb</b> <b>units</b> {{were studied}} in two macrosmatic species of rodents under conditions intended {{to preserve the}} cyclical stimulation which normally accompanies nasal breathing. Patterns of unit activity related to the inhalation cycle were observed in all animals, often {{in the absence of}} specific stimuli, and could not be explained in simple mechanical terms. Distinctive changes in these patterns occurred in response to certain odors, and were generally independent of changes in the overall firing frequency. These findings indicate that a change in the overall firing frequency of unit discharges is neither a necessary nor sufficient measure of responsiveness to odors in the rodent olfactory bulb, and that stimulus-specific temporal distributions of unit firing may be involved in olfacto-endocrine activities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{responses}} to odor stimulation of 40 single {{units in the}} olfactory mucosa and of 18 units in the olfactory bulb of the tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) were recorded with indium-filled, Pt-black-tipped microelectrodes. The test battery consisted of 27 odorants which were proved effective by recording from small bundles of olfactory nerve. Two concentrations of each odorant were employed. These values were adjusted for response magnitudes equal to those for amyl acetate at- 2. 5 and- 3. 5 log concentration in olfactory twig recording. Varying concentrations were generated by an injection-type olfactometer. The mucosal responses were exclusively facilitory with a peak frequency of 16 impulses/sec. 19 mucosal units responded {{to at least one}} odorant and each unit was sensitive to a limited number of odorants (1 - 15). The sensitivity pattern of each unit was highly individual, with no clear-cut types, either chemical or qualitative, emerging. Of the 18 olfactory <b>bulb</b> <b>units</b> sampled, all responded to at least one odorant. The maximum frequency observed during a response was 39 impulses/sec. The bulbar neurons can be classified into two types. There are neurons that respond exclusively with facilitation and others that respond with facilitation to some odorants and with inhibition to others. Qualitatively or chemically similar odorants did not generate similar patterns across bulbar units...|$|R

40|$|Modal {{parameter}} identification is a core issue in health monitoring and damage detection for hydraulic structures. For a roof overflow hydropower station with a <b>bulb</b> tubular <b>unit</b> under ambient excitation, a complex unit-powerhouse-dam coupling vibration system increases {{the difficulties of}} modal {{parameter identification}}. In this study, {{in view of the}} difficulties of modal order determination and the noise jamming caused by ambient excitation, along with false mode identification and elimination problems, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was used to decrease noise, the singular entropy increment spectrum was used to determine system order, and multiple criteria were used to eliminate false modes. The eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) and stochastic subspace identification (SSI) method were then used to identify modal parameters. The results show that the relative errors of frequencies in the first four modes were within 10 % for the ERA method, while those of SSI were over 10 % {{in the second and third}} modes. Therefore, the ERA method is more appropriate for identifying the structural modal parameters for this particular powerhouse layout...|$|R

The development of the film required the photographer pull two tabs, the second tab which pulled the positive/negative [...] "sandwich" [...] from the camera, where it developed outside the camera. If the temperature was below 15°C (60°F), the positive/negative [...] "sandwich" [...] was placed between two aluminum plates and placed either in the user's pocket or under their arm to keep it warm while developing. After the required development time (15 seconds to 2 minutes), the positive (with the latent image) was peeled apart from the negative.|$|R
40|$|Sensory {{discrimination}} requires distributed {{arrays of}} processing units. In the olfactory <b>bulb,</b> the processing <b>units</b> for odor discrimination {{are believed to}} involve dendrodendritic synaptic interactions between mitral and granule cells. There is increasing anatomical evidence that these cells are organized in columns, and that the columns processing a given odor are arranged in widely distributed arrays. Experimental evidence is lacking on the underlying learning mechanisms for how these columns and arrays are formed. To gain insight into these mechanisms, {{we have used a}} simplified realistic circuit model to test the hypothesis that distributed connectivity can selforganize through an activity-dependent dendrodendritic synaptic mechanism. The results point to action potentials propagating in the mitral cell lateral dendrites as playing a critical role in this mechanism. The model predicts that columns emerge from the interaction between the local temporal dynamics of the action potentials and the synapses that they activate during dendritic propagation. The results suggest a novel and robust learning mechanism for the development of distributed processing units in a cortical structure...|$|R

Gravel is the most popular form of wetland fill medium, but tire chips provide more porosity, are less dense, and cheaper. Before spray application, wetland effluent must be disinfected (traditionally by chlorine). This study determines the treatment efficiency of SFCWs filled with gravel or tire chip media to treat domestic wastewater and the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light in effluent disinfection. The influent and effluent of six SFCWs filled with tire chip medium and six SFCWs filled with gravel were monitored for six to twelve months. Parameters measured included pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD?), total and volatile suspended solids, NH?, P, and fecal and total coliforms. Differences between medium types in wetland performance were found for the parameters of BOD? and P, in which tire chip wetlands outperformed gravel wetlands. The average percent reduction for BOD? and P in the tire-chip filled wetlands was 86 and 65 %, respectively, compared to 72 and 32 % in the gravel-filled wetlands. The higher reduction in BOD? in the tire chip wetlands {{may be due to the}} prolonged detention time of the wastewater caused by higher pore volume. Soluble P was reduced more efficiently in the tire chip wetlands, most likely because iron in the wires of steel belted tires complexed with P to create an insoluble compound. There was no correlation between temperature and BOD? reduction. Because chlorination generates toxic byproducts, UV disinfection may be a better alternative. Two low pressure (254 nm) and two medium pressure UV bulbs (190 to 400 nm) were used to determine disinfection efficiency. Upon installation, all units disinfected effluent successfully. After two weeks in operation, three of the four units were failing due to decreased light intensity from films that developed on <b>bulbs.</b> One <b>unit</b> consistently disinfected water for one year without maintenance. Ultraviolet disinfection, as utilized, was not suitable for use with SFCWs because of inconsistency in disinfection. Tire chips may be a better fill medium for SFCWs than gravel because of higher porosity, lower cost, and greater reduction of P in effluent...|$|R
