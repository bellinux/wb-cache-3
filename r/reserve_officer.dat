5|$|In {{preparation}} for its buildup in strength, {{the army had}} to train a large cadre of officers. On 10 June 1917 Middleton was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. as the adjutant of a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> training camp. These camps were organized to take civilians {{and turn them into}} officers in ninety days, and as adjutant Middleton was responsible for directing the flow of paperwork for 2,700 officer candidates. By November 1917, his camp graduated its last class of officers, and Middleton requested to join a combat division. His request was granted and on 21 December 1917 he reported to the 4th Division at Camp Greene near Charlotte, North Carolina. Two days later, however, he received new orders to become the commander of a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> training camp in Leon Springs, Texas. Here, he reported as ordered, and stayed until the mission was complete in April 1918. As he was technically on loan from the 4th Division, his request to rejoin that unit was granted, and Middleton was soon on his way to France.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his education, Hipper signed up {{as a volunteer}} <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> (Einjährig-Freiwilliger), a one-year volunteer position in the German military. After basic officer training in 1879, Hipper decided to join the navy. He went to Kiel, where he took the Pressen, courses designed to prepare officers for the naval entrance examination, which he successfully passed. On 12 April 1881, {{at the age of}} 18, Franz Hipper became an officer of the Imperial German Navy. Among the fellow cadets of the 1881 class was Wilhelm Souchon, who went on to command the Mediterranean Division at the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham relinquished his RAF {{commission}} officially on 1 August 1946, {{retaining the}} rank of group captain, but remaining in the re-constituted Auxiliary Air Force with the permanent rank of squadron leader.

5|$|Following the {{advanced}} course, Middleton {{spent the summer}} as the senior instructor at a <b>Reserve</b> <b>Officer</b> Training Camp at Fort Logan, Colorado, then returned to Camp Benning for one more year {{as a member of}} the Infantry Board.

George joined the United States Army and on May 21, 1917, received his commission as second lieutenant in the Cavalry as a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer.</b> A month later, he went on active duty with the Cavalry at Fort Myer, Virginia, and married Anna Virginia Helms on August 10. In October George resigned his reserve commission to become a flying cadet with the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{serving on}} HMS Centaur, Rotheram moved to HMS Barfleur in 1780 and HMS Monarch shortly {{afterwards}} as a lieutenant, serving under Lord Howe. Monarch was heavily {{engaged in the}} West Indian campaign during the latter stages of the war, and Rotheram saw action at the Battle of Martinique in 1780, the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 and the Battle of St Kitts and the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. Following {{the end of the}} war at the start of 1783, Rotheram returned to Britain as a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> on half-pay.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer <b>Reserve</b> <b>officer</b> Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do was}} to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E

5|$|Barr's {{achievements}} as {{a combat}} pilot {{earned him the}} Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. Shortly after taking command of No.3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by Axis forces, and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other Allied fugitives to safety, receiving for his efforts the Military Cross, a rare honour for an RAAF pilot. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with No.2 Operational Training Unit. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the oilseed industry, {{for which he was}} appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1983. He died in 2006, aged 90.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1943, Madgwick {{participated in}} {{government}} educational {{planning for the}} post-war years. He {{played a major role}} in the establishment of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme to provide government assistance to ex-servicemembers to complete or undertake university education. In 1944 Madgwick and colleagues began drafting their vision for post-war adult education and articulated their vision at the Workers Education Association of New South Wales Conference, held 10–11 March 1944 in Sydney. They followed-up the conference with a formal, published paper, which called for heavy Commonwealth government involvement and expenditures on adult education. Their proposed plan, however, was rejected by the Prime Minister's office, which, to Madgwick's disappointment selected a more modest program. Madgwick's active duty service ended in March 1946 and he was transferred to <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> status on 19 April 1946.|$|E
5|$|By April 1944, Göth {{had been}} {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain), having received a double promotion, skipping the rank of SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant). He was also appointed a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> of the Waffen-SS. In early 1944 the status of the Kraków-Płaszów Labour Camp changed to a permanent concentration camp under the direct authority of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (WVHA; SS Economics and Administration Office). Mietek Pemper testified at the trial that it was during the earlier period that Göth committed most of the random and brutal killings for which he became notorious. Concentration camps were more closely monitored by the SS than labour camps, so conditions improved slightly when the designation was changed.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher {{aspired to}} become an astronaut, and joined the Air Force <b>Reserve</b> <b>Officer</b> Training Corps. In 1974, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in {{mechanical}} engineering, graduating with top honors. After graduation, he joined the U.S. Air Force. After flight training in Oklahoma, he was stationed in Alaska where {{he served as a}} F-4E Aircraft commander and NORAD Alert Force commander. During the Cold War, his duties included commanding squadrons to intercept Soviet military aircraft. In 1980, as budget cutbacks were reducing his squadron's flying time, Fletcher turned down a regular commission in the Air Force. He left the Air Force with the rank of captain, having received the Air Force Commendation Medal and the Outstanding Unit Award.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914, {{and as part of}} the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men paid their own fares to England to join up. A number of eligible recruits could not afford to go, so Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a <b>reserve</b> <b>officer</b> was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, {{it was decided}} that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a <b>Reserve</b> <b>officer,</b> Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
