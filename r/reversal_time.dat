It is common to understand the <b>time</b> <b>reversal</b> invariance of a physical theory in causal terms, such that whatever can happen forwards in time (according to the theory) can also happen backwards in time. This has led many to hold that <b>time</b> <b>reversal</b> symmetry is incompatible with the asymmetry of cause and effect. This paper critiques the causal reading of <b>time</b> <b>reversal.</b> First, I argue that the causal reading requires time-reversal-related models {{to be understood as}} representing distinct possible worlds, and on such a reading causal relations are compatible with <b>time</b> <b>reversal</b> symmetry. Second, I argue that the former approach does however raise serious sceptical problems regarding the causal relations of paradigm causal processes, and as a consequence there are overwhelming reasons to prefer a non-causal reading of <b>time</b> <b>reversal</b> whereby <b>time</b> <b>reversal</b> leaves causal relations invariant.

It is demonstrated that at the reversal by the pulse with sinusoidal shape, there exists the optimal duration, which minimizes the mean <b>reversal</b> <b>time</b> (MRT) and the standard deviation (SD, jitter). Both the MRT and the jitter significantly depend on the angle θ between the reversal magnetic field and the anisotropy axis. At the optimal angle the MRT can be decreased by a factor of 7 for damping α= 1 and up to 2 orders of magnitude for α= 0. 01, and the jitter can be decreased from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude in comparison with the uniaxial symmetry case.
