However, {{little research has been}} done on this problem as far as we know. In this paper, we propose a new mean field theory that can treat a general class of a non-equilibrium <b>random</b> <b>system.</b> We apply the present theory to an analysis for an associative memory with oscillatory elements, which is a well-known typical <b>random</b> <b>system</b> with large degrees of freedoms.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of a mechanical system depends on some parameters such as physical and geometrical properties, {{external and internal}} loading, initial and boundary conditions, etc. If all of these parameters are constant, then the system is deterministic and its behavior is described by a single set of differential equations. On the other hand, if {{one or more of}} the these parameters are <b>random,</b> the mechanical <b>system</b> is stochastic and there is a family of differential equations sets (one for each realization of the <b>random</b> <b>system)</b> associated to the same. Therefore, it is necessary to compute statistics of the <b>random</b> <b>system</b> realizations to characterize the {{dynamics of}} the stochastic mechanical system. This work illustrates the analysis of a one-dimensional elastic bar, with random elastic modulus and subjected nonlinear external force. The analysis is done through Monte Carlo method, where a large amount of realizations of the <b>random</b> <b>system</b> is obtained via numerical simulations. Then statistics of these realizations are computed, and these statistics reveal information about the average behavior of the <b>random</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Percolation {{threshold}} is {{a mathematical}} concept related to percolation theory, {{which is the}} formation of long-range connectivity in <b>random</b> <b>systems.</b> Below the threshold a giant connected component does not exist; while above it, there exists a giant component {{of the order of}} system size.

50|$|Such Relational systems, or regimes, {{can be seen}} {{as defined}} by {{reductions}} in degrees of freedom among the elements of the system. This diminution in degrees of freedom in relationships among elements is characterized as correlation. In the commonly observed transitions between phases of matter, or phase transitions, the progression of less ordered, or more random, to more ordered, or less <b>random,</b> <b>systems</b> is recognized as the result of correlational processes (e.g. gas to liquid, liquid to solid). In the reverse of this process, transitions from a more-ordered state to a less ordered state, as from ice to liquid water, are accompanied by the disruption of correlations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Many traders use {{mechanical}} systems to trade. Such trading systems usually are tested on historical data. It shows good {{performance in the}} past. This paper describes the method for evaluating such trading systems based on {{the hypothesis that the}} tested system is trading randomly [1]. Under this null hypothesis we build a <b>random</b> <b>system</b> of the same characteristics as the tested one. The <b>random</b> <b>system</b> presents the same probabilities of taking a long position (betting on the price going up) and taking a short position (betting on the price going down) as tested system. The only distinguishing factor is the performance of the system. Simulations of the <b>random</b> <b>system</b> are run many times to create a performance distribution that is used to verify the null hypothesis.

5000|$|One of the play's main {{thematic}} concepts is chaos theory. Paul Edwards, in {{his essay}} [...] "Science in Hapgood and Arcadia", notes that [...] "chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and <b>random</b> <b>systems</b> where entropy is high. ... It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of classical physics), yet it finds regularities that {{prove to be the}} regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy".|$|E
50|$|The easiest {{methods of}} {{transferring}} surpluses involve {{an element of}} randomness; partially <b>random</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used in the}} Republic of Ireland (except Senate elections) and in Malta, among other places. The Gregory method (also known as Newland-Britain or Senatorial rules) eliminates randomness by allowing for the transfer of fractions of votes. Gregory is in use in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland (Senate elections) and in Australia. Both Gregory and earlier methods have the problem that in some circumstances they do not treat all votes equally. For this reason Meek's method, Warren's method and the Wright system have been invented. While easier methods can usually be counted by hand, except in a very small election Meek and Warren require counting to be conducted by computer. The Wright system is a refinement of the Australian Senate system replacing the process of distribution and segmentation of preferences by a reiterative counting process where the count is reset and restarted on every exclusion. Meek is used in local body elections in New Zealand.|$|E
