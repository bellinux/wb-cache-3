50|$|Bickfordâ€™s fuse {{not only}} {{dramatically}} improved the safety conditions of mines around the world, but {{also contributed to}} the development of dynamite. Alfred Nobel created dynamite in 1867, by moulding nitroglycerine and a mud-like compound found near his laboratories called kieselguhr into individual cylinders. At the end of each cylinder Nobel inserted a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> which could be ignited in one of two ways. First, by inserting a safety fuse into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and igniting the fuse, it will set the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> off and produce enough energy to detonate the dynamite. Second, it is possible to detonate dynamite by inserting a <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> into the end of the cylinder and then by attaching an electrical wire into the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> and producing a current which will travel from the source to the <b>blast</b> <b>cap</b> will also set off the dynamite.|$|R

50|$|In addition, confessions by the convicted {{perpetrators}} {{describe the}} bombs as ammonium nitrate-based explosives. Most {{of the components}} of the bombs such as <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and detonating cords were discovered to have come from the city of Talisay in the southern province of Cebu.

50|$|The exploding-bridgewire {{detonator}} (EBW, {{also known}} as exploding wire detonator) {{is a type of}} detonator used to initiate the detonation reaction in explosive materials, similar to a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> because it is fired using an electric current. EBWs use a different physical mechanism than <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> using more electricity delivered much more rapidly, and explode in a much more precise timing after the electric current is applied, by the process of exploding wire method. This has led to their common use in nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|This mode {{provides}} manual warhead initiation using standard military <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and a priming adapter. The command-detonation capability bypasses the SLAM's fuse and safing and arming (S&A) assembly.|$|R
5000|$|A {{detonator}} {{contains an}} easy-to-ignite primary explosive {{that provides the}} initial activation energy to start the detonation in the main charge. Explosives commonly used in detonators include mercury fulminate, lead azide, lead styphnate and tetryl and DDNP. <b>Blasting</b> <b>caps</b> and some detonators are stored separately and not inserted into the main explosive charge until just before use, keeping the main charge safe. Early <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> also used silver fulminate {{but it has been}} replaced with cheaper and safer primary explosives.Silver azide is still used sometimes,but very rarely due to its high price.|$|R
5000|$|A typical [...] "capacitive discharge" [...] {{blasting}} machine works by charging a capacitor from a battery, then discharging the capacitor through an external circuit, called the firing line, {{to fire the}} <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> While the machine is idle, an [...] "internal shunt" [...] is connected across the output terminals so that any stray voltages induced in the external circuit, for example by nearby radio transmitters, are harmlessly short-circuited without triggering the <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> The machines also typically include an [...] "abort" [...] feature to discharge the internal capacitor without firing the cap.|$|R

PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST) runs at about the same speed per iteration as <b>regular</b> <b>BLAST,</b> but is able to detect weaker sequence similarities that are still biologically relevant 3. Alignment quality is based on alignment sensitivity and alignment precision 4.|$|R
50|$|The mine can be detonated by any {{mechanism}} that activates the <b>blasting</b> <b>cap.</b> There are field-expedient methods of detonating the mine by tripwire, or by a timer, {{but these are}} rarely used.|$|R

40|$|Six {{different}} types of <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> mainly of the type used in coal mines, were evaluated to determine both their 1 lF and DC characteristics.

50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{explosives}} detasheet is very stable. It is detonated with a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> or primercord {{but not by}} small-arms fire, heat, water, pressure, or concussion. Detasheet is relatively expensive compared to other explosives.|$|R
50|$|Fuse type <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> {{are still}} in active use today. They are the safest type to use around certain types of {{electromagnetic}} interference, {{and they have a}} built in time delay as the fuse burns down.|$|R
50|$|On November 10, 1887, {{condemned}} prisoner Louis Lingg {{killed himself}} in his cell with a <b>blasting</b> <b>cap</b> hidden in a cigar. The next day, Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and George Engel were executed by hanging.|$|R
25|$|To {{create the}} {{symmetrical}} implosion required to compress the plutonium to the required density, thirty-two explosive charges were simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with <b>blasting</b> <b>caps,</b> progress towards achieving simultaneity {{to within a}} small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed Johnston to use a large capacitor to deliver a high voltage charge directly to each explosive lens, replacing <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> with exploding-bridgewire detonators. This detonated all thirty-two charges within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was {{critical to the success of}} the implosion-type nuclear weapon. Johnston was awarded US Patent 3,040,660 for the exploding-bridgewire detonator.|$|R
40|$|Shock {{response}} spectra {{data from}} flight certification tests were analyzed to determine envelope variation {{with respect to}} mean values in each axis. An overall variation of + or - 8. 61 dB or 169 percent exists for the data. This large variation {{may be attributed to}} {{one or more of the}} following: (1) Instrumentation problems may exist. (2) Variations in the source charge (<b>blasting</b> <b>caps)</b> such as shape or explosive load may exist. (3) Two <b>blasting</b> <b>caps</b> were used to excite the pyrotechnic plate tester. Delay time between charge firings may have varied. The cause or causes of the variations need to be identified and researched to prevent future pyroshock problems...|$|R
