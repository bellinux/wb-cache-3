This is because improvements in aggregate energy proportionality {{can be accomplished}} largely with software reorganization, requiring minimal changes to the underlying hardware. However, this relies {{on the assumption that}} a workload can scale up and down across multiple nodes dynamically based on aggregate demand. Many workloads cannot achieve this easily due to the way data may be distributed across individual nodes, or the need for data sharing and communication among many nodes even to serve a single <b>request.</b> <b>Note</b> that aggregate energy proportionality can be achieved with this scheme even if individual nodes are not energy proportional ...|$|E

This step is completed before the system is used as part of the user registration with Steve.

We use αr = 0.25 for our results but it can be replaced with any other number depending on the ratio of importance you want to give the existing allocated network function. Using the above cost heuristic, the cost of the shortest path (the one with the lowest latency) is found (line 8). Then for all candidate paths in allPaths, we calculate that cost and if it is less than the cost of the currently known lowest cost path, then it is used to replace the shortest path (lines 9 - 15). Finally, we return the path with the lowest cost (line 16).|$|E
