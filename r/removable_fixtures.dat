40|$|International audienceUp-scaling tracer {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in a pilot-scale rotary kiln twice {{as big as the}} kiln used in the first two Parts of this study. Internal fixtures such as grid, or lifter structure arranged in 3 and 6 rows of single throughout lifters were used. The effects of these <b>removable</b> <b>fixtures</b> and other usual operating conditions, namely, mass flow rate of granular biomass materials, rotational speed and slope of the kiln on the residence time distribution (RTD), the mean and variance of residence time (MRT and VRT), the hold-up (HU), the Peclet number (Pe) and corresponding axial dispersion coefficient (D), were investigated. Scaling-up rules were derived for the MRT, HU volume fraction and D from the results of a comprehensive experimental work. Good agreement was found between the experimental data and the calculated values. The wide size distribution of the beech chips {{used in the present study}} allows analysis of particle segregation, which may further increase understanding of the flow characteristics of granular materials, notably within flighted rotary kilns. The results show that while significantly increasing the dispersion, ipso facto, enhancing the mixing, the lifters limit the extent of particle segregation...|$|E

50|$|The flutes (or valve meters) of the {{dishwasher}} are prevalent in American models (with some appearing in European and Asian models influenced by US design) {{due to the}} higher pressure of the American water system (which averages at 90 torrs/min, {{as opposed to the}} 65 torrs/min pressure in other countries). The flutes help drain the excess water, preventing entropy within the system due to higher pressures at a lower volume. This is a <b>removable</b> <b>fixture,</b> as some areas require a higher or lower discharge based on their water system.|$|R
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2006 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is {{involved}} in research and design of highefficiency hybrid vehicles based on hydraulic systems. Building and testing hydraulic piston pumps form part of this study. Nine pistons in a two-inch circle are spherically-jointed to connecting rods and surround a central constant velocity (CV) joint. The pistons and CV joint must be assembled simultaneously into a mating barrel inside the pump housing; the multiple joints {{make it difficult to}} align all parts at once. This project is to design a <b>removable</b> <b>fixture</b> to position the pistons and line up the CV joint for proper assembly within tight quarters...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of implant dentistry, the {{teaching}} and indications for removable prosthodontics is becoming a lost art, especially in affluent urban environments, where most replacements are accomplished {{by the use of}} implant <b>fixtures.</b> <b>Removable</b> prosthodontics is still being taught and is used in rural areas and in the elderly patients or medically compromised individual. Therefore it challenges the restorative dentist to be able to fabricate optimum functioning removable complete and partial dentures. Dental schools especially in affluent urban areas, are currently stressing the use of endosseous implants to replace single teeth, partially edentulous situations, and completely edentulous dental arches. Consequently, {{there appears to be a}} lack of teaching of removable prosthodontics. There are dental laboratories usually in urban areas that mostly fabricate implant prosthesis with and without the use of CAD/CAM [1]. Furthermore, there are laboratories that still create fixed and removable partial and complet...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} technology with implants based {{has now been}} developed in recent years. Implant with the bridge superstructure method is employed after variety of considerations where {{it is expected to}} meet its function, aesthetics, and comfortability. The alveolar bone existed is one reason for the process of adding bone (bonegraft). This case report proposes to determine the successful insertion of a superstructure anterior implant bridge post autograft. Two female patients were asked to use dental implant anterior with bridge system. The first case, the autograft application is made for a 20 -year-old woman with edentulous teeth 11, 21, 22. One year later it was then inserted in the area of dental implant fixture 11 and 22. After 9 months, the healing abutments and the superstructure were inserted too. 2 weeks after, the abutments of bridge and crowns of teeth 11, 21 and 22 with a pontic in the teeth 21 had been inserted. The second case, a 46 -year-old woman with edentulous 11, 12, 21, 22. They want to change the denture because they did not feel comfortable with the <b>removable</b> denture acrylic. <b>Fixture</b> placement was done a year after autograft. Insertion of healing abutments and the superstructure printing can be done after 6 months. A month later implant abutments and crowns could be inserted. Labial fullness is corrected; an implant-retained in the region of 12 and 21, 12, and 22 used the pontic. Prosthodontic rehabilitation with a fixed denture using the implant bridge after autograft anterior maxilla is an alternative fixed denture placement with satisfactory results, aesthetic correction and comfortably...|$|R
