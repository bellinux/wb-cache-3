40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of {{information}} and communication technology, the educationenvironment has being enriched and become more diversified. Hence computer based assessment came as a prevalent method of administering the tests. Randomization of test items here may produce unfair effect on test takers which is unproductive in the outcome of the test. There is a need to develop the Intelligent Tutoring System that assigns <b>intelligent</b> <b>question</b> depending on the student’s response in the testing session. It will be more productive when the questions are assigned based on the learner ability in the early stage itself. So, this study focus on building up a framework to automatically assign <b>intelligent</b> <b>question</b> based on the learner ability not only all through the session, but also on entry. At end, automatic up gradation of the question levels can be done dynamically. The questions are classified based on item difficulty using Item Response Theory model. The learners are classified based on their level by Decision Tree using ID 3 algorithm. Thereby the objective of Intelligent Tutoring System is achieved by using adaptability and intelligence in testin...|$|R

The importance {{of the role of the}} individual leader is acknowledged, but it argues that this role is not to provide the answers but to ask <b>intelligent</b> <b>questions</b> in tackling wicked issues that undermine well being. The book explores the experience of reform across the sector and sets some tough challenges for government, public institutions and their leaders.

6000|$|As regards {{physical}} conditions, {{the only}} one that is considered by Mr. Mahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good conversationalist, is the possession of a musical voice. Some learned writers have been of opinion that a slight stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation, but Mr. Mahaffy rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity from a native brogue to an artificial catchword. With his remarks on the latter point, the meaningless repetition of phrases, we entirely agree. Nothing can be more irritating than the scientific person who is always saying ‘Exactly so,’ or the commonplace person who ends every sentence with ‘Don’t you know?’ or the pseudo-artistic person who murmurs ‘Charming, charming,’ on the smallest-provocation. It is, however, with the mental and moral qualifications for conversation that Mr. Mahaffy specially deals. Knowledge he, naturally, regards as an absolute essential, for, as he most justly observes, ‘an ignorant man is seldom agreeable, except as a butt.’ Upon the other hand, strict accuracy should be avoided. ‘Even a consummate liar,’ says Mr. Mahaffy, is a better ingredient in a company than ‘the scrupulously truthful man, who weighs every statement, questions every fact, and corrects every inaccuracy.’ The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company. Mr. Mahaffy, however, makes an exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells us that <b>intelligent</b> <b>questions</b> addressed to an astronomer, or a pure mathematician, will elicit many curious facts which will pleasantly beguile the time. Here, in the interest of Society, we feel bound to enter a formal protest. Nobody, even in the provinces, should ever be allowed to ask an <b>intelligent</b> <b>question</b> about pure mathematics across a dinner-table. A question of this kind is quite as bad as inquiring suddenly about the state of a man’s soul, a sort of coup which, as Mr. Mahaffy remarks elsewhere, ‘many pious people have actually thought a decent introduction to a conversation.’ ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{importance}} of emotions and feelings is crucial to effective teaching and learning. Why {{do we have to}} do this? The question may irritate the teacher, but {{it is one of the}} most <b>intelligent</b> <b>questions</b> that a student can ask. Students—and the rest of us, for that matter—are loathe to expend cognitive energy unnecessarily, so assessing {{the importance}} of a task is a key initial step in cognition. But how do we know what is important? Our brain's ability to unconsciously or consciously identify and assess the relevance and meaning of what we confront is just a small part of a very complex cognitive system. Recent developments in our understanding of the neurobiology of consciousness (Damasio, 1999; Edelman & Tononi, 2000) are providing educators with new understandings of how we recognize dangers and opportunities, and these insights pose important challenges to educators. Unconscious Emotions Because our immediate environment is rich in dangers and opportunities that range widely in importance, our brain needs something akin to a thermostat to determine when a specifi...|$|R

The technology and application of factory raising seedlings were introduced in this paper. Three kinds of raising seedlings modes, which have been put in use in China, are small <b>raising</b> seedlings greenhouse, <b>intelligent</b> <b>raising</b> seedlings greenhouse and factory raising seedlings respectively. The disadvantages are that, they belong to tray raising seedlings mode which needs large fields and trays, and the labor intensity is too hard. In order to reduce the area and raise the level of raising seedlings mechanization, a kind of rice factory three-dimensional raising seedlings system was presented, which is consisted of greenhouse, seedlings frame, carpet seeder and so on. A new carpet raising seedlings was also put forward and can produce long seedlings carpet that is twice as wide as seedlings tray at least. And a carpet seeder designed can flat the nutritional tape into seedlings frame and put seeds and topsoil on the tape.
