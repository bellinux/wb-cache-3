After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her <b>rigging</b> had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the <b>rigging,</b> all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.|$|E

Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras <b>rigging,</b> but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the <b>rigging.</b> They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} number of broadside ironclads {{was built in the}} 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the <b>rigging</b> did not impede the field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Achilles was recommissioned in 1901 as a depot ship at Malta under a {{succession}} of different names.

5000|$|Gaff <b>rig</b> {{remains the}} most popular fore-aft <b>rig</b> for {{schooner}} and barquentine mainsails and other course sails, and spanker sails on a square <b>rigged</b> vessel are always gaff <b>rigged.</b> On other <b>rigs,</b> particularly the sloop, ketch and yawl, gaff <b>rigged</b> sails were once common but have now been largely replaced by the Bermuda <b>rig</b> sail, which, {{in addition to being}} simpler than the gaff <b>rig,</b> usually allows vessels to sail closer to the direction from which the wind is blowing (i.e. [...] "closer to the wind").|$|R
50|$|Diamond <b>rigs</b> {{can also}} {{be part of a}} multi-combination <b>rig.</b> Multi-combination <b>rigs</b> are a dual setup <b>rig</b> capable of {{operating}} in either a reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling role (though not at the same time). This is a common scenario where exploration drilling is being performed in a very isolated location. The <b>rig</b> is first set up to drill as an RC <b>rig</b> and once the desired metres are drilled, the <b>rig</b> is set up for diamond drilling. This way the deeper metres of the hole can be drilled without moving the <b>rig</b> and waiting for a diamond <b>rig</b> to set up on the pad.|$|R

5|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the surrender of}} Marengo, Captain Bruilhac surrendered Belle Poule, the damage inflicted by Amazon {{and the presence of}} Warren's squadron persuading him that further resistance was hopeless. French losses in the engagement were severe, Marengo suffering extensive damage to her hull and <b>rigging</b> and losing 63 men killed and 83 wounded from a crew of 740. The latter included both Linois and his son with serious wounds and Captain Vrignaud, who had to have his right arm amputated. Losses on Belle Poule included six killed and 24 wounded from her complement of 330. British losses were comparatively light, London suffering ten dead and 22 wounded and Amazon four killed and five wounded. London was the only British ship damaged, mainly in her <b>rigging,</b> which was hastily repaired {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the <b>rigging</b> survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's <b>rigging</b> during boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|At 10:00, Soleil {{accepted}} that his remaining ships would rapidly be overhauled by Monarch and drew them together, forming a compact group {{with which to}} receive the British attack. He also ordered his captains to focus their fire on the enemy sails, <b>rigging</b> and masts, hoping to inflict enough damage to delay the pursuit and allow his force to escape. Within minutes Monarch was heavily engaged with Armide and Minerve but Captain Lee found himself at a disadvantage: the heavy swell that had suited his ship during the chase also prevented him from opening his lower gunports in case of flooding. This halved his available cannon {{and as a result}} his isolated ship began to suffer severe damage to its <b>rigging</b> and sails from the frigates' gunnery. Within 20 minutes, Monarch was unable to manoeuvree, but Lee continued fighting until Centaur could reach the melee, the flagship opening fire at 11:00. Hood passed the battling Monarch and Minerve, concentrating his fire on Armide and the flagship Gloire. For another 45 minutes the battle continued, Centaur suffering damage to her <b>rigging</b> and sails from the French shot and taking casualties from musket fire from the soldiers carried aboard. Among the wounded was Commodore Hood, who was shot in the right forearm, the ball eventually lodging in his shoulder. Hood retired below and command passed to his second in command, Lieutenant Case.|$|E

5|$|At 17:00, {{the leading}} French ship of the line, Magnanime, came within range with her bow chasers. Calcutta {{continued}} sailing southwards, remaining {{ahead of the}} squadron but not at a sufficient distance to avoid Magnanimes fire. Realising that unless he took drastic measures his ship would be caught, Woodriff turned Calcutta back towards Magnanime, hoping to disable her before the next ship in line, the frigate Thétis, could join the battle. Captain Pierre-François Violette on Magnanime prepared to meet Calcutta and the engagement rapidly became furious, Calcutta and Magnanime exchanging full broadsides at close range. Within 45 minutes, {{it was clear that}} Woodriff's gamble had failed. The larger and more powerful Magnanime inflicted severe damage to the British ship's <b>rigging,</b> rendering her unable to manoeuvre or escape, with the remainder of the French squadron bearing down. With defeat inevitable, Woodriff spared the lives of his men by striking his colours and surrendering to Violette. Although Calcutta was badly damaged among her <b>rigging</b> and sails, her hull had suffered little from the engagement and she had only lost six killed and six wounded. French casualties were negligible, although Armide was forced to undergo extensive temporary repairs on her own sails and <b>rigging</b> before she was able to operate as a scout once more. Brothers had also been captured: the corvette Sylphe had separated during the chase and rapidly overhauled the lumbering merchant ship, which had surrendered without a fight.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations <b>rigging.</b> The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a half}} hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the <b>rigging,</b> at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides.

Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes <b>rigging</b> were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E
