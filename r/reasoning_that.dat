40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate student understanding in signals and systems, particularly the study of continuous-time linear, time-invariant systems. In this paper, we report on a principal finding of this investigation, namely, the importance of the interval matching reasoning resource in accounting for the faulty <b>reasonings</b> <b>that</b> students invoke in reasoning about central topics in signals and systems. The qualitative method of clinical interviewing was employed for probing into student understanding. Fifty-one undergraduate students majoring in aerospace engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology volunteered to participate in this study. Data was analyzed with the aim of identifying the faulty <b>reasonings</b> <b>that</b> participants invoked in their response to different signals and systems problems, and the cognitive structures of <b>reasoning</b> resources <b>that</b> describe and explain the origin of these faulty <b>reasonings.</b> Results indicate <b>that</b> there is a consistency across student faulty reasonings related to three different signals and systems topics — superposition, convolution, and the Laplace transform. This consistency is ascribed to the systematicity in student invocation of the reasoning resource of the interval matching readout strategy...|$|R

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan, {{and male}} Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects this, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed the date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E

Carnage discovers a method of transporting his symbiote through phone lines, which he uses to hack computers and attack people playing the game. He escapes from the Ravencroft asylum and kidnaps his caregiver, Dr. Pazzo. Venom confronts Carnage in cyberspace, before Pazzo douses Carnage in flammable liquid and sets him ablaze. Venom saves Carnage from dying, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> death is what he wants. A subplot has Brock meeting Kirstin, a young musician. When Brock accidentally paralyzes her boyfriend Clive, Kirstin asks her mother to avenge him; this storyline continues in Venom: Sinner Takes All.|$|E
5|$|Jones is {{approached}} by greaser Mutt Williams, who {{tells him that}} Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a mental breakdown and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles {{on the walls and}} floor of his cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> Oxley had returned it there.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E

In 1979 he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams. After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with McLaren for 1980. He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the 1979 season at Watkins Glen — <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> the token effort would benefit neither him nor the team.|$|E
5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> {{working as a}} {{management}} consultant {{for a variety of}} companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than forty years.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had reached}} a stalemate and Murad contemplated his next move. He was advised to pillage the countryside, but the surrounding fields had already been burned by Skanderbeg. The sultan decided to stop chasing bodies of men into the forests to prevent further casualties. Mehmed, Murad's son, proposed leaving Svetigrad to strike at Krujë. Murad sternly rejected this, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> the supplies to take Svetigrad would have been wasted and that Krujë would be more strongly defended than Svetigrad. The sultan thus decided to remain at Svetigrad {{in an attempt to}} starve the garrison into submission. Meanwhile, the garrison under the leadership of Peter Perlati made several successful sorties against the Ottomans, in order to ease the encirclement and strengthen his soldiers' morale.|$|E
5|$|Bolívar {{took control}} of Caracas with his victory {{at the battle of}} Carabobo, and the Congress of Cúcuta issued laws similar to those in Perú. Guayaquil {{declared}} independence, and Bolivar sent Antonio José de Sucre to reinforce them. Sucre's forces were not enough, and requested help from San Martín. Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bolívar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia. San Martín and Bolívar sought to generate Latin American integration, but disagreed on the type of government: Bolívar proposed a republic, and San Martín a constitutional monarchy, <b>reasoning</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be easier to}} receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations.
