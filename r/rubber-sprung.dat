25|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Ka-2 comprises a large <b>rubber-sprung</b> wooden skid {{under the}} forward fuselage {{in front of}} a non-retractable semi recessed mainwheel, as well as a steel <b>rubber-sprung</b> tail-skid. Conventional controls are fitted with ailerons on each wingtip trailing edge, elevator with anti-balance trim tab behind the tailplane and rudder aft of the fin. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, at 38% chord and approx ⅓ span, open out above and below the wing to provide approach control.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a <b>rubber-sprung</b> tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Their empennages were conventional, with plywood covered {{horizontal}} tails {{on top of}} the fuselages. [...] The fins {{were small}} and [...] semi-circular and the fabric covered rudders had scalloped, rounded edges. They had fixed, tailskid undercarriages with mainwheels on a single axle <b>rubber-sprung</b> from a transverse member mounted on V-struts. The forward member of the V joined the forward fuselage just behind the metal cowling and the rear one went to the lower wing forward attachment points.|$|E
25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special <b>rubber-spring</b> shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|R
2500|$|The seating {{is under}} {{the leading edge of}} the wing with a cabin roof window in the wing center section. [...] Access is through side transparencies. [...] Engine options include several Rotax or Jabiru units in the 37-89kW (50-120hp) range, driving two- or three-blade {{propellers}} and enclosed in a composite cowling. Both undercarriage versions have the main wheels on faired-in V-form struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, with <b>rubber-sprung</b> half axles fixed to a compression frame. The conventional tailwheel is steerable but the alternative nose wheel [...] castors freely, though a steerable version is planned.|$|E
2500|$|The two beams {{were covered}} in smooth Alferium; behind the wing they were inverted, convex teardop-shaped in section and tapered to the tail. [...] At the front, each had a [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db {{water-cooled}} 12-cylinder upright V-12 engine driving a two-blade propeller. The radiators were placed {{on both sides of}} the cowlings, and the fuel tanks were in the booms behind the engines, seen as a relatively safe place in case of attack. Each main wheel of the wide track, tailskid undercarriage was <b>rubber-sprung</b> on a V strut enclosed by a bulged and tapered continuous extension of the boom underside. At the rear the booms were linked by a rectangular tailplane carrying a single elevator. [...] The booms mounted small fins with deep, balanced rudders.|$|E
50|$|The Grasmücke had conventional, fixed {{landing gear}} with a 1.40 m track. Its mainwheels {{were on a}} single axle, <b>rubber-sprung</b> to a frame of steel V-struts, one mounted {{transversely}} from the lower fuselage frame to the axle centre and one on each side, mounted longitudinally, to its ends. There was an internally <b>rubber-sprung</b> tailskid.|$|E
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Ka-2 comprises a large <b>rubber-sprung</b> wooden skid {{under the}} forward fuselage {{in front of}} a non-retractable semi recessed mainwheel, as well as a steel <b>rubber-sprung</b> tail-skid. Conventional controls are fitted with ailerons on each wingtip trailing edge, elevator with anti-balance trim tab behind the tailplane and rudder aft of the fin. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, at 38% chord and approx ⅓ span, open out above and below the wing to provide approach control.|$|E
50|$|The {{undercarriage}} was a fixed single monowheel, {{without a}} brake but assisted by a <b>rubber-sprung</b> nose skid {{which had a}} steel underside that could be replaced if damaged. There was also a small tail skid which was sprung with tennis balls.|$|E
50|$|One {{feature of}} this vehicle were the <b>rubber-sprung</b> wheelsets, with rubber {{elements}} being inserted between the tyre and the wheel body. So this design feature, which was used on the Intercity-Express, is not actually a modern discovery. However, {{as a result of}} the short wheelbase of only 3.5 m to 4 m the vehicle tended to hunt slightly.|$|E
5000|$|The Potez 24 had a fixed, {{tailskid}} undercarriage with a 2.0 m track. Its single axle, {{enclosed in}} a fairing, was joined {{to the lower}} fuselage longerons by near-vertical, telescopic shock absorbing legs and faired, rearward drag struts. Instead of the usual cross-wires the structure had a single diagonal cross-bracing tube. [...] The tailskid was <b>rubber-sprung.</b>|$|E
50|$|Of {{very similar}} {{construction}} to the Grunau Baby, the Wolf had strut-braced high-set monoplane wings supported on a pylon aft of the cockpit. The hexagonal-section fuselage was constructed largely of wood with plywood skinning and {{the wings and}} tail surfaces were plywood-skinned {{back to the main}} spars with wooden-framed fabric-covered rear portions. The undercarriage consisted of <b>rubber-sprung</b> skids under the nose and tail with a fixed mainwheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity.|$|E
50|$|Their empennages were conventional, with plywood covered {{horizontal}} tails {{on top of}} the fuselages. The fins {{were small}} and semi-circular and the fabric covered rudders had scalloped, rounded edges. They had fixed, tailskid undercarriages with mainwheels on a single axle <b>rubber-sprung</b> from a transverse member mounted on V-struts. The forward member of the V joined the forward fuselage just behind the metal cowling and the rear one went to the lower wing forward attachment points.|$|E
50|$|The Type 74 {{incorporated}} some of {{the innovations}} Horace Short had introduced to the Short Admiralty Type 42, including manganese-steel tube struts instead of wood. In addition to the two main <b>rubber-sprung</b> floats below the fuselage and the single tail float, it also had smaller floats attached below the lower wingtips. Ailerons were mounted on the upper wing only, the latter extending beyond the span of the lower wing. The extensions were braced by diagonal struts to the lower wingtips.|$|E
5000|$|Meantime TH {{offered a}} 4w {{version of the}} Steelman loco on foreign and {{domestic}} enquiries - eventually winning an order for 9 for the MoD in 1986-7. HM the Queen named one of these at MoD Bicester (she had also named an earlier chain-drive Vanguard). Offering a rubber-suspension loco as a [...] "tripper" [...] however was not acceptable to overseas railway authorities, so a coil-spring version was proposed, to be designated a [...] "Steelman Rapide", leaving the <b>rubber-sprung</b> original as the [...] "Steelman Royale".|$|E
50|$|The seating {{is under}} {{the leading edge of}} the wing with a cabin roof window in the wing center section. Access is through side transparencies. Engine options include several Rotax or Jabiru units in the 37-89 kW (50-120 hp) range, driving two- or three-blade {{propellers}} and enclosed in a composite cowling. Both undercarriage versions have the main wheels on faired-in V-form struts mounted on the lower fuselage longerons, with <b>rubber-sprung</b> half axles fixed to a compression frame. The conventional tailwheel is steerable but the alternative nose wheel castors freely, though a steerable version is planned.|$|E
50|$|The WA-30 Bijave is two-seat {{development}} of the Wassmer WA-21 Javelot II and the first Bijave flew on 17 December 1958 from Issoire Aerodrome. The Bijave is a cantilever shoulder-wing monoplane with a welded steel tube fuselage covered with fabric and reinforced plastic. The wing is made from wood, covered in birch forward of the spar and fabric to the rear, it has no flaps but is fitted with retractable perforated wooden airbrakes. The pilot and passenger sit in tandem in an enclosed cockpit with individual transparent canopies. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel, a wooden <b>rubber-sprung</b> skid under the nose and a steel tailskid.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{fuselage}} {{is similar}} to that of the Aviamilano CPV1 with a wooden structure and ovoid cross-section. As before, the rear part is plywood skinned, but the forward part is covered with glass fibre. [...] A long, single, semi-reclining seat cockpit with a single piece canopy following the fuselage contours is placed ahead of the leading edge. Under it a <b>rubber-sprung</b> landing skid reaches aft to a retractable single wheel under the forward wing. The fuselage tapers rearwards to a T-tail quite different from the CPV1's conventional empennage, with a swept, straight tapered fin and rudder carrying a cantilever, tapered, one-piece all-moving horizontal tail fitted with a central anti-balance tab.|$|E
5000|$|The Crested Wren's {{fuselage}} was a plywood-skinned hexagonal structure, its vertical faces {{longer than}} the others. It curved to a point at the nose, where the flying wires and tow rope were attached, and tapered gently towards the tail. The open, unscreened cockpit was under the wing leading edge immediately forward of the pylon. A <b>rubber-sprung</b> ash landing skid with a steel sole ran from the nose to below the trailing edge. [...] There were no fixed tail surfaces: separate rounded elevators were mounted on a little pedestal and a roughly D-shaped rudder moved between them. The elevator control wires emerged from the fuselage midway between the wing and the tail.|$|E
5000|$|The Racing Biplane, {{also known}} as The Racer or Biplane No. 33 from its Bristol {{sequence}} number, was powered by a [...] Gnome engine driving a four-bladed tractor propeller. It had unequal span wings each with a single steel-tube spar. The rectangular fuselage was a composite structure of wood and steel tubes covered in fabric. It had a twin-skid steel-tube chassis fitted with two wheels on a <b>rubber-sprung</b> cross axle and also had a tail skid, the main skids were long enough to act as brakes on landing. The aircraft was displayed at Olympia in 1911 and was then taken to Larkhill in April 1911 where it was wrecked when it overturned attempting its first flight.|$|E
50|$|The VSO 10 is a mixed-construction glider {{with wooden}} and steel tube {{structural}} members, aluminium alloy rear fuselage and glass-fibre sandwich skins. The wings are shoulder-mounted and the tailplane {{is mounted on}} top of the integral fin. Conventional control surfaces include all-wooden slotted ailerons, all-metal DFS airbrakes on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing and fabric-covered all-metal elevators and rudder. The undercarriage in the Standard Class aircraft is a manually retractable <b>rubber-sprung</b> monowheel with a drum brake, (non-retractable in the Club-Class aircraft), with a rubber-mounted steel skid under the tail. The pilot is accommodated in a fully reclined seat under a removable canopy rear segment and fixed forward segment. Provision is made for 56 L water ballast, for use in strong lift conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The two beams {{were covered}} in smooth Alferium; behind the wing they were inverted, convex teardop-shaped in section and tapered to the tail. [...] At the front, each had a [...] Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db {{water-cooled}} 12-cylinder upright V-12 engine driving a two-blade propeller. The radiators were placed {{on both sides of}} the cowlings, and the fuel tanks were in the booms behind the engines, seen as a relatively safe place in case of attack. Each main wheel of the wide track, tailskid undercarriage was <b>rubber-sprung</b> on a V strut enclosed by a bulged and tapered continuous extension of the boom underside. At the rear the booms were linked by a rectangular tailplane carrying a single elevator. The booms mounted small fins with deep, balanced rudders.|$|E
50|$|The empennage, {{like the}} fuselage, was steel framed and fabric covered. Both fin and tailplane, the latter mounted at mid-fuselage height, had straight, swept leading edges and carried {{balanced}} control surfaces with straight, unswept rear edges and round tips. The rudder was deep, extending to the keel, and worked within an elevator cut-out. The Challenger had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Its mainwheels were on faired, cranked axles hinged {{from the central}} fuselage underside, braced by drag struts hinged further aft; these members were enclosed in balsa and fabric airfoil fairings. Short, vertical oleo legs were attached {{to the bottom of}} the outer engine mountings. The wheels had independent Bendix brakes and were almost entirely enclosed in large dural tube, fabric covered fairings. A small tailwheel was mounted on a <b>rubber-sprung</b> pylon.|$|E
50|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood stressed-skin tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a <b>rubber-sprung</b> tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The Sauro was {{powered by}} a 97 kW (130 hp) Farina T-58 radial engine within a domed cowling that left its five {{cylinders}} individually exposed. Behind the engine the fuselage was ovoidal in cross-section and tapered only slowly to the tail. It had a chrome steel frame, covered with plywood and fabric. The two tandem cockpits, the forward one over the wing and the other just behind its trailing edge, had long headrest deckings behind them that extended to the tail. The cockpits were equipped with dual controls; those of the forward position could be disconnected in flight. Both seats had room for a parachute. The tail surfaces were conventional, steel-framed {{and covered with a}} mixture of aluminium and fabric, with the tapered tailplane set at mid-fuselage with an angular fin and rudder above. The rudder ended above the fuselage, angled to allow for elevator movement. A steel shod, <b>rubber-sprung</b> tailskid was mounted {{at the end of the}} fuselage.|$|E
5000|$|Like the BS.7, the BS.8 had a {{fuselage}} {{based on}} a slender, triangular-cross-section, plywood-covered beam, sloping upwards aft from below the leading edge to place the strut braced triangular tailplane {{at the same height}} as the wing, on top of a trapezoidal fin. The fin carried a deep, unbalanced rudder, rectangular except at the bottom where it was cropped to match the keel line of the boom. It worked in a notch between the two otherwise rectangular elevators, also unbalanced. The beam now extended to the nose, with a <b>rubber-sprung</b> landing skid attached below it, starting near the nose and reaching back almost to the wing trailing edge. The BS.8 had a conventional, fabric-covered upper fuselage or nacelle on top of the beam from its nose to well behind the trailing edge. [...] The pilot's position was, as before, under the leading edge, but he was now in a [...] "comfortable" [...] cockpit with an [...] "ovoid" [...] seat.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the IS-10 was an oval section, slender plywood monocoque. The pilot {{sat in a}} semi-reclining {{position in}} a long, single-seat cockpit under a single-piece, side-opening perspex canopy which, with a short fixed transparency behind it. stretched from the nose into {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Its undercarriage comprised a short, <b>rubber-sprung</b> skid from the nose to only about halfway to the wing. A fixed, unsprung monowheel was semi-recessed into the fuselage under the wing and fitted with a brake. Further aft the fuselage tapered to a conventional empennage. A narrow, ply-covered fin and a fabric-covered rudder, which extended down to the keel, together formed a straight-tapered, flat-topped vertical tail. The fin also mounted a straight-edged, fabric-over-ply-covered tailplane placed just above the fuselage, which carried straight-tapered, similarly skinned elevators. These were balanced by a bob weight within the fuselage and had gaps both at their roots to clear the fin and at their tips to clear rearward tailplane extensions, with a small central cut out for rudder movement. A small tail bumper was fitted under the rudder hinge.|$|E
50|$|The fixed bogies {{which are}} used by most 100% low floor trams {{increase}} track wear and decrease {{the speed at which}} a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4 - 15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and pivoting bogies at the tram's ends. For a time it was said to be the only true 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies in production. However, the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with pivoting bogies (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a fixed centre bogie) in Istanbul, and for Helsinki, a tram with similar interior solution and all pivoting bogies is undergoing trials as of 2015. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of 350 mm above rail; the height over the bogies is 450 mm above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is 700 mm wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be idle ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of <b>rubber-sprung</b> wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner bogies) sprung swing bolsters. The secondary springing of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.|$|E
40|$|For {{the life}} and fatigue {{strength}} evaluation of rail vehicle wheels a calculation method was developed which integrates the experimental methodes for durability evaluation of wheels, being approved over many years. Because {{of the complexity of}} the different finite-element calculation steps suitable tools are developed for. automatic usage. In this report the calculation method is used during the development phase of a <b>rubber-sprung</b> rail vehicle "spoke"-wheel. The rubber elements were considered in detail. First the rubber elements were optimized regarding the spring characteristic and the fatigue strength, then tests were carried out to verify the calculations and investigate the fatigue strength...|$|E
