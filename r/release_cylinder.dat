40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} measure ammonia emissions from farms {{is an important}} issue both in terms of establishing emissions regulations and for effective evaluation of mitigation techniques. To address this issue, experimental trials were carried out to determine the ability to quantitatively recover ammonia released within a large environmental chamber designed to house six dairy cows or manure processing technologies. Ammonia was released over 30 min periods at a range of values (0. 1 to 0. 7 g/min) from three positions within the chamber. Chamber temperature was maintained at 22. 2 C. Air flow was maintained at one of three setpoints; 10. 5, 14. 0, or 21. 0 air exchanges per h. The amount of ammonia recovered from each release was determined by calculating the average increase in ammonia concentration during the release and stabilization periods, and multiplying by the measured volumetric air flow. Over 86 trials, the recoveries averaged 105. 1 0. 8 % of the amounts released as determined by the weight change of the <b>release</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Small increases in measured recoveries were associated with increased air flow and increased amounts of ammonia released. Results from this study indicate that increases in ammonia within the chamber, including short–term increases, can be quantitatively recovered...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of various blends of neutralized palm oil methyl ester (NPOME) in a small-unmodified direct-injection diesel engine and to compare them with that of a reference diesel fuel (D 2). The NPOME has been blended together with D 2 in several percentages (10 %, 20 % and 50 %) and known as B 10, B 20 and B 50. The acquisition of operating parameters such as performances, emission concentrations, cylinder pressure and fuel line pressure were performed as a function of engine loads, at the engine speed of 1500 rpm. The effect of engine load and blend percentages on brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency, heat <b>release,</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, ignition delay, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), unburned hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and exhaust smoke were carried out in this study. As a whole it was found that the palm oil-based alternatives behaved comparably well to the D 2 in terms of performance (fuel consumption and thermal efficiency). Smoke density readings show improvements as compared to that emitted by the diesel fuel in which operating under similar conditions. The emissions of CO, CO 2 and HC were reduced by using biodiesel fuels, while NOx emissions for biodiesels were slightly higher...|$|E
40|$|The use of palm {{oil-based}} biodiesel fuel {{has been}} proposed as an alternative fuel for diesel engines in Malaysia. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of several biodiesel blends of neutralized palm oil methyl ester (NPOME) in a small-unmodified direct injection diesel engine, and to compare them to that of a Malaysian grade 2 diesel fuel (D 2). Experimental measurements of engine performances, exhaust emissions, cylinder pressure, fuel line pressure, rate of heat release and ignition delay were performed as a function of engine load at different engine speeds. Comparisons between D 2 and the biodiesel blends on the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency, heat <b>release,</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, ignition delay, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), unburned hydrocarbon (uHC), particulate matter (PM) and exhaust smoke were carried out in this study. A comparison between D 2 and the biodiesel fuels on the injector tip deposit was also studied. In this study, simulations were performed to evaluate the diesel and biodiesel fuels performance in a diesel engine. The simulation was modelled using GT-Power software in order to simulate the performance and emissions. Based on the simulation, the results were comparable to the experimental results. In the engine experiment, it was found that the palm oil-based biodiesels behaved comparably to the D 2 in terms of performance (fuel consumption and thermal efficiency) and rate of heat released. Smoke quality showed a better result when compared to that emitted by the diesel fuel (D 2) operating under similar conditions. The injector tip deposit was lower when biodiesel fuels were used in the engine when compared to the diesel fuel (D 2). The emissions of CO, CO 2, HC and PM were also lower using biodiesel fuels, while NOx emissions were higher when compared to D 2...|$|E

40|$|Compression {{ignition}} engines {{have been}} used widely in the transportation sector and power generation for the decades. These engines are less fuel consumed with higher brake thermal efficiency. However, compression ignition engines produce higher pollution in NOx and PM emission as well as cause several negative drawbacks to the environment. Most {{countries in the world}} have regulated several regulations to reduce the emission from the engines. Other than that, the introduction of biodiesel in the engines is beneficial and proven to reduce the emission significantly. However, biodiesel has higher density and viscosity with lower heating value as compared to mineral diesel. Fuel additives are among other methods that proven to modify the properties of biodiesel to be comparable with mineral diesel without doing any engine modification. Although fuel additives’ ability to reduce harmful emissions is well known in the literature, the mechanism for these additives is not well understood when operated in the four-stroke, four-cylinder diesel engines. Two alcohol-based additives, methanol and ethanol were diluted with B 20 blend (20 % biodiesel + 80 % mineral diesel) with the formulation of 5 % by volume. The test fuels; mineral diesel, B 100 (palm-diesel), B 20 blend and B 20 -alcohol blends (B 20 E 5 and B 20 M 5) were investigated on a Mitsubishi 4 D 68 four stroke, four-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine incorporating sensors for in-cylinder pressure measurement and thermocouples. There were two operating modes dealing with these fuels, which the first mode been conducted on increasing engine speeds at 50 % throttle position. While as for the second mode, these fuels were operated at three different engine loads, 0. 05 MPa, 0. 4 MPa and 0. 7 MPa with the engine constant speed of 2500 rpm. The effect of test fuels on brake power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), combustion (in-cylinder pressure, rate of heat <b>release,</b> <b>cylinder</b> temperature) and NOx, NO, CO and CO 2 emissions were investigated. Results found that the performance of diesel engine improved with the use of alcohol (ethanol and methanol) in the B 20 blends especially in comparison to mineral diesel, B 100 and B 20. Overall, the results indicated that when compared to mineral diesel, B 100, B 20, B 20 E 5 and B 20 M 5 have higher brake thermal efficiency. The use of alcohol as a fuel additive in the B 20 blend has improved the combustion characteristics when the loads were applied to the engine. Besides, the exhaust emission for the B 20 E 5 and B 20 M 5 were fairly reduced when compared to mineral diesel...|$|E

The introduction of these [...] "Blue Amberols" [...] helped to bring cylinder sales up. The early Blue Amberol releases offered excellent audio quality for their era — better, in fact, than that of later issues, because from January 1915 onward Thomas A. Edison, Inc., which had been concentrating its efforts on improving the quality of Diamond Disc phonograph records, began to <b>release</b> <b>cylinders</b> which were acoustically dubbed from Diamond Discs. The dubbing technique used was non-electronic (the disc phonograph horn played into the cylinder recording horn) until December 1927, when electronic dubbing was introduced. This resulted in a somewhat hollow [...] "dead" [...] sound on the cylinders compared to the original discs. On many dubbed cylinders, when the cylinder's own 160 rpm surface noise is low enough, 80 rpm disc surface noise can be heard starting up shortly before the music begins.|$|R
40|$|The holt-melt {{extrusion}} {{technique has}} proven to be an advantageous method for preparation of solid dosage forms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the release profiles of sustained <b>release</b> <b>cylinders</b> produced by hot-melt extrusion. The cylinders were composed of inner and outer part, both containing theophylline [1]. Cylinders were 0. 5 cm or 1 cm long. The two parts were extruded separately, cut into pieces and joined manually. Dissolution testing was performed on USP 2 apparatus at rotation speed 50, 100 and 150 rpm. Artificial gastric and intestinal media were used consecutively. Due to their hydrophilic / lipophilic properties inner part of <b>cylinder</b> <b>releases</b> the drug fast while outer part represents extended release component. No influenceof stirring rate on theophyline release was observed for 1 cm cylinders while for 0. 5 cm cylinders the amount of released drug slightly increased with increase of stirring rate (Fig. 1). However, due to high variability of release results significant differences could not be proven. This high variability of release results was beside other factors (poor wettability due to lipophilic components etc.) at least partly ascribed to manual preparation of the dosage forms. Manual joining of the inner and outer part of the cylinder caused void spaces between both parts as shown on the stereomicrographs (Olympus SZX 12) (Fig. 2). The consequence of void spaces is additional free surface available for dissolution which can not be controlled and thus increases the variability of release results. Thus, the automatic simultaneous co-extrusion would be better choice when preparing co-extrudates as void spaces between two parts of cylinders could be avoided and variabilityat least partly reduced...|$|R

For purposes of this work raw pyrolysis oil was derived from waste vehicle tyres through vacuum pyrolysis realized in experimental installation.
