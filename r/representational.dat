5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental <b>representational</b> substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some <b>representational</b> substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the <b>representational</b> substrate of this <b>representational</b> substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a <b>representational</b> substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} <b>representational</b> realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} <b>representational</b> theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek <b>representational</b> arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain {{the origins of the}} world, and details the lives and adventures {{of a wide variety of}} gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify <b>representational</b> realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a <b>representational</b> strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arts and}} leisure {{activities}} {{described in the}} fifth sub-book include activities such as garland making and perfumery, wherein the flowers are arranged in patterns of pleasing colors and ones that delight the senses. The text lists types of aromatic woods, such as sandalwood and their qualities. The text describes the art of painting as three types — Viddha (<b>representational),</b> Aviddha (sketch, outline) and Bhava (narrative). The text includes a recipe for making various types of paints, as well as crayons for drawing, and then recommends the steps in making a drawing.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} in the game include: Meagan Foster (Rosario Dawson)the captain of the Dreadful Wale; Paolo (Pedro Pascal)leader of the Howler Gang; Mindy Blanchard (Betsy Moore)Paolo's second-in-command; Mortimer Ramsey (Sam Rockwell)a corrupt officer of the Dunwall City Watch; Liam Byrne (Jamie Hector)the Vice Overseer of Karnaca who opposes the Howlers; Anton Sokolov (Roger L. Jackson)Dunwall's genius inventor; the Outsider (Robin Lord Taylor)the <b>representational</b> figure of the Void, an alternate dimension that grants supernatural abilities; and Jessamine Kaldwin (April Stewart)Emily Kaldwin's mother, whose spirit was trapped in The Heart.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of <b>representational</b> signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and <b>representational</b> duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Indonesian wax-resist batik {{designs on}} cloth combine <b>representational</b> motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with {{abstract}} and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of Cirebon has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of Yogyakarta and Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of Lasem {{on the north}} coast of Java and of Tasikmalaya in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.|$|E
5|$|UBS AG is a Swiss global {{financial}} services company, incorporated in the Canton of Zurich, and co-headquartered in Zürich and Basel. The company provides wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide, and is {{generally considered to be}} a bulge bracket bank. In Switzerland, these services are also offered to retail clients. The name UBS was originally an abbreviation for the Union Bank of Switzerland, but it ceased to be a <b>representational</b> abbreviation after the bank's merger with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. The company traces its origins to 1856, when the earliest of its predecessor banks was founded.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Hecatompylos {{had served}} as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates {{established}} royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, Ctesiphon and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert (Nisa, Turkmenistan), where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty. Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of Gotarzes I of Parthia (r. c.90–80BC). It became {{the site of the}} royal coronation ceremony and the <b>representational</b> city of the Arsacids, according to Brosius.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of <b>representational</b> thought or increased memory.|$|E

25|$|The <b>representational</b> {{requirements}} in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.|$|E
25|$|Spybuck told Harrington that he {{preferred}} painting cowboys, livestock, and range scenes, but through Harrington's patronage, Spybuck's style evolved, particularly in {{his choice of}} subjects {{and the way he}} painted them. His style was naïve and <b>representational,</b> featuring local scenes of ceremonies, games, social gatherings, and home life that he was familiar with and often participated in. His style recalled Plains flatstyle representative art that often identified individuals by depicting details of dress and accoutrement, but he took the <b>representational</b> depiction of the figures and setting in a new direction that was uniquely his own.|$|E

25|$|The ILA won a slim {{victory in}} the May 26, 1954, election, despite {{aggressive}} IBL campaigning. In August1954, the results were finally approved and certified by NLRB and the ILA was given <b>representational</b> rights in the Port of New York. The IBL did not go quietly and forced a third <b>representational</b> election in 1956, {{in which it was}} again defeated. By the time an AFL-CIO committee recommended re-admittance for the ILA in August 1959, the IBL was active only in the Great Lakes. In October, the IBL officially dissolved itself and IBL president Larry Long became president of ILA's Great Lakes District.|$|E
25|$|Belief: A {{conviction}} to {{the truth}} of a proposition. Beliefs can be acquired through perception, contemplation or communication. In the psychological sense, belief is a <b>representational</b> mental state that {{takes the form of a}} propositional attitude.|$|E
25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{virtually}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the <b>representational</b> aspect of the works. The simplification of <b>representational</b> form gave way to a new complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.|$|E
25|$|Hawthorne {{and other}} artists {{established}} the Provincetown Art Association in 1914 {{and held the}} first of many juried exhibitions the following year. Weinrich contributed nine pictures to this show, all of them <b>representational</b> and somewhat conservative in style.|$|E
25|$|There {{are major}} {{differences}} between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like constituency grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, <b>representational</b> or derivational, construction- or rule-based.|$|E
25|$|New wards {{were created}} for {{elections}} this year, 2007, polling on 3 May and, as the wards became effective for <b>representational</b> purposes, the Highland Council's management and committee structures were reorganised. The Caithness management {{area and the}} Caithness area committee were therefore abolished.|$|E
25|$|The Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was {{practically}} {{over by the}} spring of the 1907 Salon des Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne in the fall of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from expressing bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. Simplified form began to overtake the <b>representational</b> aspect of the works. For Metzinger and Delaunay, too, <b>representational</b> form gave way to a new complexity; {{the subject matter of the}} paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited. And Picasso had almost completed Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.|$|E
25|$|Juan Bastos (born 18 January 1958, in Caracas, Venezuela) is an American {{portrait}} {{artist of}} Bolivian descent who also creates other <b>representational</b> art, including pieces that utilize mythology and symbolism.

25|$|Robert L. Qualters, Jr. (born March 13, 1934) is an American painter, {{installation}} {{artist and}} printmaker based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His work encompasses traditional painting, {{as well as}} murals, and collaborations with other Pittsburgh-based artists across several disciplines. He {{is associated with the}} Bay Area Figurative Movement of <b>Representational</b> Painting.|$|E
25|$|After 1928, Csaky {{moved away}} from Cubism into a more figurative or <b>representational</b> style for nearly thirty years. He {{exhibited}} internationally across Europe, but some of his pioneering artistic innovation was forgotten. His work today is primarily held by French and Hungarian institutions, as well as galleries and private collections both in France and abroad.|$|E
25|$|Other Board decisions, such as Bee Bus Line Company (decided May 10, 1934) and Eagle Rubber Company (decided May 17, 1934), {{laid down}} the {{stipulation}} that a properly conducted, government-monitored <b>representational</b> election required good-faith bargaining, and that collective bargaining must precede the decision to strike. Both decisions have had stabilizing influences on collective bargaining relationships.|$|E
25|$|Chicago has a {{distinctive}} fine art tradition. For {{much of the}} twentieth century, it nurtured a strong style of figurative surrealism, as {{in the works of}} Ivan Albright and Ed Paschke. In 1968 and 1969, members of the Chicago Imagists, such as Roger Brown, Leon Golub, Robert Lostutter, Jim Nutt, and Barbara Rossi produced bizarre <b>representational</b> paintings.|$|E
25|$|The ILA {{strove to}} clean house and rid itself {{of the few}} members who had in fact been proven corrupt or criminal. In August 1953, the ILA was {{suspended}} from the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a devastating blow. The AFL created the International Brotherhood of Longshoremen (IBL-AFL) to replace the besmirched ILA and scheduled <b>representational</b> elections.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{issued a}} new order, E.O. 6580, on February 1, 1934. The order gave the Board {{explicit}} power to authorize, upon a showing by {{a substantial number}} of employees, <b>representational</b> elections to determine majority status. The order appeared to give the winning organization exclusive representation for employees in the bargaining unit, but this interpretation was widely contested.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} decades of the 20th century formed an {{exceptional}} period of artistic ferment and revolution. Avant-garde movements rapidly evolved and overlapped in a march towards nonfigurative, total abstraction. The still life, {{as well as other}} <b>representational</b> art, continued to evolve and adjust until mid-century when total abstraction, as exemplified by Jackson Pollock's drip paintings, eliminated all recognizable content.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Virginia College and University Redistricting Competition was {{organized}} by professors Michael McDonald of George Mason University and Quentin Kidd of Christopher Newport University. About 150 students on sixteen teams from thirteen schools submitted plans for legislative and U.S. Congressional districts. The winning submissions for the congressional redistricting were from the University of Virginia and from the College of William and Mary. The “Division 1” maps conformed to the Governor’s Executive Order, and did not address electoral competition or <b>representational</b> fairness. In addition to the criteria of contiguity, equi-population, the federal Voting Rights Act, and communities {{of interest in the}} existing city and county boundaries, “Division 2” maps in the competition did incorporate considerations of electoral competition and <b>representational</b> fairness. Judges for the cash award prizes were Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. They also created districts more compact than the General Assembly’s earlier efforts.|$|E
