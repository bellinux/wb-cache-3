5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} threats and had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> the bush on a hyena.|$|E

25|$|Valentino and Giancarlo are {{the kings}} of high living. Every other {{designer}} looks and says, ‘How do they live the way they do?’ I don’t think they made the money that Valentino and Giancarlo did, because Giancarlo {{knows how to make}} money. If they did, they didn’t spend the money like Valentino. No other designer ever did. When the terrorism first started in Rome – the period when the Red Brigades were kidnapping people – Valentino was <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> in a bulletproof Mercedes. And do you know what color the Mercedes was? Red. My God, I thought, you must want to get blown up.|$|E
25|$|Snorri also relates that Aðils loved good {{horses and}} had the best horses in his days (interestingly, the {{contemporary}} Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Slöngvi and another one Raven, which he had taken from Áli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd {{on the island of}} Andøya. Aðils himself died in a similar way at the Dísablót. Aðils was <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. The Swedes called him a great king and buried him at Uppsala. He was succeeded by Eysteinn.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Arkan {{could be}} seen <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> Belgrade in his pink Cadillac and {{gambling}} on roulette in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby Pančevo to Sveti Stefan and Portorož. Following a game of poker in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street, Bečići, an elevator altercation started with a tenant from the apartment building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He couldn't avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange {{between him and the}} judge – during the pre-session identification Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document about a mortgage loan that he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street. He ended up receiving a six-month sentence, which he served at the Belgrade Central Prison.|$|E

25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had been <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> with the same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the race was delayed by rain and {{lightning}} {{in the vicinity of}} the speedway for nearly 30 minutes. The drivers were called to their cars at 8:40p.m. and rolled off pit road around 8:57. Under night Tennessee skies, Carl Edwards led the field to the green flag at 9:03. Teammate Denny Hamlin got a much better start and led the first lap. Chase Elliott worked his way up to Hamlin and passed him for the lead on the ninth lap. Kyle Busch reeled him in to pass under him in turn 4 to take the lead on lap 23. The first caution of the race flew on lap 30 for rain. It picked up in intensity to the point that the race was red-flagged on lap 38. The red flag period lasted for one hour, 24 minutes and four seconds before engines were refired at 10:42 and the cars rolled back onto the track. After eight laps <b>riding</b> <b>around,</b> the rain returned with greater intensity and the race was red-flagged a second time at lap 48. Just past 11:00, the rest of the race was postponed to Sunday at 1:00p.m.|$|E

500|$|As a {{child he}} [...] "hoped to be a {{musician}} or a hockey player." [...] At Main Street Elementary School, with {{the encouragement of}} his teacher James Doyle, he developed an interest in writing, serving as editor for his school newspaper. He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive to keep trying to succeed as a writer." [...] He realized [...] "there probably wasn't going to be a career in <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> with my friends listening to Foghat," [...] so Scully decided he [...] "definitely wanted to break into comedy" [...] even though he [...] "really had no reason to believe [...] could succeed." [...] Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was first}} dubbed [...] "Magic" [...] as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Everett High School, when he {{recorded}} a triple-double of 36points, 18rebounds and 16assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports {{writer for the}} Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious. In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8points and16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game. Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, {{who was killed in}} a car accident the previous summer. He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, saying years later, [...] "I doubted myself back then." [...] Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or <b>riding</b> <b>around</b> in Chastine's car. Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan and was also named to the 1977 McDonald's All-American team.|$|E

[...] The 2008 solo ride was undertaken when Gandolfi was 73, 2010 when he was 77, and the 2013 solo <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> his 80th birthday. [...] The 2013 <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> India was published as a series of contributions to The Guardians [...] "Backpacking" [...] travelogue section between June and October of that year.
