40|$|The {{problem of}} small Island Developing States (SIDS) is quite recent, {{end of the}} 80 s and 90 s, {{still looking for a}} {{theoretical}} consolidation. SIDS, as small states in development, formed by one or several islands geographically dispersed, present reduced population, market, territory, natural resources, including drinkable water, and, in great number of the cases, low level of economic activity, factors that together, hinder the gathering of scale economies. To these diseconomies they come to join the more elevated costs in transports and communications which, allies to lower productivities, to a smaller quality and diversification of its productions, which difficult its integration in the world economy. In some SIDS these factors are not dissociating of the few investments in infrastructures, in the formation of human resources and in productive investments, just as it happens in most of the developing countries. In ecological terms, many of them with shortage of natural resources, but integrating important ecosystems in national and world terms, but with great fragility relatively to the pollution action, of excessive fishing, of uncontrolled development of tourism, factors that, conjugated and associated to the stove effect, condition the climate and the slope of the medium level of the sea water and therefore could put in cause the own survival of some of them. The drive to the awareness of the international community towards its problems summed up with the accomplishment by the United Nations in the Barbados’s Conference, 1994 where the right to the development was emphasized, through the going up the appropriate strategies and the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of the SIDS. The orientation of the regional and international cooperation in that sense, sharing technology (namely clean technology and control and administration environmental technology), information and creation of capacity-building, supplying means, including financial resources, creating non discriminatory and just trade rules, it would drive to the establishment of a world system economically more equal, in which the production, the consumption, the pollution levels, the demographic politics were guided towards the sustainability. It constituted an important step for the recognition for the international community on the specificities of those states and it allowed the definition of a group of norms and politics to implement at the national, regional and international level and it was important that they continued {{in the sense of the}} sustainable development. But this Conference had in its origin previous summits: the Summit of Rio de Janeiro about Environment and Development, accomplished in 1992, which left an important document - the Agenda 21, in the Conference of Stockholm at 1972 and even in the Conference of Ramsar, 1971 about “Wetlands. ” CENTRO DE ESTUDOS AFRICANOS Occasional Papers © CEA - Centro de Estudos Africanos 4 Later, the Valletta Declaration, Malta, 1998, the Forum of Small States, 2002, get the international community's attention for the problems of SIDS again, in the sense that they act <b>to</b> increase its <b>resilience.</b> If the definition of “vulnerability” was the inability of the countries to resist economical, ecological and socially <b>to</b> the <b>external</b> <b>shocks</b> and “resilience” as the potential for them to absorb and minimize the impact of those shocks, presenting a structure that allows them to be little affected by them, a part of the available studies, dated of the 90 s, indicate that the SIDS are more vulnerable than the other developing countries. The vulnerability of SIDS results from the fact the they present an assemblage of characteristics that turns them less capable of resisting or they advance strategies that allow a larger <b>resilience</b> <b>to</b> the <b>external</b> <b>shocks,</b> either anthropogenic (economical, financial, environmental) or even natural, connected with the vicissitudes of the nature. If these vulnerability factors were grouped with the expansion of the economic capitalist system at world level, the economic and financial globalisation, the incessant search of growing profits on the part of the multinational enterprises, the technological accelerated evolution drives to a situation of disfavour of the more poor. The creation of the <b>resilience</b> <b>to</b> the <b>external</b> <b>shocks,</b> <b>to</b> the process of globalisation, demands from SIDS and of many other developing countries the endogen definition of strategies and solid but flexible programs of integrated development. These must be assumed by the instituted power, but also by the other stakeholders, including companies and organizations of the civil society and for the population in general. But that demands strong investment in the formation of human resources, in infrastructures, in investigation centres; it demands the creation capacity not only to produce, but also to produce differently and do international marketing. It demands institutional capacity. Cape Verde is on its way to this stage...|$|R

This report {{examines}} how the access of Latin American and Caribbean countries <b>to</b> <b>external</b> debt financing has {{evolved in the}} three decades since the debt crisis of 1982. In these thirty years, as the global financial environment evolved and structural shifts {{took place in the}} region, the market for Latin American and Caribbean tradable debt opened, deepened and broadened, developing from an unsecuritized loan market in the 1980 s to a robust and improved securitized bond market {{by the end of the}} period. The study highlights how bond financing today is very different from what it was in the 1980 s and 1990 s and how access <b>to</b> <b>external</b> bond financing has become more widespread and less costly. Through the analysis of the forces behind the evolution of spreads, issuance and credit ratings, the report shows that by the end of 2012, debt spreads had declined considerably from the high levels prevalent in the late 1990 s and early 2000 s; the composition of debt issuance had shifted from sovereigns to the corporate sector and to local markets; debt was issued on a broader range of currencies; credit quality had improved substantially; and Latin American and Caribbean external debt attracted a larger and more diversified investor base. From 1982 to 2012, several countries in the region moved from facing a shortage of funds to learning how best to manage available financing options. Access <b>to</b> <b>external</b> debt financing is not universal, however, and despite increased <b>resilience,</b> vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>external</b> financial <b>shocks</b> can still be a threat.

40|$|This book {{explores the}} changes that have {{occurred}} as regards the production structure, trade and society in Central America and the Dominican Republic, and how these have influenced the countries’ growth trajectories. One of the conclusions it reaches is that the subregion overall has enjoyed faster economic growth than the rest of Latin America over the two decades examined, which has helped to raise people’s incomes and living standards. Yet this progress falls far short of what is needed, given the high levels of poverty and indigence and the glaring inequalities suffered by much of the population in Central America and the Dominican Republic. If the subregion is to attain higher levels of development with equality, one of the challenges it must tackle urgently is to adopt a strategy for changing its production structures and forging ahead with subregional integration, in order to correct productivity lags and income gaps.

40|$|The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} stories of economic transition and integration among developing countries. Strong rates of economic growth since the early 1990 s have been fueled by increased trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the subregion. This economic progress has translated into marked improvements in living standards and human development outcomes, and dramatic reductions in poverty. Unilateral policy reforms and greater economic cooperation through the GMS Program in particular have led to positive trade and investment growth. More recently, membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and participation in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) and other preferential trading agreements have driven reforms. Despite these achievements, the trade policy reform agenda remains incomplete. It is important for the GMS members of AFTA to multilateralize their preferences in order to avoid trade diversion and deflection, and remain open to global trade. This should also be the objective of the various ASEAN+ 1 bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). Retaining a multiple-tier tariff system is unlikely to mitigate revenue loss, but could unnecessarily burden an already stretched bureaucracy, or lead to more rent-seeking. In order to reduce vulnerability to external shocks, diversification of both export commodities and markets are being considered. Intra-sectoral diversification of export commodities is likely to be more viable and less costly than inter-sectoral diversification.

40|$|World air {{transport}} {{has been on}} a steady exponential rise since the 1940 ’s and the trend has shown remarkable <b>resilience</b> <b>to</b> <b>external</b> <b>shocks.</b> The level of air traffic has greatly exceeded the wildest expectations of the air traffic management pioneers that originally defined the basic precepts ATM that persist till today. This has stretched ATM to a point where it is starting to show signs of ineffectiveness in the face of ever increasing congestion. Delays are on the rise, costs are ballooning, flights are being elongated unnecessarily, the system is becoming increasingly susceptible to disruption, and the high environmental impact of aviation is being compounded by the inability of air traffic controllers to optimise ATM operation in real-time. If these trends are not reversed, ATM could eventually face instability. The conservative, self-preserving outlook of the ATM community has confined progress to relatively minor tweaks of a tired human-centric paradigm. However, the diverging gap between ATM performance and fundamental requirements indicates the need for a step change. In this work, the traditionally incremental approach to ATM research was broken to favour a more exploratory mindset. As a result, a new discipline called Computational Air Traffic Management has been defined to address the unique set of challenges presented by the ATM problem, by taking a more objective scientific approach. A specific embodiment of a CATM system was designed, constructed, simulated and tested and shown to be a significant step towards demonstrating the feasibility of a fully autonomous multi-agent-based {{air transport}}ation system based on optimisation principles. The system offers unique advantages in terms of resilience to disruption, efficiency and future scalability. The traffic density using such a system can be realistically increased many times higher than current levels while significantly improving on the current levels of safety, operating cost, environmental impact and flight delays.

40|$|Includes bibliographyIn {{the first}} quarter of 2007, Latin American spreads {{tightened}} to new lows and equity prices climbed further, despite a brief bout of market turbulence in late-February and early-March. The good macroeconomic performance of the countries of the region contributed to these favorable developments, but the high level of liquidity in global markets, as well as elevated risk tolerance among market participants, also played a very important role. The negative shift in market sentiment in late-February and early-March was triggered by steep declines in global equity markets - which came after an almost 9 % drop in the Shanghai market on February 27, its biggest fall in a decade - as well as by concerns about the U. S. mortgage market and its potential impact on the U. S. economy. Although brief, the bout of market turbulence lifted implied volatilities in most markets. Global equity markets quickly recovered, and Latin American stocks continued their winning streak, surging in the quarter. The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Latin American Price Index gained 5. 6 % in dollar terms in {{the first quarter}}, following a gain of 21. 1 % {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2006. For the first five months of the year, Latin America's MSCI gained 22. 1 %. The quick recovery of Latin American asset prices after the sell-off indicated that market confidence on the region was not easily displaced, even by sharp fluctuations in asset prices. As a result of the search for yield in face of ample global liquidity and improving fundamentals, Latin American bond spreads continued to tighten to record low levels in the first quarter, despite widening briefly during the sell-off of late-February and early-March. According to JPMorgan, the EMBI+ Latin component tightened 11 basis points in the first quarter and 18 basis points in the first five months of year. Compared to U. S. corporate spreads, Latin American spreads of similar credit rating continued to trade at tighter levels. As long as returns remain attractive relative to alternatives such as the U. S. high yield, the region will continue to be an important destination for capital flows, with inflows moving to corporate and local currency debt, as well as stocks. Latin American markets were also supported by active debt management in the first quarter, as countries took advantage of the favorable external environment to improve their debt profiles, increase issuance in local currency and develop local markets.

High dependence on rain-fed agriculture and poor soil health increases vulnerability of farming systems and predisposes rural households to food insecurity and poverty thus eroding their productive assets and weakening their coping strategies and <b>resilience</b> <b>to</b> <b>external</b> <b>shocks.</b> Increasingly, the onset, duration and intensity of rains vary considerably from year to year, while the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as drought and floods are on the increase with devastating impacts on the national economy and the livelihoods of the people. Moreover agricultural seasons in some areas of the country are expected to shift. Drastic and innovative measures are therefore needed to help farmers and consumers cope with the changes in emerging and projected weather patterns. The most affected will be the rural poor, who are dependent on farming as a livelihood. Because of their poverty status, they have less ability to accumulate and protect assets and have the least adaptive capacity to respond to climatic shocks occasioned through extreme events as well as variability in weather during the cropping seasons. Changes in climate may be faster and more intense than in the past and existing knowledge on approaches and practices in agriculture may not be sufficient to address the adaptation needs. To ensure that the country is food secure and for food producers to improve their livelihoods, climate smart agriculture (CSA) is the most appropriate approach. The CSA approach would ensure sustainable increase in agricultural productivity; build resilience in food systems and adapt to climate change; reduce food losses and waste; and contribute to the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. I believe that this CSA Programme, which {{is the result of a}} collective, sector-wide consultation effort, places Tanzania firmly on a new and ambitious growth trajectory for the future. We recognise the vital role that agriculture must play in growing the economy and creating decent jobs. In this respect, the agriculture sector as a whole is determined to optimise its contribution. The successful implementation of this programme will require multi-level partnerships between the public and private sector, civil society and citizens. I acknowledge with appreciation the constructive and cooperative relationships we have already built in this regard with all parties involved. I believe that agriculture in this country will grow from strength to strength. This, however, will require a shift in the way we do things, in line with the new strategic approach. Finally, I would like to thank the many people who have contributed to the development of this programme. Our thanks to the panel of 10 experts from across all stakeholder groups in the sector, chaired by Ms. Shakwaanande Natai, for the pivotal role they played in guiding the development of the Programme, and for their commitment to the process. I would also like to express our appreciation for those who submitted comments and made inputs that tmade the document better. We are grateful for your commitment and dedication to walk this path with our Ministry...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The aim of {{this thesis}} is to conduct a {{thorough}} analysis {{of the performance of}} Australian banks {{over a long period of}} time, covering a period of various regulatory measures. To achieve this aim, the following four objectives are set in this thesis: first, to investigate economic efficiency (i. e. cost and profit efficiency) of the Australian banks before and after the implementation of the prudential regulation; second, to examine whether the Australian banks operate at the minimum efficient scale; third, to assess whether the efficiencies achieved contribute to wealth maximization of shareholders; fourth, to examine the determinants of Australian bank efficiency. Using a data set covering a period from 1985 through 2008, I first apply the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine the technical, cost and profit efficiency of Australian banks. A standard data envelopment analysis (DEA), as well as a slack-based DEA model (Tone 2001), is then used to assess the technical and scale efficiency of Australian banks. In addition, a Malmquist index model is used to investigate bank productivity changes over the sample period. The relationship between bank efficiency and bank stock returns is also examined using the market model. Lastly, a mixed two-step approach is used to examine efficiency and the determinants of efficiency using panel data from 1988 to 2008 across three countries, namely, Australia, Canada and the U. K [...] In the first stage, a common efficiency frontier for banks in three countries is constructed including the environmental factors. The firm-level determinants of efficiency are then investigated by regressing these efficiencies on firm-specific factors. A key finding of this thesis is that, over the period from 1985 through 2008, the technical, cost and profit efficiency of Australian banks improved. However, scale efficiency showed a declining trend, which was mainly due to the scale inefficiency of the big-four banks over the sample period. Australian banks have a high level of cost and profit efficiency, but have a relatively low level of technical efficiency. Technological improvement is found to be the major driving force behind productivity changes of Australian banks, and also has a positive effect on the profit efficiency frontier. It is also observed that technical, cost and profit efficiency have a positive effect on bank stock returns, suggesting that bank efficiency is properly recognized by market participants. Compared to their regional counterparts, the big-four banks have a lower level of technical efficiency, but a higher level of cost efficiency. The low level of technical efficiency of the big-four banks is attributed to scale inefficiency. In comparison, the regional banks can achieve the same level of profit efficiency as that of the big-four banks by devising a better way of transforming inputs into outputs. Australian banks show a superior performance in terms of technical, cost and profit efficiency compared with that of Canadian and U. K. banks. The factors such as intangible assets, loans to deposits ratio and, loans to assets ratio exert a positive influence on technical efficiency. On the other hand, technical efficiency is inversely affected by size, ratio of loan loss provisions to total loans and debt to equity ratio. The findings of this thesis appear to provide justifications for the deregulatory measures and the prudential regulation framework introduced by the Australian regulatory bodies. Australian banks with increased efficiency levels and relatively high capital adequacy ratios demonstrated <b>resilience</b> <b>to</b> <b>external</b> <b>shocks,</b> such as the Asian financial crisis and the subprime mortgage crisis. An investigation of the determinants of bank efficiency suggests that an Australian bank manager has the choice of tuning up either the capital structure or the asset structure to improve efficiency. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations relating to data unavailability and efficiency evaluation techniques...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{approximate}} P(^+ mn|s⃗e⃗_o), a two-step approximation technique is employed, which calculates the conditional probability through a probabilistic path search. We first acquire all paths leading <b>to</b> <b>external</b> <b>shock</b> events, for every mission node {{for which we}} would like to perform mission impact assessment. Often, {{we would like to}} perform this for every node in the mission dependency model.
