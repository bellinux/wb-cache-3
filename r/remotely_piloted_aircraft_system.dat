40|$|This {{document}} is the Deliverable D 10. 1 - 3 titled “Concept of Operations” for ACROSS, a European Commission 7 th Framework co-funded project. The Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) {{to be developed}} in ACROSS WP 10 must deal with a full flight deck crew incapacitation (Configuration 4 of the ACROSS Definitions) and should enable a safe return and automatic landing of the aircraft to a suitable airport. A potential system {{for the detection of}} the incapacitation will be investigated in ACROSS WP 9. During the phase in which the EACS is active it may be in contact with a cooperative ground segment. As defined in D 10. 1 - 1 Candidate Solutions, two solutions ere brought forward to more detailed description in this concept of operations (ConOps) document. During the identification of the candidate solutions, the full spectrum of control over the aircraft systems was considered: From a fully automated Emergency Aircraft Control System (EACS) to fully ground controlled <b>Remotely</b> <b>Piloted</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>System.</b> None of these extreme ends of the spectrum will by themselves constitute a satisfying solution at all levels. Therefore, for the purpose of deriving a concept of operations, the two solutions for which ConOps are developed are called “Ground Centered” and “Aircraft Centered”. For the aircraft centered solution, the EACS will navigate, aviate and land autonomously. A ground station linked to the EACS {{will be able to make}} strategic decision such as diversions to alternate airports (for example in the event of runway closure) and uplink barometric altimeter settings. The ground centered solution will have the possibility of using the aircraft as <b>remotely</b> <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>system</b> (RPAS) with direct commands to the primary control surfaces.

However, regulation for integration in airspace is not harmonised in Europe.

The ESA project DESIRE (Demonstration of Satellites Enabling the Insertion of <b>Remotely</b> <b>Piloted</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Systems</b> in Europe), investigated to fly an RPAS as IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) traffic within national borders in controlled, non-segregated airspace by communication link via satellites. A real-time man-in-the-loop simulation environment has been set-up, where real air traffic controllers, a real pilot (for other traffic), and a pilot at an RPAS ground control station (GCS) participated to evaluate the concept. Several representative scenarios were evaluated, including emergency situations. Also the additional work load brought to air traffic controllers was investigated using the NASA TLX method. We have shown that integration of RPAS in controlled airspace is a feasible concept. Air traffic controllers indicated that control of the RPAS {{did not differ significantly}} from control of other, manned aircraft, although at the beginning a slightly increased workload was observed. We have also demonstrated that RPAS emergency procedures can be designed equivalent to those of manned aircraft, such that the air traffic controller will understand and is able to predict the behaviour of the RPAS in several loss-of-satellite-communication situations.
