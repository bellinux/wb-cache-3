5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem <b>Reap.</b> Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem <b>Reap,</b> Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War {{to an end and}} suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E

5|$|In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal Phnom Penh Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 {{million from}} {{personal}} savings and bank loans, {{which he used}} to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. The airlines flew domestic routes within {{the first year of}} operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal Phnom Penh Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom PenhBangkok, Phnom PenhHo Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh CitySiem <b>Reap.</b> The airlines attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem <b>Reap</b> in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding the deals due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.|$|E

5|$|Field {{research}} {{carried out}} by ethnologists such as Stefan Ehrentraut shows that {{only a minority of}} Vietnamese children attend public schools, with figures varying across different provinces. In Kampong Chhnang and Siem <b>Reap</b> where the Vietnamese live along the river banks, enrolment into public schools fare below 10%, whereas in other provinces such as Kampot and Kratie the proportion are higher. As the majority of Vietnamese do not carry citizenship papers, they were unable to enrol their children into public schools. For those who send their children to schools, most of them only attend school for a few years and seldom complete Grade 12 as Vietnamese parents were unable to afford school fees. Vietnamese students also faced difficulties in academic work, as classes are taught exclusively in the Khmer language, and Vietnamese children that grew up speaking Vietnamese at home have limited competency in Khmer. In some Vietnamese communities based in the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, there are private schools that are run by Vietnamese community associations and Christian organisations. The private schools cater the teaching of the Vietnamese language, and are mostly attended by children of impoverished families.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Sihanouk built a {{personal}} residence at Chamkarmon District {{where he lived}} {{over the next ten}} years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971 Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs to cook his meals. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008 Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem <b>Reap</b> and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they did not belong to him.|$|E

40|$|In {{a sample}} {{of a total of}} 11 judoists - one was the Tori (thrower), and the other ten were uke (those who were thrown during the {{performance}} of throwing technique), was analyzed the second phase of throwing (tsukuri) judo technique osoto gari. Tori is an active athlete superior quality (master, body mass = 72 kg), and all the other, who were thrown (uke) differ from each other as the weight and height of the body concerned. The average of their body weight was 73. 8 kg, which means that it is almost even with body mass of tori. For data collection was used a three-dimensional motion analysis system APAS (Ariel Performance Analysis System). Tsukuri is the phase where occur most actions of <b>reaping</b> leg. The second phase (tsukuri) begins when tori detach his right foot and lasts until the beginning of <b>reaping</b> opponent's leg, on which was concentrated its weight (uke's weight). The parameters that describe the effect of the <b>reaping</b> leg in the second phase of technique osoto gari are crucial for the successful execution of this leg technique. For the analysis of {{the second phase of the}} throw were selected 14 variables that describe the position of the body and certain body parts of both athletes, velocity parameters of tori's <b>reaping</b> leg and the duration of this phase (time). The role of the tori's standing leg is to maintain a stable position during this phase, while the other leg quickly and in full force acts <b>reaping.</b> The smallest angle of the knee joint of standing leg during the second phase was 130. 84 °. Before the moment of <b>reaping,</b> or detachment of uke`s feet from the mat, standing leg has a tendency to extension in the knee joint, which impacts positively on raising the tori's body center of mass. Height tori's body center of mass at the beginning phase was 87. 79 cm. As a result of tori's action by pulling onto uke, but little to his left side, the uke`s center of mass at the end of this phase is moved laterally to 6. 10 cm. The results show quite similar values of the distance of the body center of mass of both judoists at the beginning and the end phase, meaning that at the beginning of <b>reaping,</b> uke`s body move slightly to the side, so that the distance between two body center of mass increases and remains almost the same as at the beginning phase. Velocity parameters of tori's <b>reaping</b> leg during <b>reaping</b> are very important factors for a strong effect on the uke`s body or uke`s leg on which this concentrated weight. Maximal linear velocity of the ankle of <b>reaping</b> leg in back direction was 5. 05 m / s. Average value of the angular velocity of <b>reaping</b> leg in back direction in the sagittal plane of this phase (before the detachment of uke`s feet) was 198. 16 degrees per second (° / s), while maximal angular velocity of the same leg was 316, 01 (°/s). During <b>reaping,</b> or touching his leg with uke`s leg, the knee angle of <b>reaping</b> leg is changed, so its value significantly affect the efficiency of performing technique. Average value of the angle of knee joint (prior to the detachment uke`s feet) was 146. 80 °. At this phase occur the most important movements of <b>reaping</b> leg and other parts of tori's body. Therefore, this phase lasts slightly longer than the other phases (0. 37 s) ...|$|R
5|$|In January 1952 Sihanouk re-appointed Penn Nouth {{as prime}} {{minister}} before leaving for France. Once there, Sihanouk wrote to French president Vincent Auriol requesting that he grant Cambodia full independence, citing widespread anti-French sentiment among the Cambodian populace. Auriol deferred Sihanouk's request to the French commissioner for overseas territories, Jean Letourneau, who promptly rejected it. Subsequently, Sihanouk traveled to Canada and the United States, where he gave radio interviews to present his case. He {{took advantage of the}} prevailing anti-communist sentiment in those countries, arguing that Cambodia faced a Communist threat {{similar to that of the}} Viet Minh in Vietnam, and that the solution was to grant full independence to Cambodia. Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in June 1953, taking up residence in Siem <b>Reap.</b> He organised public rallies calling for Cambodians to fight for independence, and formed a citizenry militia which attracted about 130,000 recruits.|$|E

Charles VI's promises never materialised. In 1718 he repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union between Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Don Carlos of Spain, the eldest child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir.

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem <b>Reap</b> have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
