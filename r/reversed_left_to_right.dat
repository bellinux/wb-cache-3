50|$|Each tintype {{is usually}} a camera original, so the image {{is usually a}} mirror image, <b>reversed</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> from reality. Sometimes the camera was fitted with a mirror or right-angle prism so that the end result would be right-reading.|$|E
50|$|Most {{telescope}} designs {{produce an}} inverted image at the focal plane; these {{are referred to}} as inverting telescopes. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and <b>reversed</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right,</b> so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still <b>reversed</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right.</b> In terrestrial telescopes such as spotting scopes, monoculars and binoculars, prisms (e.g., Porro prisms) or a relay lens between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the Galilean refractor and the Gregorian reflector. These {{are referred to as}} erecting telescopes.|$|E

The final round is played {{in the same way as}} the qualifying round, but players shoot according to the ascending order of their first-round scores. In each round, the shots and the score are confirmed by the referee and the television instant replay system. The final round will be shot in <b>reverse</b> direction (<b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> corner for a left-handed shooter and vice versa).

50|$|The {{reversal}} of images by a plane mirror is perceived differently {{depending on the}} circumstances. In many cases, the image in a mirror appears <b>to</b> be <b>reversed</b> from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right.</b> If a flat mirror is mounted on the ceiling it can appear to reverse up and down if a person stands under it {{and looks up at}} it. Similarly a car turning left will still appear <b>to</b> be turning <b>left</b> in the rear view mirror for the driver of a car in front of it. The {{reversal of}} directions, or lack thereof, depends on how the directions are defined. More specifically a mirror changes the handedness of the coordinate system, one axis of the coordinate system appears to be reversed, and the chirality of the image may change. For example, the image of a right shoe will look like a left shoe.|$|R
40|$|This year I {{taught a}} new second-year {{undergraduate}} course whose mainaim {{was to help}} the students to write and read mathematics intelligently. I made two design decisions at the outset. First, the course should be aimed at middle-level students; it shouldn’t rely on the students being high fliers. Second, {{there should be some}} substantial mathematics in the course, otherwise it could hardly teach mathematical writing. What mathematics to put in? One can easily find suitable ‘puzzle ’ questions, starting with the old brainteaser: When we look at ourselves in a mirror, why do we see ourselves <b>reversed</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> but not upside down? When the students have made their first attempt at this, one can show them Martin Gardner’s account ([2] p. 23 f). Not all students appreciate that their answer needs to point to some feature that the left-right dimension does have and the up-down dimension doesn’t. So there is an issue of logic that we need to discuss, and at this point several students ask to have another shot at the question. But for me, and I suspect for most students too, a random selection of good essay topics doesn’t provide enough structure for a course. Sally Mitchell, who leads the college’s initiative Writing in the Disciplines, gave me a valuable clue here. She showed me her own work on using informal logic to give the students a framework for writing [4]. The informal logic that she was using seemed to me too far removed from the arguments that a mathematics student needs to handle. For example it said nothing about making and using assumptions, two essential tools of mathematical thinking. So I thought of taking her approach but with a more sophisticated logic. Hence the name of the course: ‘Logic I: Mathematical Writing’. The backbone of the course is a study of informal reasoning in mathematics. We start with a short review of Blaise Pascal’s De l’Esprit Géométrique [5], and the two main topics of the course (both introduced by Pascal) are defining and proving. Each of these topics gives scope for both practical examples and background theory. For example one question in the exam asked the students to describe in words the function with the graph shown in Fig 1 below...|$|E

While these levels span the full eight screens in length, they are not openly accessible all the way across, as some portions are blocked by cave walls that force Harry to travel through other areas in order to progress. Quicksand and tar pits are replaced by rivers and chasms. Balloons let Harry ascend to new areas. Snakes and crocodiles are not in this version, but scorpions are still there. New animal hazards include bats, which fly across some screens from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> right; condors, which start by flying <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> then <b>reverse</b> and fly <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> {{the remainder of the}} visit to that screen; Electric eels that swim in the rivers; and frogs that jump over some pits that have ladders, often above where a bat is present.|$|R
5000|$|A star {{diagonal}} is an {{angled mirror}} or prism used in telescopes that allows viewing from {{a direction that}} is perpendicular to the usual eyepiece axis. It allows more convenient and comfortable viewing when the telescope is pointed at, or near the zenith (i.e. directly overhead). Also, the resulting image is right side up, but is <b>reversed</b> from <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right.</b> Star diagonals are available in 1.25" [...] and 2" [...] diameters. The 2" [...] diagonals allow larger longer focal length low power 2 inch barrel eyepieces for a greater field of view. Star diagonals come in all price ranges, from as low as thirty dollars up to hundreds of dollars. However, even an expensive star diagonal will deliver poor performance {{if it is not}} in alignment with the optical axis of the telescope. A telescope in perfect collimation will be thrown out of collimation by a misaligned star diagonal and often this misalignment will determine the image quality of the telescope to a larger extent than the surface accuracy of the prism or mirror. Since the mirror or prism of the star diagonal is located nearly at the focal plane of the instrument, surface accuracy of greater that 1/4 wave is more in the line of advertising than any increase in optical performance. A 1/10 wave mirror or prism star diagonal that throws off the collimation of the telescope will perform worse than a 1/2 wave star diagonal that is in proper alignment.|$|R

The source shape (top left corner) was mapped to the target shape (left) by posing descriptor-based functional constraints which do not disambiguate symmetries (i. e. without landmark constraints). By further adding correspondence constraints, we obtain a near isometric map which <b>reverses</b> orientation, mapping <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> (center). The representation allows for algebraic operations on shape maps, so we can subtract this map from the ambivalent map, to retrieve the orientation preserving near-isometry (right). Each column shows the first 20 x 20 block of {{the functional}} map representation (bottom), and {{the action of the}} map by transferring colors from the source shape to the target shape (top). We present a novel representation of maps between pairs of shapes that allows for efficient inference and manipulation. Key to our approach is a generalization of the notion of map that puts in correspondence real-valued functions rather than points on the shapes. By choosing a multi-scale basis for the function space on each shape, such as the eigenfunctions of its Laplace-Beltrami operator, we obtain a representation of a map that is very compact, yet fully suitable for global inference.

40|$|AbstractIn {{children}} with a ventricular septal defect, transseptal blood flow has been demonstrated angiographically to be bidirectional {{in all but the}} smallest defects. To investigate this phenomenon noninvasively, two-dimensional Doppler color flow echocardiography was used in 77 patients (aged 1 day to 15. 5 years, mean 24 months). During isovolumetric contraction, flow was seen from the <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> ventricle in 82 (98 %) of 84 studies. During isovolumetric relaxation, <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> flow was noted in 72 (96 %) of 75 studies. During early diastole in patients with an isolated defect, flow was initially from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>left</b> ventricle and subsequently <b>reversed</b> <b>to</b> become <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>right</b> in 29 (91 %) of 32 studies. In patients with concomitant right ventricular volume overload, flow across the ventricular defect was from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>left</b> ventricle throughout diastole in 30 (86 %) of 35 studies. In each of four patients with d-transposition of the great vessels and each of two patients with I-transposition of the great vessels, blood flow was from the morphologic <b>left</b> ventricle <b>to</b> the morphologic <b>right</b> ventricle during isovolumetric contraction and from the morphologic <b>right</b> ventricle <b>to</b> the morphologic <b>left</b> ventricle during isovolumetric relaxation. These results demonstrate 1) the complex nature of intracardiac shunting in {{children with}} ventricular septal defect as previously shown by angiography; 2) an intrinsic functional difference in the contractile and relaxation properties of the morphologic left and right ventricles; and 3) differences in diastolic blood flow patterns between {{children with a}}n isolated defect and those with a ventricular septal defect and right ventricular volume overload (p = 0. 0001) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of vehicle design, fabrication and testing of the micro class tethered remotely operated vehicle (ROV) for underwater exploration. It will emphasize on the development of tri-thruster ROV. This will be a new type of design where the ROV will have two motors mounted at the front. Its layout is very different from other conventional ROV which have two horizontal motors mounted at the rear. The development accentuate on mechanical approach. The ROV developed will have hydrodynamic features add to it. The prototype is modeled using SOLIDWORKSTM and the further analysis of the model was done using COSMOSFloWorksTM. The quantitative analyses done has determined limiting factor for the ROV as it is desired to be operational in both sea and fresh water for a limited depth. For the fabrication purpose, this project will proceed with PVC pipe as its main component for frame. In methodological section, objective of material selection was to reduce fabrication cost without reducing the performance. The type of onboard control method used simple circuit of double pole double throw (DPDT). Simple circuit were chosen as it is easier to troubleshot and provide more reliability in executing motion compare to complex coding. From COSMOS analysis, the hydrodynamic cover performs very well in decreasing the drag force of developed vehicle. Guided by preliminary result and initial specification, a handmade fabrication will be done to create a prototype to show how this innovative ROV behave underwater, how its drive system response, how the control is functioned and how the motions are perform. The real time testing then runs and the testing bed preferred were surrounding area and control environment. The result was than recorded in video and examination done base on the recorded motion. From real time analysis, the hydrodynamic cover effectively smoothen the prototype motion at underwater and within water surface. The fabricated model can submerge, resurface, move forward and <b>reverse,</b> rotate <b>to</b> <b>left</b> and <b>right.</b> The result of this development will be significantly improved the existing design of ROV and pioneering the future development of remotely operated vehicle for underwater exploration. The fabricated model has installed camera and the first to be equipped with oblique hydrodynamic cover and frontal thruster layout. The development in phrase can be concluded as an innovation of design and invention of layout...|$|R
