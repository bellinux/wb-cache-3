40|$|The <b>Residue</b> <b>on</b> <b>Ignition</b> Test speciˆed in General Tests, Japanese Pharmacopeia is {{a method}} to measure {{the weight of the}} {{residual}} substance not volatilized when the sample is ignited under a constant condition. Generally, this test is in-tended to determine the content of inorganic substances contained as impurities in an organic substance, and, oc-casionally, to determine the amount of inorganic substances contained as components in an organic substance. Our laboratories have adopted this test method for the above two purposes {{in the case of the}} quality control for drug sub-stances, synthetic intermediates, starting materials in the course of drug development. Some validation studies have been conducted for this test in order to clarify the quantitation limit in the case of an application for the former purpose, and trueness and precision in the case of the latter purpose. Consequently, the quantitation limit was determined as around 0. 50 mg. The amount of sample should be determined based on this quantitation limit (mg) and the level of quantitation limit (％) or that of speciˆcation limit (％) should be considered from the view point of each testing purpose. The test method was also conˆrmed to have a good trueness and precision as the determination method for an alkaline salt, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salt, of organic compounds, as long as the test is operated with great care not to scatter the content out of crucible during ignition to incineration...|$|E
40|$|An 'open source' {{field-scale}} batch pyrolyser {{was designed}} and constructed to produce biochar, which is the solid residue formed when biomass thermally decomposes {{in the absence of}} oxygen. The design approach was focused on simplicity for the intended target user, a hobby farmer. This is achieved in a batch process, where temperature ramp rates, gas flows and the end-point are controlled. Solids handling is only required {{at either end of the}} process. LPG is used as the initial heating source and later as the ignition source when pyrolysis gases are recycled. A mathematical model formulation of the process was developed to predict the proportions of products produced as well as the time taken to achieve complete pyrolysis. Reaction kinetics are complex and not fully understood. In this model, simplifications were taken to provide guidelines for the reactor design as well as the effects of moisture on the process efficiencies. The quality performance of the 'open source' pyrolyser was determined by comparing its biochar to that produced in a lab scale gas fired drum pyrolyser. Parameters varied on the lab drum pyrolyser were highest treatment temperature in the range 300 to 700 °C, sample size, moisture content and grain direction for Pinus radiata. The properties that were investigated are elemental composition (C, H, N, S), proximate analysis (moisture, volatile matter and fixed carbon) and char yield (% wt/wt). The ash content was determined by <b>residue</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition.</b> For the lab scale experiments, it was found with increasing peak temperature that yield, volatile matter and hydrogen to carbon ratio decrease. Yield was unaffected by moisture, size and grain direction. The design of the pilot reactor followed the principle observed with particle size that, in order to get maximum residence time of the vapour and tar in the reactor, the reactor was designed with a perforated core so that the vapours have a tortuous path of travel. This design also meant that heat and mass transfer occurred in the same direction, from the outer wall to the perforated core. In comparison to the lab scale pyrolyser, the same trends were observed in regards to temperature. High yields of 29. 7 wt % and 28. 8 wt % were obtained from wood with an initial moisture content of 21. 9 wt % and 60. 4 wt % respectively, confirming yield is unaffected by moisture. Mass and energy balances were conducted on both the lab scale and pilot scale pyrolysers. For every kilogram of carbon in LPG used on the lab scale pyrolyser, an average of 0. 25 kilograms of carbon is produced at 700 °C. Based on the optimum run for the pilot scale, for every kilogram of carbon in LPG used, 2. 6 kilograms of carbon is produced at 700 °C...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Malaria {{has been}} {{responsible}} for the deaths of thousands of people annually and is considered one of the biggest health challenges globally. In order to ensure that patients in malaria affected areas receive products of suitable quality, it is important that effective pharmacopoeial monographs for these medicines are available for distinguishing between good and inferior quality products, prior to distribution to the public. With artemether and lumefantrine forming part of the current, most effective treatment regimes against malaria, the development of monographs for the lumefantrine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (a monograph already exists for the artemether API) and for artemether/lumefantrine combination dosage forms, has become a high priority to the World Health Organization (WHO) for inclusion in the International Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Int.). During this study, both APIs were also evaluated for the possible occurrence of polymorphism, in order to provide manufacturers with additional information regarding identified polymorphic forms. During the polymorphic screening of artemether, the physico-chemical properties of the different recrystallisation products demonstrated results similar to those of the raw materials tested. Although the polymorphic screening of lumefantrine revealed no new polymorphic forms, it was found that the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were influenced by preferred orientation and that the variation in melting points obtained, correlated well with differences observed in particle size and/or morphology. It therefore illustrated the importance for manufacturers of lumefantrine to consider the possibility of the melting point being influenced by crystal habit and particle size, and would it be advisable not to characterise and identify lumefantrine, based on the melting point alone. The physico-chemical analytical results obtained during the polymorphic screening of artemether and lumefantrine furthermore revealed that only one crystal packing for each API exists. Methods for the two new monographs were developed in accordance with WHO requirements and were validated compliant with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on the validation of methods. The methods developed for lumefantrine during this study, included the following: The chosen identification tests comprised a standalone infrared method, or as an alternative a combination of ultraviolet spectrophotometry (UV-VIS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) methods. The standard pharmacopoeial methods for heavy metals, sulfated ash (<b>residue</b> <b>on</b> <b>ignition)</b> and loss on drying were proposed. For the determination of the related substances (impurities from synthesis and degradation products), a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and a newly developed TLC method were included, with the monograph allowing a choice. Furthermore, a titration with perchloric acid was decided upon for the assay of the lumefantrine API. An alternative UV spectrophotometric assay method (not included in the Ph. Int. monograph) was developed using a UV spectrophotometric method where the A 1 %/ 1 cm value in methanol was established as 331. 4. For the monographs of artemether/lumefantrine tablets and powder for oral suspension two identification tests were developed for use in combination, namely TLC and HPLC methods. A TLC limit test was developed for the related substances of artemether, which proved to be less stable than lumefantrine. The developed method made the simultaneous assaying of artemether and lumefantrine, using HPLC, possible. The proud outcome of this research project was the adoption of the final proposed monographs for the lumefantrine API and artemether/lumefantrine combination dosage forms, during the 42 nd meeting of the WHO’s Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations (July 2008, Geneva), for inclusion in the Ph. Int. The methods for identification, assay and related substances of the artemether/lumefantrine tablets monograph were verified by an independent surveillance study, during which the results demonstrated that the methods were easily transferable between quality control (QC) laboratories. During this study, the proposed monograph was used to test 108 batches of artemether/lumefantrine tablets, sourced by the WHO. The generated results were able to identify batches of substandard quality and thus proved the monograph methods to be suitable for distinguishing between suitable or inferior quality, and even counterfeit batches. The conclusion that could be drawn from the outcomes of this study was that the use of the methods in these monographs during quality control testing, should indeed result in a reduction in substandard and/or counterfeit products being distributed to the public, thus in reducing the number of malaria related deaths and the escalating occurrence of resistance against antimalarial treatment regimes.

Spring mineral N and potentially available N were measured in an arable field together with gravimetric water content, loss <b>on</b> <b>ignition,</b> crop yield, percentages of sand, silt, and clay, and elevation to describe their spatial variation geostatistically. The areas with a larger clay content had larger values of mineral N, potentially available N, loss <b>on</b> <b>ignition</b> and gravimetric water content, and the converse was true for the areas with more sandy soil. The results suggest that the spatial relations between mineral N and loss <b>on</b> <b>ignition,</b> gravimetric water content, soil texture, elevation and crop yield, and between potentially available N and loss <b>on</b> <b>ignition</b> and silt content could be used to indicate their spatial patterns.
