50|$|Another way of fitting more balls into a <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is by {{radially}} 'fracturing' (slicing) one of {{the rings}} all the way through, loading the balls in, re-assembling the fractured portion, and then using a pair of steel bands to hold the fractured ring sections together in alignment.

40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} machine tools is {{critical}} in determining their productivity and {{the accuracy of the}} finished work piece. The headstock of the machine tool has the greatest impact on these parameters. The tool or work-piece holder must meet specific demands for maximum speed and rigidity. These two parameters are variable, but always in contradiction, and depend mainly on the Spindle-Bearings System (SBS). In this context, SBS are increasingly being produced in combination with roller bearings, and with various combinations of <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> This is mainly because the <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> allow groupings of different combinations to achieve the optimal compromise between the required maximum speed and the desired stiffness of the SBS. Stiffness, especially in <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> is not constant but dependent on the magnitude of the load. The SBS is a statically indeterminate system, and an accurate calculation of the bearings and its nodes, as well as the whole system, is only possible using iterative methods. The exact calculation of SBS stiffness cannot be achieved without the use of powerful computers and high-quality software. Selection of the optimal configuration is achieved by analyzing a number of potential, alternative SBS solutions. The exact calculation {{of a large number of}} variants, and manufacturing their prototypes, is time consuming and very expensive. The solution is to quickly determine, with sufficient reliability, the parameters of the bearing nodes, which are influenced by the <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> It is only in the final variation that an accurate calculation using iterative methods can be made, followed by subsequent production of a prototype for verification.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The primary objective of the research project was to determine through rotordynamic computer modeling and experimental testing, the radial stiffness of a symmetric angular contact ball bearing for static and dynamic misalignment under various axial loads. A bearing test rig was specifically designed and manufactured to test the angular contact ball bearing. The test rig maximum speed was 20, 000 rpm with the ability to apply 1000 lb axially. Testing was conducted for thrust loads of 0, 156 N, 356 N, 1, 148 N and 1, 962 N. Static angular misalignment between the inner and outer race ranged between 0. 75 mil/in. and 3. 0 -mil/in. misalignment. The dynamic misalignment testing was performed with a negative and a positive taper in the bearing support system. There were two different testing methods utilized to determine the radial stiffness of the ball bearing: 1) eigenvalue frequency analysis and 2) critical speed transition tests. Each method used experimental measurements in conjunction with computer simulation to determine the <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> spring rate. The eigenvalue frequency analysis was only implemented to the 0. 75 mil/in. misalignment case due to the poor vibration transmissibility through the ball bearing for the larger cases of angular misalignment. Experimental measurements of the static pull tests, forward eigenvalues, backward eigenvalues, backward critical speeds, and forward critical speeds were matched with XLTRC model simulations to determine the stiffness values for each of the cases. Eigenvalue data was collected with a Hewlett Packard Spectrum Dynamic Signal Analyzer and critical speed transitions were monitored with ADRE, a condition monitoring data acquisitions system. Results include critical speed maps, Campbell Diagrams, Bode response plots, waterfall plots, and spectrum plots. Both forward and backward critical speeds were measured during the experiments. The effect of increasing static angular misalignment increased the <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> spring rate. Both the positive taper and negative taper cases indicated a softening effect when compared to the aligned (no taper) stiffness values. Significant nonlinearity was observed in the deflection and vibration of the test rig. The rotating system also revealed signs of bifurcation for higher degrees of static misalignment. The negative taper configuration generated significant sub-synchronous vibrations excited at the forward and backward eigenvalues...|$|E
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} {{allows the}} fabrication of small mechanical systems in silicon using standard micro-fabrication pro- cesses. MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating rotary bearings using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. Ball cages or retainers are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> with an integrated ball cage, a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the solder bond in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the solder bond. However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM. The test results for all of the bearings designs presented here show that the devices exhibit stable operation at low to moderately high speeds. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: surface originated flaking and subsurface originated flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface originated flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in surface originated flaking about microstructural change. In this study, surface originated flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and <b>radial</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent originated flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to surface originated flaking was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the surface originated flaking compared with subsurface originated flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that surface originated flaking occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the surface originated flaking shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the surface originated flaking than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between surface originated flaking and subsurface originated flaking...|$|E

Using CADD design {{as a replacement}} of the manual drafting method is {{only a fraction of}} its potential. The work that is done repeatedly can be in most cases performed automatically through customization. Customization of standard CAD packages can significantly increase productivity. The custom functions and programs can extend the capabilities of CAD packages to perform a wide range of drafting tasks. The paper discusses a customization strategy intended to facilitate completion of some repetitive drafting tasks in mechanical drafting process. One way to extend the capabilities of AutoCAD is by creating and using blocks. Blocks are useful for creating repeated content, such as standard components. The Dynamic Blocks feature enables user to modify blocks by adding parameters, actions, constraints that increase the versatility and power of the blocks. The paper presents two examples in creating and using dynamic blocks in order to save time and get maximum benefits of AutoCAD features.

An optical encoder is coupled to measure rotational motion of the piston within the cylinder. In use, the apparatus is mounted in a testing machine and a specimen to be tested is secured at one end to the free end of the piston rod and at its other end to the mounting block of the testing machine.
