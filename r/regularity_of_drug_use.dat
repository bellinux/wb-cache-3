40|$|Recent studies {{investigating}} the labor-market effects <b>of</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> have consistently found a positive relation between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and earnings. These analyses have, however, ignored the potential relationship between <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and human-capital formation. This paper examines the effect <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> during adolescence on formal educational attainment using a sample {{drawn from the}} National Longitudinal Survey Youth Cohort. The probability <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is estimated across racial groups according to three categories; <b>use</b> <b>of</b> any illicit <b>drug,</b> <b>use</b> including hard <b>drugs,</b> and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> only marijuana. Fitted values for the probability <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are calculated and entered into a regression framework to estimate the number of school years completed. The empirical results indicate that all three categories <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are associated with significant negative impacts on educational attainment after controlling for individual differences in personal endowments and socioeconomic characteristics. On average, adolescent <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is found to reduce eventual educational attainment by about 1 year, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that previous studies that focus only on the direct effects <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on earnings may reflect a statistical bias that leads to an overstatement of the positive effects <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on earnings. ...|$|R

The Chi-Square test, Fisher's Exact and a significance level of 5 % {{were used for the}} analyzes. Results: The prevalence of suspected patients was 6. 7 %. The prevalence ratio of administration of opioid analgesics 'if necessary' is twice higher among patients suspected <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> compared to patients not suspected <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (p = 0. 037).

40|$|Objective: Atypical {{sequences}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> progression {{are thought}} to have important implications for the development of substance dependence. The extent to which this assumption holds for South African populations is unknown. This paper attempts to address this gap by examining the prevalence and correlates of atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> progression among South Africans. Method: Data on substance use and other mental health disorders from a nationally representative sample of 4351 South Africans were analysed. Weighted cross tabulations were used to estimate prevalence and correlates of atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> progression. Results: Overall, 12. 2 % of the sample reported atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> progression. The most common violation was the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> extra-medical <b>drugs</b> prior to alcohol and tobacco. Gender was significantly associated with atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> with the risk pattern varying by the type <b>of</b> <b>drug.</b> None <b>of</b> the anxiety or mood disorders were associated with atypical patterns of <b>use.</b> Atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> were not associated with increased risk for a lifetime substance use disorder. Conclusion: Atypical patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> initiation seem more prevalent in South Africa compared to other countries. The early <b>use</b> <b>of</b> extra-medical <b>drugs</b> is common, especially among young women. Drug availability and social environmental factors may influence patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> The findings have important implications for prevention initiatives and future research.

Materials and methods: To determine the type of temperament, the presence and intensity of the syndrome of emotional burnout and capacity for empathy therapists and cardiologists were asked to fill {{in a number of}} questionnaires. Each doctor had a group of patients contacting by telephone for a year after the discharge from the hospital. During the telephone contact, the patients were asked about the continuation of their therapy recommended in the hospital, the <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> therapy, the frequency of absence, and the assessment of a physician by the patients. Results: 35 questionnaires were suitable for interpretation. Through one year after the discharge from the hospital it was able to contact with 147 patients, 18. 4 % (27) of patients completely stopped the treatment by recommended <b>drugs.</b> Positive assessment <b>of</b> physicians was associated with the continuation of the therapy by recommended <b>drugs</b> and <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> taking (p= 0, 03). Patients assessed physicians positively more often in cases of low level of emotional state, high level of depersonalization (cynicism) and the reduction of personal accomplishment (feeling of professional inefficiency) in a doctor.

The researchers modelled non-adherence to HAART with a set of binary indicators <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> (model I) or comprehensive patterns obtained with a cluster analysis (model II). RESULTS: In model 1, heroin <b>use,</b> injection <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> and cocaine/amphetamine/ecstasy use were not significant predictors of poor adherence in contrast with nicotine dependence, cannabis use, and amyl nitrate use. In model II, non-adherence to HAART was more prevalent among profiles characterised by alcohol abuse and multiple addictions, including nicotine dependence and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> various illicit <b>drugs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine dependence, cannabis use, and amyl nitrate use are associated with non-adherence only if they are embedded in <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> patterns characterised by alcohol abuse or heroin use.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s {{there has been}} a great deal of public concern about a new form <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> This concern has arisen from the {{practice}} <b>of</b> people <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> as an adjunct to dancing at events commonly known as 'raves'. This dance drug phenomenon is most closely associated with a drug called 'ecstasy' (usually 3, 4 -Methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine or MDMA). It is usually assumed that many of the hundreds of thousands of young people who attend raves use ecstasy. Beyond this assumption however, little is known about the patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> among 'ravers'. This thesis will examine in detail the relationships between the 'rave scene' and changing patterns <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> This was done using data from 135 dance drug scene event attendees (ravers) collected during detailed interviews conducted by the author. It was found that <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> related to dance events was not restricted to MDMA, but included a variety of other substances used in different settings.

Qualitative methodology was used to collect the data. In-depth interviews were carried out with 29 prisoners in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin. The sample profile describes socio-demographic background; drug-using status; drug-using history; criminal history; and drug-crime relationship conditions of prisoners. Other than in designated drug free wings, respondents percieved Mountjoy to be characterised by a drug culture and that the overall atmosphere of the prison was affected by <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Respondents with a history <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> identified perceived benefits <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> {{as a means of}} alleviating problems such as boredom and depression.

40|$|The {{threat to}} human health posed by {{antibiotic}} resistance is of growing concern. Many commensal and pathogenic organisms have developed resistance to well established and newer antibiotics.

Using population genetic methods and epidemiological observations, we report an analysis of the influence of the selective pressure imposed by the volume <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> on temporal changes in resistance. Analytical expressions are derived to delineate key relationships between resistance and drug consumption. The analyses indicate that the time scale for emergence of resistance under a constant selective pressure is typically much shorter than the decay time after cessation or decline in the volume <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> and that significant reductions in resistance require equally significant reductions in drug consumption.
