40|$|Extensive {{and rich}} Cu-Ag sulfide {{mineralization}} occurs in Poland across the {{contact between the}} Upper Permian Zechstein restricted marine sequence and the Lower Permian <b>Rotliegende</b> continental volcanic and clastic sequence. Geologic {{evidence suggests that the}} mineralization was formed during late diagenesis when metalliferous brines migrated through the <b>Rotliegende,</b> leaching metals from the volcanic detritus, and up the flanks of basement highs, possibly along fracture porosity, to the pyritic Kupferschiefer and Zechstein limestone above. Thick evaporites in the lower Zechstein preclude a vertical flow-through model, but metal zoning attitudes suggest that the brines overturned where the <b>Rotliegende</b> pinched out against he highs and moved laterally along the base of the Zechstein toward the basin centers, presumably to sink back down into the <b>Rotliegende,</b> completing a convection cell.

40|$|International audiencePermian <b>Rotliegende</b> {{sandstone}} cores {{were collected}} from an area of about 14, 800 km 2 (! 5710 mi 2) mostly to the eastsoutheast {{of the city of}} Bremen in northern Germany, at depths between 4596 and 5330 m (15, 079 - 17, 487 ft). The separated size fractions (< 0. 2, 0. 2 - 1. 0, and 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm) consist of illite (90 - 100 %) with small to minute amounts of chlorite and detectable quartz and feldspars in the coarser fractions. Scanning electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic observations showed two types of illite morphologies: flakes coating detrital framework minerals and laths and fibers invading the pore space. The data points of most size fractions fit two isochrons, with slopes providing ages of 191 ± 8 and 178 ± 1 Ma, with initial 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratios reasonably close to the atmospheric value. Microthermometric fluid-inclusion determinations in quartz and calcite characterize two types of percolating fluids: a highly saline (19 % NaCl equivalent) fluid at variable temperatures depending on the reservoirs (185 to 150 °C) and a slightly saline one (2. 6 % NaCl equivalent) again at varied temperatures (170 to 145 °C), also depending on the locations. These temperatures are higher than paleotemperatures calculated {{on the basis of a}} present-day burial gradient of 30. 5 °C/km, therefore favoring hydrothermal illitization, with the oldest illite crystallizing at a generally higher temperature than that of the younger illite...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation constitutes a reservoir characterization and tertiary recovery {{improvement of the}} Weber Formation, northwest Colorado. The Weber formation was deposited in an ancient desert environment and consists of intertonguing eolian dunes and fluvial deposits. Similar reservoirs are increasingly important to the petroleum industry, well known examples are in the <b>Rotliegende</b> in the North Sea oil fields and newly discovered Pennsylvanian strata in Saudi Arabia. This study gives scientists the first example that shows how eolian reservoirs are compartmentalized in three dimensions. Previous studies have concentrated on anisotropy in the eolian sands caused by the foreset dips of the eolian dunes, but these studies assumed that the eolian sands were relatively continuous and internally homogenous. This study shows that soils, ponds and discontinuous fluvial deposits can effectively compartmentalize a reservoir unit. ^ The dissertation consists of three studies, each addressed in a separate chapter, and each {{of which will be}} submitted to different scientific journals for publication. The first paper describes the different facies in the Weber sandstone and shows which form reservoir and which are potential barriers to fluid flow. The different depositional facies in the core were classified as a function of their depositional environment. Cross-sections and depositional models were developed to characterize the environment of deposition during the Lower and Upper Weber Formation ages. Finally, the different depositional facies were classified as a function of their potential reservoir quality. The depositional model allows us to extrapolate the geometries of reservoir and non-reservoir sandstones in three dimensions. ^ The second paper used well-logs and rock physics to quantify the permeabilities and porosities of the different depositional facies as a function of their rock properties. And correlated the potential reservoir and non-reservoir facies to well logs. This allows scientists to infer depositional environment and reservoir quality in other similar oil fields. Secondly, reservoir and non-reservoir rocks were distinguished based on their compressional and shear wave velocities. This allows scientists to infer reservoirs on seismic images, even where no wells are present. Those velocities have been employed to calculate compressional to shear wave ratios, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, and acoustic and elastic impedance, which help to distinguish the rocks bearing oil from the water saturated rocks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Analytical {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (ATEM) was used to obtain chemical analyses of single illite crystals from Upper Carboniferous reservoir sandstones ofthe Bothamsall Oilfield, East Midlands, UK, and from <b>Rotliegendes</b> (Permian) sandstones of the North Sea. All samples {{were found to be}} highly aluminous, with only minor Mg and Fe, and to have near-ideal dioctahedral sheet otals. No significant var!ation in chemical composition of illite was found within the Bothamsall reservoir rocks, irrespective of paragenesis or strati-graphic horizon. Similar esults were obtained from the <b>Rotliegendes</b> samples. Variation was found, however, between Bothamsall and <b>Rotliegendes</b> analyses populations. The <b>Rotliegendes</b> illites were distinctly more K-rich, which is the result of greater charge deficiency in the octahedral sheet. These results indicate that all the illite in both reservoirs precipitated in equilibrium with the reservoir pore-fluid. Furthermore, they imply that the physico-chemical composition fthe pore-fluid id not evolve significantly between the different iUite generations in the Bothamsall samples. These data, when compared with published analyses of authigenic illite, indicate that he compositional field for illite in sandstones is restricted incomparison with that of illite in mudrocks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Permian Basin is {{the main}} target of {{exploration}} in western Poland. Porous <b>Rotliegendes</b> sandstone and two Zechstein carbonate formations {{are the most important}} reservoirs. Every depositional system includes diVerent lithofacies, and interrelations create patterns of trap/reservoir and sealing horizons. Combi-nation traps, with both structural and facial elements involved in their closure, create a comparatively high risk for exploration. Palaeogeographic analysis based on 3 D seismic data presents opportunities for improved interpretation leading to a significant reduction of risk in exploration and development drilling. There is no direct information in 3 D seismic data, but they allow us to reproduce the palaeogeography and successive stages of structural redevelopment by means of flattened seismic sections and construction of the corresponding maps, i. e. pseudo-palaeogeographical maps...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Subsurface 3 D {{geological}} {{models of}} aquifer and seal rock systems from two contrasting analogue sites {{have been created}} {{as the first step}} in an investigation into methodologies for geological storage of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers. Development of the models illustrates the utility of an integrated approach using digital techniques and expert geological knowledge to further geological understanding. The models visualize a faulted, gently dipping Permo-Triassic succession in Lincolnshire and a complex faulted and folded Devono-Carboniferous succession in eastern Scotland. The Permo-Triassic is present in the Lincolnshire model to depths of 2 km OD, and includes the aquifers of the Sherwood Sandstone and <b>Rotliegendes</b> groups. Model-derived thickness maps test and refine Permian palaeogeography, such as the location of a carbonate reef and its associated seaward slope, and the identification of aeolian dunes. Analysis of borehole core samples established average 2 D porosity values for the <b>Rotliegendes</b> (16 %) and Sherwood Sandstone (20 %) groups, and the Zechstein (5 %) and Mercia Mudstone (< 10 %) groups, which are favourable for aquifer and seal units respectively. Core sample analysis has revealed a complex but well understood diagenetic history. Re-interpretation of newly reprocessed seismic data in eastern Scotland has significantly reduced interpretative uncertainty of aquifer and seal units at depths of up to 6 km OD in a complex faulted and folded Devonian-Carboniferous succession. Synthesis of diverse data in the 3 D geological model defines a set of growth folds and faults indicative of active Viséan to Westphalian dextral-strike slip, with no major changes in structural style throughout the Carboniferous, in contrast to some published tectonic models. Average 2 D porosity values are 14 - 17 % in aquifer units and < 2 % in the seal unit, with a ferroan dolomite cement occluding porosity at depth...|$|R
50|$|To {{the south}} it is bounded by the Vindelician Ridge (Vindelizische Schwelle) and, {{to the west}} and northwest, by the Armorican and London-Brabant Massifs. To the north the basin is bordered by the {{highlands}} of Ireland and Scotland, which were then still connected to the North American continent. To the east the basin was defined by the East European Platform, to the northeast by the Fennoscandinavian Shield (Scandinavia and Finland). The sedimentation began in the <b>Rotliegendes</b> with continental depositions. Later, during the Zechstein and Muschelkalk the region was largely flooded by the sea. Bunter sandstone and Keuper are again largely of continental origin. But even in these rocks the perimeter regions have marine influences, short incursions of the sea also reached the centre of the basin in northern Germany.|$|R
30|$|The Norwegian-Danish Basin {{contains}} a thick Upper Permian–Mesozoic succession of sedimentary rocks (Fig.  1). The basin {{was formed in}} Late Carboniferous–Early Permian time by crustal stretching, succeeded by deposition of <b>Rotliegendes</b> coarse-grained clastic sediments and later by Zechstein salts (Stemmerik et al. 1987; Nielsen 2003; Vejbæk 1989, 1997; Michelsen and Nielsen 1993; Pharaoh et al. 2010). The Permian period followed basinal subsidence governed primarily by thermal cooling and local faulting, and the Triassic sediments include a succession of sandstones, mudstones, carbonates and evaporites, whereas the Jurassic strata are dominated by mudstones and sandstones (Berthelsen 1980; Michelsen and Clausen 2002; Nielsen 2003). The Mesozoic deposition is influenced by differential uplift across the basin and occasionally, halokinesis has resulted in local deviations from the regional uplift trend (Japsen et al. 2007). The regional trend points to gradually increasing uplift toward the northeast. The Cretaceous sediments encompass limestones, mudstones, sandstones, marls and chalks. The Cenozoic succession comprises a series of primarily mudstones, sandstones and limestones.|$|R

The molybdenum content of the vegetation is determined by the amount of this element in the soil and its pH-value. The weathering soils of granite, porphyry, gneiss and <b>Rotliegendes</b> produce a molyb denum-rich vegetation. Significantly poorer in Mo is the vegetation on loess, diluvial sands, alluvial riverside soils and especially on Keuper and Muschelkalk weathering soils, which produce legumes and, e. g. cauliflower with molybdenum deficiency symptoms.

Helicopters were first used to transport workers. Larger gas finds followed in 1966—Leman Bank, Indefatigable and Hewett, but by 1968 companies had lost interest in further exploration of the British sector, a result of a ban on gas exports and low prices offered by the only buyer, British Gas.

50|$|The {{rocks in}} the Nahe region are {{predominantly}} of Cisuralian (early Permian) age {{and part of the}} <b>Rotliegendes.</b> At that time, an impetuous volcanism appeared in the region. Huge deposits of the reddish volcanic rock Rhyolite and of the more alkaline volcanic rock Andesite were left. The valleys of the Nahe and its tributaries have been being formed since 2.6 million years ago during the Quaternary, the geologically latest period, as a result of ground heaving of the surrounding mountains of Hunsrück and North Palatine Uplands. This led to a steep decline of all waters and hence to strong erosion activities. Particularly strong erosion occurred in warmer melting periods during the ice ages, when tundra climate reigned and the soil was not protected by a dense cover of vegetation. Depending on the underground, narrow gorges with cliffy precipices arose in areas with hard volcanic rocks or wide gentle valleys with flood plains in areas with soft sedimentary deposits. The frequent change between both forms is charming along the Nahe.|$|R

40|$|Significant {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} occur in so-called “barren red-beds ” in several regions around the world. Although red-beds occur throughout the geological timescale, examples with an economic interest are the Late Carboniferous, Permian and Early Triassic of Europe (Barren Measures, <b>Rotliegendes,</b> Bunter; Doornenbal and Stevenson, 2010), the Triassic of the United States, and the Permian–Carboniferous of the Middle East. These sediments are generally deposited in non-marine environments under arid climate conditions. In terrestrial basins, biostratigraphic analysis of plant microfossils (pollen and spores) is often effective in constraining static geological models. Unfortunately, such organic-walled microfossils are not preserved in red-bed deposits due to oxidation, hampering stratigraphic correlation on both local (field) and regional scale. In our research, a group of biogenic siliceous microfossils, termed phytoliths, has been applied as biostratigraphic tool in the Permian–Carboniferous red-bed sequences. Phytoliths, or biogenic silica particles (BSPs), originate in the cells of higher land plants. After organic matter decomposition, phytoliths can be preserved as siliceous bodies.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{relationship}} between porosity and burial depth of sandstone reservoirs is complex. It depends on primary porosity, which {{is related to}} grain-size and depositional process and also on the porosity gradient (the change in porosity with depth) which, in most cases, is linear. This relationship may be expressed as: ~b u = 4 ~ °-G. D, where ~b u is the porosity at depth D below surface, 4 ~ e is the primary depositional porosity, and G is the porosity gradient in % porosity per 1000 ft (305 m). Porosity gradients decrease with increasing quartz content, abnormal pressures, and {{in the presence of}} hydrocarbons. They increase with increasing geothermal gradient. There are at present insufficient data to quantify these relationships. Empirically derived porosity gradients for North Sea <b>Rotliegendes,</b> Jurassic and Palaeocene reservoir sandstones are 2. 2, 2. 6 and 2. 9 per cent per 1000 ft (305 m) respectively.

5000|$|In the Permian {{geological}} period (about 296-251 {{million years}} ago) the first sandstone formations, some 100 metres thick, were {{deposited in the}} area of today's Palatinate Forest; in particular, the rock units of the <b>Rotliegendes</b> and the Zechstein (about 256-251 million years ago) are important. At the beginning of the Germanic Triassic, i.e. from the Lower {{to the beginning of the}} Middle Triassic, there was (about 251-243 million years ago) a desert-like climate, so that as a result of further depositions of sand, rock layers of up to 500 metres thickness were formed. This led inter alia, through the addition of iron oxide, to a variable colouration of the rock strata - hence the name [...] "bunter" [...] sandstone (bunter being German for [...] "coloured") - and, depending on the type and binding of the material, (clay-bound sandstone as opposed to silicified quartz sandstone) to the formation of rock layers of different hardness. This resulted in the subgroups of lower, middle and upper bunter sandstone. These bunter sandstone formations were buried by various types of sediments in the adjacent sections of muschelkalk (243-235 million years ago) and keuper (234-200 million years ago), and also during the Jurassic (200-142 million years ago) and Cretaceous (142-66 million years ago).|$|R

Because the formations of the Zechstein, for example, the Annweiler and Speyerbach beds, consist more of fine-grained sandstones with clayey binding and shales and therefore have a softer consistency, this material could be more easily carried awayl leaving the older rocks of the Zechstein and <b>Rotliegendes</b> exposed. This resulted in erosion surfaces and broad valleys, as are particularly characteristic of the northeastern Wasgau, for example, in Gossersweiler and Völkersweiler, also in Hauenstein, Busenberg or Fischbach bei Dahn. At the same time, parts of the Lower Bunter Sandstone, the so-called Trifels and Rehberg beds remained, because they mostly consist of harder quartz sandstone and are therefore particularly resistant to weathering and erosion. The micro-relief of the Wasgau was developed during the Neogene period (23.8 to 2.8 million years ago), and especially the Quaternary period (2.8 to 0.01 million years ago), as a result of erosion, that is characterized by diversely-shaped, often conical and isolated hills with bizarre rock formations (the Wasgau Rock Country or Wasgau Felsenland). This rock country extends from Annweiler in the northeast roughly to the stream of the Falkensteiner Bach at Phillipsburg in the southwest and forms the actual core area of the Wasgau.|$|R
