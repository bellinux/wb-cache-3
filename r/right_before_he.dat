Midway through the fourth quarter, the LSU offense crossed the 50-yard line for the first time of the game only to be pushed back to the 50 after Dont'a Hightower sacked Jordan Jefferson on a fourth down play to give possession back to Alabama. On that possession, the Crimson Tide scored the only touchdown of the game on a 34-yard Trent Richardson run to make the final score 21–0.|$|E

5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|The old king's estrangement {{from his}} three daughters {{from his first}} {{marriage}} (Princesses Louise, Stéphanie, and Clémentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls. An Austrian newspaper claimed that <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter. After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million francs, although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated. The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared. A trust of $10,000,000 the king had placed in Caroline and their two sons' names became a target of the princesses; they and the Belgian government argued that the trust formed part of Leopold's private estate, and thus all three girls and the government had a right to their share, as its funds had derived from the Congo Free State. The Belgian government's lawsuit succeeded, allowing them to collect the entire trust, but it also diminished the share the princesses received (as each collected a comparatively meager $1,000,000). Belgian statesman Emile Vandervelde later charged in an open letter that Leopold had given Caroline $6,000,000 worth of Congo bonds which had been found to be previously missing when Belgium annexed the colony.|$|E
25|$|In the film, where Harry and Hermione have {{travelled}} back in {{time and}} are hiding outside of Hagrid's hut, it is heavily implied that Dumbledore somehow knows that they are there, as he distracts the other characters at key moments or slows down the proceedings (such as by suggesting that he sign Buckbeak's execution order as well, then after Fudge agrees he says it will take some time as he has an extremely long name), which allows Harry and Hermione time to free Buckbeak unseen. In the book, Dumbledore merely comments that the executioner must sign the order, <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> is about to leave the cabin to execute Buckbeak.|$|E

In the fourth quarter, they drove 67 yards and scored with George's 5-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter, while the Cowboys lost any chance of a comeback due to two more costly turnovers. First they drove inside the Vikings 20-yard line, but linebacker Ed McDaniel forced a fumble from receiver Jason Tucker <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could cross the goal line and the ball rolled through the end zone for a touchback.

25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{investigate}} {{the death of}} a 14-year-old boy found dead in a hospital waiting room. The victim, Percy Howell, appeared to suffer sustained blows to the head from a blunt object but waited days before seeking treatment. Although initially suspicious of the boy's cold and uncaring father (Dan Moran), a devout Christian who makes antisemitic remarks at Munch, the detectives eventually question another teen (Gavin Goren) who spent time with Howell <b>right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died. After convincing the gullible teen that the copy machine was actually an [...] "electrolyte neutron magnetic scanner" [...] that could detect lies, they learn Howell was killed by Colin Dietz (Joe Fersedi), the teenage leader of a gang called the Zaps, with a baseball bat. Munch and Bolander arrest Dietz, who says he loved Howell like a brother and the beating was an initiation. Bolander is deeply disturbed by Dietz's cold casualness in discussing the murder. Later, Bolander talks to a bartender (John Waters) about his divorce, and the episode ends with Bolander drinking alone at the bar, quietly singing an Elvis Presley song.|$|E
500|$|Inspired {{partially}} by Debra, {{and partially}} by {{his desire to}} be a better family man than Arthur, Dexter considers giving up killing people. After convincing his wife Rita (Julie Benz) to go safely out of town, Dexter searches for Arthur, eventually tracking him down and capturing him. Dexter insists he is not like Arthur, but Arthur insists they are both the same. <b>Right</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> is killed with a framing hammer, Arthur tells Dexter [...] "It's already over." [...] Disposing of Arthur's body on his boat afterwards, Dexter comes to realize that his love for his family is starting to outweigh his need to kill, and he begins to hope for a future without killing. But upon returning home, he finds a message from Rita that she came home from the airport because she forgot her identification. Dexter returns her phone call, only to find that Rita's cell phone and bags are in the house. Dexter hears Harrison crying in the bathroom and finds Rita dead in the bathtub. Harrison sits in a pool of Rita's blood on the bathroom floor, in the same manner that Dexter was left in a pool of his mother's blood during his youth, which gave Dexter his murderous tendencies.|$|E

During the summer of that year, on 29 July, Porto bought 20% of Deco's economic rights from GestiFute for €2.25 million, plus 5% of Paulo Ferreira and Ricardo Carvalho's economic rights, this price being higher than presumed because the Portuguese team refused a €15 million offer from Barcelona. On 4 April, the same team bought more 15% of Deco's economic rights for €1.25 million, plus 10% of strker Benni McCarthy's rights.
