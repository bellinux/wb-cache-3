40|$|Conventional methods {{supporting}} Java binary security mainly rely on {{the security}} of the hosts Java Virtual Machine (JVM). However, malicious Java binaries keep exploiting the vulnerabilities of JVMs, escaping their sandbox restrictions and allowing attacks on end user systems. Administrators must confront the difficulties and dilemmas brought on by security upgrades. On the other hand, binary rewriting techniques have been advanced to allow users to enforce security policies directly on mobile code. They have the advantage of supporting a richer set of security policies and self-constrained written code. However, the high administrative and performance overhead caused by security configuration and code rewriting have prevented <b>rewriters</b> from becoming a practical security tool. In this paper, we address these problems by integrating binary code <b>rewriters</b> with web caching proxies and build the security system called PB-JARS, a Proxy-based JAva Rewriting System. PB-JARS works as a complimentary system to existing JVM security mechanisms by placing another line of defense between users and their end user systems. It gives system administrators centralized security control and management for mobile code and security policies. We evaluated PB-JARS using a real Java binary traffic model derived from analyzing real web trace records. Our results show that adding binary rewriting to web caching system can be very efficient in improving end host security at low cost...|$|R

40|$|Mediation, like translation, {{may take}} {{different}} forms {{and may be}} classified according to Jakobson’s classic model as intralingual, interlingual or intersemiotic communication. In all three modes of communication, texts essentially become recontextualisations of pre-existing discourses and often {{give rise to a}} chain of other texts, each of which is subject to a certain degree of mediation. Although the bridge-building metaphor is undoubtedly a legitimate way of approaching most forms of mediation, there is increasing evidence in the literature that this is not always the case. The scenario in which mediation operates is much more complex and it is one in which mediators’ compliance or resistance to contextual and socio-cultural factors and prevailing norms in a given point in history play a major role. Attention is increasingly being focussed {{on the nature of the}} rewritings they produce and on how their agency is made manifest. This holds true for rewritings that take place within the same language, across language boundaries and in the growing area of audio-visual translation. Of particular interest in this regard is the broadening of the notion of translation to include other forms of rewriting in which the <b>rewriter’s</b> interventionist role is a central feature. The present volume addresses various forms of translation and rewriting and explores the strategies <b>rewriters</b> use to achieve their goal of rendering the target text accessible to its recipient audience. "Knowing how" to rewrite in English entails developing an awareness of the whys and wherefores of rewriting. Just as knowledge about language leads to awareness of language, which in turn leads to increased efficiency and sensitivity to language, so familiarity with the general principles of translation and rewriting leads to enhanced competence and performance...|$|R
50|$|Pit depth modulation, {{which the}} company later branded MultiLevel Recording (ML), {{is one of many}} {{techniques}} to increase recording densities on conventional CD-optical media. Calimetrics' implementation of pit depth modulation, using modified CD drive electronics but no changes to the pickup-head, increased the quantity of distinguishable recording-marks from 2-levels (used by EFM in CD) to 8 levels. The increase in bit-density had a side benefit of increasing data-transfer rate (at the same rotational-velocity of the disc.) MultiLevel, like most of the other strategies proposed for extending CD capacity, was not backward compatible with CD-ROM technology: 2GB ML R, RW, and ROM disc playing and recording required ML-capable writers and special ML-CD compatible media. However, the cost to build CD <b>rewriters</b> with both ML and CD support was less than that of DVD-recordable technology.|$|R

Unfortunately, specifying such encodings is tedious and error-prone.

Users need only provide the assembly syntax for the instructions for which they want encodings. Derive automatically reverse-engineers instruction encoding knowledge from the assembler by feeding it permutations of instructions and doing equation solving on the output.

In this paper, we consider ontologies described by existential rules (also known as Datalog+/-), a framework that generalizes lightweight description logics. A common approach is to rewrite a conjunctive query w. r. t an ontology into a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) which can be directly evaluated against a database. However, the practicability {{of this approach is}} questionable due to 1) the weak expressivity of classes for which efficient <b>rewriters</b> have been implemented 2) the large size of optimal rewritings using UCQ. We propose to use semi-conjunctive queries (SCQ), which are a restricted form of positive existential formulas, and compute sound and complete rewritings, which are union of SCQ (USCQ).

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring {{is a task}} of {{collecting}} measurements that reflect the state of a system. Administration {{is a collection of}} tasks for control and manipulation of computer systems. Monitoring and Administering computer ResourceS (MARS) in a distributed grid computing environment (i. e. a distributed environment for coordinated resource sharing and problem solving in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations) is an important, expensive, and critical task. We present a novel solution based on applying crosscuts using binary <b>rewriters</b> and an event-based model that allows developers to create non-trivial MARS programs easily and uniformly. Our approach converts low-level API resource calls into system-wide events that MARS programs can monitor. This is accomplished by introducing advice that contains event-generating code at join points in programs that represent computer resources. We categorize low-level resource APIs by imposing a transactional metaphor to simplify the complexity of interactions between resources and to enable reasoning about MARS programs. We report both a case study and simulation that supports the viability of our approach. ...|$|R
