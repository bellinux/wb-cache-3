50|$|Protein {{chemical}} shift <b>re-referencing</b> is a post-assignment process of adjusting the assigned NMR {{chemical shift}}s to match IUPAC and BMRB recommended standards in protein chemical shift referencing. In NMR chemical shifts are normally referenced {{to an internal}} standard that is dissolved in the NMR sample. These internal standards include tetramethylsilane (TMS), 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) and trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP). For protein NMR spectroscopy the recommended standard is DSS, which is insensitive to pH variations (unlike TSP). Furthermore, the DSS 1H signal {{may be used to}} indirectly reference 13C and 15N shifts using a simple ratio calculation 1. Unfortunately, many biomolecular NMR spectroscopy labs use non-standard methods for determining the 1H, 13C or 15N “zero-point” chemical shift position. This lack of standardization makes it difficult to compare chemical shifts for the same protein between different laboratories. It also makes it difficult to use chemical shifts to properly identify or assign secondary structures or to improve their 3D structures via chemical shift refinement. Chemical shift <b>re-referencing</b> offers a means to correct these referencing errors and to standardize the reporting of protein chemical shifts across laboratories.|$|E
40|$|The shared last-level caches in CMPs play an {{important}} role in improving application performance and reducing off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. In order to use LLCs more efficiently, recent research has shown that changing the <b>re-reference</b> prediction on cache insertions and cache hits can significantly improve cache performance. A fundamental challenge, however, is how to best predict the <b>re-reference</b> pattern of an incoming cache line. This paper shows that cache performance can be improved by correlating the <b>re-reference</b> behavior of a cache line with a unique signature. We investigate the use of memory region, program counter, and instruction sequence history based signatures. We also propose a novel Signature-based Hit Predictor (SHiP) to learn the <b>re-reference</b> behavior of cache lines belonging to each signature. Overall, we find that SHiP offers substantial improvements over the baseline LRU replacement and state-of-the-art replacement policy proposals. On average, SHiP improves sequential and multiprogrammed application performance by roughly 10 % and 12 % over LRU replacement, respectively. Compared to recent replacement policy proposals such as Seg-LRU and SDBP, SHiP nearly doubles the performance gains while requiring less hardware overhead...|$|R

50|$|Probabilistic Approach for protein NMR Assignment Validation (PANAV) is a freely {{available}} stand-alone {{program that}} is used for protein chemical shift <b>re-referencing.</b> Chemical shift referencing {{is a problem in}} protein nuclear magnetic resonance as >20% of reported NMR chemical shift assignments appear to be improperly referenced. For certain nuclei (especially 13C and 15N) these referencing issues can cause systematic chemical shift errors of between 1.0 and 2.5 ppm. Chemical shift errors of this magnitue often make it very difficult to compare NMR chemical shift assignments between proteins. It also makes it very hard to structurally interpret chemical shifts (i.e. identify secondary structures or perform chemical shift refinement). Unlike most other chemical shift <b>re-referencing</b> tools PANAV employs a structure-independent protocol. That is, with PANAV {{there is no need to}} know the structure of the protein in advance of correcting any chemical shift referencing errors. This makes PANAV particularly useful for NMR studies involving novel or newly assigned proteins, where the structure has yet to be determined. Indeed, this scenario represents the vast majority of assignment cases in biomolecular NMR. PANAV uses residue-specific and secondary structure-specific chemical shift distributions that were calculated over short (3-6 residue) fragments of correctly referenced proteins (found in RefDB) to identify mis-assigned resonances. More specifically, PANAV compares the initial (i.e. observed) chemical shift assignments to the expected chemical shifts based on their local sequence and expected/predicted secondary structure. In this way, PANAV is able to identify and re-reference mis-referenced chemical shift assignments. PANAV can also identify potentially mis-assigned resonances as well. PANAV has been extensively tested and compared against a large number of existing <b>re-referencing</b> or mis-assignment detection programs (most of which are structure-based). These assessments indicate that PANAV is equal to or superior to existing approaches.|$|E
5000|$|The actual {{calculation}} of the RCI involves several additional steps including the smoothing of secondary shifts over several adjacent residues, the use of neighboring residue corrections, chemical shift <b>re-referencing,</b> gap filling, chemical shift scaling and numeric adjustments to prevent divide-by-zero problems. 13C, 15 N and 1H secondary chemical shifts are then scaled {{to account for the}} characteristic resonance frequencies of these nuclei and to provide numeric consistency among different parts of the protocol. Once these scaling corrections have been done, the RCI is calculated. The ‘‘end-effect correction’’ can also be applied at this point. The last step of the protocol involves smoothing the initial set of RCI values by three-point averaging.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} study, a {{chemical}} shift <b>re-referencing</b> program (PANAV) was {{run on a}} total of 2421 BMRB entries that had a sufficient proportion of (>80%) of assigned chemical shifts to perform a robust chemical shift reference correction. A total of 243 entries were found with 13Cα shifts offset by more than 1.0 ppm, 238 entries with 13Cβ shifts offset of more than 1.0 ppm, 200 entries with 13C’ shifts offset of more than 1.0 ppm and 137 entries with 15N shifts offset by more than 1.5 ppm. From this study, 19.7% of the entries in the BMRB appear to be mis-referenced. Evidently, chemical shift referencing {{continues to be a}} significant, and as yet unresolved problem for the biomolecular NMR community.|$|E

40|$|Practical cache {{replacement}} policies {{attempt to}} emulate optimal replacement by predicting the <b>re-reference</b> interval of a cache block. The commonly used LRU replacement policy always predicts a near-immediate <b>re-reference</b> interval on cache hits and misses. Applications that exhibit a distant <b>re-reference</b> interval perform badly under LRU. Such applications {{usually have a}} working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using <b>Re-reference</b> Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2 -bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU 2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2 MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric {{by an average of}} 4 % and 10 % respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4 -core CMP with an 8 MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7 % and 9 % respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2 X less hardware than LRU and 2. 5 X less hardware than LFU...|$|R
50|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance chemical shift <b>re-referencing</b> is a chemical analysis method for chemical shift referencing in biomolecular nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR). It {{has been estimated that}} up to 20% of 13C and up to 35% of 15N shift assignments are improperly referenced. Given that the structural and dynamic information contained within chemical shifts is often quite subtle, it is critical that protein chemical shifts be properly referenced so that these subtle differences can be detected. Fundamentally, the problem with chemical shift referencing {{comes from the fact that}} chemical shifts are relative frequency measurements rather than absolute frequency measurements. Because of the historic problems with chemical shift referencing, chemical shifts are perhaps the most precisely measurable but the least accurately measured parameters in all of NMR spectroscopy.|$|E
5000|$|SHIFTCOR (Shift Correction) is a freely {{available}} {{web server}} {{as well as}} a stand-alone computer program for protein chemical shift <b>re-referencing.</b> [...] Chemical shift referencing is a particularly widespread problem in biomolecular NMR with up to 25% of existing NMR chemical shift assignments being improperly referenced. [...] Some of these referencing problems can lead to systematic errors of between 1.0 to 2.5 ppm (especially in 13C and 15N chemical shifts). Errors of this magnitude can play havoc with any attempt to compare assignments between proteins or to structurally interpret chemical shifts. Identifying which proteins are mis-assigned or improperly referenced can be challenging, as can correcting the errors once they are found. The SHIFTCOR program was designed to assist with identifying and fixing these chemical shift referencing problems. Specifically it compares, identifies, corrects and re-references 1H, 13C and 15N backbone chemical shifts of peptides and proteins by comparing the observed chemical shifts with the predicted chemical shifts derived from the 3D structure (using PDB coordinates) of the protein(s) of interest 1. The predicted chemical shifts are calculated using the ShiftX program. [...] The SHIFTCOR program was originally used to construct a database of properly re-referenced protein chemical shift assignments called RefDB. [...] RefDB is a web-accessible database of more than 2000 correctly referenced protein chemical shift assignments. While originally available as a stand-alone program only, SHIFTCOR has since been released for general use as a web server.|$|E
5000|$|The PSSI and PANAV {{programs}} use {{the secondary}} structure determined by 1H shifts (which are almost never mis-referenced) {{to adjust the}} target protein’s 13C and 15N shifts to match the 1H-derived secondary structure. LACS uses the difference between secondary 13Cα and 13Cβ shifts plotted against secondary 13Cα shifts or secondary 13Cβ shifts to determine reference offsets. A more recent version of LACS 68 has been adapted to identify 15N chemical shift mis-referencing. This new version of LACS exploits the well-known relationship between 15N shifts and the 13Cα (or 13Cβ shifts of the preceding residue. In contrast to LACS and PANAV/PSSI, CheckShift uses secondary structure predicted from high-performance secondary structure prediction programs such as PSIPRED [...] to iteratively adjust 13C and 15N chemical shifts so that their secondary shifts match the predicted secondary structure. These programs have all been shown to accurately identify mis-referenced and properly re-reference protein chemical shifts deposited in the BMRB,. Note that both LACS and CheckShift are programmed to always predict the same offset for 13Cα and 13Cβ shifts, whereas PSSI and PANAV do not make this assumption. As a general rule, PANAV and PSSI typically exhibit a smaller spread (or standard deviation) in calculated reference offsets, indicating that these programs are slightly more precise than either LACS or CheckShift. Interestingly, neither LACS nor CheckShift are able to handle proteins that have the extremely large (above 40 ppm) reference offsets, whereas PANAV and PSSI {{seem to be able}} to deal with these kinds of anomalous proteins.In a recent study, a chemical shift <b>re-referencing</b> program (PANAV) was run on a total of 2421 BMRB entries that had a sufficient proportion of (>80%) of assigned chemical shifts to perform a robust chemical shift reference correction.

From this study, 19.7% of the entries in the BMRB appear to be mis-referenced.

5000|$|PREDITOR (PREDIction of TORsion angles) is a freely {{available}} web-server for {{the prediction}} of protein torsion angles from chemical shifts. For many years it has been known that protein chemical shifts are sensitive to protein secondary structure, which in turn, is sensitive to backbone torsion angles. torsion angles are internal coordinates {{that can be used}} to describe the conformation of a polypeptide chain. They can also be used as constraints to help determine or refine protein structures via NMR spectroscopy. In proteins there are four major torsion angles of interest: phi, psi, omega and chi-1. Traditionally protein NMR spectroscopists have used vicinal J-coupling information and the Karplus relation to determine approximate backbone torsion angle constraints for phi and chi-1 angles. However, several studies in the early 1990s pointed out the strong relationship between 1H and 13C chemical shifts and torsion angles, especially with backbone phi and psi angles. Later a number of other papers pointed out additional chemical shift relationships with chi-1 and even omega angles. PREDITOR was designed to exploit these experimental observations and to help NMR spectroscopists easily predict protein torsion angles from chemical shift assignments. Specifically, PREDITOR accepts protein sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates torsion angle predictions for phi, psi, omega and chi-1 angles. The algorithm that PREDITOR uses combines sequence alignment, chemical shift alignment and a number of related chemical shift analysis techniques to predict torsion angles. PREDITOR is unusually fast (<40 s per protein) and exhibits a very high level of accuracy. In a series of tests 88% of PREDITOR’s phi/psi predictions were within 30 degrees of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions (3-state predictions) were correct and 99.97% of PREDITOR’s predicted omega angles were correct. PREDITOR also estimates the torsion angle errors so that its torsion angle constraints can be used with standard protein structure refinement software, such as CYANA, CNS, XPLOR and AMBER. PREDITOR also supports automated protein chemical shift <b>re-referencing</b> and {{the prediction of}} proline cis/trans states. PREDITOR is not the only torsion angle prediction software available. Several other computer programs including TALOS, TALOS+ [...] and DANGLE [...] have also been developed to predict backbone torsion angles from protein chemical shifts. These stand-alone programs exhibit similar prediction performance to PREDITOR but are substantially slower.|$|E

The results of PLV and DTF demonstrated group differences in fronto-posterior asymmetry following CSD transformation, while for PLI the differences were significant only using REST.
