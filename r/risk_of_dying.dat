5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} government {{state and}} local spending on public goods and income inequality as predictors <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying.</b> MethodsData on 431, 637 adults aged 30 – 74 and 375, 354 adults aged 20 – 44 in the 48 contiguous US states were used from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study to estimate the impacts of {{state and local}} spending and income inequality on individual <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> all-cause and cause-specific mortality for leading causes of death in younger and middle-aged adults and older adults. To reduce bias, models incorporated state fixed effects and instrumental variables. ResultsEach additional $ 250 per capita per year spent on welfare predicted a 3 -percentage point (− 0. 031, 95 % CI: − 0. 059, − 0. 0027) lower probability <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> from any cause. Each additional $ 250 per capita spent on welfare and education predicted 1. 6 -percentage point (− 0. 016, 95 % CI: − 0. 031, − 0. 0011) and 0. 8 -percentage point (− 0. 008, 95 % CI: − 0. 0156, − 0. 00024) lower probabilities <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> from coronary heart disease (CHD), respectively. No associations were found for colon cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; for diabetes, external injury, and suicide, estimates were inverse but modest in magnitude. A 0. 1 higher Gini coefficient (higher income inequality) predicted 1 -percentage point (0. 010, 95 % CI: 0. 0026, 0. 0180) and 0. 2 -percentage point (0. 002, 95 % CI: 0. 001, 0. 002) higher probabilities <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> from CHD and suicide, respectively. ConclusionsEmpirical linkages were identified between state-level spending on welfare and education and lower individual <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying,</b> particularly from CHD and all causes combined.

5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21–44% protein, 9–37% fat and 10–30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's hindquarters or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study examines, in {{the context}} of the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) epidemic, the effects of optimal breast-feeding, complete avoidance of breast-feeding, and early cessation of breast-feeding. METHODS: The three categories of breast-feeding were weighed in terms of HIV transmission and infant mortality. Estimates of the frequency of adverse outcomes were obtained by simulation. RESULTS: Avoidance of all breast-feeding by the whole population always produces the worst outcome. The lowest frequency of adverse outcomes occurs if no HIV-seropositive women breast-feed and all seronegative women breast-feed optimally, given infant mortality rates below 100 per 1000 and relative <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> set at 2. 5 for non-breast-fed compared with optimally breast-fed infants. For known HIV-seropositive mothers, fewer adverse outcomes result from early cessation than from prolonged breast-feeding if the hazard of HIV transmission through breast-feeding after 3 months is 7 % or more, even at high mortality rates, given relative <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> set at 1. 5 for early cessation compared with optimal duration of breast-feeding. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> HIV transmission through breast-feeding at various ages needs to be more precisely quantified.

40|$|Today's {{electronic}} packaging {{products have}} to keep shrinking in size and achieving higher packing density. The small-outline diode (SOD) {{is one of the}} smallest and most widely used components in all electronic devices. A series of calculations and analyses were conducted based on finite element simulation to study the thermo-mechanical performance of SOD package. The residual thermal stresses accumulated during production in the cooling processes after die bonding and post-mold curing were considered as the indicator of thermo-mechanical performance of the packages. Subsequently, the impacts of the package's material properties and geometric parameters on the residual stresses were investigated. Based on this paper, a design that achieves optimum reduction in thermal stresses has been obtained. In addition, die cracking is one of the crucial problems in electronic packaging industry that certainly influences the reliability of electronic devices. In this paper, the possibility of slanting corner cracking in silicon die during the cooling process after die bonding was taken into account, and the strain energy release rate in fracture mechanics at the crack tip was employed to evaluate the impact of several package parameters to the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>die</b> cracking. Similar to the previous part, parametric studies and optimal design have been conducted with the purpose <b>of</b> reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>die</b> cracking...|$|R

40|$|In high-income countries, {{there is}} {{extensive}} evidence showing that {{higher levels of}} educational attainment, higher income and higher occupational classes are correlated with lower <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying</b> among adults. Far less is known on mortality differentials in low- and middle-income countries {{due to the lack}} of information on the socio-economic characteristics of the deceased. In this paper, we evaluate whether survey reports on the survival of sisters can help to fill this gap. We find that levels of educational attainment are correlated within families, and therefore characteristics of the deceased can be inferred from those attained by their sisters responding to the survey. Because estimates of adult mortality based on sibling histories have large confidence intervals, we pool all DHS together and fit a generalized liner mixed effects models to capture mortality differentials. In most surveys, higher education is associated with lower <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>dying,</b> especially in urban areas, but reversed gradients are observed in several countries with high mortality and generalized HIV prevalence. There is limited support for the hypothesis that this puzzling pattern results from larger underreporting of deaths by women with less education. Instead, we argue that sibling histories truly reflect the complexity of the relationship between adult mortality and education, especially in countries affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Overall, the sibling approach offers new possibilities for measuring inequalities in adult mortality in low- and middle-income countries...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo examine {{trends in}} {{reporting}} injury {{as a cause}} of death among people with epilepsy in the U. S. during the past three decades. MethodWe analyzed the U. S. multiple causes of death data from death certificates in 1981 – 2010 to compare rate and odds ratios (OR) of reporting injury as cause of death among cases with vs. without mention of epilepsy across years. ResultsThe trends in reporting epilepsy with and without injury were similar in most age groups but were inconsistent in most external causes of injury. The OR of reporting injury was 1. 02 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0. 97 – 1. 07) in 1981 – 1985 and decreased to 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 48 – 0. 55) in 2006 – 2010. The decline in OR was prominent among people aged 15 – 24 followed by people aged 25 – 44. For the five external causes of injury, the OR of suffocation and drowning were 6. 32 (95 % CI 5. 91 – 6. 75) and 5. 64 (95 % CI 5. 16 – 6. 16) in 1981 – 1985 and decreased to 3. 03 (95 % CI 2. 74 – 3. 35) and 2. 56 (95 % CI 2. 18 – 3. 00) in 2006 – 2010. The OR for poisoning and traffic crashes were 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 57 – 0. 85) and 0. 08 (95 % CI 0. 07 – 0. 09) in 1981 – 1985 and 0. 21 (95 % CI 0. 18 – 0. 25) and 0. 06 (95 % CI 0. 05 – 0. 08) in 2006 – 2010.
