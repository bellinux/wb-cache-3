40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) acts on {{central nervous system}} neurons, {{regulating}} naturally occurring cell death, synaptic connectivity, fiber guidance and dendritic morphology. The dynamically regulated production of NGF beginning in development, extends throughout adult life and aging, exerting numerous roles through a surprising variety of neurons and glial cells. This study analyzes the localization of NGF in the brain of the teleost fish Nothobranchius furzeri, an emerging model for aging research due to its short lifespan. Immunochemical and immunohistochemical experiments were performed by employing an antibody mapping at the N-terminus of the mature chain human origin NGF. Western blot analysis revealed an intense and well defined band of 20 kDa, which corresponds to proNGF of N. furzeri. Immunohistochemistry revealed NGF immunoreactivity (IR) diffused throughout all regions of telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and <b>rhomboencephalon.</b> It was detected in neurons and in glial cells, the latter mostly lining the mesencephalic and rhomboencephalic ventricles. Particularly in neurons, NGF IR was localized in perikarya and, to a less extent, in fibers. The widespread distribution of proNGF suggests that it might modulate numerous physiological functions in the adult brain of N. furzeri. The present survey constitutes a baseline study to enhance {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms underlying the role of NGF during aging processes...|$|E
40|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF) is a {{pluripotent}} mediator, originally considered important in neuronal homeostasis and pathophysiology, {{later it was}} also implicated in the ageing processes. In mammals, NGF is viewed as im-portant {{for the survival of}} forebrain cholinergic neurons, involved in cognitive function, and appears to degen-erate with age and markedly diminish in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The age-related decrease of NGF occurs particu-larly in memory-linked areas such as the hippocampus. Also in non mammalian vertebrate models, NGF changes in age-related degeneration and increases in various pathological lesions. This study analyzes the localization of NGF in the brain of N. furzeri, a model for ageing research. Experiments of in situ hybridization (ISH), by using a LNA probe, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), by employing an antibody mapping at the N-terminus of the mature chain of NGF of human origin, were performed. NGF mRNA expression was observed in the neuronal perikarya of all major regions of the brain, with the highest rate of signal probe in the telen-cephalon (mainly in the subpallial telencephalon). The protein was detected in the cytoplasm of neurons and, to a less extent, in fibers, both diffused throughout the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon and <b>rhomboencephalon.</b> The widespread distribution of NGF mRNA and protein suggests that the NGF system may modulate numerous physiological functions also in the adult brain of fish. The present survey constitutes a baseline study to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of NGF during ageing processes...|$|E
40|$|Endozepines are {{a family}} of {{peptides}} capable of displacing benzodiazepines from their specific binding sites, to which belong the diazepam-binding inhibitor and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). This paper reports the distribution of ODN-related peptides, investigated {{for the first time}} by immunocytochemistry, in different brain and pituitary regions of the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa. Immunoreactive ODN-like material was found in the telencephalon at the level of bundles of different olfactory nerve fibres. Moreover, {{at the level of the}} pallium, immunoreactive multipolar neurons were observed in the pars parvocellularis of the stratum griseum superficialis. Similar immunopositive nerve cell bodies were found in the nucleus medialis of the central prosencephalic complex. In the mesencephalon, few immunoreactive neurons lining and contacting the mesencephalic ventricle were detected; such nerve cells could be involved in the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis. Dorsally in the mesencephalon, numerous ODN-containing cell bodies were present in the area praetectalis. The <b>rhomboencephalon</b> was immunostained only in the octavolateral area and in the nucleus motorius magnocellularis of the trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, ODN immunoreactivity was also present in the nerve cells of ganglia of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve complex. The immunocytochemical patterns described here in the brain of M. glutinosa suggest an involvement of ODN-like peptides as neuromodulators in sensory pathways, such as olfactory and visual. Finally, ODN-like substances were localized in discrete populations of adenohypophysial cells and in tanycytes lining the neurohypophyseal walls, suggesting for endozepines a paracrine and/or endocrine control of pituitary hormones release and a neurohormone role respectively. These results could give new insights into the chemioarchitecture of the brain of myxinoids...|$|E
