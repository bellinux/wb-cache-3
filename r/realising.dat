40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of jumps on {{volatility}} estimation and inference based on various <b>realised</b> variation measures such as <b>realised</b> variance, <b>realised</b> multipower variation and truncated <b>realised</b> multipower variation. We review the asymptotic theory of those <b>realised</b> variation measures and present a new estimator for the asymptotic ‘variance’ of the centered <b>realised</b> variance {{in the presence of}} jumps. Next, we compare the finite sample performance of the various estimators by means of detailed Monte Carlo studies where we study {{the impact of}} the jump activity, the jump size of the jumps in the price and the presence of additional independent or dependent jumps in the volatility on the finite sample performance of the various estimators. We find that the finite sample performance of <b>realised</b> variance, and in particular of the log–transformed <b>realised</b> variance, is generally good, whereas the jump–robust statistics turn out not to be as jump robust as the asymptotic theory would suggest {{in the presence of a}} highly active jump process. In an empirical study on high frequency data from the Standard & Poor’s Depository Receipt (SPY), we investigate the impact of jumps on inference on volatility by <b>realised</b> variance in practice. <b>Realised</b> variance, <b>realised</b> multipower variation, truncated <b>realised</b> variance, inference, stochastic volatility, jumps, priceLength: 48...|$|R

40|$|When {{high-frequency}} data is available, <b>realised</b> variance and <b>realised</b> absolute variation can {{be calculated}} from intra-day prices. In {{the context of a}} stochastic volatility model, <b>realised</b> variance and <b>realised</b> absolute variation can estimate the integrated variance and the integrated spot volatility respectively. A central limit theory enables us to do filtering and smoothing using model-based and model-free approaches in order to improve the precision of these estimators. When the log-price process involves a finite activity jump process, <b>realised</b> variance estimates the quadratic variation of both continuous and jump components. Other consistent estimators of integrated variance can be constructed on the basis of <b>realised</b> multipower variation, i. e., <b>realised</b> bipower, tripower and quadpower variation. These objects are robust to jumps in the log-price process. Therefore, given adequate asymptotic assumptions, the difference between <b>realised</b> multipower variation and <b>realised</b> variance can provide a tool to test for jumps in the process. <b>Realised</b> variance becomes biased in the presence of market microstructure effect, meanwhile <b>realised</b> bipower, tripower and quadpower variation are more robust in such a situation. Nevertheless there is always a trade-off between bias and variance; bias is due to market microstructure noise when sampling at high frequencies and variance is due to the asymptotic assumptions when sampling at low frequencies. By subsampling and averaging <b>realised</b> multipower variation this effect can be reduced, thereby allowing for calculations with higher frequencies. </p...|$|R
