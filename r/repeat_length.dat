500|$|Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are {{unstable}} during replication, {{and this}} instability increases {{with the number}} of repeats present. This usually leads to new expansions as generations pass (dynamic mutations) instead of reproducing an exact copy of the trinucleotide repeat. This causes the number of repeats to change in successive generations, such that an unaffected parent with an [...] "intermediate" [...] number of repeats (28–35), or [...] "reduced penetrance" [...] (36–40), may pass on a copy of the gene with {{an increase in the number}} of repeats that produces fully penetrant HD. Such increases in the number of repeats (and hence earlier age of onset and severity of disease) in successive generations is known as genetic anticipation. Instability is greater in spermatogenesis than oogenesis; maternally inherited alleles are usually of a similar <b>repeat</b> <b>length,</b> whereas paternally inherited ones have a higher chance of increasing in length. It is rare for Huntington's disease to be caused by a new mutation, where neither parent has over 36 CAG repeats.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT DNA {{isolated}} from mammalian cell nuclei reveals discrete size patterns when partially digested with micrococcal nuclease. The DNA <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> from different tissues within a species or from different species may vary. These differences {{have been attributed}} to the presence of different species of histone H 1. To examine the nature of regulation of DNA <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> and their possible relationship to histone H 1, we have selected several mouse and human cell lines that differ in their DNA <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> and examined them and their cell hybrids. 24 mouse x human and five mouse x mouse hybrid cell lines were analyzed. All the interspecific hybrids exhibited the repeat pattern characteristic of the murine parent. The mouse intraspecific hybrids had a repeat pattern of only one of the parents. We conclude that the partial human chromosome complements retained in the hybrids assume the <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> exhibited by the mouse cells. Because H 1 histones have been implicated in the determination of DNA-repeat lengths, we also investigated the regulation of H 1 histone expression in these cell hybrids.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Bouvier des Flandres (BdF) dog is {{predisposed}} to develop prostate carcinoma (PCA). In humans, ethnic groups with higher prevalence of PCA have higher serum androgens concentrations and shorter polyglutamine (CAG) <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> in the androgen receptor (AR) gene.

OBJECTIVE: To compare serum androgens concentrations in the BdF with other breeds and to determine whether CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>length</b> and plasma androgens concentrations are correlated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Androgens were measured in 46 BdF and in 53 other dog breed. Length of CAG-I and CAG-III repeats were measured in 41 BdF and correlated with androgen levels. RESULTS: In the BdF group shorter CAG-I and longer CAG-III <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> were associated with lower androgen concentrations.

Patients of both sexes were divided into younger and older age at onset groups, and compared with younger and older controls. Younger onset male RA patients had significantly shorter CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> than the younger male controls (21. 8  versus 23. 2, p= 0. 007) or the older onset male RA patients (21. 8  versus 23. 2, p= 0. 04). Older onset male RA and both younger and older onset female RA patients had similar CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> when compared with their controls. Neither seropositivity nor rheumatoid nodule positivity had a significant relation with CAG <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths.</b>  CONCLUSION—Shorter CAG <b>repeats</b> of the AR gene, presenting high levels of transactivation activity, are related to younger age onset male RA, suggesting {{the possible}} role of androgens as a modulating factor. ...|$|R

There were no differences in the CAG and GGN <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> between the groups. In cross-sectional analyses of the whole cohort, total and free T were positively associated with CAG length (all P < 0. 05) before, but not after, waist circumference or body mass index was added to the model.

50|$|Huntington’s {{is caused}} by an {{autosomal}} dominant mutation expanding the number of glutamine codon repeats (CAG) within the Huntingtin gene (Htt)(OMIN 613004) (http://www.omim.org/entry/143100). The Htt gene encodes for the huntingtin protein which {{plays a role in}} normal development but its exact function remains unknown (Nasir et al., 1995). The length of this CAG repeat correlates with the age-of-onset of the disease. The average person without Huntington’s has less than 36 CAG repeats present within the Htt gene. When this <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> exceeds 36, the onset of neuronal degradation and the physical symptoms of Huntington’s can range from as early as 5 years of age (CAG repeat > 70) to as late as 80 years of age (CAG repeat < 39) (Chen et al., 2002).|$|E

Subjects were grouped as CAG short (CAGS) if harboring <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> ? 21, the rest as CAG long (CAGL); and GGN short (GGNS) if GGN <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> ? 23, or long if >? 23 (GGNL).

There was an association between the logarithm of CAG repeats polymorphism and the changes of body mass (r?=? 0. 34, P?=? 0. 03). At adult age, CAGS men showed lower accumulation of total body and trunk fat mass, and lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) and MFO per kg of total lean mass compared with CAGL (P?<? 0. 05).

HollingsworthUrea {{inclusion}} compounds (UICs) are classic {{examples of}} nanoporous, host:guest materials {{in which the}} linear channels of the honeycomb structure of the urea host can include various types of long-chain compounds (the guests). By using synchrotron X-ray radiation sources, {{a deeper understanding of}} these materials is made possible through detailed structural studies. In particular, this dissertation describes a series of structural phase transitions that occur upon cooling two related UICs containing alkanedione guest molecules. UICs may be classified as either commensurate or incommensurate structures, depending on whether the <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> of the host (c[subscript h]) and guest (c[subscript g]) along the channel axis are related by a small whole number ratio. Crystals of 2, 8 -nonanedione/urea and 2, 11 -dodecanedione/urea, which are incommensurate structures at room temperature, undergo "lock-in" phase transitions below room temperature to generate commensurate structures in which the guest <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> are elongated. Upon nucleation and growth of these elongated, commensurate phases, other molecules in the same channels are compressed to give successively shorter guest <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths.</b> Further lock-in phase transitions give a multitude of commensurate and incommensurate phases during cooling.

50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} {{have been linked}} to {{neuronal}} death in suffers of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of cerebellar neurons, particularly Purkinje neurons. Pathogenic ATXN1 contains an abnormally elongated stretch of the amino acid glutamine. This elongation is variable in length. The shortest <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> shown to cause disease in humans is 39 uninterrupted CAG triplets, and the longest observed contained 83 repeats. Longer repeat tracts are correlated with earlier age of onset and faster progression. How polyglutamine expansion in Ataxin-1 causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is still unclear. Mutant Ataxin-1 protein spontaneously misfolds and forms aggregates in the nucleus of Purkinje neurons, but it has been shown in mice that aggregation is not required for pathogenesis. Soluble Ataxin-1 interacts with many proteins, studies of such interactions have shown that polyglutamine expansion in Ataxin-1 causes both dominant gain-of-function and loss-of-function pathologies. It has been shown that other neuronal proteins can modulate the formation of Ataxin-1 aggregates and that this in turn may affect aggregate-induced toxicity.|$|E

Three sequentially derived subclones of a rat hepatoma, similar in phenotype, present a constant <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> of 189 (+/- 1) base pairs. Three independent variant clones do not express hepatic functions and each has a different repeat length: 184 base pairs, 188 base pairs, and 192 base pairs. Somatic hybrids between the two types of cells in which liver functions are extinguished have a <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> close or identical to that of the nonexpressing parent. In the case of one hybrid clone that reexpresses the liver phenotype and has undergone some chromosome loss, the 189 -base-pair <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> characteristic of the well-differentiated cells is reestablished. Finally, an amelanotic variant clone derived from a pigmented hamster melanoma clone also shows a signficantly altered <b>repeat</b> <b>length.</b> No correlations have been observed between <b>repeat</b> <b>length</b> and either generation time or chromosome number. Maintenance of the expression of differentiation therefore appears to be associated with a constant <b>repeat</b> <b>length,</b> and loss of the former with a modification in <b>repeat</b> <b>length,</b> suggesting that chromatin packaging is intimately involved in the regulation of gene expression...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the possible association between AR gene polymorphism and serum sex steroids and lipids. 170 healthy males, aged 22 - 59 years (mean 42 years), were included in the study. Anthropometrical as well as sociometrical parameters were recorded. Body fat content (BFC) (% fat mass) was measured by bioelectrical impedance. Serum lipids and total and free testosterone (T) and estradiol (E(2)) levels were measured in each subject. AR gene CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>length</b> was determined. No significant correlation was found between the length of AR gene polyglutamine tract and the levels of gonadal steroids (total and free T, total and free E(2)) or to the lipid levels (Triglycerides, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol). In addition, serum lipid levels were not significantly different in the lower compared to higher half of CAG <b>repeats</b> <b>length</b> distribution. On multiple regression analysis BFC was found to predict HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were found to show, respectively, significant negative and positive correlation with body fat content.

This study investigated the association of PAX 6 with high myopia in 379 high myopia patients and 349 controls. Methods: High myopia patients had refractive errors of – 6. 00 diopters or greater and axial length longer than 26 mm. Control subjects had refractive errors less than – 1. 00 diopter and axial length shorter than 24 mm. The P 1 promoter, all coding sequences, and adjacent splice-site regions of the PAX 6 gene were screened in all study subjects by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. PAX 6 P 1 promoter-luciferase constructs with variable AC and AG <b>repeat</b> <b>lengths</b> were prepared and transfected into human ARPE- 19 cells prior to assaying for their transcriptional activities. Results: No sequence alterations in the coding or splicing regions showed an association with high myopia. Two dinucleotide repeats, (AC) m and (AG) n, in the P 1 promoter region were found to be highly polymorphic and significantly associated with high myopia.
