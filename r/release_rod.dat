40|$|Rods {{are capable}} of greater slow release than cones {{contributing}} to overall slower release kinetics. Slow <b>release</b> in <b>rods</b> involves Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). By impairing release from ribbons, we found that unlike cones where release occurs entirely at ribbon-style active zones, slow <b>release</b> from <b>rods</b> occurs mostly at ectopic, non-ribbon sites. To investigate the role of CICR in ribbon and non-ribbon <b>release</b> from <b>rods,</b> we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) {{as a tool for}} visualizing terminals of isolated rods loaded with fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator dyes and synaptic vesicles loaded with dextran-conjugated pH-sensitive rhodamine (pHrodo). We found that rather than simply facilitating release, activation of CICR by ryanodine triggered <b>release</b> directly in <b>rods,</b> independent of plasma membrane Ca 2 + channel activation. Ryanodine-evoked release occurred mostly at non-ribbon sites and release evoked by sustained depolarization at non-ribbon sites was mostly due to CICR. Unlike release at ribbon-style active zones, non-ribbon release did not occur at fixed locations. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -tracker dye in rod terminals showed that ER extends continuously from synapse to soma. Release of Ca 2 + from terminal ER by lengthy depolarization did not significantly deplete Ca 2 + from ER in the perikaryon. Collectively, these results indicate that CICR-triggered release at non-ribbon sites is a major mechanism for maintaining vesicle <b>release</b> from <b>rods</b> and that CICR in terminals may be sustained by diffusion of Ca 2 + through ER {{from other parts of the}} cell...|$|R

5000|$|In {{light water}} reactors, this is {{achieved}} by inserting neutron-absorbing control rods into the core, although the mechanism by which rods are inserted depends {{on the type of}} reactor. In PWRs, the control rods are held above a reactor's core by electric motors against both their own weight and a powerful spring. Any cessation of the electric current <b>releases</b> the <b>rods.</b> Another design uses electromagnets to hold the rods suspended, with any cut to the electric current resulting in an immediate and automatic control rod insertion. A SCRAM is designed to <b>release</b> the control <b>rods</b> from those motors and allows their weight and the spring to drive them into the reactor core, rapidly halting the nuclear reaction by absorbing liberated neutrons.|$|R

Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull played mandolin on Fat Man, from their second album, Stand Up, and also occasionally on later <b>releases.</b> <b>Rod</b> Stewarts 1971 No.1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff. David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album, Friend of the Devil and Ripple, which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings. John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page both played mandolin on Led Zeppelin songs. Dash Crofts of the soft rock duo Seals and Crofts extensively used mandolin in their repertoire during the 1970s.
