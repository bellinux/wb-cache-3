40|$|The LTC ® 3101 is a {{complete}} power management solution for low power portable devices. It provides three high efficiency switching DC/DC converters which seamlessly transition from battery to USB/wall adapter power when available. A synchronous buck-boost regulator provides complete fl exibility, allowing operation from a single Li-Ion/Polymer battery, 2 to 3 AA cells, a USB port or any other power source operating from 1. 8 V to 5. 5 V. Two always-alive outputs, a 50 mA LDO and a 200 mA MAX output that tracks the higher voltage input supply, provide power for critical functions or additional external regulators. Flash memory cards can be directly powered from the protected 100 mA Hot Swap output. Pushbutton control logic and a programmable-duration microprocessor <b>reset</b> <b>generator</b> simplify interfacing to a microprocessor while internal sequencing and independent enable pins provide flexible power-up options. The LTC 3101 is available in a low profile (0. 75 mm) 24 -lead 4 mm × 4 mm QFN package...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{low power}} {{implementation}} of a secure EPC UHF passive digital base band processor will be designed for UWB transceiver on RFID for wireless application. To ensure the secure information transaction of the passive tag, traditionally {{the focus is on}} directly applying a low complexity encryption engine. The attackers could make use of known header to reveal the secret key. The proposed architecture consists of a novel clock and data flow solution enforced by an anti-collision algorithm engine embedded inside the RFID passive tag. Low power design techniques such as clock gating, optimal clock driving and parallel operation will be used {{in the design of the}} tag. The complete digital baseband processor RFID tag consists of a receive and transmit buffer a controller unit to control the data and clock, slot and <b>reset</b> counter,random <b>generator,</b> comparator and memory controller. Increased power consumption, is one of the important factors, which governs the performance of the ICs in Ultra Deep Sub Micron (UDSM) regime.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the existing}} protection scheme {{of a real}} distribution system with distributed generators, in Greece. Network protection utilizes three successive reclosers at the main trunk and fuses at the laterals. The generating units are protected by overcurrent and voltage/frequency relays. The analysis focuses on the fault-ride-through capability of the generating units and proposes the <b>resetting</b> of the <b>generators</b> and network protection relays so as {{to conform to the}} requirements imposed by distribution system operators and international standards. The proposed protection system guarantees selectivity for any short-circuits occurring inside or outside the distribution system, irrelative if the generating units are connected to the network or not. Meaningful conclusions are derived from the application of the proposed protection coordination principle...|$|R
40|$|Advances in cardiac device {{technology}} {{have led to}} the first generation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conditional devices, providing more diagnostic imaging options for patients with these devices, but also new controversies. Prior studies of pacemakers in patients undergoing MRI procedures have provided groundwork for design improvements. Factors related to magnetic field interactions and transfer of electromagnetic energy led to specific design changes. Ferromagnetic content was minimized. Reed switches were modified. Leads were redesigned to reduce induced currents/heating. Circuitry filters and shielding were implemented to impede or limit the transfer of certain unwanted electromagnetic effects. Prospective multicenter clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of the first generation of MR conditional cardiac pacemakers demonstrated no significant alterations in pacing parameters compared to controls. There were no reported complications through the one month visit including no arrhythmias, electrical <b>reset,</b> inhibition of <b>generator</b> output, or adverse sensations. The safe implementation of these new technologies requires an understanding of the well-defined patient and MR system conditions. Although scanning a patient with an MR conditional device following the strictly defined patient and MR system conditions appears straightforward, issues related to patients with pre-existing devices remain complex. Until MR conditional devices are the routine platform for all of these devices, there will still be challenging decisions regarding imaging patients with pre-existing devices where MRI is required to diagnose and manage a potentially life threatening or serious scenario. A range of other devices including ICDs, biventricular devices, and implantable physiologic monitors as well as guidance of medical procedures using MRI technology will require further biomedical device design changes and testing. The development and implementation of cardiac MR conditional devices will continue to require the expertise and collaboration of multiple disciplines and will need to prove safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness in patient care...|$|R
40|$|Proprioceptors such as muscle {{spindles}} and Golgi tendon organs {{provide the}} central nervous system with sensory feedback for motor control and kinesthesia. It is difficult to record afferent activity from such receptors during motor behavior, so theories of motor control usually depend on implicit or explicit assumptions about such activity. The muscle spindle is the most important proprioceptor, playing a dominant role in kinesthesia and in reflexive adjustments to perturbations. Each muscle spindle accurately senses and encodes length and velocity information of the extrafusal muscle fibers over a wide range of movements despite the relatively restricted dynamic range of firing rates for action potentials. It does this by shifting the relative importance and sensitivity to length and velocity in response to specialized fusimotor efferents (gamma motoneurons), at the cost of complicating the interpretation of their signals by the nervous system. We have constructed a physiologically realistic model of the spindle that is composed of mathematical elements closely related to the anatomical components found in the biological spindle. The spindle model consists of three nonlinear intrafusal fiber models: bag 1, bag 2 and chain. The bag 1 fiber model {{is the only one that}} receives dynamic fusimotor control and is primarily responsible for velocity sensitivity of the spindle. The bag 2 and chain receive ?static fusimotor control and contribute mainly to length sensitivity. All three fiber types give rise to primary afferent activity, while only bag 2 and chain to secondary afferent activity. In the case of the primary afferent, the model incorporates the experimentally observed effect of partial occlusion, where primary afferent activity results from a competition between two impulse generator sites, one located on the bag 1 and other on bag 2 and chain fibers. When both sites are active, the dominant generator wins and suppresses all activity in the weaker <b>generator</b> by <b>resetting</b> its spike <b>generator.</b> While that results in total occlusion, the mechanism responsible for partial occlusion observed in the case of primary afferent is believed to include electrotonic current spread between the suppressed and dominant generator, resulting in increased impulse generation at the dominant site. The model also incorporates the appropriate temporal properties of three types of intrafusal fibers during static or dynamic fusimotor stimulation. The advantage of including these properties is demonstrated by comparing model simulations with and without these properties to data from recently published experiments in which both fusimotor efferent and spindle afferent activity were recorded simultaneously during decerebrate locomotion in the cat (Taylor et al., J Physiol 529. 3 : 825 - 836, 2000). We have inverted the spindle model in order to use it as a tool to better understand fusimotor control in natural tasks. By supplying the inverted model with records of afferent activity and kinematics during natural tasks, the inverted model can be used to infer the underlying fusimotor drive. Once the principles of fusimotor control are understood, it should be possible to apply the spindle model to predict more accurately the activity of spindle afferents and their role in control of motor tasks...|$|R
