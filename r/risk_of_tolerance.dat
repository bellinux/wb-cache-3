5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E

50|$|Benzodiazepines {{are often}} used to reduce anxiety {{symptoms}}, muscle tension, seizure disorders, insomnia, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, and panic attack symptoms. Their action is primarily on specific benzodiazepine sites on the GABAA receptor. This receptor complex is thought to mediate the anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant actions of the benzodiazepines. Use of benzodiazepines carries the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> (necessitating increased dosage), dependence, and abuse. Taking these drugs {{for a long period}} of time can lead to withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> dependence, and {{withdrawal}} are very low when the drug is used for 2-4 weeks only and that lormetazepam is generally a safe and effective drug when used for no longer than 2-4 weeks. Some sleep disturbance in the form of rebound insomnia can, however, occur even after short-term usage of 7 days. Those with a history of addiction may be at increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and dependence especially those with a past history of dependency on sedative hypnotic drugs.|$|R

40|$|Background: Benzodiazepines can be {{classified}} {{as one of the}} most frequently prescribed categories of medication. This medication category is distinguished by a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and dependence, in the case of long-term, excessive use. Aim: The aim of our study was to analyse the use of benzodiazepines in the general population, municipality of Berane, Montenegro, during the previous year. Methods: Research was based on the analysis of 1000 prescriptions of benzodiazepines, issued by physicians in Primary Health Care. The diagnostic manual utilised for the purpose of this research was International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10). The survey was conducted for a period of 40 days during January and February 2015. Results: The study was performed in the general population, age from 18 to 98 years (621 females and 379 males). The average age of all participants in the study was 64. 1 ± 13. 1 years. Analysis of data confirmed that the most frequently prescribed from the group of benzodiazepines were: diazepam (42. 2 %), bromazepam (30. 3 %), lorazepam (16. 4 %), alprazolam (6. 4 %), nitrazepam (2. 6 %) and clonazepam (2. 1 %). The significant statistical difference (x 2 = 58. 664; p< 0. 001) was found between female patients who used benzodiazepines in 62. 1 % of cases, compared to male patients who used benzodiazepines in 37. 9 % of cases. It was confirmed that benzodiazepines were usually prescribed for 17 different diagnoses, mostly for diagnoses from the group I, viz. cluster-diseases of the circulatory system (39. 7 %), group F-mental and behavioural disorders (31. 1 %) and group E-endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (7. 7 %). Conclusion: Studies about drug utilisation provide plenty of useful information which can be further used with the aim of achieving more rational prescribing and more effective patient treating...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide {{advisers}} and planners in the financial services industry with an outline of the key issues to consider as they develop an understanding <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> their clients. <b>Risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> is the assumed level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> that a client is willing to accept. Through gaining an accurate assessment <b>of</b> a client's <b>risk</b> profile, an adviser can develop a tailored financial plan that better reflects the client's perception of the acceptable trade-off between risk and the compensation required for bearing risk. By making the client's risk tolerance explicit and understandable, the planner is able to help the client identify any mismatch between psychological and financial needs, then work with the client to make any trade-offs that might be required. However, in contrast to the views of some financial writers, it is argued that risk tolerance is a complex attitude that requires the use of a sophisticated and complete assessment process. Most importantly, the use of a scientifically developed measure <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> within a structured process set up by the financial planner provides the best approach to determine the <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> clients. A <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> test score or profile provides the adviser with a good basis upon which to explore further in the interview the type of investments that a client is most likely to find to be acceptable. In addition, using a test <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> that has established test norms allows the adviser and client to understand how a client's level <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>tolerance</b> compares to other people who have completed the same profile.

25|$|Like all benzodiazepines, {{clonazepam}} is a GABA-positive allosteric modulator. One-third {{of individuals}} treated with benzodiazepines {{for longer than}} four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction.

40|$|Risk {{tolerance}} is a {{term used}} differently in psychology and economics. In psychology, personality is known to affect type <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> taking; instrumental and stimulating.
