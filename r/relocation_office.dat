40|$|Through a “three pronged” {{termination}} policy, {{including the}} termination of tribal sovereignty, cultures and lands, the U. S. federal government sought to finally end the trust relationship it held with Native Americans. While both {{the termination of}} Native Nations and Public Law 280 assaulted the sovereignty of Native Nations, it was the relocation program that would finally force Native individuals to be active participants in the capitalist system. By the time the relocation program was brought to Oakland, California, in 1956, the city was undergoing drastic demographic and population shifts, which would {{have a major impact}} on the opportunities available to the relocation program participants. Like the reservations, the flatland neighborhoods of Oakland were both economically and politically controlled from the outside, rendering them a virtual colony of the larger city. Thus, rather than advance their economic or political status, as the actions of the <b>Relocation</b> <b>Office</b> would suggest, this new colonial system, operating within the internal colony of the “Black ghetto,” would perpetuate the low economic position of Native peoples. Tracing the history of American relocation into Oakland, this paper examines and exposes the central role of vocational training in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) educational system, which not only enabled the largest relocation of Native peoples into urban areas, but forced Native students into urban school systems that simultaneously maintained and transformed colonial narratives, policies and rhetoric of the earlier BIA educational models while also inadvertently creating spaces that facilitated the most organized forms of intertribal resistance and activism. Tracing the history of relocation into the flatlands of Oakland is of particular interest as it highlights how the processes and understandings of sovereignty, internal colonialism, and positionality intersect within and between racially colonized communities. Consequently, by reconstructing the story of relocation into Oakland, we can begin to question what impact this had on the relocatees’ colonial status as “wards of the state,” in addition to asking how, as well as whether, relocation transformed the ways in which Native peoples were viewed externally (from various levels of government along with local non-Native neighbors and community members) and how this shifted, if at all, internal perceptions of self and community. Thus, using the history of relocation and urban Indians as a guide, we can begin to unpack the ways in which their colonial relationship has changed over time and space...|$|E

In 1950, the Navajo-Hopi Law was passed which funded a program to help relocate tribe members to Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and Denver and help them find jobs.

40|$|This paper marks a {{departure}} from the focus on external stakeholders in much research on legitimacy and Multinational Corporations, adopting a social psychological approach to study how MNCs build internal legitimacy for controversial decisions with their subsidiaries. We explore this through a longitudinal, real-time qualitative case study of a regional <b>office</b> <b>relocation,</b> since <b>office</b> <b>relocations</b> represent rare yet significant strategic decisions. We analyze the interplay between the legitimation strategies of senior managers and subsidiary legitimacy judgments, based in instrumental, relational, and moral considerations, and how {{the relationship between the two}} develops over time. From this analysis we derive inductively a process model that reveals the dynamics of building internal legitimacy with subsidiaries, and how an MNC moves on even in the absence of full legitimacy, when dealing with controversial MNC decisions. The model highlights two important dynamics. The first is a dynamic between legitimation strategies and legitimacy judgments and how this is influenced by local subsidiary contexts. The second is a temporal dynamic in how both the legitimation strategies and legitimacy judgments evolve over time. Our model contributes to research on legitimacy in MNCs, what we know about tensions that characterize MNC sub-unit relationships, and research on headquarters relocation...|$|R

40|$|Main {{purpose of}} this thesis is an {{assessment}} of the possibility of companies to transfer their seat from several points of view. It is distinguished between situations of companies with regard to the <b>relocation</b> of head <b>office</b> contrary to the <b>relocation</b> of registered <b>office.</b> At first, the migration issue is analyzed in general, then from the perspective of EU law. Due to insufficiently resolved scope of the freedom of establishment, especially with respect to the transfer of registered office, the thesis focuses on the European Company. For the time being, it can be considered as the most advanced result of the common effort of EU member states to achieve a supranational company form. It was not a random choice to dedicate part of this thesis to the European Company since the possibility to move its registered office freely across the EU {{is one of the main}} attributes granted to the European Company form. The analysis of relocation process, including consideration of potential difficulties results in comparison with actual opportunities of "national"companies in this respect.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate perceived health, work environment and self-estimated productivity one month before and at three, six and twelve months after <b>relocation</b> from individual <b>offices</b> to an open-plan office environment. METHODS: Employees from three departments within the same company group and who worked with relatively similar tasks and who were planned to be relocated from private offices to open-plan offices were invited to participate. Questionnaires comprising items from The Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale, The Work Experience Measurement Scale, the questionnaire by Brennan et al. about perceived performance and one question from the Work Ability Index were sent to participants one month before relocation (baseline) to open-plan offices and then at three, six and twelve months after relocation. At baseline, 82 questionnaires were sent out. The response rate was 85 %. At the follow-ups 77 - 79 questionnaires were sent out and the response-rate was 70 %- 81 %. RESULTS: At follow-ups, perceived health, job satisfaction and performance had generally deteriorated.
