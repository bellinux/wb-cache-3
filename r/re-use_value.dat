40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine what financial return, if any, DOE would realize if they invest solely in removal of the asbestos from these three Hanford steam plants and the associated large bore distribution piping at the site. Once the asbestos was removed the strategy was to bring in companies that specialize in salvage and material re-use and have them remove, at no cost to DOE, the plants and the associated large bore piping. The salvage companies we contacted had said that if they didn't have to remove asbestos, they may be able to realize enough value from these plants to offset their demolition and/or dismantling cost. The results were not what we expected but they do offer DOE some favorable financial alternatives to their present approach. The study concluded that there was very little salvage and/or <b>re-use</b> <b>value</b> remaining in the steam plant material that could be used to offset the demolition and/or dismantling cost. The notable exception to this is the removal of the 24 inch steam piping that runs from 200 E to 200 W areas (see IDM executive summary under Dismantling cost). It is estimated that the <b>re-use</b> <b>value</b> of the 24 -inch piping would more than pay for the dismantling cost of this piping. On a more favorable note, it does appear as though the cost of conventional demolition can be reduced by a factor of 3 to 5 if the asbestos is removed first and the demolition is performed using competitive and commercial practices. Both estimates in this study are similar except that IDM did not include floor slab removal nor remove the same quantity of piping. This is why we are using a range of 3 to 5 as a reduction factor. The IDM estimate (using union labor) for demolition after removal of asbestos was approximately $ 1. 5 M versus $ 10. 0 M for accomplishing the work using Hanford practices and rates...|$|E

40|$|Research into {{sustainable}} distribution {{has largely}} focussed on improving {{the delivery of}} products through the supply chain from manufacturer to end customer by developing fundamental understanding of the various supply chain operations at work in urban centres. The logistics activities associated {{with the return of}} damaged, unsold or returned consumer products back up the supply chain, and the consolidation, handling and disposal of waste products that may result, is becoming of increasing interest in the drive to reduce costs and maximise efficiency within the distribution sector. With the introduction of the EC Directives on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) (2002 / 96 /EC), the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances (RoHS) in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (2002 / 95 /EC), and Packaging and Packaging Waste (94 / 62 /EC), the onus is on retailers and manufacturers to reduce their waste output and better manage their respective logistics operations in this area by participating in specific waste take-back schemes. The need to effectively manage product returns as part of the supply chain process has become more pronounced since the introduction of the Directive on Distance Contract (97 / 7 /EC), which stipulates that anyone who makes a purchase via the Internet, telephone, fax or mail order is able to change their mind during a ‘cooling-off’ period of seven working days after the goods have been received with no explanation for their return being required. Under this backdrop of increasingly liberal returns policies coupled with a ‘throw away’ consumer culture, the extent to which product returns contribute to increasing waste and recyclate generation needs to be explored. With a variety of centralised and decentralised supply chain mechanisms being employed to service retailers, there is potential scope for co-ordinating reverse processes to both reduce collective transport impacts and maximise <b>re-use</b> <b>value</b> from the recyclate generated. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Online {{archives}} are {{of increasing}} importance in Archaeological Informatics, but like any new genre they prompt {{a number of}} questions. What is their relationship to publication? What should go in them? How should they be delivered and indexed? Can they be preserved? Whilst their delivery requires technology, we must also consider how that technology should best be employed {{in the service of}} our discipline. This article attempts to address some of these questions but it need not be read from start to finish. The links from this summary provide one fairly linear route through the text but each section is self-contained and can also be accessed directly from the Contents page. The problems posed by effective publication of archaeological fieldwork have exercised the profession for many decades. The issues raised go to the core of discussion of whether preservation by record is a valid concept, and indeed whether archaeological data exist. There are different schools of thought about the relationship between publication and archiving, but hopefully we can accept that data are recorded observations but still agree that they have a <b>re-use</b> <b>value</b> for re-examination and re-interpretation. Since the 1960 s archaeology has experienced a publication crisis point. The scenario is familiar. Excavation is destruction; it is an unrepeatable experiment and the archaeologist has a professional obligation to make a full and accessible record of his/her observations. Yet full publication is increasingly expensive and difficult, and excavation monographs are read by few people, and bought by even fewer. In England the development of post-PPG 16 fieldwork has exacerbated the problem by creating a mountain of unpublished grey literature and making the work of synthesis even harder; a similar situation exists in other countries. Meanwhile museum archives are also reaching breaking point; most are running out of storage space, few can provide facilities for access, and almost all report low levels of usage. Digital technology now offers the means by which the crisis may at last be overcome. It provides an opportunity to provide unprecedented access to archaeological data through online digital archives and to integrate synthetic interpretation with recorded observations in a seamless fashion, in a way which has been pioneered by Internet Archaeology. It may even allow a virtual re-integration of the paper and artefactual archives, which in the British Isles have become physically separated. However, the growth of the World Wide Web brings with it its own problems of locating relevant resources of quality which need addressing by effective indexing and access. Such resources need not be brought together in a central place but can instead be searched across distributed sites. On the other hand, if we maintain archives at a local level we must be aware of problems of data integrity. The trend for archaeological data to be captured and held in digital format, and even to be born digital raises issues of data preservation. This article is based on the experiences gained and lessons learned during the development of the Archaeology Data Service over the last five years, presented here as a case study which links each of the above themes. It is clear that we need to plan for data re-use, and that archiving must be considered at the outset of a project, not just regarded as an afterthought once the final publication proofs have been checked, and that we must provide adequate documentation to allow re-users to understand the context of our recorded observations, rather than pretending that data can be divorced from the observer. This inevitably has a cost, but our profession has long played lip service to the importance of the structured and ordered archive, without necessarily doing anything about it. We must also train future generations of archaeologists to apply skills of source criticism in their use of archival sources and, as the distinction between archiving and publication becomes blurred and both are seen as part of the dissemination strategy for our discoveries, we must ensure that adequate academic and professional credit is given for both. Finally, the assistance of numerous others who have contributed to the ADS and the development of online archives is also acknowledged...|$|E

The potential performance of a value reuse mechanism not only depends {{on the number of}} instances it has eliminated, but {{as well as on the}} time spent in detecting the instance to be eliminated. In order to have better value reuse, we move from instruction level reuse to function reuse, so that one can detect more eliminative instances with reasonable e#ort. This removes the extra time spent on detecting the possibility of instruction execution elimination. The results of the mathematical library functions evaluated can be reused. Since they can be treated as instructions, i. e, functions which do not have side-e#ects with the application, one can eliminate the function call itself. In this paper, we propose a technique to <b>re-use</b> the evaluated <b>values</b> for math library functions. Execution time is decreased up to 6 %.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a plan to}} upgrade colliery spoils to construction materials. The plan {{is based on the}} idea that the mineral composition of which colliery spoils are made of are similar to the composition of construction materials. However, colliery spoils also contain carbon and sulfides whilst construction materials mostly do not. By thermal treatment, i. e. burning out the carbon and oxidation of sulfides, the mineral part can be upgraded into a form, suitable for production of construction materials. An optimized Fluidized Bed Combustion (FBC) technology in combination with treatment of coarser particles in a shaft-furnace, is regarded the most suitable method for this purpose. An integrated processing facility based on proven technologies will be able to upgrade colliery spoils into (1) basic minerals to be used for the production of construction materials (a high <b>valued</b> <b>re-use),</b> simultaneously recovering the remaining energy-content, i. e.

The activities of key international organisations promoting lifelong learning as {{significant in the}} context of globalisation, combined with the innovative character of OER as high-quality open learning resources, were the reasons for the focus. The aim was to understand the function of OER through exploring motivational aspects, approaches to and contexts of individual learning among users of five different OER: penLearn, OpenSpires, OpenStudy, METU OpenCourseWare and Wolne Lektury. A case study approach allowed the focus on the uniqueness of specific OER. Semi-structured interviews and virtual output collection were triangulated as data gathering methods. Interviews were analysed using the Miles and Huberman’s (1994) qualitative framework and output - using Preece et al. ’s (2002) thematic analysis guidelines. Results show OER as not only resources but learning environments supporting ‘expansion of human learning’ (COL, 2011 : 2) through being accessible free-of-charge, openly, without registrations, exams; providing various subjects, levels and formats suitable for users with different needs, disabilities, interests and resources. OER support wider access to and inclusion in learning, empowering individuals in directing their learning, especially 9 during transitions or ‘critical periods’ (Knowles, 1973). OER users emerged as motivated by various online and offline factors related to supporting formal education or non-formal learning, and exchanging expertise or support. Even if linked to supporting formal goals, learning, participation and communication within OER are motivated intrinsically, by interest, knowledge, curiosity, enjoyment and appreciation of learning, subject or interactions.

The result of this project {{comes in the form of}} design, which can be used by designers and other actors such as housing corporations and local residents, as a show case with solutions dealing with issues of social safety, cohesion, diversity and life resistance. The researched context is that of a mixed neighborhood with late post-war portiek dwellings and 19 th century housing; the neighborhood in Oranjeboom street in the city of Rotterdam is used as a case for study and design. Since the project is concerned with the relation between social functions and physical, spatial properties, and aims to achieve the presuppositions for social sustainability, emphasis is placed on incorporating the perspectives of local residents; both existing and future expected ones, with a particular focus on families with children and working-at-home persons living in the neighbourhood. An integrated intervention pattern is developed, at different levels of scale –from urban to architectural and material scale, concerning built-up area, program, public and communal space and indoor living environment. Design deals mostly with two social sustainability aspects that were deemed most relevant within the specific context. These are firstly social safety, since aspects related to this appear to be the greatest threat to the future value of these neighborhoods. Secondly, possibilities for social interaction, since this is the most important (potential) quality of the neighbourhood. Spatial preconditions for a design that replies to these problems are also strongly correlated. The first issue is translated in solutions for accessibility and usability of public and communal spaces and border treatment, through a clear privacy zoning between public and private space. Solutions for visibility were also important to offer easier social control. The second issue is translated in solutions for communal activities and communal space design; external and internal: the courtyard and the portieks design was the main focus points. The other two issues: diversity and life resistance are treated through solutions for variety in building typologies and functions in the district and flexibility and affordability issues of the housing. Specifically water management and insulation-thermal costs awe remain points of focus. Architectural design proposal is made for a crucial neighborhood part, namely a residential building block, the main traffic structure, and the communal courtyard and public park area around it, to test how the theoretical preconditions and patterns can be translated into a coherent design. Keeping social potential in Oranjeboom street by designing a neighboorhood that enables and facilitates the change of its inhabitant’s social situation, enabling social and economic survival. Research in the thesis plan and two papers (article and reflection paper has led to formulate the desirable and possible characteristics for the design of the district. The application of these design criteria - social safety, cohesion, diversity and life resistance. -dictated specific spatial preconditions in order to enable successful livability of the district. The existing structure however, imposes certain barriers and restricts the possibilities of the solutions to be chosen. On the other hand, <b>re–using</b> the existing <b>values</b> in order to achieve the upper goals is a big challenge that all Rmit projects include.
