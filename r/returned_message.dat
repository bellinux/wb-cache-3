50|$|As Enigma was {{the central}} element, i.e. control, of the naval U-boat offensive, the Kriegsmarine strived to ensure the {{security}} of the machine. As with the continual security review conducted during the interwar years, the process continued during the war years. B-Diensts own communications were monitored for mistakes on an continual basis. For example, during the Norwegian Campaign, the Büffel, boat NS25, a converted whaler used as an auxiliary patrol ship, made a mistake, when it requested a weather report with the service abbreviation QOB. This was an impossible situation for the answering telegraphist, as Bletchley Park cryptanalysts would know that the <b>returned</b> <b>message</b> was a weather report, i.e. offering a crib, and made the answer impossible to deliver. Radioman Wilhelm Lemcke, who sent the message, was sent to Stavanger for additional training. Physical and logical exposure of Enigma machinery and keying documentation was equally important and was limited, whenever possible. For example, vessels which were expected to encounter shallow water, where Enigma materials could be recovered, were instructed to carry none whatsoever, and instead use the hand cipher (German:Reservehandverfahren) For example, the U-boat U-47, which sank the HMS Royal Oak on the October 14th 1939, carried only a hand cipher. When the Admiral Graf Spee scuttled herself in shallow water, the Enigma machinery and keying documents were already safely stored by the German Naval Attaché in Monte Video.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{scheduling}} divisible load applications on star networks, in presence of <b>return</b> <b>messages.</b> This {{work is a}} follow-on of, where the same problem was considered under the 2 -port model, where a given processor can simultaneously send and receive messages. Here, we concentrate on the one-port model, where a processor can either send or receive a message {{at a given time}} step. The problem of scheduling divisible load on star platforms turns out to be very difficult as soon as <b>return</b> <b>messages</b> are involved. Unfortunately, {{we have not been able}} to assess its complexity, but we provide an optimal solution in the special (but important) case of FIFO communication schemes. We also provide an explicit formula for the optimal number of load units that can be processed by a FIFO ordering on a bus network. Finally, we provide a set of MPI experiments to assess the accuracy and usefulness of our results in a real framework...|$|R

50|$|A pseudonymous remailer or nym server, {{as opposed}} to an {{anonymous}} remailer, is an Internet software program designed to allow people to write pseudonymous messages on Usenet newsgroups and send pseudonymous email.

These instructions usually involve the anonymous remailer network itself, thus protecting the true identity of the user.|$|R

In one of the studies, the attractiveness of 60 males and 60 females were measured and their interactions were monitored.

What they found was different from the original construct of matching. People contacted others who were significantly more attractive than they were. However {{it was found that the}} person was more likely to reply if they were closer to the same level of attractiveness. This study supported matching but not as something that is intentional.|$|R
