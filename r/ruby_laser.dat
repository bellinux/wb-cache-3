25|$|Because {{at least}} half the {{population}} of atoms must be excited from the ground state to obtain a population inversion, the laser medium must be very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of laser heating began only 8 years after Charles Weir, of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), {{made the first}} diamond anvil cell and Alvin Van Valkenburg, NBS, realized the potential {{of being able to}} see the sample while under pressure. William Bassett and his colleague Taro Takahashi focused a laser beam on the sample while under pressure. The first laser heating system used a single 7 joule pulsed <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> that heated the sample to 3000°C while at 260 kilobars. This was sufficient to convert graphite to diamond. The major flaw of in the first system was control and temperature measurement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> have {{declined}} in {{use with the}} discovery of better lasing media. They are still used in a number of applications where short pulses of red light are required. Holographers around the world produce holographic portraits with <b>ruby</b> <b>lasers,</b> in sizes up to a meter square. Because of its high pulsed power and good coherence length, the red 694 nm laser light is preferred to the 532 nm green light of frequency-doubled Nd:YAG, which often requires multiple pulses for large holograms. Many non-destructive testing labs use <b>ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> to create holograms of large objects such as aircraft tires to look for weaknesses in the lining. <b>Ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> were used extensively in tattoo and hair removal, but are being replaced by alexandrite and Nd:YAG lasers in this application.|$|R
50|$|The first {{material}} {{used for}} <b>lasers</b> was synthetic <b>ruby</b> crystals. <b>Ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> are still {{used for a}} few applications, {{but they are not}} common because of their low power efficiencies. At room temperature, <b>ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> emit only short pulses of light, but at cryogenic temperatures they can be made to emit a continuous train of pulses.|$|R
50|$|The {{two types}} of lasers {{commonly}} used are solid-state <b>lasers</b> (especially <b>ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> and Nd:YAG lasers) and gas lasers.|$|R
25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
2500|$|After {{absorbing}} short-wavelength light, {{there is}} short interval {{of time when}} the crystal lattice of ruby is in an excited state before fluorescence occurs. If 694-nanometer photons pass through the crystal during that time, they can stimulate more fluorescent photons to be emitted in-phase with them, thus strengthening the intensity of that red light. By arranging mirrors or other means to pass [...] emitted light repeatedly through the crystal, a <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> in this way produces a very high intensity of coherent red light.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ruby</b> <b>lasers</b> did {{not deliver}} a single pulse, but rather {{delivered}} {{a series of}} pulses, consisting {{of a series of}} irregular spikes within the pulse duration.

50|$|In 1962, Willard Boyle, {{working at}} Bell Labs, {{produced}} the first continuous output from a <b>ruby</b> <b>laser.</b> Unlike the usual side-pumping method, {{the light from}} a mercury arc lamp was pumped into {{the end of a}} very small rod, to achieve the necessary population inversion. The laser did not emit a continuous wave, but rather a continuous train of pulses, giving scientists the opportunity to study the spiked output of ruby. The continuous <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> was the first laser to be used in medicine. It was used by Leon Goldman, a pioneer in laser medicine, for treatments such as tattoo removal, scar treatments, and to induce healing. Due to its limits in output power, tunability, and complications in operating and cooling the units, the continuous <b>ruby</b> <b>laser</b> was quickly replaced with more versatile dye, Nd:YAG, and argon lasers.|$|E
