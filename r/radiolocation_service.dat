The main results of the measurements obtained in the physical layer of the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) are introduced. A new method for the utilization of the multipath propagation phenomenon to improve the estimation of the distance between the mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS) is outlined. This method significantly increases the quality of location services in systems which use a radio interface with direct sequence code division multiple access (DS CDMA) ...|$|R

This paper reports an investigation regarding the feasibility of utilizing cellular radio for the purpose of mobile location estimation. Basic strategies to be utilized for location estimation are elaborated. Two possible approaches for cellular based location estimation are investigated with the help of computer simulation. Their effectiveness and relative merits and demerits are identified. An algorithm specifically adapted for cellular environment is reported with specific features where mobiles, irrespective of their numbers, can locate their position without adversely loading the cellular system.

50|$|Prior to WRC-15, all 5 MHz Amateur {{allocations}} made {{by individual}} administrations were {{in accordance with}} Article 4.4 of the ITU Radio Regulations, which requires non-interference with other radio services. Where two-way amateur radio communication is authorized on 60 m, it has generally been within the frequency range 5250 - 5450 kHz, but the whole of this range is not necessarily available and allocations vary significantly from country-to-country. This has been particularly true in latter years since the award at WRC-12 of the range 5250 - 5275 kHz to the <b>Radiolocation</b> <b>Service,</b> thus effectively reducing the former frequency range down to 5275 - 5450 kHz.|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of space objects {{including}} artificial debris is increased, needs for development of new applications in <b>radiolocation</b> <b>service</b> (radars) are also growing {{to be used for}} aerospace surveillance and tracking the launch and movement of spacecrafts. Radiowaves in the VHF (3 - 30 MHz) band propagate well through the ionosphere, thus various space object detection applications including remote space sensing and asteroid detection as well as defining the position of natural and artificial Earth satellites are enable from terrestrial-based radiolocation radars in this frequency band. Considering the effective and economical aspects, VHF bands are appropriate for implementation of these new radiolocation radars. Current requirements for radiolocation radars used for space-object detection from terrestrial locations are based on 2 MHz bandwidth in portion of the VHF band, however allocation with a wider frequency range may provide flexibility and facilitate sharing with existing services.

The additional bandwidth will provide greater image resolution, improve range accuracy, allow for greater radar density, improve interference performance, lower system costs, and increase ability to collect more information about an object or area observed by a radar. Operation of these radars must not adversely affect other co-primary services in the band, or the radio astronomy service in the adjacent band, 15. 35 - 15. 40 GHz. This proposal also takes into account the need for an allocation in the range 15. 4 - 15. 6 GHz to address the requirements of mobile-satellite service systems under WRC- 12 Agenda item 1. 25. A separate, complimentary proposal under Agenda item 1. 25 makes the allocation to the mobile-satellite service in the range 15. 4 - 15. 6 GHz...|$|E
