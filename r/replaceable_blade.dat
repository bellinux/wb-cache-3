5000|$|Sticks have {{traditionally}} been made from wood, but in recent years, sticks made of more expensive materials such as aluminum, Aramid (kevlar), fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other composite materials have become common. In addition to weighing less, composite sticks can be manufactured with more consistent flexibility properties than their wooden counterparts. They also {{do not have the}} natural variations that wooden sticks possess therefore a batch of the same sticks will all perform roughly the same. There are die-hard NHL professionals that still like the feel of wood sticks such as Paul Stastny (Son of ice hockey Hall-of-Famer Peter Stastny). Some of these sticks have replaceable wood or composite blades, while others are one piece sticks without a <b>replaceable</b> <b>blade.</b> Composite sticks, despite their greater expense, are now commonplace at nearly all competitive levels of the sport, including youth ice hockey. Some of the top brands of composite sticks include Bauer, Easton, Reebok/CCM, and Warrior. Many professionals are using composite stick technology rather than wooden sticks. These new sticks are lighter and provide a quicker release of the puck, resulting in a harder, more accurate shot. Although the new materials do enable harder shots, the improved durability and lighter materials can make the transition from wooden to composite stick more difficult for less experienced players. A shortcut used by numerous players is to use a weighted system, such as kwik hands, to quickly adjust to the new sticks. More expensive ice hockey sticks (such as the Bauer Vapor APX 2, Bauer Supreme TotalOne NXG, Bauer Nexus 8000, Reebok 20k, Reebok Ribcore, Easton Stealth RS 2, Easton V9 & V9E, Warrior Covert DX1 [...] ) usually are the lightest sticks on the market (390-470 grams in a senior stick). In addition to the increased torque that these composite sticks possess, the sticks do not warp or absorb moisture like their wooden counterparts.|$|E

40|$|In the ﬁeld of turbomachinery, {{vibration}} amplitude is often reduced by dissipating the kinetic {{energy of the}} blades with devices that utilize dry friction. Under-platform dampers, for example, are often placed in the underside of two consecutive turbine blades. Dampers are kept {{in contact with the}} under-platform of the respective blades by means of the cen-trifugal force. If the damper is well designed, vibration of blades instigate a relative motion between the under-platform and the damper. A friction force, that is a non-conservative force, arises in the contact and partly dissipates the vibration energy. Several contact mod-els are available in the literature to simulate the contact between the damper and the under-platform. However, the actual dynamics of the blade-damper interaction have not fully understood yet. Several test rigs have been previously developed to experimentally investigate the performance of under-platform dampers. The majority of these experimen-tal setups aim to evaluate the overall damper efﬁciency in terms of reduction in response amplitude of the blade for a given exciting force that simulates the aerodynamic loads. Unfortunately, the experimental data acquired on the blade dynamics do not provide enough information to understand the damper dynamics. Therefore, the uncertainty on the damper behavior remains a big issue. In this work, a novel experimental test rig has been developed to extensively investigate the damper dynamic behavior. A single <b>replaceable</b> <b>blade</b> is clamped in the rig with a speci-ﬁc clamping device. With this device the blade root is pressed against a groove machined in the test rig. The pushing force is controllable and measurable, to better simulate the actual centrifugal load acting on the blade. Two dampers, one {{on each side of the}} blade, are in con-tact with the blade under-platforms and with platforms on force measuring supports. These supports have been speciﬁcally designed to measure the contact forces on the dam-per. The contact forces on the blade are computed by post processing the measured forces and assuming the static equilibrium of the damper. The damper kinematics is rebuilt by using the relative displacement, measured with a differential laser, between the damper and the blade under-platform. This article describes the main concepts behind this new approach and explains the design and working of this novel test rig. Moreover, the inﬂuence of the damper contact forces on the dynamic behavior of the blade is discussed in the result section...|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a modular {{propeller}} is to provide more user control on boat rally speed. Each modular propeller made of composite materials has three main parts: the hub part with a front-end cap, a set of <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades,</b> and a rear joint to the shaft. The propeller blade parts assembly into slides of the hub requires not professional assistance, but desscrewing a high quality bronze to remove cone. The blade` bottom joint part of composite blades must be compatible by manufacturer design to overall license the blade assembly for use.|$|R

50|$|The macuahuitl {{had many}} {{drawbacks}} in combat versus European steel swords. Despite being objectively sharper, prismatic obsidian is also considerably more brittle and fragile than steel: obsidian blades {{of the type}} used on the macuahuitl tended to shatter on impact with other obsidian blades, steel swords or plate armor, and also have severe difficulty penetrating European ring mail. The thin, <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades</b> used on the macuahuitl were also easily dulled or chipped by repeated impacts on bone or wood, making artful use of the weapon critical. It takes more time to lift and swing a club {{than it does to}} thrust with a sword. More space is needed as well, so warriors advanced in loose formations and fought in single combat.|$|R
50|$|Straight razors {{eventually}} {{fell out}} of fashion. Their first challenger was manufactured by King C. Gillette: a double-edged safety razor with <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades.</b> These new safety razors did not require any serious tutelage to use. The blades were extremely hard to sharpen, and {{were meant to be}} thrown away after one use, and rusted quickly if not discarded. They also required a smaller initial investment, although they cost more over time. Despite its long-term advantages, the straight razor lost significant market share. As shaving became less intimidating and men began to shave themselves more, the demand for barbers providing straight razor shaves decreased.Since 2012, production of straight razors has increased multifold. Straight razor sales are increasing globally and manufacturers have difficulty satisfying demand. Straight razor sales are increasing because they are perceived as a better value and more efficient product.|$|R
5000|$|A rib spreader, {{also known}} as Finochietto {{retractor}}, {{is a type of}} retractor specifically designed to separate ribs in thoracic surgery. Rack-and-pinion-type stainless steel rib spreaders (with a thumb-screw to lock it in place) were an innovation introduced by French surgeon Theodore Truffier in 1914. This was modified in 1936 by Argentinian surgeon Enrique Finochietto to have [...] blades (blades with [...] "windows") and a hand-cranked lever to both separate the arms in a staged fashion and lock them in place at each stop. The Burford-Finochietto rib speader has <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades.</b> [...] The Truffier and especially the Burford-Finochietto (and its variants) are ubiquitous in open thoracic surgery, which accounts for over 90% of thoracic surgeries. Minimally invasive thoracic techniques (such as VATS and teleoperated surgical machines) have yet to prove superior, despite decades of development. Recently, a new intelligent, automated rib spreader in development demonstrated results superior to the Finochietto-style retractors.|$|R

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{wire stripper}} was first patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades,</b> and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism {{to return to the}} rest position. The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the rest position while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|R
50|$|Ontario knife {{company is}} most {{well known as}} a {{supplier}} of military knives.

50|$|The largest {{construction}} or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades,</b> made of either die-cast metal or molded plastic. Some use standard razor blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust {{how far the}} blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife {{can be used to}} cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray. The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.|$|R
5000|$|From 2001 to 2003, Brocade {{released}} switches {{based on}} its third generation ASIC, [...] "BLOOM" [...] (Big LOOM). BLOOM introduced increased throughput of 2 Gbit/s instead of 1 Gbit/s.

The 12000 represented several internal architecture and technical changes besides the new ASIC: it had an upgraded control processor architecture (Intel i960 moved to PowerPC 405GP), changed the embedded operating system (FOS v4.0 migrated from Wind River Systems VxWorks to MontaVista Linux), and introduced the backplane architecture (hierarchical PCI buses with <b>replaceable</b> <b>blades</b> attached to a backplane). The Bloom ASIC also introduced a notable capability of frame-level Fibre Channel trunking, which provided high throughput with load balancing across multiple cables. It needed to be implemented in the ASIC hardware to ensure in-order delivery of frames. Also hot firmware upgrade was introduced with FOS v4.1 in October 2003.|$|R
