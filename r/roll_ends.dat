50|$|The FACIT ECM 64, {{manufactured}} by Swedish company Facit AB, is {{a prototype of}} carousel memory. To avoid having a single, long magnetic tape, it instead has 64 small rolls of 9 meters each, with 1.6-cm wide tape on each roll, divided into 8 channels per roll. The tape speed is 5 m/s. To read a particular roll, the carousel rotates so the desired <b>roll</b> <b>ends</b> up at the bottom. A counterweight sits at the free end of the tape, and facilitates the roll in moving out and down into a mechanism with a read-and-write head. The tape is then rewound. The average seek time is 2 seconds and the storage space is 2560 kilobytes. The control system is operated by transistors. Both the carousel and individual spools are replicable.|$|E

50|$|If {{the plate}} is not {{finished}} on singles, or without doubling the plate over, it is doubled {{over in a}} squeezer. The squeezer was like a table where {{one half of the}} surface folds over {{on top of the other}} and a press flattens the doubled over plate so the <b>rolled</b> <b>end</b> will fit in the rollers. It is then reheated for another set of rolling. This is repeated until the desired geometry is reached. Note that if the plate needs to be doubled over more than once the <b>rolled</b> <b>end</b> is sheared off. The pack is then allowed to cool. When cool, the pack is sheared slightly undersized from the final dimensions and the plates separated by openers.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are a few}} stamps of this series—all {{dating from}} 1923—with {{features}} that set them apart from the normal sheet stamps discussed and charted above, although at first glance they may seem identical to the standard products. Ranging from moderately to extremely rare, these are so-called [...] "coil waste" [...] and [...] "sheet waste" [...] issues. That is to say, they were produced from stamps left over after the long rotary-printed rolls of paper had been cut into normal sized coils or sheets (the <b>roll</b> <b>ends</b> being {{too small to be}} processed for coils or sheets with the standard equipment).

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} axisymmetric winding {{model for}} wound rolls of thin web is devel-oped. The model accounts for radial and axial displacements and radial, circumferential, axial and shear stresses. The roll build-up is modeled as an incremental accretion process. The material behaviour of the roll is considered as hyperelastic, orthotropic and radially nonlinear. The numerical solution is developed using the {{finite element method}} and the total Lagrangian formulation. The model is applied to the winding of paper rolls. It is shown that centrifugal forces may considerably affect the resulting stress distributions. For nonzero Poisson’s ratios significant edge effects in the roll stresses are found. In particu-lar, high shear stresses and shear stress gradients are discovered {{in the vicinity of the}} core near the <b>roll</b> <b>ends.</b> A remarkable stress leveling phenomenon is found where the effect of a non-constant incoming web tension is evened out in the roll axial direction. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the cold}} {{inflation}} scenario, the slow roll inflation and reheating via coherent rapid oscillation, are usually considered as two distinct eras. When the slow <b>roll</b> <b>ends,</b> a rapid oscillation phase begins and the inflaton decays to relativistic particles reheating the Universe. In another model dubbed warm inflation, the rapid oscillation phase is suppressed, {{and we are}} left with only a slow roll period during which the reheating occurs. Instead, in this paper, we propose a new picture for inflation in which the slow roll era is suppressed and only the rapid oscillation phase exists. Radiation generation during this era is taken into account, so we have warm inflation with an oscillatory inflaton. To provide enough e-folds, we employ the non-minimal derivative coupling model. We study the cosmological perturbations and compute the temperature at the end of warm oscillatory inflation. Comment: 22 pages, typos fixed, accepted by EPJ...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted {{related to the}} dimensional stability of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) in landfill applications. Multiple occurrences of panel separation of overlap seams in GCLs have been documented; however, explanation for the relative contribution of various mechanisms causing shrinkage has been limited. A systematic test program was conducted {{to determine the effects}} of a variety of conditions on GCL dimensional stability. Effects of initial moisture content, permeant type, and overburden pressure were tested by subjecting various GCL products to wet-dry cycles and measuring the dimensional change with each cycle. Different GCL types were each tested under various combinations of initial moisture content (as-received, 50, 75, 100, and 125 %), permeant types (tap water, distilled water, and 0. 1 M CaCl 2), and overburden pressures (0, 6, and 20 kPa). Thermal expansion tests were conducted by heating or cooling GCL test specimens to temperatures of 0, 10, 40, 60, and 80 °C at constant moisture content. Subgrade tests were conducted by placing GCL test specimens on compacted clay and sand subgrades in different orientations and hydration conditions in sealed containers and measuring dimensional change over time. Mechanical necking tests were conducted by subjecting GCL specimens to varying levels of tension and measuring the longitudinal and transverse strains at each load increment. Field simulation tests were conducted by placing specimens on a compacted sand subgrade beneath an exposed geomembrane liner outdoors in late summer. Initial moisture content tests resulted in shrinkage strains as high as 20 % after 20 wet-dry cycles. GCLs ranged from slightly anisotropic [approximately 1. 1 : 1 ratio of machine (MD) to cross-machine (XMD) shrinkage] to highly anisotropic (approximately 3 : 1 ratio of MD to XMD shrinkage). Most combinations of GCL type and initial moisture content resulted in GCL MD shrinkage strains greater than a value that would cause panel separation (termed panel separation threshold, PST) at <b>roll</b> <b>ends</b> during the first wet-dry cycle. All test specimens contracted beyond the PST in the MD within 3 wet-dry cycles. GCL specimens without attached geomembranes contracted beyond the PST in the XMD within 5 cycles. Permeant type tests demonstrated that hydration with 0. 1 M CaCl 2 reduced shrinkage by 50 - 80 % compared to permeation with tap water. Overburden tests demonstrated that applying 6 kPa and 20 kPa reduced specimen shrinkage by at least 60 % and 80 %, respectively. Thermal expansion tests indicated that temperature changes at constant moisture content had little effect on GCL dimensional stability. Subgrade tests demonstrated that subgrade type and moisture as well as GCL type and orientation had effects on dimensional stability. Tensile necking tests demonstrated that transverse shrinkage occurred due to tensile forces in GCLs, but shrinkage was nearly always less than PST. Field simulation tests demonstrated that wet-dry cycles in the field were less intense and/or less frequent than in the laboratory. Results of this testing provide a basis for GCL overlap specifications necessary to maintain full coverage and future research to confirm a suggested method of preconditioning bentonite to prevent shrinkage...|$|E

30|$|Roll {{flattening}} is {{an important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll flattening calculation. However, the roll flattening calculated by traditional flattening models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll flattening, a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll flattening are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll flattening for different rolling force, flattening width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to <b>roll</b> <b>end</b> and the <b>roll</b> diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll flattening is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the <b>roll</b> <b>end,</b> which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R
