50|$|In {{recent years}} the Pound-Drever-Hall {{technique}} has become a mainstay of laser frequency stabilization. Frequency stabilization is needed for high precision because all lasers demonstrate frequency wander at some level. This instability is primarily due to temperature variations, mechanical imperfections, and laser gain dynamics, which change laser cavity lengths, laser driver current and voltage fluctuations, atomic transition widths, and many other factors. PDH locking offers one possible {{solution to this problem}} by actively tuning the laser to match the resonance condition of a stable <b>reference</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{diaphragm}} is placed between the environment at a variable pressure and a <b>reference</b> <b>cavity</b> {{at a fixed}} pressure, the diaphragm will bend {{in response to a}} pressure differential. As the diaphragm bends, the distance along the surface in compression will increase. A surface acoustic wave pressure sensor simply replaces the diaphragm with a piezoelectric substrate patterned with interdigitated electrodes. Strain and torque work in a similar manner, as application to the sensor will cause a deformation of the piezoelectric substrate. A surface acoustic wave temperature sensor can be fashioned from a piezoelectric substrate with a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion {{in the direction of the}} length of the device.|$|E

40|$|Continuous-wave lasers locked to high-finesse optical <b>reference</b> <b>cavities</b> are {{oscillators}} {{that produce}} ~ 500 THz optical signals with unprecedented stability. Indeed, sub-femtosecond fractional frequency instability at one second averaging {{can now be}} achieved. A self-referenced femtosecond laser frequency comb (FLFC) {{is used as a}} frequency divider to provide a phase-coherent link between optical and microwave domains, dividing the frequency down to the gigahertz range while also transferring the stability of the original signal. Photodetectors then convert the optical pulses into electronic signals. The resultant 10 GHz microwave signals have ultra-low phase noise below - 100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset, surpassing that of traditional microwave oscillators. This new approach offers significant improvement for many applications that rely on stable microwave signals, and may even create new measurement technologies otherwise unachievable with current signal sources. In reality, fundamental and technical sources of noise in each stage of the optical-to-microwave generation process limit the ultimate achievable stability of the signal. Optical <b>reference</b> <b>cavities</b> are limited by environmental effects and thermal fluctuations, and FLFC dividers suffer from intrinsic timing jitter, amplitude noise, and limited stabilization servo bandwidth. However, it is the seemingly straightforward photodetection of optical pulses that proves to be the limiting factor in the ultimate noise floor of these signals. In this thesis, I describe the noise limitations of each part of the optical-to-microwave scheme, particularly focusing on the noise limitations of photodetection. I will give a basic representation of these photodetection noise phenomena in terms of the physical behavior of optically-generated electrons in semiconductor photodiodes. The two main photodetection noise phenomena [...] shot noise and amplitude-to-phase conversion [...] will be thoroughly characterized in the context of generation of 10 GHz low phase noise signals.
