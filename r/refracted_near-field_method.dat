40|$|Selectively buried ion-exchanged waveguides {{in glass}} are {{investigated}} theoretically and experimentally {{for use in}} low-loss coupling to other optical media. Selectively buried waveguides (SBWGs) are integrated optic structures in which light makes a transition from a buried waveguide with a maximum refractive index that lies 5 - 20 μm beneath the glass surface to a surface section with a maximum refractive index that lies {{at or near the}} surface. The buried sections provide low propagation losses and convenient coupling to optical fibers. Surface sections allow interaction between the guided mode and a superstrate material; in these sections the glass and superstrate form a composite waveguide in which the optical field propagates in both materials as a single optical mode. Adiabatic transition regions connect buried and surface sections. SBWGs are modelled by use of the finite difference method. The refractive index profile is first computed. The mode profiles and effective indices of the modes that the waveguide supports are then solved. The beam propagation method is applied to determine how the mode changes as it propagates through the SBWG. The transition from a buried to a surface waveguide is modelled, and it is found that the transition is adiabatic and low-loss. The surface section is modelled with a polymer superstrate, and the confinement factor in the polymer is computed. Ag⁺/K⁺ ion exchange is used to fabricate SBWGs, and a thorough experimental investigation of their properties is conducted. Refractive index profiles in buried, surface, and transition regions are measured by use of the <b>refracted</b> <b>near-field</b> <b>method,</b> and it is demonstrated that the maximum refractive index lies approximately 20 μm beneath the surface in buried regions and approximately 3 μm beneath the surface in surface regions.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we report}} {{the results of}} our {{experimental}} and theoretical studies of the optical properties of large core step index (SI) plastic optical fibers (POF) and graded index (GI) POFs. A set of criteria and analyses of physical parameters are developed in context to the major issues of POF applications in short-distance communication systems. Analyses are presented to show how the measured POF optical attenuation affects the overall performance in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and how use of perfluorinated polymers can overcome limitations inherent to current POF materials. Results of POF optical bandwidth measurements by direct picosecond time domain methods are reported and their relationship to refractive index profiles theoretically analyzed by the WKB and finite-element methods. Two high resolution optical techniques of <b>refracted</b> <b>near-field</b> and transverse interferometric methods are presented and used to measure the index profiles of large core POFs. Results reveal that the index profile of current GI POF is not parabolic, but consists of two markedly different regions. Analysis of the index profile reveals that strong mode coupling increases the GI POF bandwidth from its profile-determined value of 0. 43 GHz to its measured value of 3. 0 GHz for 100 m. We further study mode coupling effect inside POFs through various experimental techniques, including pulse broadening-length dependence measurements and far-field radiation pattern measurements. ...|$|R

The versatility of labeling target structures with fluorescent dyes permits to visualize {{structure and function}} at a subcellular resolution with a wide field of view.

40|$|Intravascular {{ultrasound}} (IVUS) is {{a medical}} imaging modality aimed at imaging blood vessel walls from within the vessel. Current commercial IVUS catheters are designed to yield two-dimensional cross-sectional images perpendicular to the vessel wall. By pulling the catheter back through the artery (in the ‘axial direction’), and stacking the resulting cross-sectional images, a three-dimensional image of the artery can be obtained. However, in non-stationary blood vessels like, e. g., the coronary arteries, artery motion {{is added to the}} pullback motion, and as a result consecutively obtained cross-sectional images are not necessarily acquired in neighbouring positions. Therefore, IVUS measurements are electrogated to ensure proper localisation of the consecutive cross-sectional images. Unfortunately, the radiation pattern of commercial catheters is very narrow, which, combined with a high pullback rate, leads to severe spatial undersampling in the axial direction. Consequently, the data is incomplete and motion compensation attempts are unsuccessful. Instead, in this work the design of an axial IVUS array is presented. With the array, three-dimensional volumes rather than cross-sectional planes are imaged in each pullback position. If the imaged volume is large enough, overlap between images from consecutive electrogated measurements can be achieved. This enables motion compensation techniques, as well as the acquisition of continuous, correct three-dimensional images of artery sections. In order to assess the image quality of the resulting prototype design, software has been developed which models linear acoustic propagation through inhomogeneous soft tissue. The resulting scattering {{is not limited to the}} Born approximation. The governing frequency domain integral equation is solved iteratively using a parallelised Fortran implementation, which is accurate to within several percent when compared to analytical solutions. Arbitrary contrasts in both compressibility and volume density of mass, as well as arbitrary transducer configurations can be treated. Unfortunately, where contrasts extend the numerical domain boundaries, spurious reflections are generated. These reflections are suppressed by a factor of one hundred or more using a frequency domain scatter integral equation formulation of a perfectly matched layer, while virtually no reflections occur off this attenuative layer. Both the scatter simulation software and the design of an ultrasound array require the accurate and efficient computation of incident pressure fields generated by a (piston) transducer. Five methods are compared in efficiency and accuracy, viz. the Rayleigh integral, the impulse response <b>method,</b> the fast <b>near-field</b> <b>method,</b> the fast <b>near-field</b> <b>method</b> combined with time-space decomposition, and a frequency domain formulation of the latter time-space decomposition method. The frequency domain formulation has been derived to extend the validity of the time-space decomposition method. To reach the same accuracy, the fast <b>near-field</b> <b>method</b> and time-space decomposition easily yield a speed-up factor of more than one hundred when compared to the Rayleigh integral, and the maximum attainable accuracy is significantly higher for these methods. Note that, apart from the Rayleigh integral, all methods assume piston behaviour of the transducer. The fast <b>near-field</b> <b>method</b> was used to design an optimal axial IVUS array given the constraints in dimensions, frequency, penetration depth and sensitivity. The resulting array consists of eight elements of dimensions 100 µm by 350 µm, with an interelement kerf of 100 µm, and operates at 20 MHz. Using the scatter simulation software, the expected image quality is simulated, and significant improvements over the image quality of a current commercial catheter are achieved. The array prototype was fabricated in-house by first fabricating piezo-electric wafers including matching and backing layers. Next, the electrical connections were made, and finally the separate elements were diced from the wafer. The resulting array contains almost identical elements operating at 21 MHz, with a fractional bandwidth of 80 % or more. Using far-field pressure field measurements, the transducer surface velocity distribution was computed using an iterative inversion scheme. From this measurement it followed that, despite the complicated construction, the elements vibrate independently, and that motion is spatially confined to the actively driven regions. Using both reference phantoms and a bovine artery, the image quality of the array prototype was compared to that of a conventional single element IVUS catheter. In the radial and axial direction the array yields a significantly higher image quality, while in the circumferential direction a similar image quality was obtained. With the array prototype, contrast boundaries are smoothly and continuously imaged in the axial direction, and local events are properly localised. In addition, using the array prototype both the wires of a stent phantom and the structure behind the wires can be imaged, whereas using a conventional single element transducer only the wires are visible, and smeared out in the axial direction.

Compared with previously proposed <b>near-field</b> <b>methods</b> of acoustic superresolution, in {{this work}} we describe how far-field superresolution can be obtained using an acoustic vortex wave antenna. This is accomplished by leveraging the recent advances in optical vortices {{in conjunction with the}} topological diversity of a leaky wave antenna design. In particular, the use of an acoustic vortex wave antenna eliminates the need for a complicated phased array consisting of multiple active elements, and enables a superresolving aperture to be achieved with a single simple acoustic source and total aperture size less than a wavelength in diameter. A theoretical formulation is presented for the design of an acoustic vortex wave antenna with arbitrary planar arrangement, and explicit expressions are developed for the radiated acoustic pressure field. This geometric versatility enables variously-shaped acoustic vortex patterns to be achieved, which propagate from the near-field into the far-field through an arrangement of stable integer mode vortices.

Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless gelatin and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection. He was thus the inventor of true interferential colour photography. He received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for this breakthrough.Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned {{a few years after}} its discovery. One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to spectroscopic applications. Early in 1933, Ives proposed to use a photoelectric device to probe stationary waves to make spectrometric measurements. In 1995, P.

40|$|When light {{passes through}} a hole smaller than the {{wavelength}} of the light, the transmission is very low and the light is diffracted. This however changes if holes are arranged in a periodic array on metal. In that case the light couples to surface plasmons; this results in enhanced transmission, spectral selection and a small angular diffraction. We develop a novel microscopic method based on a periodic hole-array, which {{will be used as}} a multiple-apertures near-field source for illuminating a biological sample while the light is collected in far-field. The measurement speed is high, due to the use of an array instead of a single source. The main advantage of this microscope originates from the low diffraction of light through a relatively thick sample with enhanced transmission. It results in the ability to measure the samples interior and 3 D reconstruction can be made by semi-confocal techniques.
