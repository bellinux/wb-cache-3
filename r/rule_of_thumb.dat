5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep that remain {{on the island of}} Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E
5|$|A simple <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is {{that for}} {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is {{in the opposite direction}} of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

The rules and indices are used to predict scale formation and in many cases, to determine the maximum concentration ratio for a tower’s operation, and the control pH. Indices and <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> are a way to estimate scale prediction when more rigorous, and accurate, methods are not available or practical. The availability of high powered Pentium class calculation power, and ion association model software for water chemistry modeling and prediction, have made more precise calculations economical for even the smallest water treater. This paper reviews common water treatment <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> their origin, and compares them to ion association model saturation indices.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} problem solving of general {{practitioners}} (GPs), which is explored with different methods and from different perspectives. The general {{aim was to}} explore and describe <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and to analyse the management of respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTI and UTI) in general practice in Sweden. The results are based upon focus group interviews concerning <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> and a prospective diagnosis-prescription study concerning the management of patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI or UTI. In addition unpublished data are given from structured telephone interviews concerning specific <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> in acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. GPs were able to verbalize their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> which could be called tacit knowledge. A specific set <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> was used for rapid assessment when emergency and psychosocial problems were identified. Somatic problems {{seemed to be the}} expected, normal state. In the further consultation the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> seemed to be used in an act of balance between the individual and the general perspective. There was considerable variation between the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> <b>of</b> different GPs for patients with acute sinusitis and prevailing cough. In their <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> the GPs seemed to integrate their medical knowledge and practical experience of the consultation. A high number of near-patient antigen tests to probe Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A tests) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests were performed in patients, where testing was not recommended. There was only a slight decrease in antibiotic prescribing in patients allocated a diagnosis of RTI examined with CRP in comparison with patients not tested. In general, the GPs in Sweden adhered to current guidelines for antibiotic prescribing. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (PcV) was the preferred antibiotic for most patients allocated a diagnosis of respiratory tract infection. In conclusion, the use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> might explain why current practices prevail in spite of educational efforts. One way to change practice could be to identify and evaluate <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> used by GPs and disseminate well adapted <b>rules.</b> The use <b>of</b> diagnostic tests in patients with infectious illnesses in general practice needs critical appraisal before introduction as well as continuing surveillance. The use <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> by GPs might be one explanation for variation in practice and irrational prescribing of antibiotics in patients with infectious conditions.

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so unusual for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of}} these advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

In the case of portfolio choice, I find that optimal linear age rules lead to modest welfare losses relative to the dynamic programming solution and that a linear rule based on the ratio of financial wealth to total lifetime resources performs even better. Consumption rules generate larger welfare losses—from 1 – 8 % of annual consumption—but an effective rule is to consume 70 – 80 % of annuitized lifetime wealth...|$|R
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper {{provides}} {{the rationale for}} the Guideline Daily Amounts (GDAs) for fat, saturated fat and other nutrients that appear on food labels in the UK. These GDAs are provided voluntarily by manufacturers and retailers and were developed to help people make better use of nutrition labelling [...] the format of which is prescribed by the European Union's nutrition labelling directive. The paper also describes the basis to some <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> for what counts as 'a lot' or 'a little' of fat, saturated fat and other nutrients, in an individual food. DESIGN: The paper gives the background to, and purpose of, the GDAs and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> and explains how they were calculated. It briefly describes their subsequent usage by food producers and others. RESULTS: Both GDAs and the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> first appeared in a leaflet developed by the authors and published in 1996 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. GDAs for fat, saturated fat and energy were adopted subsequently by the Institute of Grocery Distribution and then by many retailers and some manufacturers. The <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> for fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium have recently been republished in some leaflets published by the Food Standards Agency in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: GDAs and <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> may provide useful ways of helping consumers make sense of nutrition labelling. The current GDAs and the <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thumb</b> could usefully be updated in the light of recent developments...|$|R
