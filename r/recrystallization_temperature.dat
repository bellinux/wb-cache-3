50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the <b>recrystallization</b> <b>temperature</b> of the material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually {{large pieces of}} metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as slabs, blooms, and billets. If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired soaking pit for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the <b>recrystallization</b> <b>temperature.</b> To maintain a safety factor a finishing temperature is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the <b>recrystallization</b> <b>temperature.</b> If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|E

40|$|Dilatometric {{techniques}} {{were used to}} build the continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram for a medium carbon microalloyed steel; the microstructure and hardness were determined at different cooling rates. The mechanical behavior of the steel in the austenite field and at temperatures approaching austenite to ferrite transformation was measured by means of hot torsion tests under isothermal and continuous cooling conditions. The no <b>recrystallization</b> <b>temperatures,</b> Tnr, and start of phase transformation, Ar 3, were determined under continuous cooling condition using mean flow stress vs. inverse of absolute temperature diagrams. Interruption of static recrystallization within the interpass time in the austenite field indicated that the start of vanadium carbonitride precipitation occurred under 860 °C. Austenite transformation was found to start at around 710 °C, a temperature similar to that measured by dilatometry, suggesting that interphase precipitation delays the transformation of deformed austenite. Pearlite was observed at temperatures ranging from 650 °C to 600 °C, with the flow curves taking on a particular shape, i. e., stress rose sharply as strain was increased, reaching peak stress at low deformation, around 0. 2, followed by an extensive softening region after peak stress...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effectiveness of equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) and annealing to improve the grain morphology and mechanical properties of electron-beam remelted pure niobium. Extrusions were performed at room temperature with a 90 o die. Routes 1 A, 2 C, 4 E and 8 E were investigated with duplicate billets undergoing routes 1 A, 2 C and 4 E to determine reproducibility. Niobium proved to be very workable during the ECAE process. Hardness increased most dramatically after the first pass and leveled off thereafter. <b>Recrystallization</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the Reference Metals material ranged {{from a low of}} 800 o C for routes 2 C, 4 E and 8 E to a high of 1000 o C for route 1 A. For the Wah Chang material, the <b>recrystallization</b> <b>temperatures</b> ranged from a low of 800 o C for the 4 E ECAE processed material to a high of 950 o C for the asreceived material. The initial grain size and orientation have been hypothesized to be influential on recrystallized grain morphology for ECAE/annealing processed niobium. Smaller initial grains produce a smaller and more homogeneous recrystallized grain microstructure. The average grain diameters for the recrystallized 4 E ECAE processed Wah Chang material are 13 ???? 6. 3 mm for the 1000 o C annealed state (no banding) and are 21 ???? 9. 5 mm for the 1100 o C annealed state (no banding). Reference Metals material that underwent route 4 E and annealed at 1000 o C resulted in an average grain diameter of 28 mm for billet 2 (banding) and an average grain diameter of 32 mm for billet 19 (slight banding). Reference Metals material that underwent route 8 E (no banding) annealed at 1000 o C resulted in an average grain diameter of 36 mm. Reference Metals material that underwent route 4 E samples annealed at 1100 o C resulted in an average grain diameter of 26 mm for billet 2 (banding) and an average grain diameter of 43 mm for billet 19 (slight banding). Route 8 E (significant banding) annealed at 1100 o C resulted in an average grain diameter of 29 mm. Strain failure decreases from the as-cast material to the worked/recrystallized material while the 0. 2 % yield stress and ultimate tensile strength increase from the as-cast material to the worked/recrystallized material. Long sub-grains are created in the as-worked material after one and two passes and become more broken up after four passes. Sub-grain boundary angles increase with increasing strain.

40|$|Three {{episodes of}} {{alteration}} of the Woodsreef harzburgite were identified based on cross-cutting relationships in outcrop and on mineral assemblages, textures and 6180 values.
