5000|$|The center cut or {{pork loin}} chop {{includes}} a large T-shaped bone, and is structurally {{similar to the}} beef T-bone steak. Rib chops come from the <b>rib</b> <b>portion</b> of the loin, and are similar to rib eye steaks. Blade or shoulder chops come from the spine, and tend to contain much connective tissue. The sirloin chop is taken from the (rear) leg end and also contains much connective tissue. The shoulder end produces chops that are considerably fattier than the chops taken from the loin end. [...] The so-called [...] "Iowa Chop" [...] is a thick center cut; the term was coined in 1976 by the Iowa Pork Producers Association. A [...] "Bacon Chop" [...] is cut from the shoulder end and leaves the pork belly meat attached. Pork chops are sometimes sold marinated to add flavor; marinades such as a chili sauce or a barbecue sauce are common. As pork is often cooked more thoroughly than beef, thus running the risk of drying out the meat, pork chops can be brined to maintain moistness. One could also wrap their pork chops in bacon to add further moistness during the cooking process.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. In the manufacture of fully-fashioned knitted outerwear, it is usual for the garment sections to be constructed with a lower <b>rib</b> <b>portion</b> on to which is knitted a fashioned section of plain knitting. The majority of fully fashioned knitting machines are capable of producing only the plain fabric section, the <b>rib</b> <b>portion</b> being knitted separately on V-bed machines. In order to knit the plain section of the garment pieces on to the rib, each loop of the rib must be transferred to a corresponding knitting element on the fully fashioned knitting machine. It is common practice within the knitwear industry to perform this transfer manually, each loop of a slack course in the rib being impaled on {{to a point of}} a magazine bar, the excess courses of knitting being unroved as waste. The loops are then transferred from this bar, via a feeding bar on to the knitting elements of the fully-fashioned machine. This manual transfer of the loops is both tedious and expensive in terms of labour. However, there are recently developed machines on the market which will knit the rib and transfer it automatically to a magazine bar but they are both expensive and also render the existing plant obsolete. This thesis describes the concept, design and development of a novel patented automatic rib transfer system which relies on the relatively inexpensive modification of existing V-bed knitting machines. The modifications are aimed at providing a sub-assembly attachment suitable for a variety of V-bed knitting machines. Bars loaded automatically by these modified machines may be fed to any fully-fashioned knitting machine via a specially developed "gauge-changing" device to alter the pitch of the loops from that of the V-bed machine to that of the fully-fashioned machine. These automatically loaded bars may also be used to feed either a modern semi-automatic "linking system", such as the Boehringer Autolinker, or, in certain cases a conventional linking dial. NOTE. The term 'rib transfer' is used {{in the context of this}} thesis to describe the operation of transferring a knitted rib from a V-bed knitting machine to a straight bar knitting machine...|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} specimen, AODF 836, {{was described}} in 2016. It includes portions of the skull, including a left squamosal, nearly complete braincase, right surangular, and various fragments.

50|$|The Ruark {{has been}} {{extensively}} rebuilt, with her keel, keelson, some <b>ribs</b> and <b>portions</b> of the centerboard trunk believed to be original. She does, however, retain her original appearance, with some concessions to the passenger excursion trade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shell is}} broadly fusiform. The {{posterior}} two-fifths of the whorls between the sutures shows a strongly excavated channel.The anterior three-fifths {{are marked by}} 10-12 prominent, broad, low, rounded, somewhat protractive axial ribs which are truncated posteriorly by the channel, their terminations forming cusps. The intercostal spaces are about twice {{as wide as the}} <b>ribs.</b> The <b>ribbed</b> <b>portions</b> of the whorls on the spire are covered by five, equal and equally spaced, incised, spiral lines. The summit of the whorls are appressed, rendering the sutures ill defined. The base of the body whorl is moderately long, marked by the feeble continuations of the axial ribs and on the posterior half by five incised spiral lines equaling those on the spire in strength and spacing and forming a continuous series with them. The anterior portion of the base shows about seven ill-defined spiral lirations. The aperture is narrowly elongate pyriform. The sinus is shallow immediately below the sutures. The outer lip is somewhat sinuous. The columella is strong, slightly sigmoid. The coloration of the type consists of a creamy white ground, which is almost unmarked in the subsutural channel and on the anterior half of the base on the last turn. A few dots of brownish orange appear near the summit between the ribs of the preceding whorls. The <b>ribbed</b> <b>portion</b> of the whorl between the anterior and posterior portion of the base is strongly mottled with brownish orange in the intercostal spaces, less so on the summits of the ribs, while a little posterior to the middle the base is marked by two slender spiral lines of the same color.|$|R
50|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Savannasaurus, AODF 660, {{was discovered in}} 2005 on the Belmont sheep station by David Elliot, founder of Australian Age of Dinosaurs. The Belmont sheep station, northeast of Winton, Queensland, {{is part of the}} upper Winton Formation which has been dated to the Cenomanian-Turonian (93.9 mya) based on detritial zircons. One of the holotype's metatarsals was originally thought to have belonged to a theropod, but later excavations revealed the remainder of the skeleton. The specimen consists of several cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, several <b>ribs,</b> <b>portions</b> of the shoulder girdle including a coracoid and both sternal plates, parts of the forelimbs including the feet, several elements of the hip, and bones from the hind foot, along with various fragments. The specimen was encased in a single concretion.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the causes}} of digital {{ischemia}} and necrosis are diverse in women, the most common etiology is connective tissue disease. We describe a patient with scleroderma who presented with arm ischemia secondary to arterial embolization from thoracic outlet syndrome. Her sublavian artery was compressed by the anterior scalene muscle and a cervical rib, leading to a stenosis with poststenotic dilation of the artery. Within the aneurysmal formation was a thrombus, which was probably {{the source of the}} distal embolization. The patient underwent surgical resection of the cervical and first <b>rib.</b> The abnormal <b>portion</b> of the subclavian artery was resected and replaced with an interposition graft...|$|R
40|$|When an {{orthotropic}} {{composite slab}} cast on steel decking {{is subjected to}} fire attack, there is a decreasing temperature gradient from the bottom surface to the top surface. In addition, the temperature within the continuous upper portion of the slab varies in the horizontal sense due {{to the presence of}} the ribs. This makes it different from a flat slab. In this study, using a layered 9 -noded iso-parametric slab element and a 3 -noded beam element, an orthotropic slab element is developed to model orthotropic slabs in fire. The element is assembled from a solid slab element which represents the continuous upper portion of the profile, and a special beam element which represents the <b>ribbed</b> lower <b>portion.</b> An equivalent width for the cross-section of this beam element is determined according to the dimensions of the cross-section of the ribbed profile, and the beam shares the nodes of the solid slab element. Slight modifications are applied to the slab and beam models. The temperature within each layer of the slab element can vary between adjacent Gauss integration points so as to reflect the temperature gradients in the horizontal plane. It is reasonable to ignore the torsional resistance of the beam element, because it actuall...|$|R

Several fire tests on composite slabs have been modelled to validate the approach. Cases of orthotropic slabs with wide range of parameters defining the ribbed profile have been studied, which show that the orthotropic slab model is robust and effective in reflecting the influence of the shape of ribs on the thermal and structural performance of the slabs in fire. The study shows the influence of decking shape on the thermal and structural behaviours of orthotropic slabs. A simple evaluation method fo...|$|R
30|$|This {{work was}} {{approved}} by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of Shandong Agricultural University and carried out in accordance with the “Guidelines for Experimental Animals” of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Beijing, PR China). The experimental cohort consisted of 30 castrated boars composed of equal numbers of three breeds: Laiwu (LW), Lulai Black (LL), and Large Whites (LY). All pigs were housed at Laiwu Breeder Pig Farm Co. Ltd. (Laiwu city, Shandong Province, China) and fed a diet formulated to meet current nutritional requirements (NRC 1998). On the day of slaughter, the mean weight of the pigs was 114  ±  2  kg. Samples were collected from the longissimus dorsi muscle at the last <b>rib</b> and a <b>portion</b> of the muscle tissue. Afterward, the remaining samples were stored at − 80  °C for further analysis.|$|R
5000|$|The rosette {{and lower}} {{pitchers}} are bulbous {{in the lower}} part and [...] in the middle, becoming wider towards the mouth. They are smaller than their aerial counterparts, reaching only 10 cm high by 4 cm wide. Lower pitchers are rarely seen, as the plant quickly enters the climbing stage. A pair of fringed wings runs {{down the front of}} each pitcher, although these are often reduced and only present in the upper portion of the pitcher cup. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and widens towards the rear. It is up to 12 mm wide and bears prominent teeth and <b>ribs.</b> The inner <b>portion</b> of the peristome accounts for around 62% of its total cross-sectional surface length. On the inner surface, the glandular region covers the basal half of the pitcher; the waxy zone is reduced. The pitcher lid or operculum is approximately [...] in shape. On its underside it possesses a number of very dense fleshy bristles measuring up to 2 cm in length. Other than these distinctive structures, the lid has no appendages. An unbranched spur is inserted near the base of the lid.|$|R
40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} characteristics of microchannel heat sink with secondary oblique channels in alternating direction and rectangular ribs (MC-SOCRR) are studied numerically for Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 100 to 500. The effects of secondary channels and ribs on the Nusselt number and friction factor are investigated. A comparative analysis {{has been conducted}} {{to the performance of}} the proposed design with related geometries such as microchannel with rectangular ribs (MC-RR) and microchannel with secondary oblique channels (MC-SOC). The results emphasized the superiority of overall performance of MC-SOCRR over both MC-RR and MC-SOC. The strategy which pursued by new design is the exploitation of larger flow area which provided by secondary channel to reduce pressure drop caused by ribs. Besides, the existence of the <b>ribs</b> in central <b>portion</b> of the channel is utilized to inject more flow through secondary channels for further enhancement in flow mixing. The effect of three geometrical parameters; relative width of secondary channel (λ) relative rib width (β) and angle of secondary channel (θ) on the convective heat transfer and pressure drop have been investigated. The MC-SOCRR with parameters; λ = 0. 666, β = 0. 5 and angle = 45 ° yields the best overall performance with Pf = 1. 98 at Re = 500...|$|R
40|$|An unusual {{specimen}} showing synostosis of left sided {{first and}} second ribs was encountered during scanning of bones in anatomy department. The ribs were partially fused {{in the region of}} their neck and tubercles, and displayed an osseous tunnel. The tunnel measured 1. 2 cm in length and was directed anterolaterally. The shaft of first rib imperceptibly blended with that of the second and resulted in obliteration of first intercostal space. The maximum width of this conjoint shaft was 3. 6 cm. Superior surface of the rib specimen was marked by a large muscular impression for scalenus medius muscle. The groove for subclavian artery on the superior surface of first rib was prominent. The anterior end of the second <b>rib</b> and a <b>portion</b> of its shaft were separated from the anterior end of first rib by a V-shaped notch. The radiograph of the specimen confirmed the presence of a tunnel between the fused portions of neck and tubercle. Such skeletal abnormalities may be associated with segmentation defects of bony tissues and variations in the disposition of neurovascular structures, thus rendering them vulnerable to compression at the thoracic outlet. The fused ribs affect the chest wall expansion and may result in respiratory complications. Precise knowledge and awareness of such anomalies is important for clinicians, especially for thoracic surgeons and radiologists...|$|R
