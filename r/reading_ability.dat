5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general <b>reading</b> <b>ability,</b> an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Confrontation naming {{tasks are}} useful in the {{assessment}} of children with learning and language disorders. Objectives: The aims of this study were (1) providing longitudinal data on confrontation naming; (2) investigating the role of socioeconomic status (SES), intelligence, age, and gender in confrontation naming; (3) identifying relationship between confrontation naming and <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> (fluency, accuracy, and comprehension). Method: A five-year longitudinal investigation of confrontation naming (i. e., the Boston Naming Test (BNT)) in a nonclinical sample of Italian primary school children was conducted (n = 126), testing them {{at the end of each}} school year, to assess nonverbal intelligence, confrontation naming, and <b>reading</b> <b>abilities.</b> Results: Performance on the BNT emerged as a function of IQ and SES. Significant correlations between confrontation naming and <b>reading</b> <b>abilities,</b> especially comprehension, were found; BNT scores correlated better with reading fluency than with reading accuracy. Conclusions: The longitudinal data obtained in this study are discussed with regard to <b>reading</b> <b>abilities,</b> intelligence, age, gender, and socioeconomic status...|$|R

25|$|Between 2006/7 and 2010/11, {{national}} learning assessments (NLA) {{showed some}} improvement in percentages of children obtaining basic level proficiency in grades 4 and 8. Grade 4 increased from 41% to 43% and grade 8 increased from 37% to 44%. In 2008/09, 63.7% of grade 10 and 55.2% of grade 12 were performing below basic level. By 2011/12, poor performance showed some decrease, although percentages varied between subjects.

40|$|Reading {{is a basic}} {{competence}} {{that students}} have to master to be successful. Despite this fact, recent studies show {{that there may be}} a significant decline in the <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> of college students, one of the most educated segments of any population. This work is a prospecting study regarding the assessment of <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> of college students, namely in the context of Engineering education. Based on an existing screening test for assessing reading difficulties of children and teenagers, this work presents the results obtained by administrating that test to students at a top engineering institution in Portugal. An outcome of this study is the determination of a time range suitable for a massive, time limited, use of the previously mentioned test to assess college students, thus enabling a basic tool that will permit, in future works, to screen <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> in wider college populations. This work also shows evidence that ca. 20 % of college students present a poor reading performance, revealing a strong need for monitoring college students’ <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> along different generations...|$|R
50|$|Phonological {{awareness}} {{is an important}} determiner of success in learning to read and spell. For most children, strong readers have strong phonological awareness, and poor readers have poor phonological awareness skills. Phonological awareness skills in the preschool and kindergarten years also strongly predict how well a child will read in the school years. In addition, interventions to improve phonological awareness abilities lead to significantly improved <b>reading</b> <b>abilities.</b> Phonological awareness instruction improves reading and spelling skills, but the reverse is also true: literacy instruction improves phonological awareness skills. The relationship between phonological awareness and <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> changes over time. All levels of phonological awareness ability (syllable, onset-rhyme, and phoneme) contribute to <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> in the Kindergarten through second grade. However, beyond the second grade, phoneme-level abilities play a stronger role.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 81) This {{study examines}} current research relevant to reading motivation and gender {{to uncover the}} disparity between the <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> of boys and girls. Boys are falling drastically behind their female counterparts in reading, and research indicates that on average, boys are {{a year and a}} half behind girls in the area of <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> (Sullivan, 2009). Many researchers believe this can be attributed to curriculum that does not suit the interests of boys ages four through eleven, therefore decreasing their motivation to read. Perhaps if the content of school books was more relevant to the interests of boys this gap in achievement could be lessened. For this graduate thesis data was analyzed in a unique way from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to determine how parental involvement, teacher engagement, and student reading choices affect <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> in boys and girls. The hypothesis in this study is ??that boys who are more engaged in reading will perform better than those boys who are disengaged, will have a smaller gap between their scores and the girl???s scores, will exhibit more growth than boys who are not engaged, and will close the gap when compared to girl???s <b>reading</b> <b>abilities...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for <b>reading</b> <b>ability</b> 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 72 - 79). This small-scale {{case study}} was conducted to investigate the effects of the guided reading approach on struggling students' <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> and their motivation to read. Four struggling readers from grade three were purposively chosen to participate in the study. The Scholastic Reading Inventory in its two forms, students' documents, teacher observations, running records, individual student reading conferences, and interviews with the students' parents or tutors were used to assess progress in the participants' <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> and determine the effect of guided reading on them. Similarly, teacher observations, conferences, interviews, and the Reading Survey from The Motivation to Read Profile were employed to provide data about students' reading motivation after their participation in the guided reading program. Findings showed that the implementation of guided reading helped struggling students improve their decoding skills, built up their fluency, and increased their motivation to read. It also improved the struggling readers' vocabulary and comprehension skills, albeit to a lesser extent. However, had the program been implemented in grades one and two, it might have yielded better results. Further research is needed to track the effect of guided reading on students' <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> along different grade levels and to explore its effect on the <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> and motivation of students of different genders. 1 bound copy: 89 leaves; ill.; 30 cm.

40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} is a {{very complex}} task that requires different cognitive processes and <b>reading</b> <b>abilities</b> over the life span. There are fewer studies of reading comprehension relative to investigations of word <b>reading</b> <b>abilities.</b> Reading comprehension difficulties, however, have been identified in two common and frequently overlapping childhood disorders: reading disability (RD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The nature of reading comprehension difficulties in these groups remains unclear. The performance of four groups of adolescents (RD, ADHD, comorbid ADHD and RD, and normal controls) was compared on reading comprehension tasks as well as on reading rate and accuracy tasks. Adolescents with RD showed difficulties across most reading tasks, although their comprehension scores were average. Adolescents with ADHD exhibited adequate single word <b>reading</b> <b>abilities.</b> Subtle difficulties were observed, however, on measures of text reading rate and accuracy as well as on silent reading comprehension, but scores remained in the average range. The comorbid group demonstrated similar difficulties to the RD group on word reading accuracy and on reading rate but experienced problems on only silent reading comprehension.
