25|$|The {{north of}} Minas Gerais {{is part of}} the arid sertão of the Nordeste, and is thus subject to {{frequent}} droughts. Recent irrigation projects use the water from the São Francisco river for agriculture; the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state, which is subject to a regular <b>rainfall</b> <b>pattern.</b> The diamond mines of this region, mainly in Diamantina, attracted miners but are now exhausted, and the remaining population lives in poor conditions, especially in the valley of the Jequitinhonha River. The region is, however, known for its high quality cachaça production. Salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage. The main cities of this region are Montes Claros, Teófilo Otoni, Pirapora and Janaúba.|$|E
25|$|Landscape {{change can}} also alter weather patterns. The Congo basin {{used to be}} covered by rainforest, yet an {{expansion}} of savannah in Central Africa has extending the sandy soil area because of deforestation. The generation of oxygen by forest are contributors to the rainfall system. However, deforestation has disrupted the ecosystem services and created an eco-climate issue. The <b>rainfall</b> <b>pattern</b> in this area has been characterized as a heavy rain season and a severe dry season. The missing forest has intensified the already dichotomy climate, increasing the episodes of violent rainfall and extending the dry season. With long dry spells, the vegetation in these areas can become sparse. This results in no soil protection {{during the rainy season}} and creates more soil erosion problems.|$|E
500|$|Vertical {{wind shear}} forces the <b>rainfall</b> <b>pattern</b> around a {{tropical}} cyclone to become highly asymmetric, {{with most of}} the precipitation falling to the left and downwind of the shear vector, or downshear left. [...] In other words, southwesterly shear forces the bulk of the rainfall north-northeast of the center. [...] If the wind shear is strong enough, the bulk of the rainfall will move away from the center leading to what is known as an exposed circulation center. [...] When this occurs, the potential magnitude of rainfall with the tropical cyclone will be significantly reduced.|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} concern over climate change, {{descriptions}} of how <b>rainfall</b> <b>patterns</b> are changing over {{time can be}} useful. Observations of daily rainfall data {{over the last few}} decades provide information on these trends. Generalized linear models are typically used to model patterns in the occurrence and intensity of rainfall. These models describe <b>rainfall</b> <b>patterns</b> for an average year but are more limited when describing long-term trends, particularly when these are potentially non-linear. Generalized additive models (GAMS) provide a framework for modelling non-linear relationships by fitting smooth functions to the data. This paper describes how GAMS can extend the flexibility of models to describe seasonal patterns and long-term trends in the occurrence and intensity of daily rainfall using data from Mauritius from 1962 to 2001. Smoothed estimates from the models provide useful graphical descriptions of changing <b>rainfall</b> <b>patterns</b> over the last 40 years at this location. GAMS are particularly helpful when exploring non-linear relationships in the data. Care is needed to ensure the choice of smooth functions is appropriate for the data and modelling objectives.
