5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Veneto</b> and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{declared}} war on Austria in alliance with Prussia in 1866 and received the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Veneto</b> following their victory. Italian troops entered Rome in 1870, ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power. Italy entered into a Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1882, following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions. However, even if relations with Berlin became very friendly, the alliance with Vienna remained purely formal as the Italians were keen to acquire Trentino and Trieste, corners of Austria-Hungary populated by Italians. So in 1915, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allied Powers, as the western powers promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria-Hungary) for participation that was more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality. Victory in the war gave Italy a permanent seat in the Council of the League of Nations.|$|E

25|$|The Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{region is}} bordered by the Alps {{to the north}} {{separating}} it from Austria. Slovenia borders the region on {{the east and the}} Italian <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Veneto</b> forms the western border and part of the southern border with the Adriatic Sea. The northern half is very mountainous and gives way to flatter terrain and plains {{on the way to the}} sea. The climate is distinguished with very warm days and chilly nights that help maintain a balance in the grape between acidity and sugar levels and allows the grapes a long, slow growing season. In summertime the mean temperature is around 73°F (22.8°C) with rainfall averaging 60inches (1,530mm). Harvest normally takes place in September. The soils of the region vary from the calcium rich marl and flysch sandstone in the more hilly regions to clay, sand and gravel in the valley. The names of Friuli vineyards and wine estates often include the word ronco (plural ronchi), which is the Friulian word for a terraced hillside.|$|E
500|$|After the Kingdom of Italy capitulated to the Allies in September 1943, {{according}} to Goebbels {{in his personal}} diary on 29 September 1943, wrote that Hitler had expressed that the Italian-German border should extend {{to those of the}} <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Veneto.</b> Veneto was to be included into the Reich in an [...] "autonomous form", and to benefit from the post-war influx of German tourists. At the time when Italy {{was on the verge of}} declaring an armistice with the Allies, Himmler declared to Felix Kersten that Northern Italy, along with the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, was [...] "bound to eventually be included in Greater Germany anyway".|$|E
