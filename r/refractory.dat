Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes.

50|$|The Beaver Clay Mfg. Co. was {{incorporated}} in 1902, and its first plant was erected the same year. In that year, {{the company began}} manufacturing paving bricks. Shortly after the paving brick facilities were operational, the company made plans to manufacture face bricks.

The Beaver County clay company was awarded contracts with the U.S. government during World War I, which would help bolster its output to 30-36 million bricks in 1919. The company was purchased by the New Castle <b>Refractories</b> Company in 1935.

40|$|In high {{temperature}} {{processes in the}} basic industry, e. g. steel mining, <b>refractories</b> are applied. To achieve a sufficient thermal shock resistance carbon containing <b>refractories</b> are used in steel mining, {{despite the fact that}} the utilization of carbon leads to higher heat losses and carbon pickup. To reduce the heat loss, to govern the carbon pickup and to enable innovative process routines for the clean steel technology novel carbon-reduced and carbon-free <b>refractories</b> are being developed. To assess the application potential and to support the ongoing improvement of selected carbon-reduced and carbon-free <b>refractories</b> the thermal shock performance is investigated focusing on the understanding of the microstructural mechanisms of crack propagation. The thermomechanical investigations concentrate on controlled crack propagation experiments and thermal shock tests. Controlled isothermal crack propagation experiments with macroscopic and microscopic observation are based on wedge splitting and compact tension test. To determine the resistance against crack propagation as an estimation of the potential thermal shock damage analytical relations have been applied. The thermal shock experiments focused on upard mode thermal shocks via electron beam tests facilities. Due to the very fast (ms) upward mode thermal shock in vacuum in contrast to conventional thermal shocks in air or water effects related to chemical interactions can be excluded. Due to a dependency on the sample size only carbon-free, alumina-based <b>refractories</b> were investigated. The influence due to the addition of zirconia and titania is shown. Thermal shock experiments with electron beam were mainly performed on carbon-containing <b>refractories,</b> since carbon-free <b>refractories</b> tended to electrical charging. For the investigated carbon-containing <b>refractories</b> the thermal shock damage is shown in dependence of different parameters (duration, number) ...|$|R
