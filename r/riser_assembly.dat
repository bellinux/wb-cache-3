40|$|Enrichment in foam {{fractionation}} {{is enhanced}} by reducing the liquid flux while maintaining the flux of bubble surfaces. We show {{that it is possible}} to do so in a continuous foam fractionation column by inserting a plate into the foam layer and forcing the foam through a narrower tube (foam riser) mounted at the centre of the plate. A 35 % reduction in liquid flux was observed by using a single plate-foam <b>riser</b> <b>assembly</b> in a foam stabilised by 0. 52 g/L sodium dodecyl sulphate solution, and the liquid rejected from the foam due to the presence of the foam riser had the same concentration as the feed solution. However, due to the nature of the adsorption isotherm of SDS, the enrichment enhancement measured in the experiments hererin was modest. The mechanism of the foam riser plate was explained by invoking recent theoretical studies on pneumatic foam. It was demonstrated that the reduction in liquid flux was affected by sudden expansion of the flow area causing a rejection of interstitial liquid to the top of the plate and extracted, whence it was recycled back to the feed. Preliminary experiments on the effect of liquid pool depth and foam height on interfacial adsorption were also carried out to demonstrate that the insertion of the plate does not affect the adsorption of the target substance to the bubble surface in the current system. It was found that equilibrium could be achieved within 0. 2 m of liquid pool depth or foam height, however the equilibrium surface excess on a rising bubble in the liquid pool is roughly 51 % of the equilibrium value on a quiescent interface, while that in the foam layer is roughly 73 % of the equilibrium value on a quiescent interface...|$|E
40|$|Free Standing Hybrid Riser (FSHR) is an {{innovative}} concept for the riser to transport {{oil and gas}} from the seabed to a floating production platform deployed in deep water. A FSHR mainly consists of a buoyancy can, a vertical steel riser, a flexible jumper and an upper <b>riser</b> <b>assembly</b> (URA). This study focuses {{on the development of}} the numerical scheme for the dynamic simulation of a FSHR whose flexible jumper is connected to a moored floating production vessel, say floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO). The numerical scheme is mainly based on an existing in-house numerical code, known as COUPLE. In using COUPLE, URA is modeled as a rigid body. The URA connects a vertical steel riser and a flexible jumper, both of which are modeled by beam elements (experienced both tensions and bending moments) in COUPLE. The buoyancy can is connected to the URA through a tether chain, which provides the vertical upright force on the URA and in turn the tension to the vertical riser. The tether chain is modeled by bar elements (experienced only tensions) while the buoyancy can is modeled as a rigid cylinder (beam element). The motions and forces of the two rigid bodies, namely URA and the buoyancy can, are coupled in the simulation. Because the connection between the URA and steel riser is considered as ?rigid?, an accurate numerical scheme modeling a rotational spring connecting the URA and steel riser is developed for calculating the bending moment applied at the upper end of the riser. Given the motion at the upper end of the flexible jumper (connecting to a FPSO), numerical simulations are made for two different FSHRs. The results simulated using COUPLE are in satisfactory agreement with those obtained using OrcaFlex, a commercial code widely used by the offshore industry. Furthermore, the vortex induced motion (VIM) of the buoyancy can is considered in the simulation and its effects on the motion of the FSHR are explored, which is compared with the corresponding model tests. The ability to simulate the dynamics of FSHRs developed in this study may be helpful for the future design of FSHRs...|$|E
40|$|During routine {{inspections}} of the Space Shuttle's Main Propulsion System (MPS) Liquid Oxygen (LO 2) pre-valve, the mechanism provided {{to maintain the}} valve {{in the open position}} was found cracked. The mechanism is a Vespel roller held against the valve visor by a stack of Belleville springs. The roller has been found cracked 3 times. All three instances were in the same valve in the same location. There are 6 pre-valves on each orbiter, and only one has exhibited this problem. Every-flight inspections were instituted and the rollers were found to be cracked after only one flight. Engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center worked together to determine a solution. There were several possible contributors to the failure: a mis-aligned visor, an out of specification edge with a sharp radius, an out of specification tolerance stack up of a Belleville spring stack that caused un-predicted loads on the Vespel SP- 21 roller, and a dimple machined {{into the side of the}} roller to indicate LO 2 compatibility that created a stress <b>riser.</b> The detent <b>assembly</b> was removed and replaced with parts that were on the low-side of the tolerance stack up to eliminate the potential for high loads on the detent roller.

40|$|To prevent harmful {{pollutants}} from stormwater runoff being discharged into a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS 4 s), operators must {{obtain a}} NPDES permit {{and develop a}} stormwater management program before any land disturbance activity can begin. The Virginia Department of Conservation 2 ̆ 6 Recreation (DCR) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) have put in place the new Virginia Stormwater Management Program VSMP) Permit Regulations which will become effective from July 2014. Localities are authorized to adopt their own stormwater management ordinances as long as these ordinances are based upon findings of local or regional comprehensive watershed management studies or findings developed through {{the implementation of a}} MS 4 permit or are determined to be necessary to prevent any further degradation to water resources or to address specific existing water pollution. Some projects already in the pipeline are ‘grand-fathered’ from these requirements until July 2019. These regulations and ordinances will require a change in the mindset of the “permittee”. Unlike in the past when the pollutant removal efficiencies of “Traditional” stormwater management facilities (BMP) did {{not take into account the}} removal that occurred when the runoff volume is reduced, the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method (RRM) developed by the Center for Watershed Protection (CWP), the Chesapeake Stormwater Network (CSN), and the DCR recognize a BMPs 2 ̆ 7 capacity to reduce the overall runoff volume as well as mass pollutant removal reflecting a “Mass Balance” Approach. In many existing urbanized areas, the infrastructure changes needed to retrofit existing stormwater drainage systems with structural BMPs – to provide for stormwater quality and quantity control – can both be difficult due to right-of-way issues and also be expensive. In these cases, low-impact BMPs and non-structural means for controlling stormwater can be put in place to reduce pollutant at source before more expensive structural BMPs are instituted. Ensoftec has developed SWMSoft, a database managed computer program, which simplifies the RRM by providing step-by-step procedures for calculating the RR volumes. The different types and design levels, <b>riser</b> <b>assembly,</b> outfall analysis, treatment train, and stormwater best management practice (BMP) routing are already built-in. SWMSoft which assists the designer to comply with runoff and pollutant reduction targets for each outfall and the hydrologic unit code (HUC) boundary. The program also calculates the peak flows for each outfall using the modified TR- 55 Curve Numbers for the reduced runoffs. SWMSoft accounts for pollutant loads contributed by managed turf in addition to impervious cover. The designer can select the appropriate practices to treat turf areas and turf-intensive land uses. The emphasis is to provide low impact designs or environmental site designs that can achieve runoff and pollutant load reduction ahead of structural BMP’s. In most cases, the full range of practices can be considered as part of the treatment train. SWMSoft provides detailed designs for all these facilities excluding proprietary manufactured devices. Because SWMSoft is a managed database, permutations of various stand-alone BMP facilities and combinations of various facilities (treatment train) are straightforward procedures and iterative modifications of BMP facilities can be easily performed to provide optimized designs...|$|E
40|$|Offshore ultra {{deepwater}} {{field is}} being promising {{as the future}} {{of oil and gas}} reserves. The advancement of technology in ultra deepwater has been leading Brazil into one of the promising offshore market. A Brazilian state-owned oil operator, Petrobras, confirms that 33 % from their total exploration area are located at water depth below 1500 m (Salies, 2005). It can be seen that the future of oil and gas exploration and production lies in ultra deepwater. The development of ultra deepwater field posed many challenges, in particular, on the selection of the riser concept. For ultra deepwater environment, the long suspended length of riser will significantly increase the vessel payload. High external hydrostatic pressure on the riser will increase the probability of collapse failure. Large dynamic motions of the vessel due to waves, and also large vessel offsets from wind, current and slow-drift motion yields potential buckling issues at the touch-down-point (TDP). In addition, potential fatigue problems due to vessel motions and soil-riser interactions also present at touch-down-point (TDP) area. Large current speed in deepwater field might also lead to vortex induced vibration (VIV) which eventually will contribute to significant fatigue damage for particular riser sections. By looking into these challenges, {{it is very important to}} select the most appropriate riser concept for the ultra deepwater field. Catenary Offset Buoyant <b>Riser</b> <b>Assembly</b> (COBRA) as newly developed hybrid riser concept offers a solution to overcome the challenges in ultra deepwater field. In general, COBRA riser arrangement consists of a catenary riser section with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on top which is tethered down to sea bed via two mooring lines. The catenary section from top of the sub-surface buoy is connected to the floater by a flexible jumper. This flexible jumper can effectively absorb the floater motions, which give significant improvements for both strength and fatigue performance on the overall system. As a hybrid riser concept, this concept offers cost effective solution by avoiding all the expensive bottom assemblies that normally needed for a hybrid riser concept. This thesis focuses on COBRA riser concept for offshore Brazil ultra deepwater environment, specifically for Santos Basin Central Cluster region at 2200 m water depth. It is observed that there is common sudden change phenomenon on the current direction in Santos Basin area. In this thesis, the effect of bidirectional (2 -directions) current is analyzed, and the comparison with unidirectional current is discussed thoroughly. The analyses are focused on the global strength design performance under extreme environmental load and global fatigue design performance of the riser due to wave induced and VIV induced. This thesis captures detail analysis of COBRA base case configuration. In addition, further sensitivity studies from the base case riser arrangement are also presented. The parameter on sensitivity studies are determined based on possible alternative riser arrangements, i. e. locating the sub-surface buoyancy in deeper area, connecting the flexible jumper through the bottom section of the sub-surface buoyancy, and also alternative buoyancy tethers configurations on the seabed.

40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} moving into deeper waters Floating Production Units (FPUs) {{have been widely used}} for production purpose. Selection of FPU for deepwater field development is a complicated task is mainly governed by factors like water depth, location of field (remoteness), environmental conditions, deck space requirements, storage requirements and offloading requirements etc. Amongst all the available FPU alternatives ship shaped FPSO has undoubtedly dominated the concept selection and are generally used in marginal and remote fields lacking pipeline infrastructure. Selecting riser concept for FPSO stationed in deepwater has posed challenges due high hydrostatic pressure and large vessel payload. The condition is worsened if besides deepwater, FPSO is also stationed in harsh environmental conditions. Under such conditions FPSO is subjected to large offsets and dynamics which are directly transferred along the riser length to its base unless riser is uncoupled from the FPSO. One of the major factors governing the riser concept selection for deepwater FPSO is the geographical location and weather conditions prevalent there. For example free hanging flexible riser has been mostly used in moderate environments of offshore Brazil while concepts like Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) and Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT) are dominant in calm weather conditions of West of Africa (WoA). Flexible risers in various configurations are currently the most widely used concept with turret moored FPSO in water depth up to 1500 m. This can be accounted to their flexibility which allows them to accommodate large vessel offsets and also to be spooled on reels/carrousels for storage and installation purposes. But other factors like requirement of large diameter to increase collapse resistance, tendency to birdcage, large cost and increased weight limits its use beyond 2000 m. For past decade on of the alternatives to flexible riser for spread moored FPSO in deepwater benign environments has been SCR. SCR is not only a cheaper option but also permits use of large diameter sizes as required to withstand high hydrostatic pressure at larger depths. However SCRs are yet to find its application with deepwater FPSO in moderate to harsh environments due to their reduced fatigue life at hang-off and Touch Down Zone (TDZ). One way of improving the fatigue life of SCR is by changing the riser configuration from catenary to wave shaped (SLWR) by adding buoyancy to it and such a configuration is installed with turret moored FPSO (1780 m) in offshore Brazil. Two overcome the disadvantage of coupled riser systems like SCR, un-coupled riser concepts namely Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT), Single Hybrid Riser (SHR) and Buoyancy Supported Riser (BSR) have been installed. Fairly new un-coupled riser concepts like Grouped Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR), Catenary Offset Buoyant <b>Riser</b> <b>Assembly</b> (COBRA) and Tethered Catenary Riser (TCR) are being studied and developed for deepwater application. Till date there is no FPSO stationed in water depths exceeding 1000 m in Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS).

Based on the literature review lazy wave configuration of flexible riser and Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) have been considered as a viable riser concept. Main aim of this case study is to compare the two riser concepts on basis of vessel payload, fabrication cost and installation cost while the scope of study involves preforming static, dynamic and fatigue analysis of both the riser systems by using Orcaflex.

40|$|Installing {{deep water}} risers in harsh {{environmental}} conditions {{even in the}} icing environment, {{in the near future}} seems like inevitable. Especially in the Norwegian Sea, the development of deep water technology requires an urgent solution of how to transfer hydrocarbons from sea bed to the host facility in a remote area with considering hostile environment conditions. In every subsea production system combined with a floating facility, the need of risers is a must. Deeper water causes various challenges, for instance; higher payload of the vessel, increase probability of collapse failure of the riser, higher probability for riser failure due to buckling and fatigue issue at the touch-down-point (TDP) as well as presence of Vortex Induce Vibration (VIV) in the long suspended riser span. In addition, the polar climate which is occurring in the Norwegian Sea should be considered during designing, installing and operating of the system which caused this area to be different from other places. In order to reduce excessive floater motions, an uncoupled riser system is introduced. By using buoy elements, the riser system is able decouple the motion effect of the floater, riser and mooring system that may magnify the extreme hull/floater response. This can significantly improve strength and fatigue performance of the riser. This system is widely used in deep water conditions with various riser configurations. In general, an uncoupled riser system consists of two different types of riser concepts (flexible and steel) with buoy in between. There are three main components in this configuration; a flexible jumper that is directly connected to the floater, a sub-surface buoyancy module at the connection point, and a steel riser at the bottom parts. The flexible jumper is used to absorb the floater motions, and the result the configuration gives the optimum riser concept which is best suited for deep water conditions. In this topic, we limit the uncoupled riser configurations into two types; Catenary Offset Buoyant <b>Riser</b> <b>Assembly</b> (COBRA) and Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR). The difference between these two riser configurations is at the bottom part and at the connection point; COBRA configures the steel pipe as a catenary riser with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on the top which is tethered down to sea bed via mooring lines while SLOR configures the steel pipe as a tensioned riser by using an air can as a buoyancy module to maintain the riser in tensioned position all time. By means of these riser configurations we have the possibility to use different types of riser arrangements since a standalone flexible riser is very expensive to use in deep water conditions. The main advantage of the two uncoupled riser configurations is that they enable possibilities for the floater to drift/side-step in case of drifting icebergs, which {{will be one of the}} study cases. This thesis focuses on a comparison study of the two uncoupled riser configurations based on ultimate limit state (ULS) and accidental limit state (ALS) results by considering the possibility to avoid/prevent iceberg collision. As explained previously, the risers to be studied are set to be installed in the Norwegian Sea which has harsh environmental conditions. Three different water depths have been chosen on purpose, which are 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m. In the event of iceberg approach, this thesis work presents two solutions for comparison study. The two solutions are to drift/side-step the floating structure or to disconnect the riser/mooring system using a disconnectable turret. The repot will suggest the optimum solutions; the most suitable uncoupled riser configuration for the Norwegian Sea condition with respect to the riser performance for the case of floater drift off and the geometry of a disconnected riser. Based on detail strength analysis in operating and accidental conditions, this thesis concludes that COBRA riser concept has robust and efficient design to install in the Norwegian Sea conditions. In addition, the COBRA configuration in 1500 m water depth is feasible to perform a 250 m side-stepping in the event of an iceberg approach...|$|E
