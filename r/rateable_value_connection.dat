50|$|Section 8 {{empowers}} the Commissioner {{to value}} land held under an applicable lease and any tenement comprised therein {{at any time}} to ascertain the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> {{for the purposes of}} the Ordinance. Subject to any specific provisions of the Ordinance, the basis of ascertaining the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> is the same as that in Sections 7 and 7A of the Rating Ordinance. Where the estimated <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> does not exceed the minimum <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> shall be deemed to be $1 and no demand for Government rent will be issued. That minimum <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> presently set at $3,000, is the same as the amount prescribed under Section 36(1)(l) of the Rating Ordinance for rates exemption purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{apportionment}} of the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> {{does not}} constitute a separate rating assessment made under the Rating Ordinance. The single tenement and its <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> remain as entries in the valuation list. Thus, an objection can be made only to the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of the single tenement.|$|R
25|$|In Wales, small {{business}} rates relief was not introduced until 2007. It replaced rural property relief, but included similar provisions, with 50% relief for most properties with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> below £2,000, and 25% relief for <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> between £2,000 and £5,000. Post offices with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> {{of up to}} £9,000 are eligible for 100% relief; while those over £9,000 and up to £12,000 receive 50%. It also authorises local authorities to set up local schemes of relief for properties up to a limit of £12,000 <b>rateable</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> {{thresholds}} and bandings of the Scheme {{have been}} increased {{to reflect the}} 2010 Revaluation. The scheme permits rating authorities to abate at varying prescribed levels, a ratepayer’s liability where the combined <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of the properties owned/occupied throughout Scotland is £ 18, 000 or less with effect from 01 / 04 / 10. In addition, where the cumulative <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of a businesses properties falls between £ 18, 000 and 25 %, the Scheme will offer 25 % relief to individual properties with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> £ 18, 000 or under. The exact level of relief therefore depends on: (i) the total <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> of all subjects owned or occupied by the ratepayer; and (ii) {{whether or not the}} property is eligible for one of the existing non-discretionary rate reliefs.

5000|$|... ‘Tone of the list” was {{introduced}} into rating law in Hong Kong in 1973. This legislation {{was based on}} the concept that the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> resulting from an interim valuation shall not exceed the level of <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> in the valuation list. This concept allowed a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> to be determined at a level below the “tone” if there was a decline in rental levels during the period from the date the valuation list came into force to the time of the interim valuation.|$|R

50|$|Unless {{specifically}} exempted {{under the}} Rating Ordinance (Chapter 116 of the Laws of Hong Kong), all properties in Hong Kong {{are liable to}} rating assessment, with rates payable at a specified percentage of the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> assessed on the property. Basically, the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> is the estimated market rental {{value of the property}} at a designated date.|$|R
25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether {{residential}} or commercial, {{was given a}} <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> which estimated the annual rent it would bring in. In the budgeting process the council would work out the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> within its boundaries to produce {{the proportion of the}} <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.|$|R
50|$|Business {{rates are}} a {{property}} tax, where each non-domestic property is assessed with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> expressed in pounds. The <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> broadly represents the annual rent the property {{could have been}} let for on a particular valuation date according {{to a set of}} assumptions. The actual bill payable is then calculated using a multiplier set by central government, and applying any reliefs.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rateable</b> <b>value</b> is {{in effect}} the {{estimated}} annual rental value in the open market. It is common practice supported by decided cases to assume a hypothetical tenancy, and the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> is an estimated annual rent {{which would have been}} agreed between a hypothetical landlord and a hypothetical tenant, {{on the assumption that the}} property in its actual physical state was vacant and to let. The landlord’s obligation to bear “the costs of repairs and other expenses necessary to maintain the tenement in a state to command that rent” implies that ordinary disrepair is disregarded in ascertaining the <b>rateable</b> <b>value.</b> However, serious disrepair which cannot be remedied or can only be remedied at an uneconomic cost should be taken into account.|$|R
5000|$|As {{has already}} been indicated, the Rent Act 1965 applied rent {{regulation}} to tenancies in Scotland with a <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> not exceeding £200 and which were not controlled tenancies. (This upper limit was not affected by the Counter Inflation Act 1973 which raised, but only for England and Wales, the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> limits for tenancies to be within the Rent Acts). Following rating re-valuations in Scotland in 1978 and 1985, the <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> limits were increased to £600 from 1 April 1978, and to £1,600 from 1 April 1985, in respect of dwellings which were first entered in the Valuation Roll on or after those dates. (Note: [...] "Valuation Roll" [...] {{is the same as}} the English [...] "Valuation List").|$|R
5000|$|BIDs in England and Wales {{are funded}} by a levy on the {{occupiers}} rather than {{the owners of the}} properties within the area. If voted in by local businesses, the BID levy is an extension to existing non-domestic business-rates. [...] "In England and Wales, for a BID to go ahead the ballot must be won on two counts: straight majority and majority of <b>rateable</b> <b>value.</b> In Scotland for a ballot to be successful it must meet four criteria, a minimum turnout of 25% by the number of eligible persons (the headcount) and by <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> and a majority of those that vote by number of ballots and by <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> must vote in favour.

If a house within these <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> limits had become decontrolled under the 1923 Act {{it was not}} automatically brought back into control by the 1933 Act.

50|$|To give {{relief to}} {{properties}} considered vital to rural communities, {{a combination of}} compulsory and discretionary reliefs exist in England. The Welsh scheme was incorporated into small business rates relief from 1 April 2007. Properties of a given <b>rateable</b> <b>value</b> (£7000 in England from 2005) can receive the relief {{if they are in}} a rural settlement (defined as a population of 3000 or less, within designated rural areas), and are the only general store or post office, or a food store. The only public house or petrol station (with <b>rateable</b> <b>values</b> of up £10500, as of 2005) may also receive the relief, which is a mandatory 50%.Discretionary relief of up to 100% is available for the previous properties, and for any others up to a current limit of £12000 <b>rateable</b> <b>value,</b> provided they are judged to be of benefit to the local community.|$|R
