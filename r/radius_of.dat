First, we study stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> linear time-invariant parameter-varying differential systems. A formula for the complex stability radius under multi perturbations is given. Then, under hypotheses of positivity of the system matrices, we prove that the complex, real and positive stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> the system under multi perturbations (or affine perturbations) coincide and they are computed via simple formulae. As applications, we consider problems of computing <b>of</b> (strong) stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> linear time-invariant time-delay differential systems and computing <b>of</b> stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> positive linear functional differential equations under multi perturbations and affine perturbations. We show that for a class of positive linear time-delay differential systems, the stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> the system under multi perturbations (or affine perturbations) are equal to the strong stability radii. Next, we prove that the stability <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> a positive linear functional differential equation under multi perturbations (or affine perturbations) are equal to those of the associated linear time-invariant parameter-varying differential system. In particular, we get back some explicit formulas for these stability radii which are given recently in [P. H. A.

To explain these observations a model is developed involving stimulated radiative molecular association (SRMA) reactions among the photons and {{atoms in the}} protosatellite disks of the planets. In this model thermal energy is extracted from each disk due to a resonance at radii {{where there is a}} match between the temperature in the disk and a photon energy. Matter accumulates at these radii, and satellites and rings are ultimately formed. Orbital <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune are related to photon energies ($E_{PM}$ values) in the spectrum of molecular hydrogen. Orbital <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> satellites of Saturn are related to photon energies ($E_{PA}$ values) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen.
