5|$|On 5 September 1983, {{members of}} the 42d Air <b>Refueling</b> Squadron escorted a {{crippled}} F-4E Phantom II over the Atlantic Ocean after it experienced the loss of an engine. For its actions, crew E-113 received the Mackay Trophy for <b>refueling</b> it four times and towing it with its <b>refueling</b> boom.|$|E
5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial <b>refueling</b> kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having an aerial <b>refueling</b> capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on <b>refueling</b> assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E

5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight <b>refueling</b> on the return nearly prevented <b>refueling,</b> which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight <b>refueling</b> tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were <b>refueling</b> aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, so did {{the need}} for new {{aircraft}} and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air <b>Refueling</b> Squadron in January 1955. The B-36's were not actually equipped to perform aerial <b>refueling,</b> so the planes supported other units until the arrival of the B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper stage}} is {{designed}} to operate in space, and to be <b>refueled</b> there. Assuming {{the presence of a}} space station for storing the propellant, an orbital DH-1 could be <b>refueled</b> after 17 launches. Linking two such <b>refueled</b> stages nose to nose would enable you to take ~35,000 lb to the Lunar surface, the Martian surface, or geosynchronous orbit, and return to the station. Due to fuel requirements, the cost to these locations is 6 times greater than the cost to LEO.|$|R
5000|$|Non-pressurized <b>refuel</b> systems reduce fuel spills and {{provided}} more accurate filling when used with worn automatic <b>refuel</b> nozzles. The system is also {{designed to prevent}} overfilling or manual override of the fueling system. David Juleff of Shaw Development, LLC [...] was the design engineer that tailored an aerospace non-pressurized <b>refuel</b> system to be first introduced on the Caterpillar D11 track type tractor in 1998. A number of non pressure fueling systems are available in OEM and retrofit applications from FloMeg, Shaw Delelopment, Hydrau-Flo®, FastFillSystems http://fastfillsytems.com and others ...|$|R

The four KC-767Js ordered by Japan have been delivered. The Aeronautica Militare received the first of its four KC-767As in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1953, 17 F-84Gs using aerial <b>refueling</b> {{flew from}} the United States to the United Kingdom. The 4,485-mile (3,900nmi, 7,220km) journey was the longest-ever nonstop flight by jet fighters.|$|E

5|$|An FAA {{official}} {{requested a}} face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied. The <b>refueling</b> process was delayed {{because of a}} vapor lock in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism, and Cooper became suspicious; but he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.|$|E

5|$|As of 2013, the {{top five}} {{employers}} in Spokane are the State of Washington, Spokane Public Schools, Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children's Hospital, the 92d Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing, and Spokane County. The largest military facility and employer, the 92d Air <b>Refueling</b> Wing, is stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base near Airway Heights. The leading industries in Spokane for the employed population 16years and older were educational services, health care, and social assistance (26.5percent), retail trade (12.7percent), and arts, entertainment, recreation, and accommodation food services (10.4percent). As the metropolitan center of the Inland Northwest, as well as parts of southern British Columbia and Alberta, Spokane serves as a commercial, manufacturing, transportation, medical, shopping, and entertainment hub. In 2010, the Spokane–Spokane Valley MSA had a gross metropolitan product of $19.48 billion.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1965, {{a number}} of B-52Ds {{underwent}} Big Belly modifications to increase bomb capacity for carpet bombings. While the external payload remained at 24 of 500lb (227kg) or 750lb (340kg) bombs, the internal capacity increased from 27 to 84 for 500lb bombs, or from 27 to 42 for 750lb bombs. The modification created enough capacity {{for a total of}} 60,000lb (27,215kg) using 108 bombs. Thus modified, B-52Ds could carry 22,000lb (9,980kg) more than B-52Fs. Designed to replace B-52Fs, modified B-52Ds entered combat in April 1966 flying from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Each bombing mission lasted 10 to 12 hours and included an aerial <b>refueling</b> by KC-135 Stratotankers. In spring 1967, B-52s began flying from U Tapao Airfield in Thailand so that <b>refueling</b> was not required.|$|E
