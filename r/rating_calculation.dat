40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a calculation code developed for helically coiled heat recovery boilers fed with exhaust gases from internal combustion engines, gas turbines or industrial processes. The code carries out the thermal <b>rating</b> <b>calculation</b> of the boiler {{by means of}} a one-dimensional model applicable to either water or thermal oil heating or steam generation in a once-through configuration. The paper is focused on the first case, in which cold fluid phase-change does not occur, and illustrates how the rating program can be helpful to improve the boiler design with respect to the current standard, allowing a reduction of several percentage points in the calculated heat transfer area (and correspondingly weight and material cost) required for a given duty...|$|E

Ratings/ranking provides an efficient and effective way to build trust relationship among faculties and students in e-learning environment. Content driven reputation systems is based on the feedback provided by analysis of all interactions whereas user driven reputation systems is based only on the feed-back or ratings provided by the users. Z-score is the popular ranking calculating method which compares sample with population or 2 samples, paired or unpaired. ANOVA/F tests are similar to Z-score but use variances instead of means and can be applied to more than 2 groups and other more complex scenarios.

40|$|Since 1998, the U. S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has {{maintained}} a website, Nursing Home Compare, which provides detailed quality information about every certified nursing home in the country. In December 2008, CMS greatly enhanced the usability of the website by adding an easy-to-understand 5 -star rating. Each nursing home receives one to five stars based on performance in each of three key quality domains (health inspections, reported staffing levels, and quality measures derived from mandated assessments of resident health and well-being) plus an overall quality <b>rating.</b> <b>Calculation</b> of ratings requires integration of information from both facility and residentlevel data sources. SAS ® was used extensively in analysis to support {{the development of the}} rating system, and it is currently used to process data to refresh the ratings each month, based on newly collected data in each domain. This presentation describes the integration of data from various sources and the rating algorithms, {{as well as some of}} the decisions that were made in the design of the ratings. The presentation also describes how the “ 5 -star team” maintains a consistent process as the rating methodology is refined, and new data are received monthly...|$|E

40|$|A Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) utilises an {{electric}} drive and a conventional {{internal combustion engine}} to achieve increased fuel economy and/or performance. The architecture of the vehicle, and the design focus, significantly affects the demands made on the electric drive. These demands are typically expressed as the electric drive duty, in terms of motor speed and torque. This duty can therefore vary significantly for the architecture and vehicle drive cycle selected and {{can have an impact}} on electric drive technology selection. For any given vehicle, there is no simple electric drive <b>rating</b> <b>calculation</b> for the range of hybrid vehicle architectures possible. However, the duty on the electric drive can be determined by a consideration of the whole vehicle power demand. A powertrain simulation model has been used to determine this power demand made on the two sources of traction power, the internal combustion engine and the electric drive, {{as a result of the}} required vehicle dynamics, given by drive cycle velocity and acceleration demand. This model can therefore determine the duty on the electric drive and consequent physical size and rating of the electric drives employed in a selection of different architectures in a given vehicle. In this paper, preliminary results are presented showing the variation in electric drive duty for four architectures with fixed vehicle parameters, over a specified drive cycle. The results are of interest to those involved in hybrid vehicle engineering and electric drives production...|$|E

We looked at what recommender systems {{are and what they}} are good for. All three methods were addressed and also some others. Pros anc cons of collaborative filtering and content-based recommenders were addressed. The evaluation of recommender systems was addressed. We took a closer look at collaborative filtering. User-based kNN recommendation was introduced. The term neigbourhood was introduced. The alghoritms for similarity calculation and predicted <b>rating</b> <b>calculation</b> were introduced. We took a closer look at content based recommender. A high level architecture of content-based systems was introduced. Two functions for product similarity calculation were introduced. We took a closer look at evaluation of the recommender systems. The leave-one-out method was introduced and also two measures for error calculation MAE and RMSE. The data was acquired from "Freebase" service. The values of attributes were changed and some of the attributes were eliminated. Colrec script was adapted and used for analyzing the user-based collaborative filtering. The optimization of recommendation technique was performed by using the threshold. Content-based technique was optimized by using different finctions for calculating the similarity between products. Every attribute was weighted with a different weight. The alghorithms for calculating the similarity between products and predicting ratings were introduced. Content-based technique and baseline predictor were implemented by using Python programming language. For ratings storage the two-dimensional array was used, which is included in numpy library. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acupuncture is a {{promising}} treatment approach {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain (cLBP) but {{little is known about}} the quality of acupuncture in randomized controlled trials (RCT) of acupuncture cLBP. Objective To determine how international experts (IES) rate the quality of acupuncture in RCTs of cLBP; independent international validation of the Low Back Pain Acupuncture Score (LBPAS). Methodology Fifteen experts from 9 different countries outside China were surveyed (IES). They were asked to read anonymized excerpts of 24 RCTs of cLBP and answer a three-item questionnaire on how the method of acupuncture conformed to 1) Chinese textbook standards, 2) the expert's personally preferred style, and 3) how acupuncture is performed in the expert's country. Likert scale <b>rating,</b> <b>calculation</b> of the mode for each answer, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between all three answers and the LBPAS were calculated. Results On comparison with Chinese textbook standards (question 1), 6 RCTs received a good rating, 8 trials a fair and 10 trials a poor or very poor rating. 5 of the 6 trials rated good, received at least a good rating also in question 2 or 3. We found a high correlation of 0. 85 (p Conclusion The international expert survey (IES) revealed that only 6 out of 24 (25 %) RCTs of acupuncture for cLBP were rated "good" in respect to Chinese textbook acupuncture standards. There were only small differences in how the acupuncture quality was rated in comparison to Chinese textbook acupuncture, personally preferred and local styles of acupuncture. The rating showed a high correlation with the Low Back Pain Acupuncture Score LBPAS. </p...|$|E
