Various factors contribute {{to the possibility of}} inhibition, which might also lead to differences in endocrine activity. If subordinates happen to lay eggs after the hierarchy is formed, the dominant foundress will eat the eggs to ensure all laid eggs are of her own genes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the name}} might imply it, a queen bee does not {{directly}} control the hive. Her sole function is {{to serve as the}} <b>reproducer.</b> A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-up—more than her own body weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.|$|E

The M1 Studio Dynetic Cartridge introduced the principle of a moving magnet within a stationary coil, an engineering concept that dominated cartridge design for nearly 25 years due to its higher output, lower noise, and greater headroom. The Shure M3D, introduced in 1958, was the first ever stereo moving magnet cartridge, with 20dB of stereo separation at 20kHz.|$|E

In this study, we use captureâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 markâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 resighting and multiâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 state models to examine survival senescence and reproductive senescence in six successive cohorts of fallow bucks that were studied for 16 years. We found that the overall age-specific survival probabilities of males were highly variable and the bestâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 fitting model revealed that fallow bucks have four lifeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 history stages: yearling, preâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 reproductive, primeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 age and senescent. Preâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 reproductive males (2 and 3 years old) had the highest survival. Survival declined sharply after the age of 9 years, indicating that senescence had begun. When we considered reproducing and non-reproducing males separately, {{there was no evidence of}} senescence in the former, and steadily decreasing survival after the onset of social maturity in the latter. Reproduction probability also declined in older males, and thus we provide very strong evidence of senescence. <b>Reproducers</b> had a greater chance of reproducing again in the following year than nonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 <b>reproducers.</b> Furthermore, there were differences in the survival probabilities, with <b>reproducers</b> consistently surviving better than nonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 <b>reproducers.</b> In our study population, <b>reproducers</b> allocate more to the effort to reproduce than nonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 <b>reproducers.</b> Therefore our results indicate the generally higher phenotypic quality of reproducing males.

M. du Chaillu's distribution (chap, iii.) into five orders, namely, pure, mixed with other tribes, half free, children of serviles, and chattels, is somewhat over-artificial; at any rate, now it is not generally recognized. Like the high-caste Hindu, the nobler race will marry women of lower classes; for instance, King Njogoni's mother was a Benga; but the inverse proceeding is a disgrace to the woman, apparently an instinctive feeling {{on the part of}} the <b>reproducer,</b> still lingering in the most advanced societies. Old travellers record a belief that, unlike all other Guinea races, the Mpongwe marries his mother, sister, or daughter; and they compare the practice with that of the polished Persians and the Peruvian Incas, who thus kept pure the solar and lunar blood. If this [...] "breeding-in" [...] ever existed, no trace of it now remains; on the contrary, every care is taken to avoid marriages of consanguinity.

He stated his matter skilfully and powerfully. He particularly excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of his subject. His style of argument was neither trite and vulgar, nor subtle and abstruse. He hit the house just between wind and water. And not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in question, he was never more tedious, or more earnest, than the pre-conceived opinions and present temper of his hearers required; to whom he was always in perfect unison. He conformed exactly to the temper of the house; and he seemed to guide, because he was always sure to follow it.|$|E

6000|$|After {{this latter}} visit Mr. Akers {{conducted}} {{us to the}} shop of the jeweller Castellani, who is a great <b>reproducer</b> of ornaments in the old Roman and Etruscan fashion. These antique styles are very fashionable just now, {{and some of the}} specimens he showed us were certainly very beautiful, though I doubt whether their quaintness and old-time curiousness, as patterns of gewgaws dug out of immemorial tombs, be not their greatest charm. We saw the toilet-case of an Etruscan lady,--that is to say, a modern imitation of it,--with her rings for summer and winter, and for every day of the week, and for thumb and fingers; her ivory comb; her bracelets; and more knick-knacks than I can half remember. Splendid things of our own time were likewise shown us; a necklace of diamonds worth eighteen thousand scudi, together with emeralds and opals and great pearls. Finally we came away, and my wife and Miss Shepard were taken up by the Misses Weston, who drove with them to visit the Villa Albani. During their drive my wife happened to raise her arm, and Miss Shepard espied a little Greek cross of gold which had attached itself to the lace of her sleeve. [...] . Pray heaven the jeweller may not discover his loss before we have time to restore the spoil! He is apparently so free and careless in displaying his precious wares,--putting inestimable genes and brooches great and small into the hands of strangers like ourselves, and leaving scores of them strewn {{on the top of his}} counter,--that it would seem easy enough to take a diamond or two; but I suspect there must needs be a sharp eye somewhere. Before we left the shop he requested me to honor him with my autograph in a large book that was full of the names of his visitors. This is probably a measure of precaution.|$|E
