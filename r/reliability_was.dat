While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose.

At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but <b>reliability</b> <b>was</b> greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E

40|$|<b>Reliability</b> <b>is</b> the {{probability}} of equipment or processes to function without failure, when operated correctly, for a given interval of time, under stated conditions.

Several <b>reliability</b> engineering tools <b>are</b> discussed. <b>Reliability</b> Definitions Reliability has many definitions (Omdahl 1988).

In addition, Badoer made it to the finish for three races in a row, including a top ten result at Scuderia Italia's second home race in Monza.

Mechanical <b>reliability</b> <b>was</b> an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the Renault FT, which became a decisive tool of the victory.

[...] His ideal light tank included a [...] tank gun, with 360-degree traverse and an elevation of 72 degrees. At the same time, the vehicle was to have the lowest possible silhouette, and no less than [...] of all-around armor, and [...] on the front.

Furthermore, the vehicle's mechanical <b>reliability</b> <b>was</b> to improve upon that of the existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army. [...] Despite initial obstacles, including opposition to an indigenous Spanish tank program from German General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, the first prototype was delivered in late 1938; this prototype was built from spare parts taken from a number of different tanks. The prototype performed well in testing and a new prototype was ordered.|$|E
