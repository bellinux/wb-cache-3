In this study, such knowledge is classified into two broad types, i. e. general knowledge and thematic knowledge.

40|$|Researches on flux {{switching}} machines (FSMs), especially {{permanent magnet}} FSMs (PMFSMs) have been dramatically increased lately {{due to its}} high magnetic field excitation suitable for high torque condition, high efficiency and robust rotor structure suitable for high speed applications. However, {{a large amount of}} permanent magnet (PM) volume in PMFSMs such as NdFeB creates a problem of high manufacturing cost {{in order to avoid the}} PM from demagnetized. In addition, the cost of PM itself is very expensive which is more than double when compared with the price in the last two years. Moreover the working environment with high temperature may limit its applications due to ease of demagnetization, while the flux weakening operation at high speed region is relatively difficult due to fixed PM excitation. In order to solve the problems and to reduce the machine cost, one of possiblesolutions is to replace the PM excitation by the DC excitation. In this research, a new topology of low-cost field excitation FSM (FEFSM) which use DC field current as their only mmf sources as well as with controllable flux capability is introduced. The DC field current is arranged in single direction alternately with the armature coil around the stator teeth to ease the manufacturing.

40|$|Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor (PMFSM) with outer-rotor {{configuration}} {{recently reported}} in the literature can potentially lead to a very compact in-wheel electric vehicle (EV) drive design and increased cabin space through the elimination of mechanical transmission gears. Nevertheless, the output torque is still insufficient to drive heavier EV especially at starting and climbing conditions. On the other hand, with the permanent magnets placed along the radial V-shaped segmented stator, the PMFSM is prone to excitation flux leakage and demagnetization, making optimisation of the rotor and stator dimensions a difficult objective to achieve, while keeping the PM volume constant. In this thesis, design and optimisation of high torque capability salient stator outer-rotor hybrid excitation flux switching motor (OR-HEFSMs) are investigated. With the additional DC field excitation coil (FEC) as a secondary flux source, the proposed motor offers advantage of flux control capability that is suitable for various operating conditions. The design <b>restrictions</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> of the proposed motor are kept similar as interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) employed in the existing hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) Toyota Lexus RX 400 h. The JMAG-Designer ver. 14. 1 was used as 2 D-finite elements analysis (FEA) solver to verify the motor’s operating principle and output torque performance characteristics. The subsequent optimisation work carried out using deterministic optimisation approach (DOA) has produced a very promising 12 S- 14 P OR-HEFSM configuration, where a maximum torque density of 12. 4 Nm/kg and power density of 5. 97 kW/kg have been obtained.

40|$|Self-regulatory {{patterning}} mechanisms {{capable of}} generating biologically meaningful, yet unpredictable cellular patterns offer unique opportunities for obtaining mathematical descriptions of underlying patterning systems properties. The networks of higher-order veins in leaf primordia constitute such a self-regulatory system. During {{the formation of}} higher-order veins, vascular precursors are selected from a homogenous field of subepidermal cells in unpredictable positions to eventually connect in complex cellular networks. Auxin transport routes have been implicated in this selection process, but understanding of their role in vascular patterning has been limited by our inability to monitor early auxin transport dynamics in vivo. Here we describe a live-imaging system in emerging Arabidopsis thaliana leaves that uses a PIN 1 :GFP reporter to visualize auxin transport routes and an Athb 8 :YFP reporter as a marker for vascular commitment. Live-imaging revealed common features initiating the formation of all higher-order veins. The formation of very broad PIN 1 expression domains is followed by their restriction, leading to sustained, elevated PIN 1 expression in incipient procambial cells files, which then express Athb 8. Higher-order PIN 1 expression domains (hPEDs) are initiated as freely ending domains that extend towards each other and sometimes fuse with them, creating connected domains.

The results suggest that allowing for a non-linear dynamics in the government debt to GDP ratio could imply stronger persistence and higher volatility in the responses of government indebtedness to macroeconomic shocks. The fiscal stance of the Czech Republic seems to be most vulnerable to unexpected depreciation of the local currency, discretionary pro-cyclical increases in government expenditures, and deflationary shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the 1970 British Cohort Study to {{quantify}} the intergenerational persistence of mental health, and the long-run economic costs associated with poor parental mental health. We find a strong and significant intergenerational correlation that is robust to different covariate sets, sample <b>restrictions,</b> model <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> potential endogeneity. Importantly, the intergenerational persistence is economically relevant, with maternal mental health associated with lasting effects on the child&# 039;s educational attainment, future household income and the probability of having criminal convictions. These results do not disappear after controlling for children&# 039;s own childhood and adulthood mental health...|$|R
40|$|Slightly {{revised and}} reformatted from version {{circulated}} in February 2008. Abstract: Shared mutable objects and reentrant callacks can subvert encapsulation in object-based programs. For modular reasoning, verifiers rely on methodologies. These combine special annotations or types with instrumentation (ghost state) <b>and</b> syntactic <b>restrictions</b> on programs <b>and</b> <b>specifications,</b> which pose challenges for proving soundness and for comparing/combining methodologies. This paper formalizes a second order frame rule, {{similar to that}} of separation logic but for a logic with explicit regions. The rule captures proof obligations of invariant methodologies such as ownership for dynamically instantiable abstractions, using an extended provability judgement that threads a state-based separation discipline through a proof to points where encapsulation is at risk. Soundness with respect to a standard semantics is proved using an admissibility argument for the second order frame rule. This material is based upon work supported by th...|$|R
