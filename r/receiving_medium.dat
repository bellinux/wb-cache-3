This study relates to the control of pollution of the industrial wastewater with physicochemical treatment by using an industrial waste rich in ferric chloride like original coagulant. This was tested for the control of pollution of the liquid effluents from the textile industry strongly polluted with organic matter. Several parameters were selected to control the purification of our effluents: turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and volume of sludge. The optimal concentration of the coagulant used in this treatment varies from one waste to another, according to the polluting load to treat. The output of this physicochemical treatment shows an important reduction of the polluting load of textile wastewaters: 91 – 87 % of the organic matter and 84 – 85 % of suspended solids, with less sludge production...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the estimation of the polluting load generated by domestic effluents added to those of various industries {{in one of the most}} important industrial zone in Africa.

This pollution is confirmed among others by COD/BOD ratio which may attain the value of 1. 8. Pre-treatment by coagulation floculation of waste water used in a dairy belonging to this industrial zone showed a considerable reduction of the initial pollution by a systematic decreasing of pollution parameters. Aluminium sulphates and iron chloride tested in this experience have reduced considerably all the studied parameters; the organic charge has received a very significant reduction up to 99 %. The discharge of treated effluent in the surrounding river or its use for recycling aims is then possible for this industry. However, the formed sludge can be the subject of a suitable treatment for possible agricultural, avicolous valorisation or other...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} work was to extend our {{previous}} in-vitro drug release studies using semisolid dermatological bases with non-impregnated cellulose acetate membranes. A comparison of the performances of two apparatuses, the more commonly used Franz cell and the new modified USP (mini paddle with ointment holding cell) systems were applied to this work. Five different semisolid {{as well as two}} marketed preparations containing 1 % diclofenac sodium were used. Complex, slightly non-linear release curves indicating sink conditions were found. This was explained by the co-diffusion of excipients modifying the characteristics of the membrane and the <b>receiving</b> <b>medium</b> dynamically. Although our test model is, as a rule, not suitable to establish an in-vivo-in-vitro correlation, good qualitative as well as quantitative correlations were found within some types of dermatological bases. The correlation between the results of the two in-vitro methods also depends on the type of semisolids studied. The release curve characteristics and the amount of diclofenac sodium released at 6 h were measured. Their repeatability and reproducibility were calculated. The slopes and Q-values were correlated with in-vivo data. In general, the modified USP method provided more precise results than the Franz cell method...|$|E

The purpose of this review is to summarize the pathways and factors that controlling the transport and toxicity of five extensively used ENMs. These toxicological pathways are of great importance and need to be addressed for sustainable implications of ENMs without environmental liabilities. Here we discuss five potentially utilized ENMs with their possible toxicological risk factors to aquatic plants, vertebrates model and microbes. Moreover, the key effect of ENMs surface transformations by significant reaction with environmental objects such as dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) and the effect of ENMs surface coating and surface charge will also be debated. The transformations of ENMs are subsequently facing a major ecological transition that is expected to create a substantial toxicological effect towards the ecosystem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive a {{simultaneous}} equation model of an urban economy in which the impacts of environmental policy on the suburbanization-reurbanization process can be assessed. The variable to show these effects is a measure of the density of land-use activity. The model consists of essentially four components [...] an urban land market, a market for an aggregate good, a description of a process of emission of residuals as a necessary by-product of land-use activities (production, consumption, commuting), and their accumulation and diffusion in a <b>receiving</b> <b>medium</b> (e. g., air and noise pollution). Environmental policy is then introduced into this simultaneous equation model (emission standards and fines, ordinances to install abatement equipment, emission fees, etc.). A discussion follows on the hypothesis that a successful antipollution policy could introduce a trend toward reurbanization with the claim that clear air could induce land users to relocate closer to the center of a city. The policies considered include fines for exceeding emission standards, inducing land users to purchase abatement devices in the market. The study attempts to derive the impacts of these measures on residuals' concentration, the roles of abatement devices, and urban density based on some a prior; assumptions...|$|E

The animals were individually housed and randomly allocated into 9 treatment groups of three animals each. Three levels of energy (E 1, E 2, E 3) with three levels of crude protein (P 1, P 2, P 3) were formulated to provide 90, 100 and 110 % requirement equivalents for 900 g, expected body weight gain of steers derived from NRC beef cattle requirements (1976). Live weight changes were obtained by direct weighing of the animals every month and ended by slaughtering the calves for carcass index measurements. Results indicated that Dry Matter Intake (DMI) was not significantly different between treatments. Average Daily Gain (ADG) ranged from 503 to 951 g/animal that was significantly varied among the diets (p< 0. 05).
