5000|$|In 1795, {{the machine}} was {{successfully}} used to make lacey fabrics. [...] Warp frames could be used with any thread, and the warps provided a fixed anchor for the transverse threads. In 1786 Flint invented the point bar which kept the threads at a fixed distance. In 1796, Dawson introduced cams to move the bars, and regulate the twist. Brown and Copstake succeeded in imitating Mechlen net. Lindley invented the bobbin in 1799, and Irving and Skelton the <b>regulator</b> <b>spring.</b> In 1802, Robert Brown of New Radford patented the first twist-frame, a knitter that could produce wide net.Whittaker's frame of 1804 had half its thread mounted on a warp beam and half wound on bobbins mounted on a carriage.|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} space suit requires additional capabilities for controlling and adjusting internal pressure than previous design suits. Next generation suit pressures will range from slight pressure, for astronaut prebreath comfort, to hyperbaric pressure levels for emergency medical treatment. Carleton {{was awarded a}} contract in 2008 to design and build a proof of concept bench top demonstrator regulator having five setpoints which are selectable using input electronic signaling. Although the basic regulator architecture {{is very similar to}} the existing SOP regulator used in the current EMU, the major difference is the electrical selectivity of multiple setpoints rather than the mechanical On/Off feature found on the SOP regulator. The concept regulator employs a linear actuator stepper motor combination to provide variable compression to a custom design main <b>regulator</b> <b>spring.</b> This concept allows for a continuously adjustable outlet pressures from 8. 2 psid (maximum) down to "firm" zero thus effectively allowing it to serve as a shutoff valve. This paper details the regulator design and presents test results on regulation band width, command set point accuracy; slue rate and regulation stability, particularly when the set point is being slued. Projections for a flight configuration version are also offered for performance, architectural layout and weight...|$|E
50|$|There are two {{principal}} types of Balance <b>Spring</b> <b>Regulator.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} [...] "Hog's Hair" [...] or [...] "Pig's Bristle" [...] regulator, {{in which}} stiff fibres are {{positioned}} at the extremities of the Balance's arc, {{and bring it to}} a gentle halt before throwing it back. The Watch is accelerated by shortening the arc. This is not a Balance <b>Spring</b> <b>Regulator,</b> being used in the earliest Watches before the Balance Spring was invented.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, watches have {{displayed}} {{the time in}} analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement {{appears to have a}} gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the duplex escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2 second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the double duplex escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the tri-synchro <b>regulator</b> of <b>Spring</b> Drive watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with [...] "hands" [...] that are simulated by a liquid-crystal display.|$|R
40|$|Dust {{monitoring}} data collected {{over a period}} of 5 years at a remote Australian mine site were pooled {{in order to create a}} large data set for analysis. Results adjusted for a 12 -hour shift were compared to exposure standards and 90 % of the respirable and 97 % of the inhalable dust samples were found to be within the exposure standards. Median values appear to better describe exposures than the mean which is influenced by outliers. There was a declining trend in respirable dust results over time. However, inhalable dust levels remained fairly constant over the sampling period. Inhalable dust levels were higher during the winter, yet respirable dust was elevated in the <b>spring.</b> <b>Regulators</b> need to work with practitioners in order to design dust monitoring protocols that address sampling limitations and assist mining operations to fulfil their obligations in terms of occupational hygiene monitoring and protection of their workers...|$|R
30|$|Plant growth {{regulators}}, mainly auxins, {{are widely}} used for bamboos species where rooting is difficult. The effect of growth regulators in bamboo is largely governed by the season and species. For example, B. vulgaris is easy to root and does not require growth regulator treatment. However, B. nutans, B. tulda, and D. asper require application of growth <b>regulators.</b> During <b>spring,</b> the endogenous level of hormones is often sufficient for root induction. Singh et al. (2006) reported that indole 3 -acetic acid (IAA) in summer and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) in the rainy season were most effective for rooting in B. vulgaris and D. membranaceus. Seasonal dependency of growth regulator IBA was also reported by Singh et al. (2011) for B. tulda and B. nutans. Among the seasons, summer (88 %) was most effective in B. nutans (treated with 2  mM IBA) in comparison to spring (60 %) and winter (21.8 %) with respect to survival. Different concentrations of IAA, IBA and α-napthelene acetic acid (NAA) were used for culm cuttings of B. vulgaris by Bhol and Parida (2015) who suggested not using growth regulators for rooting as its endogenous hormones are sufficient for root induction. IBA is also reported as most effective for cutting-based propagation in several bamboo species (Islam et al. 2011, Singh et al. 2011, Gulabrao et al. 2012, Kaushal et al. 2011). However, presoaking with {{a high concentration of}} NAA for 24  h before setting was found to be superior during summer in B. ventricosa (Saad et al. 2016). The effect of growth regulators also depends on setting orientation of cutting materials. Horizontal setting of IBA-treated D. asper gave higher rooting (65 %) than that of under vertical position (55 %) during summer (Razvi et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for safely reducing abnormally high intraocular pressure in an eye during a predetermined time interval is presented. This allows maintenance of normal intraocular pressure during glaucoma surgery. According to the invention, a pressure <b>regulator</b> of the <b>spring</b> biased diaphragm type {{is provided with}} additional bias by a column of liquid. The height of the column of liquid is selected such that the pressure at a hypodermic needle connected to {{the output of the}} pressure regulator is equal to the measured pressure of the eye. The hypodermic needle can then be safely inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye. Liquid is then bled out of the column to reduce the bias on the diaphragm of the pressure regulator and, consequently, the output pressure of the regulator. This lowering pressure of the regulator also occurs in the eye by means of a small second bleed path provided between the pressure regulator and the hypodermic needle. Alternately, a second hypodermic needle may be inserted into the eye to provide a controlled leak off path for excessive pressure and clouded fluid from the anterior chamber...|$|R
