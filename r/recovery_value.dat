"in {{the reign}} of Ed. 4 ... the judges ... determined, that even a nominal and fictitious recompense, {{descending}} to the issue in tail, should be an effectual bar, {{not only to the}} issue in tail, but also to the persons entitled in remainder and reversion. This, though not expressly so decided, is the inference drawn from the determination of the judges in the celebrated case 12 Ed. 4, known as Taltarum's case. The case was thus:— J. S. being seised in fee of the lands in question, gave them to one William Smith, to hold to him, and the heirs of his body, by force of which he was seised. William Smith died, leaving Humphrey, his eldest son, on whom these lands descended, who entered and was seised [...] "per formam doni". Humphrey enfeoffed one Tregos of the said lands in fee, who rendered them to the said Humphrey and Jane, his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies, remainder in fee to the said Humphrey, by force of which they were seised. Some time afterwards Jane died, on which Humphrey became sole seised of the lands in tail, and, being thus seised, one Taltarum brought a writ of right against Humphrey, and counted of his possession against him. Humphrey made defence, and vouched to warranty one R. King, who entered into the warranty, and joined the demise on the mere right. Afterwards R. King, the vouchee, made default, and departed in contempt of the court, in consequence of which final judgment was given, that the demandant, Taltarum, should recover the lands in question against Humphrey, and that Humphrey should recover lands of equal value of R. King, the vouchee. Humphrey afterwards died, without leaving heirs of his body; and the question was, whether Richard, the brother of Humphrey, who was heir in tail to those lands, should be barred by this recovery? It was determined by all the judges, that the estate tail was not barred by this recovery, because the tenant in tail was not seised of the estate tail {{at the time of the}} recovery, but of another estate; and as the <b>recovery</b> <b>value</b> goes according to the estate whereof the tenant was seised at the time of the recovery, and not in recompense of the estate he had not, the issue in tail could have no recompense in this case, and, therefore, was not barred by the recovery. It follows, therefore, that, if Humphrey had been seised of the estate tail of the gift of J.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work was to study the beneficiation of rare earth ore of the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit, located near Ketchikan, Alaska. Rare earth element (REE) composite ore samples from the Bokan Mountain [...] Dotson Ridge deposit were tested using gravity concentration, magnetic separation, flotation, and leaching techniques to separate the REE. The composite ore sample {{was a product of}} a preliminary x-ray sorting process. Qualitative electron microprobe analysis of the ore showed that most of the REE minerals in the ore were silicate minerals. Since the electron microprobe analysis samples were coated with carbon during sample preparation, the carbon element was inactivated for analysis. Because of this, carbonate compounds of minerals' particles could not be detected. 95 % of the REE mineral particles appear to be smaller than about 10 μm in size (about 100 μm² in area). For the gravity concentration, light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements' (HREE) individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> were in the ranges of 49. 6 - 52. 8 % and 46. 3 - 48. 8 %, respectively, at 25 % of mass yield. In order to separate a larger amount of the REE, a wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) test was carried out on tailings of the gravity concentration tests. The HREE individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 56. 3 - 63. 1 % at 37 % mass yield, while LREE individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> were in the 57. 9 % - 59. 1 % range. For the combined gravity and magnetic separation processes, the net individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> of the LREE and the HREE were in the range of 79. 6 - 80. 5 % and 76. 5 - 80. 9 %, respectively. The combined mass yield of the gravity and magnetic separation processes was 3 %. Direct leaching tests conducted on the composite ground ore feed yielded high individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> of 90 - 92 % of the LREE. The HREE individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 56. 5 - 87. 3 %. In the leaching, 20 % HCl was used in the 1 st and 2 nd stages with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. The solid percentage of the leach slurry was 20 % w/w. The composite ground ore sample was tested in conventional flotation using a 2. 0 L capacity Denver cell. In the flotation, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero 6493 collector, 0. 05 kg/tonne of Cytec Aero Froth 88, and 0. 1 kg/tonne of sodium metasilicate as a depressant were used. Pulp pH was set around 9. Results showed individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> in the range of 44. 6 - 50. 4 % or the LREE. The HREE individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 27. 9 - 44. 5 %. The mass yield of the flotation was 23 %. The flotation recoveries reported here are significantly lower than what was achieved previously. For the Leach after flotation process, leaching was conducted on the first concentrate of flotation. Individual elemental <b>recovery</b> <b>values</b> of the LREE and HREE were 94. 7 - 96. 5 % and 61. 1 - 90. 5 %, respectively. The concentrate was leached using 20 % HCl in both the 1 st and 2 nd stages, with a duration of 2 hrs in each stage at 90 °C. Flotation/Leach process net recoveries of LREE by individual elemental values ranged from 42. 2 - 48. 5 %. HREE net recoveries by individual elemental values ranged from 17. 1 - 41. 4 %...|$|R
50|$|Most public {{adjusters}} {{are paid}} {{based on a}} percentage of the total settlement. For example, one Georgia company states their fee is between 5% and 10% based on the type and amount of the insurance claim. However, lower percentages are used for larger losses. Higher percentages are needed for smaller losses. Smaller insurance claims can have similar costs as larger claims, but because the recovery is less on smaller claims the fee range must be adjusted to compensate the operating costs. Fees of 10% to 12% are ordinary and typical for losses of $100,000 or greater when handled by standard-rated public adjusters. Expert-rated public adjusters get a higher fee than standard-rated adjusters. For example, an expert public adjuster can charge 12% to 15% on a loss that exceeds $100,000. However, experts possess capabilities to obtain the most effective results. Therefore, highly qualified adjusters can be expected to be better skilled at achieving a better increased settlement amount than an adjuster who is not an expert. Adjusters who are experts must be classified and registered as an expert by the judicial system. Most public adjusters are not court-registered expert adjusters. Some public adjusters charge a flat percentage, while others use a regressive scale. For example, 25% of the first $100,000, 15% between $100,001 and $200,000, and 10% of any amount beyond that. Claims that are less than $50,000 are considered small losses. There are Public Adjusters who will not service smaller claims at all, while other public adjusters charge a normal range of a 30% to 35% fee rate for insurance claims with a settlement value that is less than $50,000. Public adjusters can charge a lower fee on the total settlement value of the claim, or they can charge a higher fee on an improved settlement amount that is beyond the initial settlement originally offered by the insuring organization. For example, for a $100,000 loss, a fee can be 12% on the whole claim value, where the risk is shared but for a lower fee; or alternatively, if the initial settlement was $50,000, then a public adjuster might accept a 25% fee not on the initial $50,000 but on any additional recovery settlement, a partial amount, exceeding the initial $50,000 regardless of the additional amount. However, this additional recovery method means that the public adjuster takes all of the risk, hence the higher fee. It's important to note that some states cap public adjuster fees at levels such as 10% or 20%, and some consumers opine that normal public adjuster fees are standardized, citing 10% on any claim regardless of its value. This is incorrect, and also because such limitations can cause public adjusters to avoid smaller claims altogether, since the services' costs can be a liability without providing a fair, reasonable and necessary business profit. Most states do not cap fees for this reason. Higher fees on smaller claims can provide the adequate compensation that a public adjuster needs to accept the costs of providing full services. Regardless of the fee structure, the fee may be offset by an increase in the settlement amount. In many jurisdictions, the fee structure must be disclosed up front. It {{is important to note that}} a public adjuster cannot obtain more than the policyholder is legitimately entitled to. However, the full potential <b>recovery</b> <b>value</b> of an insurance claim is often not obtained without professional assistance like that which comes from a very capable public adjuster.|$|E

For example, one Georgia company states their fee is between 5% and 10% based on the type and amount of the insurance claim. However, lower percentages are used for larger losses being claimed under a policy of insurance. Higher percentages are needed for smaller claimed losses. Smaller insurance claims can have similar costs as larger claims, but because the recovery is less on smaller claims the fee range must be adjusted to compensate for the operating costs. All public adjusters are not equal in their abilities to secure policy benefits. Skills of performance can vary significantly between public adjusters ranging from basic to elite expert. Fees of 10% to 12% are ordinary and typical for claimed losses of $100,000 or greater when handled by standard-rated public adjusters. Expert-rated public adjusters get a higher fee than standard-rated adjusters. For example, an expert public adjuster can charge 12% to 15% on a loss that exceeds $100,000. However, superior experts possess capabilities to obtain the most effective results. Therefore, highly qualified adjusters can be expected to be better skilled at achieving a greater increased benefits settlement amount than an adjuster who is not an actual expert. Adjusters who are experts must be classified and registered as an expert by the judicial system. Public adjusters declaring themselves to be experts should be verified, because such notice is not always factual. For those public adjusters who proclaim to be actual experts, it's highly recommended that their credentials be validated to prove such qualifications. Most public adjusters are not court-registered experts, but instead just have claims experience. Experience is often not expertise. Some public adjusters charge a flat percentage or a flat fee set price, while others use a regressive scale. It depends, in part, on the State Law where the loss occurred. For example, a regressive scale can be 25% of the first $100,000, 15% between $100,001 and $200,000, and 10% of any amount beyond that. Claims that are less than $50,000 are considered small claim losses. There are Public Adjusters who will not service smaller claims at all, while other public adjusters charge a normal range of a 30% to 35% fee rate for insurance claims with a settlement value that is less than $50,000. Public adjusters can charge a lower fee on the total settlement value of the claim, or they can charge a higher fee on an improved settlement amount that is beyond the initial settlement originally offered by the insuring organization. For example, for a $100,000 loss, a fee can be 12% on the whole claim value, where the cost risk can be a shared expense with the client, but for a lower fee which is a benefit for the client; or alternatively, if the initial settlement was $50,000, then a public adjuster might accept a 25% fee —not on the initial $50,000― but on any additional recovery settlement referred to as [...] "new money", being a partial claim value of an amount which exceeds the initial $50,000 settlement, where fees apply exclusively to only the additional amount recovered. However, this additional recovery method of [...] "new money only" [...] means that the public adjuster assumes all of the cost risk and expense, with no cost risk shared by the client, hence the higher fee. (For a claim not covered by the Policy, the public adjuster could experience a business loss from operating expenses spent on [...] "new money only" [...] claims that are limited to only improved settlement recovery services). There are public adjusters who contract for [...] "new money only" [...] services but charge fees of 40% and 50% to accept that high risk, where any improved settlement benefit, or the new money recovered, is essentially split about evenly between the public adjuster and the client. It's important to note that some states cap public adjuster fees at levels such as 10% or 20%, and some consumers opine that normal public adjuster fees are standardized, citing 10% on any claim regardless of its value. This is not accurate and cannot work. Such limitations can cause public adjusters to avoid helping consumers with smaller claims altogether when the services' costs can actually become a financial loss if not providing a fair, reasonable and necessary business earnings' margin needed by public adjuster firms in order to operate, just as with any business. Most states do not cap fees for this reason, while nearly all states welcome public adjuster services for their insuring public. Professional fees must be adequate for public adjusters to cover operating and business costs while still providing sufficient business income returns on those costs. Higher fees on smaller claims having low recovery values are necessary to provide the adequate compensation that a public adjuster needs to accept the costs of providing full services. Regardless of the fee structure, the public adjuster professional fee may, and will likely, be offset by an increase in the settlement amount on a covered claim. In many jurisdictions, the fee structure must be disclosed up front. It {{is important to note that}} a public adjuster cannot obtain more than the policyholder is legitimately entitled to, but public adjusters ―especially experts― generally recover a better financial settlement benefit than the fees charged to their clients, thereby leaving their clients with a net financial improvement of benefits recovery after fees are paid.

40|$|Phenol and o-cresol {{determination}} by flow injection analysis (FIA) with spectrophotometric detection, {{employing the}} 4 -aminoantipyrine reaction, is proposed {{in this work}} in order to quantify these species in soil extracts. The method was improved by a factorial planning, being verified a higher sampling rate {{in comparison with the}} conventional method, and <b>recovery</b> <b>values,</b> limits of detection and quantification similar for both methods. These aspects suggest this method as a feasible alternative for phenolic compound determinations in soil extracts...|$|R
30|$|When {{the data}} were not post-filtered in Flash 3 D (Additional file 7), {{contrast}} recovery increased very modestly (less than 0.05) for the cold rods but more severely for the hot rods. For the larger ones, the increase was as large as 0.2 in the half ROI, and the contrast recovery slightly exceeded 1.2. Using the CT fast protocol with low tube current or the CT slow protocol with high tube current on the Brightview XCT cameras resulted in almost identical contrast <b>recovery</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R
