5|$|Castle is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} catch-all term {{for all kinds of}} fortifications and, as a <b>result,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had a very different origin and purpose.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} phylogenetic {{hypothesis that}} has gained substantial traction places Brancasaurus in the clade Leptocleididae, {{along with other}} leptocleidids including Leptocleidus itself, Vectocleidus, Umoonasaurus, Nichollssaura, and also possibly Hastanectes. This <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also noted a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus with the more general Leptocleidia.|$|E

To date its best <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> 5th, which Australia has {{achieved}} twice in both {{of the most recent}} tournaments held—2009 and 2011. At the 2007 tournament, Trent Oeltjen became the first Australian player to be named in a World Cup All Star team, in recognition of his tournament-leading hitting and base-running statistics. Australia is currently participating in the 2011 tournament in Panama.|$|E

5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} low-density {{development has}} been given the pejorative label urban sprawl. This is changing, however. White flight is reversing, with many Yuppies and upper-middle-class, empty nest Baby Boomers returning to urban living, usually in condominia, such as in New York City's Lower East Side, and Chicago's South Loop. The <b>result</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents. (see gentrification).|$|E
25|$|The Nigerian-Biafran war brought devastation to Onitsha as {{the city}} was a major theatre of war for forces {{entering}} Biafra from the western front.
