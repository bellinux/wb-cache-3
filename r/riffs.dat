5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music.

The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing <b>riffs,</b> but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
