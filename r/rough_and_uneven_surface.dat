40|$|Graphene {{is known}} to be a key {{material}} for improving the performance of hydrogen sensors. High electrical conductivity, maximum possible surface area with respect to volume, and high carrier mobility {{are a few of the}} properties that make graphene ideal for hydrogen sensing applications. The problem with utilizing graphene is the difficulty in depositing uniform, thin layers onto substrate surfaces. This study examines a new method of optimizing graphene deposition by utilizing an airbrush to deposit both graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto glass substrates. The number of depositions were varied among samples to study the effect of layer thickness on the electrical and topographic properties of rGO. Linear sweep voltammetry tests show that increasing the amount of rGO deposited resulted in superior conductivity. Substrates coated with 5 spray-coats of rGO had a film conductivity of 0. 35 S/m whereas substrates coated with 20 spray-coats displayed film conductivity of 7. 67 S/m. An analysis of the topography of spray-coated rGO films revealed a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> texture resulting in hydrophobic wetting properties of rGO. When palladium nanoparticles were deposited onto rGO, samples demonstrated significant conductivity loss due to uneven palladium deposition and deformation of rGO. The unique electrical properties displayed by varying the amounts of deposited rGO establishes a method of hydrogen sensor fabrication with controllable rGO film conductivity...|$|E

40|$|In {{this case}} study, {{a number of}} gunite {{swimming}} pools exhibited extensive map or alligator cracking that caused <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The nature of the cracking pointed to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) {{as the cause of}} the cracking. Four test methods, the uranyl acetate method, petrographic examination, chemical analysis by electron microprobe, and X-ray diffraction, were used to investigate the presence of ASR within the gunite. Results showed (1) some evidence of ASR gel within the gunite using uranyl acetate; (2) the potential existence of alkali silica gel throughout the cement and within the fractures of the sand grains based on petrographic examination; (3) elevated levels of total alkali, indicating a potential for ASR to occur based on chemical analysis; and (4) tiny inclusions of thermonatrite (commonly found in ASR gel) based on X-ray diffraction. Results from each of the four test methods suggest, albeit inconclusively, the existence of ASR in the gunite. Additionally, the results of all of the four test methods did not contradict each other. Accordingly, it can be stated with some certainty that the distress in the gunite was due to ASR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For {{humanoid}} robots {{to fulfill}} their mobility po-tential they must demonstrate reliable and efficient locomotion over rugged and irregular terrain. In this paper we present the perception and planning algorithms which have allowed a humanoid robot to use only passive stereo imagery (as opposed to actuating a laser range sensor) to safely plan footsteps to continuously walk over <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> without stopping. The perception system continuously integrates stereo imagery to build a consistent 3 D model of the terrain which is then used by our footstep planner which reasons about obstacle avoidance, kinematic reachability and foot rotation through mixed-integer quadratic optimization to plan the required step positions. We illustrate that our stereo imagery fusion approach can measure the walking terrain with sufficient accuracy that it matches the quality of terrain estimates from LIDAR. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} such demonstration of the use of computer vision to carry out general purpose terrain estimation on a locomoting robot — and additionally to do so in continuous motion. A particular integration challenge was ensuring that these two computationally intensive systems oper-ate with minimal latency (below 1 second) to allow re-planning while walking. The results of extensive experimentation and quantitative analysis are also presented. Our results indicate that a laser range sensor is not necessary to achieve locomotion in these challenging situations. I...|$|R

In this study {{the effect of the}} presence of the BG nanoparticles in P(3 HB) microsphere films on the structural properties, thermal properties and biocompatibility of the films were studied. The nanoscaled bioactive glass with a high surface area was also tested for its in vitro haemostatic efficacy and was found to be able to successfully reduce the clot detection time. In an effort to study the effect of the roughness induced by the formation of HA on the cellular functions such as cell adhesion, cell mobility and cell differentiation, the composite films were immersed in SBF for a period of 1, 3 and 7 days. From the SEM images the surface of the P(3 HB) /n-BG composite microsphere films appeared fairly uniform and smooth on day 1, however on day 3 and day 7 a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> was observed. The presence of HA on the composite microsphere films on day 3 and day 7 influenced the surface roughness of the films. However, when the P(3 HB) /n-BG composite microspheres with enhanced surface roughness were tested for biocompatibility, reduced amount of protein adsorption and cell adhesion were observed. This study thus revealed that there is an optimal surface roughness for the P(3 HB) microsphere films for increased cell adhesion, beyond which it could be deleterious for cell adhesion and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{method of}} design and fabrication of vacuum-packaged microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and of individual microelectromechanical devices {{involves the use of}} multiple internal seal rings (MISRs) in conjunction with vias (through holes plated with metal for electrical contacts). The proposed method is compatible with mass production in a wafer-level fabrication process, in which the dozens of MEMS or individual microelectromechanical devices on a typical wafer are simultaneously vacuum packaged by bonding a capping wafer before the devices are singulated (cut apart by use of a dicing saw). In addition to being compatible with mass production, the proposed method would eliminate the need for some complex and expensive production steps and would yield more reliable vacuum seals. Conventionally, each MEMS or individual microelectromechanical device is fabricated as one of many identical units on a device wafer. Vacuum packaging is accomplished by bonding the device wafer to a capping wafer with metal seal rings (one ring surrounding each unit) that have been formed on the capping wafer. The electrical leads of each unit are laid out on what would otherwise be a flat surface of the device wafer, against which the seal ring is to be pressed for sealing. The resulting pattern of metal lines and their insulating oxide coverings presents a very <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface,</b> upon which it is difficult to pattern the sealing metal. Consequently, the seal is prone to leakage unless additional costly and complex planarization steps are performed before patterning the seal ring and bonding the wafers...|$|E
40|$|Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) or Laser Sintering (LS) allows {{functional}} {{parts to}} be produced {{in a wide range}} of powdered materials using a dedicated machine, and is thus gaining popularity within the field of rapid prototyping. Two current manufacturers of LS equipment and materials are EOS GmbH and 3 D Systems. The PA 2200 semi-crystalline polyamide powder studied here was developed by EOS and was processed using the 3 D Systems Sinterstation 2500 HiQ LS machine. One of the advantages of employing LS is that the loose powder of the building chamber can be recycled. However, the properties of some recycled powders such as polyamide 12 (PA 12) deteriorate by comparison to those of fresh powder. Fabricating parts using only new powder, although providing the best quality, is considerably more expensive than using recycled powder. On the other hand, using recycled powder creates the problem of the coarse, <b>rough,</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> texture. This thesis examines LS fabricated parts which are affected by the "orange peel" phenomenon due to the usage of recycled PA 12 powder. This problem must be addressed before the technology can be widely accepted. This thesis presents the problematic areas and proposes solutions to manage and utilise the recycled powder. Further, the thesis discusses experimental work on the deterioration or ageing of PA 12 powder properties in the LS process, the microstructure of "orange peel" texture and the improvement of part surface finish to avoid the "orange peel" problem.

Moreover they have metric capabilities enabling the 3 d evaluation {{of an object}} provided at least two panoramas (Fangi, 2007, 2008). The procedure already very well tested, is highly efficient and fast, although neither the orientation phase nor the plotting phase are still automatized. The photogrammetric technique {{is used for the}} survey and the three-dimensional representation of architecture; it has the same accuracy of the monoscopic multi-image low-cost systems. The advantages to use such technique turn out to be numerous: first of all the great simplification of the photogrammetric problem: every single panorama replaces many photogrammetric takings representing a complete documentation of the object, then the high speed of execution and the easiness to plot by non-expert technicians. The main limit of this approach consists on the contrary in the difficult identification of the corresponding points, which is easy in case of sharp points and corners, while it is difficult or impossible- {{because of the lack of}} stereoscopy- in case of <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as rocks, or rough blocks, like in archaeology, or curved walls. To try to solve this problem the proposed procedure has been tested, consisting in the interactive 3 d editing of the model obtained from the plotted original wire-frame, (this last limited to the suitable points only), by means of the projection of the oriented panoramas in 3 d max ® environment, which is possible because the orientation of any panorama is known, say the 3 coordinates of the projection centre, and the 3 rotation angles.

Frozen contaminants cause <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> which will disturb smooth air flow and greatly degrade the ability of the wing to generate lift and increasing drag. Amongst icing mitigation systems, passive anti-icing coatings represent a challenge to reduce the ice nucleation and growth, reducing the power consumption of the active de-icing systems and consequently the fuel consumption. In this work the advanced properties and effectiveness of the new multifunctional coating with ice-phobic and aesthetical properties are described. In particular advanced morphological characterizations based on Atomic Force Microscopy and Laser Scanning Microscopy measurements as well as subsequent Power Spectral Density analysis were performed to evaluate the surface roughness. Contact angle measurements were executed {{in order to determine the}} wettability and surface free energy as well as work of adhesion in flight conditions. In addition, dynamic analysis of the impact of single water droplets on the new multifunctional coating and the classical livery coating were performed in order to demonstrate the different physical behavior during the impingement. It was also demonstrated that the new multifunctional coating overcome the environmental test similarly to the commercial livery coating in accordance with the aeronautical specification. Finally, two NACA symmetric airfoils were design and developed using 3 D printing technology. The surfaces were coated with a commercial coating in one case and with the new multifunctional coating in the other case. Both airfoils were tested in the Icing Wind Tunnel at different conditions in order to evaluate the effectiveness, in terms of reduction of accreted ice, of the new multifunctional coating respect to the commercial one.

Other peaks relevant to the oxidation process such as the peaks relating to the disulfide (450 – 550  cm− 1), thiol (2500 – 2600  cm− 1) or sulfur carbon groups (590 – 700  cm− 1) can appear as very weak bands that may be masked by background noise [13, 14]. Rather such groups are often identified through Raman spectroscopy [15 – 18], where such bands are typically stronger than in FTIR and NIR. Though useful in following chemical changes that occur in wool proteins [19 – 22], FTIR-ATR is ultimately destructive, requiring sacrificial samples that are not always accessible in historic collections. For historic tapestries, {{it is not possible}} to take samples from the front of the tapestry. In the MODHT project this sampling issue was addressed by removing fibres from the back of the tapestries. Behind the tapestry the microclimate may differ from that experienced on the surface of the tapestries. Fibres at the back of the tapestries are also better protected from the effects of exposure to light. In FTIR-ATR analysis sample compression is necessary and may cause further physical damage to already vulnerable objects. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) can be used for a non-invasive approach, however the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface</b> of fibres in tapestries may produce erroneous results and spectra that are difficult to interpret [23]. In previous unpublished research by McCullough 1, DRIFTS was unable to produce spectra containing useful chemical information for historic tapestry fragments at Hampton Court Palace.|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} form of cancer among men in Europe and the US is {{prostate}} cancer. When a radical prostatectomy has been found necessary, it is of interest to examine the prostate, as tumour tissue on the capsule might indicate that the cancer has metastased. This is commonly done by a microscope-based morphometric investigation. Tumour tissue is normally stiffer than healthy tissue. Sensors based on piezoelectric resonance technology have been introduced into the medical field during the last decade. By studying the change in resonance frequency when a sensor comes into contact with a material, conclusions can be drawn about the material. A new and flexible measurement system using a piezoelectric resonance sensor has been evaluated. Three translation stages, two for horizontal movements and one for vertical movement, with stepper motors are controlled from a PC. A piezoelectric resonance element and a force sensor are integrated into a sensor head that is mounted on the vertical translation stage. The piezoelectric element is connected to a feed-back circuit and resonating at its resonance frequency until it comes into contact with a material, when a frequency shift can be observed. The force sensor is used to measure the applied force between the sensor and the material. These two parameters are combined into a third, called the stiffness parameter, which is important for stiffness evaluation. For measurements on objects with different geometries, the vertical translation stage can be aimed at a platform for flat objects or a fixture for spherical objects. The vertical translation stage is mounted on a manual rotational stage with which the contact angle between the sensor and the measured surface can be adjusted. The contact angles covered are between 0 ° and 35 ° from a line perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} measured object. The measured objects used were made from silicones of different stiffness and in the shape of flat discs and spheres. The indentation velocity of the sensor can be set at 1 mm/s to 5 mm/s. In the three papers that are the base for this licentiate thesis, we have investigated the dependence of the frequency shift, the applied force and the stiffness parameter on the contact angle, and the indentation velocity at different impression depths. The maximum error for the measurement system has also been determined. The results of the measurements indicate that great care must be taken when aiming the sensor against the surface of the point where the measurements are to be performed. Deviations in contact angle of more than iv± 10 ° from a line perpendicular to the surface will result in an underestimation of the frequency shift, meaning that the tissue will be regarded as stiffer than it really is. This result is important as the flat silicone models have a very even surface, which makes a controlled contact angle possible. Biological tissue can have a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surface,</b> which can lead to unintentional deviations in the contact angle. The magnitude of the stiffness parameter is favoured by a high indentation velocity compared to a low. The evaluation of this measurement system has shown that it is possible to distinguish between soft and stiff silicone models, which have been used in this initial phase of the study. A new feature in this measurement system is the fixture that makes measurements on spherical objects possible and the possibility to vary the angle of contact. This is promising for future studies and measurements on whole prostate in vitro. A future application for this measurement system is to aid surgeons performing radical prostatectomy in the search for tumour tissue on the capsule of the prostate, as the presence of tumour tissue can indicate that the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissue...|$|E

This resulted in the Messerschmitt Bf 163 and Siebel Si 201 competing against the Fieseler firm's entry. Conceived by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director Erich Bachem, Fieseler's design had a far better short {{take off and landing}} ("STOL") performance. A fixed slat ran along {{the entire length of the}} leading edge of the long wings, while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This was inspired by earlier 1930s Junkers Doppelflügel, [...] "double-wing" [...] aircraft wing control surface design concepts. For the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel's trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located flaps and outboard-located ailerons, which themselves included trim tab devices over half of each aileron's trailing edge length. A design feature rare for land-based aircraft enabled the wings on the Storch to be folded back along the fuselage in a manner similar to the wings of the US Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter. This allowed the aircraft to be carried on a trailer or even towed slowly behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin. The long legs of the main landing gear contained oil-and-spring shock absorbers that had a travel of 40 cm (15-3/4 inches), allowing the aircraft to land on comparatively <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> - this was combined with a [...] "pre-travel" [...] distance of 20 cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock. In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, Storch. With its very low landing speed the Storch often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards, in strong winds from directly ahead.|$|R
40|$|Wheeled {{vehicles}} or robots {{can achieve}} high speed locomotion {{with a relatively}} lower control complexity compared to other forms such as legged, hopping, or slithering robots. However, wheeled vehicles have several limitations on <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces.</b> For instance, wheel robots are much speedier than legged counterpart, but wheeled rope climbing robots {{are supposed to have}} very smooth ropes. Moreover, wheels come into contact with all details of the terrain causing higher energy losses in friction. More specifically, this causes higher losses on soft contact surfaces like a slacked rope. "Development of a multipurpose rope climbing robot" research is mainly focusing on developing a rope climbing robot that can be applied in various practical situations. Objective of this research is to design a four legged rope climbing robot that smoothly and steadily moves on a rope. Different mechanisms such as wheeled robot, brachalion robot, crawling type robots and different kind of legged robots have been developed to achieve this target and they have their own advantages and disadvantages. The proposed robot is a four legged robot and each leg has two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom to rotate the leg forward and backward and second degree of freedom is for grip the rope by each leg. This robot is always grip the rope very steadily and moves on rope very smoothly. These two characteristics are important to carry a weight with a robot and easily can maintain an overall stability of the robot. The robot is planned to work on various situations {{and the nature of the}} rope or characteristics such as size of the rope, whether the rope vertical or horizontal directional and whether the rope is having some obstacles like knots or bend at some points on the rope.

For rescue operations, military operations, scientific researches operate on danger areas for humans and specific rope climbing operations can be achieved by the proposed robot.

40|$|Objectives: Surface {{reconstruction}} and fitting for geometric primitives and three Dimensional (3 D) modeling {{is a fundamental}} task {{in the field of}} photogrammetry and reverse engineering. However it is impractical to get point cloud data without outliers/noise being present. The noise in the data acquisition process induces <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces,</b> <b>and</b> reduces the precision/accuracy of the acquired model. This paper investigates the problem of local surface {{reconstruction and}} best fitting from unorganized outlier contaminated 3 D point cloud data. Methods: Least Squares (LS) method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and RANSAC are the three most popular techniques for fitting planar surfaces to 2 D and 3 D data. All three methods are affected by outliers and do not give reliable and robust parameter estimation. In the statistics literature, robust techniques and outlier diagnostics are two complementary approaches but any one alone is not sufficient for outlier detection and robust parameter estimation. We propose a diagnostic-robust statistical algorithm that uses both approaches in combination for fitting planar surfaces in the presence of outliers. Robust distance is used as a multivariate diagnostic technique for outlier detection and robust PCA is used as an outlier resistant technique for plane fitting. The robust distance is the robustification of the well-known Mohalanobis distance by using the recently introduced high breakdown Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) location and scatter estimates. The classical PCA measures data variability through the variance and the corresponding directions are the latent vectors which are sensitive to outlying observations. In contrast, the robust PCA which combines the 'projection pursuit' approach with a robust scatter matrix based on the MCD of the covariance matrix, is robust with outlying observations in the dataset. In addition, robust PCA produces graphical displays of orthogonal distance and score distance as the by-products which can detects outliers and aids better robust fitting by using robust PCA for a second time in the final plane fitting stage. In summary, the proposed method removes the outliers first and then fits the local surface in a robust way. Results and conclusions: We present a new diagnostic-robust statistical technique for local surface fitting in 3 D point cloud data. Finally, the benefits of the new diagnostic-robust algorithm are demonstrated through an artificial dataset and several terrestrial mobile mapping laser scanning point cloud datasets. Comparative results show that the classical LS and PCA methods are very sensitive to outliers and failed to reliably fit planes. The RANSAC algorithm is not completely free from the effect of outliers and requires more processing time for large datasets. The proposed method smooths away noise and is significantly better and efficient than the other three methods for local planar surface fitting even in the presence of roughness. This method is applicable for 3 D straight line fitting as well and has great potential for local normal estimation and different types of surface fitting...|$|R

50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm infection pressure on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the herd. Farmers with fattening herds are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether weaners need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> <b>surfaces</b> would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the fattening pens when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum eggs. Instead, steam cleaning and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|R

60|$|The dwelling-houses, and {{contiguous}} outhouses, are, in many instances, of {{the colour}} {{of the native}} rock, out of {{which they have been}} built; but, frequently the Dwelling or Fire-house, as it is ordinarily called, has been distinguished from the barn or byer by rough-cast and white wash, which, as the inhabitants are not hasty in renewing it, in a few years acquires, by the influence of weather, a tint at once sober and variegated. As these houses have been, from father to son, inhabited by persons engaged in the same occupations, yet necessarily with changes in their circumstances, they have received without incongruity additions and accommodations adapted to the needs of each successive occupant, who, being for the most part proprietor, was at liberty to follow his own fancy: so that these humble dwellings remind the contemplative spectator of a production of Nature, and may (using a strong expression) rather be said to have grown than to have been erected;--to have risen, by an instinct of their own, out of the native rock--so little is there in them of formality, such is their wildness and beauty. Among the numerous recesses and projections in the walls and in the different stages of their roofs, are seen bold and harmonious effects of contrasted sunshine and shadow. It is a favourable circumstance, that the strong winds, which sweep down the vallies, induced the inhabitants, {{at a time when the}} materials for building were easily procured, to furnish many of these dwellings with substantial porches; and such as have not this defence, are seldom unprovided with a projection of two large slates over their thresholds. Nor will the singular beauty of the chimneys escape the eye of the attentive traveller. Sometimes a low chimney, almost upon a level with the roof, is overlaid with a slate, supported upon four slender pillars, to prevent the wind from driving the smoke down the chimney. Others are of a quadrangular shape, rising one or two feet above the roof; which low square is often surmounted by a tall cylinder, giving to the cottage chimney the most beautiful shape in which it is ever seen. Nor will it be too fanciful or refined to remark, that there is a pleasing harmony between a tall chimney of this circular form, and the living column of smoke, ascending from it through the still air. These dwellings, mostly built, as has been said, of rough unhewn stone, are roofed with slates, which were rudely taken from the quarry before the present art of splitting them was understood, <b>and</b> are, therefore, <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>uneven</b> in their <b>surface,</b> so that both the coverings and sides of the houses have furnished places of rest for the seeds of lichens, mosses, ferns, and flowers. Hence buildings, which in their very form call to mind the processes of Nature, do thus, clothed in part with a vegetable garb, appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things, as it acts and exists among the woods and fields; and, by their colour and their shape, affectingly direct the thoughts to that tranquil course of Nature and simplicity, along which the humble-minded inhabitants have, through so many generations, been led. Add the little garden with its shed for bee-hives, its small bed of pot-herbs, and its borders and patches of flowers for Sunday posies, with sometimes a choice few too much prized to be plucked; an orchard of proportioned size; a cheese-press, often supported by some tree near the door; a cluster of embowering sycamores for summer shade; with a tall fir, through which the winds sing when other trees are leafless; the little rill or household spout murmuring in all seasons;--combine these incidents and images together, and you have the representative idea of a mountain-cottage in this country so beautifully formed in itself, and so richly adorned by the hand of Nature.|$|R
