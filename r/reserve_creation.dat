The Bank of Japan (BoJ) possesses the power to end deflation and restore price stability by creating money. To do so, the BoJ needs to adopt a policy of active <b>reserves</b> <b>creation</b> where <b>reserves</b> <b>creation</b> depends upon misses of a target either for money growth or for the price level. With its present policy of demand-driven <b>reserves</b> <b>creation,</b> the BoJ limits <b>reserves</b> <b>creation</b> to the amount of reserves demanded by banks. The high level of reserves held by banks does not indicate an aggressive BoJ policy of reserves provision.

In the absence of a strategy that makes the amount of bank reserves vary to control money and prices—for example, to eliminate misses in a target for the price level— the acquisition of such assets is comparable to sterilized foreign exchange intervention. Their purchase affects the composition of the public’s asset portfolio without increasing bank reserves and money in a way that forces the portfolio rebalancing that stimulates expenditure. According to popular commentary, monetary policy is impotent to stop deflation. One argument made is that the transmission mechanism linking central bank <b>reserves</b> <b>creation</b> to money and credit creation has been severed. Lacking opportunities to lend, banks hold whatever liquidity the central bank provides as excess reserves. Another argument is that at a zero interest rate...|$|R

40|$|We utilize {{a spatial}} bioeconomic model to {{investigate}} the impacts of creating reserves on limited-entry fisheries. We find that <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> can produce win-win situations where aggregate biomass and the common license (lease) price increase. These situations arise in biological systems where dispersal processes are prevalent and the fishery prior to <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> is operating at effort levels in a neighborhood of open-access levels. We also illustrate that using strictly biological criteria for siting reserves (e. g., setting aside the most biological productive areas) will likely induce the most vociferous objections from the fishing industry. In general, {{we find that the}} dispersal rate and the degree the patches are connected play a significant role on the net impacts on the fishing sector. fisheries, limited-entry, marine reserves...|$|E

S. Gordon/Vernon Smith hypothesis of a rent dissipation process with Ricardian notions that resources are exploited across space in a pattern dependent upon relative profitabilities. The metapopulation model employed here incorporates modern biological ideas that stress patch heterogeneity, linkages, and dispersal processes between patches. The spatial bioeconomic model is then used to simulate the effects of <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> under various ecological structures. We find, under certain parameter configurations and ecological linkages, that there is potential for a "double-dividend" where both aggregate biomass and harvest increase after {{an area of the}} fishery is set aside and protected from exploitation. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of using marine {{reserves}} in combination with quotas as fisheries management tools using a patchy environment model as the biological foundation. The rent generated by fishing on the total population, using optimal quotas as a management tool, is compared to the rent from the fishery when managed with quotas and a marine reserve. This is done under different assumptions regarding the type of dispersal mechanisms between the sub-populations in the different patches and under two different assumptions regarding the harvest function. It is shown that the profitability of <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> depends on the migration rate relative to the intrinsic growth rate and the cost / price ratio and that the choice of harvesting function is of particular importance when the costs of fishing are high...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{fisheries}} management {{relies on the}} imposition of gear and/or effort restrictions. In spite of much experience with such techniques, the danger of fishery collapse is ever present. Biologists have advocated an alternative strategy, the establishment of marine reserves. However, {{it is possible that}} the benefits of marine <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> can be overstated if economic behaviour is ignored. In spite of being managed under a system of transferable quotas, the Stewart Island paua (abalone) fishery has been in decline for some time. We develop an integrated economic and biological model of this fishery and use it to predict biomass levels in a number of scenarios, including the imposition of a network of no-take areas. We identify circumstances under which the marine reserve solution outperforms traditional management techniques. We show that the benefit of a marine reserve is highest when a fishery is heavily exploited and when accounting for stochastic recruitment...|$|E

[...] The latter category was not explicitly defined, but included United States Notes, National Bank Notes, and certain other notes held by banks to meet reserve requirements, such as clearing certificates. The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 removed the gold obligation and authorized the Treasury to satisfy these redemption demands with current notes of equal face value (effectively making change). Under the Bretton Woods system, although citizens could not possess gold, the federal government continued to maintain a stable international gold price. This system ended with the Nixon Shock of 1971. Present-day Federal Reserve Notes are not backed by convertibility to any specific commodity, but only by the collateral assets that Federal Reserve Banks post in order to obtain them.|$|R

A brief description follows of the Innu of Labrador, emphasising their unique history relative to Canadian Aboriginal groups in general. Following this, data from the recent study are outlined, providing evidence of almost complete failure of schooling for the Innu. Finally, these data are discussed as insights into how the Innu, and those responsible for providing schooling for them, value and react to factors in the situation...|$|E

40|$|Community-managed {{reserves}} (CMRs) {{comprise the}} fastest-growing category {{of protected areas}} throughout the tropics. CMRs represent a compromise between advocates of nature conservation and advocates of human development. We ask whether CMRs succeed in achieving the goals of either. A fixed reserve area can produce only a finite resource supply, whereas human populations exploiting them tend to expand rapidly while adopting high-impact technologies to satisfy rising aspirations. Intentions behind the establishment of CMRs may be admirable, but represent an ideal rarely achieved. People tied to the natural forest subsist on income levels that are among {{the lowest in the}} Amazon. Limits of sustainable harvesting are often low and rarely known prior to <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> or respected thereafter, and resource exhaustion predictably follows. Unintended consequences typically emerge, such as overhunting of the seed dispersers, pollinators, and other animals that provide services essential to perpetuating the forest. CMRs are a low priority for governments, so mostly operate without enforcement, a laxity that encourages illegal forest conversion. Finally, the pull of markets can alter the “business plan” of a reserve overnight, as inhabitants switch to new activities. The reality is {{that we live in a}} hyperdynamic world of accelerating change in which past assumptions must continually be re-evaluated...|$|E
40|$|A multi-scaled {{model for}} {{biodiversity}} conservation in forests {{was introduced in}} Sweden 30 years ago, {{which makes it a}} pioneer example of an integrated ecosystem approach. Trees are set aside for biodiversity purposes at multiple scale levels varying from individual trees to areas of thousands of hectares, with landowner responsibility at the lowest level and with increasing state involvement at higher levels. Ecological theory supports the multi-scaled approach, and retention efforts at every harvest occasion stimulate landowners’ interest in conservation. We argue that the model has large advantages but that in a future with intensified forestry and global warming, development based on more progressive thinking is necessary to maintain and increase biodiversity. Suggestions for the future include joint planning for several forest owners, consideration of cost-effectiveness, accepting opportunistic work models, adjusting retention levels to stand and landscape composition, introduction of temporary <b>reserves,</b> <b>creation</b> of “receiver habitats” for species escaping climate change, and protection of young forests. © Springe...|$|R
30|$|While pastoralists {{continue}} to provide valuable ecosystem services in support of Tanzania's tourism industry and related wildlife conservation interests, the wildlife and tourism sectors continue their long legacy of failing to reciprocate in their provisions {{as they relate to}} pastoralists. Historically, pastoralists have lost key lands and resources to the state-protected areas and {{continue to}} lose access to areas. For example, the Mkungunero Game <b>Reserve's</b> <b>creation</b> in the late 1990 s in the southern Maasai steppe created conflicts with local pastoralist villages and widespread apprehension about expanding protected areas and land loss in the area (Sachedina 2008). The allocation of centrally managed tourist hunting concessions on community lands is a widespread source of conflict and results in local people having insecure rights over land and resources in areas such as the Maasai steppe (Sachedina 2008). Pastoralists in Loliondo and the Maasai steppe have also had recurrent disputes with protected area authorities regarding the boundaries of their lands and national parks (Goldman 20092011).|$|R

Further, evidence shows that government deficit leads to incremental <b>reserve</b> money <b>creation</b> even though the Reserve Bank financing of Government deficit almost ceased to exist during most part of the current decade. It argues that Government deficit by influencing the level of sterilisation impacts the accretion of net foreign assets to RBI balance sheet and, therefore, continues to be a key factor causing incremental <b>reserve</b> money <b>creation</b> and overall expansion in money supply. Given the finding that money leads to inflation, government deficit, therefore, remains relevant for stabilisation. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} socio-ecological {{resilience}} concept to compare {{two categories of}} fisheries co-management in Brazil: Extractive and Sustainable Development Reserves. Ecological resilience was estimated by the indicators: reserve areas, human density {{and the existence of}} buffer zones around the reserves. Indicators for social-resilience were grouped in two categories: flexibility (assessed by livelihood diversification and resources exploited) and capacity to organize (assessed by local/governrnenta 1 demand for <b>reserve</b> <b>creation,</b> existence of fishing management rules or management plans, participation in the decision-making process and existence of self-monitoring). Amazonian reserves are larger, have buffer zones and people depend on a broader range of natural resources compared to those on the coast. However, the inhabitants of coastal reserves can rely on ecotourism and jobs outside the reserves, which may reduce local fishing pressure. Both regions have reserves created using top-down initiatives as well as those created from local demands. Yet, participation in decision making is not necessarily related to the origin of demand and the level of local involvement can be limited in either case. Unless co-management is followed by adaptive management, increased local participation of people in management and the diversification of economic sources. its benefit to resilience is limited.

40|$|We {{present the}} first study of density and {{apparent}} survival for a jaguar (Panthera onca) population in northern Mexico using 13 years of camera trap data from 2000 to 2012. We used the Barker robust design model which combines data from closed sampling periods and resight data between these periods to estimate apparent survival and abundance. We identified 467 jaguar pictures that corresponded to 48 jaguar individuals. We included camera type and field technician as covariates for detection probabilities. We used three covariates to evaluate the effect of reserve on jaguar apparent survival: i) private <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> ii) later reserve expansions, and iii) cattle ranches' conservation activities. We found {{that the use of}} digital cameras in addition to film cameras increased detection probability by a factor of 6 x compared with the use of only film cameras (p = 0. 34 ± 0. 05 and p = 0. 05 ± 0. 02 respectively) in the closed period and more than three times in the open period (R = 0. 91 ± 0. 08 and R = 0. 30 ± 0. 13 mixed and film cameras respectively). Our availability estimates showed no temporary emigration and a fidelity probability of 1. Despite an increase of apparent survival probability from 0. 47 ± 0. 15 to 0. 56 ± 0. 11 after 2007, no single covariate explained the change in these point estimates. Mean jaguar density was 1. 87 ± 0. 47 jaguars/ 100 km 2. We found that 13 years of jaguar population monitoring with our sampling size were not enough for detecting changes in survival or density.

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{experiencing}} a growing fire problem driven by climatic change, agricultural expansion and forest degradation. Protected areas {{are an important}} feature of forest protection strategies, and sustainable use reserves (SURs) may be reducing fire prevalence since they promote sustainable livelihoods and resource management. However, the use of fire in swidden agriculture, {{and other forms of}} land management, may be undermining the effectiveness of SURs in meeting their conservation and sustainable development goals. We analyse MODIS derived hot pixels, TRMM rainfall data, Terra-Class land cover data, socio-ecological data from the Brazilian agro-census and the spatial extent of rivers and roads to evaluate whether the designation of SURs reduces fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we ask (1) a. Is SUR location (i. e., de facto) or (1) b. designation (i. e. de jure) the driving factor affecting performance in terms of the spatial density of fires?, and (2), Does SUR creation affect fire management (i. e., the timing of fires in relation to previous rainfall) ? We demonstrate that pre-protection baselines are crucial for understanding reserve performance. We show that <b>reserve</b> <b>creation</b> had no discernible impact on fire density, and that fires were less prevalent in SURs due to their characteristics of sparser human settlement and remoteness, rather than their status de jure. In addition, the timing of fires in relation to rainfall, indicative of local fire management and adherence to environmental law, did not improve following SUR creation. These results challenge the notion that SURs promote environmentally sensitive fire-management, and suggest that SURs in Amazonia will require special attention if they are to curtail future accidental wildfires, particularly as plans to expand the road infrastructure throughout the region are realised. Greater investment to support improved fire management by farmers living in reserves, in addition to other fire users, will be necessary to help ameliorate these threats...|$|E
