5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to discuss}} Nina Sayers 2 ̆ 7 <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> which are portrayed {{through the use}} of many kinds of symbols. Each stage <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is {{represented}} by symbols. Thus, I will use the theory <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to match the symbols with characteristics of each stage and the concept of symbols to analyze the symbols so that the meanings are appropriate to the contexts and able to show the ways Nina Sayers 2 ̆ 7 <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are symbolized. The analysis shows that each stage <b>of</b> the <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is symbolized by many forms of symbols. It also shows that symbols <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> can actually hold more than one meaning as they can change meanings in each stage <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> In the end, it can be concluded that symbols in Black Swan have been effectively used to strongly reveal the <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage...</b>|$|R

Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's true name symbolically kills the child, who must then assume adulthood.

5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} {{influence is}} also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one {{of a variety of}} flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> being {{significant}} markers in a {{human life}} time, have, due to processes of secularization been diminished in Dutch society. This article investigates how different contemporary Pagan movements have affected modern civil society in the Netherlands in finding new expressions <b>of</b> celebrating <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Contemporary Pagans have, since the movement's emergence, been conscious about cycles of change and accordingly of the importance <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> The most important Pagan "liturgy" of the seasonal calendar of the Wheel of the Year incorporates in its symbolism changes in the human life cycle. The relationship between the Wheel of the Year and <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> will thus be discussed for five Dutch Pagan traditions, examining how Dutch contemporary Pagans have inspired non-Pagans in celebrating their <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2014...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are {{no longer}} {{familiar}} to many people as lifestyle becomes fast-paced. When changes happen in life, many {{people are more likely}} to feel distressed and confused as they do not have time anymore to conduct <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to help them focus through the changes. Therefore, this study is conducted to reintroduce the archetypal process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Rise <b>of</b> the Guardians is one of literary works that feature the archetypal process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage.</b> Jack Frost’s <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to join the Guardians in Rise of the Guardians film are analyzed in this study since film is the manifestation of social consciousness and constitutes a reflection of reality and therefore can be subjected to an academic study. Rise of the Guardians portrays Jack Frost’s process to be a member of the Guardians, a group of mythical figures whose job is protecting children’s wonder, hopes, and dreams. Archetypal approach is used in this study as the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is universal. This study mainly uses Arnold van Gennep’s and William Bridges’ theories to identify the archetypal pattern of the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> experienced by Jack Frost. The results show that Jack Frost experiences the three archetypal phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>rites</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> which are separation, transition, and incorporation.

She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E

25|$|In West Africa, infant {{circumcision}} had religious significance as a <b>rite</b> <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> {{or otherwise}} in the past; today in some non-Muslim Nigerian societies it is medicalised and {{is simply a}} cultural norm.
