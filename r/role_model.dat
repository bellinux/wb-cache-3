40|$|<b>Role</b> <b>models</b> {{are often}} {{suggested}} {{as a way}} of motivating individuals to set and achieve ambitious goals, especially for members of stigmatized groups in achievement settings. Yet, the literature on <b>role</b> <b>models</b> tends not to draw on the motivational literature to explain how <b>role</b> <b>models</b> may help <b>role</b> aspirants achieve these outcomes. In this paper, we introduce role aspirants and their motivational processes into an understanding of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> by drawing on expectancy-value theories of motivation to bring together the disparate literatures on <b>role</b> <b>models</b> to form a cohesive theoretical framework. We first integrate different definitions of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> into a new conceptualization where we propose that <b>role</b> <b>models</b> serve 3 distinct functions in which they influence goals and motivation: acting as behavioral models, representing the possible, and being inspirational. We then build a theoretical framework for understanding not only when, but also how, <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can effectively influence motivation and goals. This new theoretical framework, the Motivational Theory of <b>Role</b> <b>Modeling,</b> highlights ways in which the power of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can be harnessed to increase role aspirants' motivation, reinforce their existing goals, and facilitate their adoption of new goals...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{choice of}} a {{specialty}} by medical students is affected by many different factors. Personal characteristics and experiences in different specialties play a part as well as various <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> The lack of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> may explain the under-representation of female specialists and full professors in medicine. Special features of <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> the effects and the possible use of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were investigated. Whenever possible, the difference {{between male and female}} students was reported. Method: A literature search of the national and international literature was performed using Medline and other search tools. Results: The search yielded 10 relevant articles about the influence of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on medical students’ choice of specialty. Six studies reported a positive relationship between <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and specialty choice. One study reported no positive effect. Two studies showed that female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> can {{play an important role in}} attracting female students into surgery. Conclusion and discussion: <b>Role</b> <b>models</b> can play an important role in medical students’ choice of specialty. Universities and specialties can make use of this fact by ensuring that students are presented with <b>role</b> <b>models</b> at suitable stages during the curriculum. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|PublishedThe lack {{of senior}} female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> {{continues}} to be cited as a key barrier to women's career success. Yet there is little academic research into the gendered aspects of <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> in organizations, or the utility of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> at a senior level. The paper starts with a review of papers examining the construction of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in organizational settings. This leads to the inclusion of two related areas – organizational demographics as the contextual factor affecting the availability of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> {{and how they are}} perceived, and work identity formation as a possible key explanatory factor behind the link between the lack of senior female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and the lack of career progression to top organizational levels. The literature looking at social theories of identity formation is then considered from a gender perspective. The key gaps identified are that while the behavioural value of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> has been well documented, a better understanding is needed of how gender and organizational demography influence the <b>role</b> <b>modelling</b> process. Importantly, the symbolic value and possibly other values of female <b>role</b> <b>models</b> in the identity construction of senior women require further in-depth investigation. Finally, this review calls for a more integrated approach to the study of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and work identity formation, pulling together literatures on organizational demography, the cognitive construal of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and their importance for successful work identity formation in senior women...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Role</b> <b>modeling</b> is an {{important}} and valuable educational method.

"May 2013 "This study was an initial attempt at precisely conceptualizing and measuring <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> and exploring the correlates, direct benefits, and career outcomes of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> for professionals. As such these results begin to address the question of whether more successful people engage in <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> differently than less successful people. I developed two key dimensions of <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> motivational and imitative <b>role</b> <b>modeling,</b> and presented a conceptual framework that demonstrates the relationship between these dimensions and the direct benefits and career outcomes of <b>role</b> <b>modeling.</b> Although other categorizations of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> have been studied, these two dimensions captured the essential processes involved in one's cognitions about social interactions with, or observations of, <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> A sample of 301 professionals was surveyed at two points in time. As to answering the question, “Do successful people use <b>role</b> <b>models</b> differently than less successful people?” the data suggests that they do when it comes to immediate benefits and subjective career outcomes.

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> has {{primarily}} focused on the qualities and attributes of exceptional <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> and less attention has been given to the act of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> itself (Elzubeir & Rizk, 2001; Jochemsen-van der Leeuw, van Dijk, van Etten-Jamaludin, & Wieringa-de Waard, 2013; Wright, 1996; Wright, Wong, & Newill, 1997). A standardized understanding of <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> in medical education remains elusive (Kenny, Mann, & MacLeod, 2003). This is problematic given that <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> is pervasively documented as an approach to teaching (Reuler & Nardone, 1994). Our study attempts to fill a void in this body of research by looking at what faculty are thinking, saying, and doing when they say they are <b>role</b> <b>modeling.</b> Individual semi-structured interviews with faculty members were conducted in the Department of General Surgery at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods for themes surrounding teaching and <b>role</b> <b>modeling.</b> Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) faculty members think they are teaching when they are acting professionally; (2) faculty members become aware of teaching opportunities and act on them; and (3) faculty members employ evidence-based teaching methods, but they are incorrectly labeling them as “role modeling. ” As a whole, our findings should help distinguish between <b>role</b> <b>modeling</b> as <b>roles</b> and responsibilities enacted while doing one’s job well, and teaching as facilitated instruction that helps connect knowledge with action (Clayton, 2006; Fassbinder, 2007).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [63]- 65) This {{study examined}} the occupational aspirations and expectations of fourthgrade black children and contributors to those career goals. Occupational aspirations and expectations were defined by prestige and gender stereotype. Drawing on Bandura's social cognitive theory, a special focus was placed on any relationship between the children's reported <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and their occupational goals. The influences of a student's family structure, self-competence level, the teacher's prediction of educational attainment, {{and the number of}} <b>role</b> <b>models</b> on occupational aspirations and expectations were examined. Whether children's occupational aspirations, expectations, <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> and other influences differ by gender was also examined. The children's aspirations were significantly higher than their expectations. Most of the occupations chosen by children were considered "neutral" in gender stereotype. Sources contributing to occupational goals, like media exposure and first-hand experience, were reported as well as reasons for discrepancy between aspirations and expectations, like the child's perception of inability. Ninety-two percent of the children reported having one or more <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Sixty-nine percent of the <b>role</b> <b>models</b> were family members, 22 % were media personalities, and 9 % were members of the community. The number of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> was related positively to the teacher's prediction of educational attainment and the student's perception of competence. Children provided reports about occupations held by <b>role</b> <b>models</b> and discussions with <b>role</b> <b>models</b> concerning occupational goals. Occupational prestige scores were not found to differ statistically between children living in one- and two-parent families. The children's aspirations were positively related to the students' perceptions of competence. A negative relationship was found between the teachers' predictions of educational attainment and the children's aspirations and expectations. The children's aspirations and expectations were not related to the number of <b>role</b> <b>models.</b> Girls' and boys' occupational aspirations and expectations were similar. Teachers rated more girls as likely {{to graduate from high school}} and college than boys. There were no significant gender differences in number of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> reported.
