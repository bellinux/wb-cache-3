40|$|Several nonhuman {{animal species}} have been claimed to {{successfully}} pass tests indicative of <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> and to therefore engage in analogical reasoning. Here, we address these claims by focusing on one recent case study. We illustrate several potential methodological limitations that make it uncertain {{as to whether the}} subjects in this particular study were indeed showing <b>relational</b> <b>matching.</b> To the extent that similar or analogous limitations apply in other studies, this undermines the claim of <b>relational</b> <b>matching.</b> Apart from this, however, even if <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> was to be conclusively demonstrated in non-humans, this behavior alone is profoundly different from analogical reasoning as performed by humans. Substantial converging evidence now suggests a critically important difference between humans and nonhumans at the level of behavioral process that explains why nonhumans do not engage in complex language and therefore do not engage in processes that require complex language, including analogy. In accordance with both these arguments, we suggest that caution is needed in the comparative cognition literature when extrapolating from nonhuman to human cognitive capacity. ...|$|E

This experiment was a direct replication of a study by Lowenkron (1984) and examined a behavioral model relevant to complex human behavior that he later came to call joint control. Children were trained to code two-dimensional stimuli {{with the help of}} a handheld mediating stimulus. They were later tested for generalization of <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> to sample with and without the mediating stimulus. Results indicated high levels of generalized matching to sample with the mediating stimulus and lower levels without. Findings also indicated that generalization was somewhat stronger with symmetrical shapes than with asymmetrical. Results are discussed in terms of a radical behavioral interpretation of complex human behavior...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{has suggested that}} analogical reasoning (recognizing similarities among object relations when the objects themselves are dissimilar) is limited to humans and apes. This study investigated whether capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) can use analogical reasoning to solve a 3 -dimensional search task. The task involved hiding a food item under 1 of 2 or 3 plastic cups of different sizes and then allowing subjects to search for food hidden under the cup of analogous size in their own set of cups. Four monkeys were exposed {{to a series of}} <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> tasks. If subjects reached criterion on these tasks, they were exposed to relational transfer tasks involving novel stimuli. Three of the monkeys failed to reach criterion on the basic <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> tasks and therefore were not tested further. One monkey, however, revealed above-chance performance on a series of transfer tasks with 3 novel stimuli. This evidence suggests that contrary to previous arguments, a member of a New World monkey species can solve an analogical problem...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} kinds of matching elements that determine analogical relatedness and literal similarity. Despite theoretical agreement {{on the importance of}} <b>relational</b> <b>match,</b> the empirical evidence is neither systematic nor definitive. In 3 studies, participants performed online evaluations of relatedness of sentence pairs that varied in either the object or <b>relational</b> <b>match.</b> Results show a consistent focus on <b>relational</b> <b>matches</b> as the main determinant of analogical acceptance. In addition, analogy does not require strict overall identity of relational concepts. Semantically overlapping but nonsynonymous relations were commonly accepted, but required more processing time. Finally, performance in a similarity rating task partly paralleled analogical acceptance; however, relatively more weight was given to object matches. Implications for psychological theories of analogy and similarity are addressed...|$|R
40|$|If {{people are}} {{required}} to respond very quickly in a samedifferent task, their judgments of sameness are heavily reliant on attribute matches, {{despite the fact that}} when given ample time, the judgments seem to rely chiefly on <b>relational</b> <b>matches</b> (Goldstone & Medin, 1994). One interpretation of this temporal pattern is that attribute matches enter into the comparison process before <b>relational</b> <b>matches.</b> However, an alternate explanation, suggested by findings of Sloutsky & Yarlas (submitted) is that attributes are encoded before relations. In this case, if the comparison process begins before the encoding is completed, early matches will involve attributes but not relations. We show via a simulation that SME can model the Goldstone & Medin results, as well as the Sloutsky & Yarlas (submitted). 1...|$|R
40|$|A Bayesian network {{formulation}} for <b>relational</b> shape <b>matching</b> is presented. The main {{advantage of}} the re- lational shape matching approach is the obviation of the non-rigid spatial mappings used by recent non-rigid matching approaches. The basic variables {{that need to be}} estimated in the <b>relational</b> shape <b>matching</b> objective function are the global rotation and scale and the lo- cal displacements and correspondences. The new Bethe free energy approach is used to estimate the pairwise correspondences between links of the template graphs and the data. The resulting framework is useful in both registration and recognition contexts. Results are shown on hand-drawn templates and on 2 D transverse T 1 -weighted MR images...|$|R
40|$|The {{matching}} of relational structures is {{a problem}} that pervades computer vision and pattern recognition research. During the past few decades, two radically distinct approaches have been pursued to tackle it. The first views the matching problem as one of explicit search in state-space. The most popular method within this class consists of transforming it in the equivalent problem of finding a large maximal clique in a derived “association graph. ” In the second approach, the <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> problem is viewed as one of energy minimization. In this paper, we provide a unifying framework for relational structure matching which does unify the two existing approaches. The work is centered around a remarkable result proved by Motzkin and Straus which allows us to formulate the maximum clique problem in terms of a continuous optimization problem. We present a class of continuous- and discrete-time “replicator ” dynamical systems developed in evolutionary game theory and show how they can naturally be employed to solve our <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> problem. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|E

In two experiments, children were asked to make a relational mapping between two pictures while ignoring a competing object match.

Experiment 2 further demonstrated that children were as good at finding the <b>relational</b> <b>match</b> with an object match present if they heard relational language as they were when there was no compelling object match present at all.

40|$|Similarity {{comparisons}} are a basic component of cognition, {{and there are}} many elegant models of this process. None of these models describe comparisons of structured representations, although mounting evidence suggests that mental representations are well characterized by structured hierarchical systems of relations. We propose that structured representations can be compared via structural alignment, a process derived from models of analogical reasoning. The general prediction of structural alignment is that similarity comparisons lead subjects to attend to the <b>matching</b> <b>relational</b> structure in a pair of items. This prediction is illustrated with a computational simulation that also suggests that the strength of the relational focus is diminished when the <b>relational</b> <b>match</b> is impoverished, or when competing interpretations lead to rich object matches. These claims are tested in four experiments using the one-shot mapping paradigm, which places object similarity and relational similarity in opposition. The results support the hypothesis that similarity involves the alignment of structured representations. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Incoming {{events that}} match or {{mismatch}} stored representations {{are thought to}} influence {{the ability of the}} hippocampus to switch between memory encoding and retrieval modes. Electrophysiological work has dissociated match and mismatch signals in the monkey perirhinal cortex, where match signals were selective for matches to goal states, whereas mismatch signals were not modulated by intention (Miller and Desimone, 1994). To investigate whether the theoretically important <b>relational</b> <b>match</b> and mismatch signals in the hippocampus are modulated by goal states, we fully crossed whether a probe stimulus relationally matched or mismatched a previously perceived image or goal state. Subjects performed two working memory tasks in which they either responded “yes ” to probes that were identical to the previous sample scene or, after performing a relational manipulation of the scene, responded “yes ” only to a probe that was identical to this perceptually novel image. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found evidence for <b>relational</b> <b>match</b> enhancements bilaterally in the hippocampus that were selective for matches between the probe stimulus and goal state, but were not modulated by whether that goal was perceptually novel. Moreover, we found evidence for a complementary hippocampal mismatch enhancement that was triggered by stimuli containing salient perceptual manipulations. Our results provided evidence for parallel memory signatures in the hippocampus: a controlled match signal that can detect matches to internally generated goal states and an automatic mismatch signal that can identify unpredicted perceptual novelty. Key words: hippocampus; medial temporal lobes; match enhancement; mismatch enhancement; goal states; relational memor...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAnalogical {{reasoning}} {{is vital to}} advanced cognition and behavioral adaptation. Many theorists deem analogical thinking to be uniquely human and to be foundational to categorization, creative problem solving, and scientific discovery [1]. Comparative psychologists have long been interested in the species generality of analogical reasoning, but they initially {{found it difficult to}} obtain empirical support for such thinking in nonhuman animals (for pioneering efforts, see [2, 3]). Researchers have since mustered considerable evidence and argument that relational matching-to-sample (RMTS) effectively captures the essence of analogy, in which the relevant logical arguments are presented visually [4]. In RMTS, choice of test pair BB would be correct if the sample pair were AA, whereas choice of test pair EF would be correct if the sample pair were CD. Critically, no items in the correct test pair physically match items in the sample pair, thus demanding that only relational sameness or differentness is available to support accurate choice responding. Initial evidence suggested that only humans and apes can successfully learn RMTS with pairs of sample and test items [4 – 7]; however, monkeys have subsequently done so [8 – 12]. Here, we report that crows too exhibit <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> behavior. Even more importantly, crows spontaneously display relational responding without ever having been trained on RMTS; they had only been trained on identity matching-to-sample (IMTS). Such robust and uninstructed <b>relational</b> <b>matching</b> behavior represents the most convincing evidence yet of analogical reasoning in a nonprimate species, as apes alone [7] have spontaneously exhibited RMTS behavior after only IMTS training...|$|E

Gentner’s Structure-Mappzng theory predicts that soundness is highest for <b>relational</b> <b>matches,</b> while accessibility is high-est for surface matches. These predictions have been borne out in psy-chological studies, and here we demonstrate that SME replicates these results. In particular, we ran SME on the same stories used in the psy-chological studies with two different kinds of match rules. In analogy mode, SME closely captures the human soundness ordering. In mere-appearance mode, SME captures the accessibility ordering. We briefly review the psychological studies, describe our computational experi-ments, and discuss the utility of SME as a cognitive modeling tool. 1 Introd. uction Analogy is a complex process.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} children’s performance in an analogy-making task involving competing perceptual and <b>relational</b> <b>matches</b> in terms of developmental changes in executive functioning. We hypothesize that the selection of the common relational structure requires the inhibition of more salient perceptual features (such as identical shapes or colors). Most of the results show that children’s performance in analogy-making tasks would seem to depend crucially {{on the nature of the}} distractors. In addition, our results show that analogy-making performance depends on the nature of the dimensions involved in the relations (shape or color). Finally, in simple conditions, performance was adversely affected by the presence of irrelevant dimensions. These results are compatible with an analogy-making account (Richland et al., 2006) based on varying limitations in executive functioning at different ages...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRecent {{findings}} have ignited a controversy {{over whether the}} hippocampus is critical for visual perception as well as memory. Some {{studies have shown that}} hippocampal damage impairs perception of scenes, but others found no evidence for hippocampal involvement. These studies measured perception as a unitary phenomenon, but recent findings indicate that perceptual discriminations can be based on two kinds of information: states of perceiving local differences or global strength of <b>relational</b> <b>match.</b> In the current study, we separated state- and strength-based perception using a change detection paradigm with scenes. Patients with selective hippocampal damage exhibited significant reductions in strength-based perception but showed spared state-based responses. In a follow-up neuroimaging study, hippocampal activation linearly tracked confidence in strength-based perception, and was not differentially associated with state-based responses. The hippocampus therefore plays a selective role in perception, contributing high-resolution strength information possibly through its role in the representation of relational information...|$|R

This problem requires <b>matching</b> two large <b>relational</b> schemas with hundreds and sometimes thousands of fields. Further, the correct match is likely complex: rather than a simple one-to-one alignment, some fields in the source database may map to multiple fields in the target database, and others may have no equivalent fields in the target database. Despite major advances in schema matching, fully automated solutions to large <b>relational</b> schema <b>matching</b> problems are still elusive.
