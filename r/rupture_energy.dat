Due to massive import of edible {{oil to the}} country as well as high potential for safflower cultivation, the research on production of safflower for oil extrusion purpose is of remarkable importance. The design of various processing and oil extraction units and also their optimization which are in relation to seed attributes is essential. In this paper the effects of different irrigation and nutrient treatments on some important physical and mechanical properties of IL 111 varieties of safflower seed were investigated. The measured properties included size, mass, volume, surface area, arithmetic and geometric mean diameter, sphericity, bulk and true densities, porosity, static and dynamic coefficient of friction, rupture force, deformation at rupture point, <b>rupture</b> <b>energy,</b> modulus of elasticity and seed hardness. The results indicated a significant effect of treatments on the biophysical and biomechanical properties at p ≤ 0. 01.

40|$|The {{effect of}} water regime on aggregate-tensile strength, <b>rupture</b> <b>energy,</b> and {{friability}} index was studied in two experiments on sandy loam soils (Glossic Phaeozem/WRB 1998). In Exp. 1, soil from a long-term, 5 -yr crop rotation receiving animal manure (dairy farm and grass, DFG) was {{compared with a}} soil (continuous cereal crop, CCC), which had grown almost continuous cereals and not received animal manure. In Exp. 2, soil from compacted plots (PAC) and uncompacted reference plots (REF) was sampled. The soil was air-dried and separated into four aggregate-size classes (i. e., 1 – 2, 2 – 4, 4 – 8, and 8 – 16 mm). Aggregate-tensile strength and <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> were measured on air-dry aggregates and on aggregates adjusted to - 10, - 30, - 100, - 350 kPa, and - 166 MPa pressure potential. Soil friability index was estimated from the tensile strength or specific <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> results. Aggregate density was determined on 2 - to 4 -, 4 - to 8 -, and 8 - to 16 -mm aggregates. The CCC soil displayed a greater increase in strength and specific <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> with increased dryness than the DFG counterpart. This {{may be related to}} differences in organic matter content and dispersible clay. Generally, the relationship between tensile strength or specific-rupture energy and pressure potential could be described by a power function. However, the <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> results could not be fitted by a power function for the Exp. 2 soils. The Exp. 2 soils differed in the stress–strain relationship, i. e., the compacted soil displayed the highest Young modulus, (Y/) in all cases.

We used noncovalently bound arrays of bacteriochlorophyll chromophores within native and genetically modified variants of LH 1 complexes to monitor local changes in the chromophore binding sites induced by externally applied hydrostatic pressure. Whereas membrane-bound complexes demonstrated very high resilience to pressures reaching 2. 1 GPa, characteristic discontinuous shifts and broadenings of the absorption spectra were observed around 1 GPa for detergent-solubilized proteins, in similarity to those observed when specific (α or β) H-bonds between the chromophores and the surrounding protein were selectively removed by mutagenesis. These pressure effects, which were reversible upon decompression, allowed us to estimate the <b>rupture</b> <b>energies</b> of H-bonds to the chromophores in LH 1 complexes. A quasi-independent, additive role of H-bonds in the α- and β-sublattices in reinforcing the wild-type LH 1 complex was established. A comparison of a reaction-center-deficient LH 1 complex with complexes containing reaction centers also demonstrated a stabilizing effect of the reaction center.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of seed {{moisture}} content, probe diameter and loading velocity (puncture conditions) on some mechanical properties of almond kernel and peeled almond kernel is considered to model {{a relationship between the}} puncture conditions and <b>rupture</b> <b>energy.</b> Furthermore, distribution of the mechanical properties is determined. The main objective is to determine the critical values of mechanical properties significant for peeling machines. The response surface methodology was used to find the relationship between the input parameters and the output responses, and the fitness function was applied to measure the optimal values using the genetic algorithm. Two-parameter Weibull function was used to describe the distribution of mechanical properties. Based on the Weibull parameter values, i. e. shape parameter (β) and scale parameter (η) calculated for each property, the mechanical distribution variations were completely described and it was confirmed that the mechanical properties are rule governed, which makes the Weibull function suitable for estimating their distributions. The energy model estimated using response surface methodology shows that the mechanical properties relate exponentially to the moisture, and polynomially to the loading velocity and probe diameter, which enabled successful estimation of the <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> (R²= 0. 94). The genetic algorithm calculated the critical values of seed moisture, probe diameter, and loading velocity to be 18. 11 % on dry mass basis, 0. 79 mm, and 0. 15 mm/min, respectively, and optimum <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> of 1. 97 · 10 -³ J.

METHODS: It was used 45 rats divided into three groups of 15 animals each. In Control Group (CG), it was performed anastomosis in distal colon without peritonitis. In Peritonitis Group (PG), it was performed anastomosis six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. In Hyperbaric Chamber Group (HCG), it was performed six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. The animals on CG and PG were kept at place air while the animals on HCG were placed on an experimental hyperbaric chamber in order to inhale oxygen at 100 %, two absolute atmospheres, for 120 minutes, for four consecutive days.

40|$|Classical {{finite element}} method {{including}} strain-softening materials suffers from a mesh-dependency solution. The thickness of the bands in which strains are localized is arbitrarily narrow and {{may lead to a}} <b>rupture</b> without <b>energy</b> consumption. This is the case in quasi-static as well as in dynamics problems. The present paper uses a two-scale dynamic damage law that is based on an intrinsic length at micro-scale, corresponding to the inter-distance between two adjacent micro-cracks, that regularizes the strain localization problem in dynamics. The material response is time-dependent due to the inertial effect of the micro-crack propagation. This produces a natural, microstructurally-based, delayed response of the material that, in turn, removes the mesh-sensitivity in dynamics. As a consequence, the size of the strain localization band is controlled by the internal length of the material. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the forced}} separation of two adhesive surfaces linked via {{a large number}} of parallel non-convalent bonds. We use a Brownian Dynamic simulation to compute the force-distance curve and the rupture force for separating adhesive surfaces with a constant rate. We also implement a statistical mechanics framework to describe the separating process, using a two-step reaction model with reaction rates obtained from the first passage time description for diffusive barrier crossing in a pulleddistance-dependent potential. A single integral mean first passage time (IMFPT) expression and the Kramers time are used to calculate the rate coefficients. The dependence of the rupture force on the separating rate exhibits three regimes. In the near-equilibrium regime, the rupture force asymptotically approaches the equilibrium rupture force, which is determined by the intrinsic free energy difference between two states. In the non-equilibrium regime, the rupture force increases with the separating rate and correlates with the bond <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> and the intrinsic off-rate. In the far from the equilibrium regime, the rupture force is determined by the bond <b>rupture</b> <b>energy.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNuclear {{pressure}} vessel steels {{are subjected to}} irradiation embrittlement which is monitored using Charpy tests. Reference index temperatures, such as the temperature for which the mean Charpy <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> is equal to 56 J (T 56 J), are used as embrittlement indicators. In this work a material model integrating a description of viscoplasticity, ductile damage and brittle fracture is used to simulate the Charpy test. The model is adjusted on an unirradiated material. It is then applied to irradiated materials assuming that irradiation affects hardening. It is shown that irradiation probably also affects brittle failure. The decrease of the Charpy upper shelf energy is also interpreted...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} simple {{expression}} for the <b>rupture</b> <b>energy</b> of a pendular liquid bridge between two spheres, {{taking into account}} capillary and viscous (lubrication) forces. In the case of capillary forces only, the results are in accordance with curve fitting expressions proposed by Simons et al. [2] and Willett et al. [5]. We performed accurate measurements of the force exerted by liquid bridges between two spheres. Experimental results {{are found to be}} close to theoretical values. A reasonable agreement is also found in the presence of viscous forces. Finally, for small bridge volumes, the rupture criterion given by Lian et al. [10] is modified, taking into account additional viscous effects...|$|E
40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the understanding and application of specific ion effects; however, a detailed interpretation of film stability regarding the ion effect has not yet been achieved. This research aims at developing an understanding of the physico-chemical colloidal aspects in an endeavor to acquire an ability to predetermine specific ion effects on nanofilm rupture. Despite the series of reports published regarding the surfactant-free films, the experimental technique proved nearly to be unable to provide further convincing interpretation towards this issue. Molecular dynamics (MD) technique was applied to investigate the effect of salt ions on film stability in various concentrations with pair-additive and many-body polarizable water-ion potentials to validate with certainty the rupture process of aqueous nanofilms in the absence and presence of salts. Properties of the liquid film including dipole moment, molecular distribution profiles, together with a detailed quantitative analysis of film <b>rupture,</b> potential <b>energy,</b> evidences e. g. ion-water binding energy, Dipole Autocorrelation Functions (DAFs) and disjoining pressure isotherm data were examined. The DAFs of water within the film were observed to be stronger in salt films than in a pure water film. The results show that salt ions destabilize the nanofilms at low concentrations, while the ability of salt to break the films depends on the strength of the ion-water interaction and the molecular partition at the film surfaces...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{is carried out}} to elicit important factors causing cracks and rupture of steel members under imposed large repeated deformations, and to investigate the quantitative relationships among the important physical factors leading to failure. Eight angle specimens were subjected to repeated axial load after undergoing inelastic buckling. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the effect of elongation of the specimen on the very low-cycle fatigue behavior under load repetitions of the order of a few to twenty. The experimental results show that energy dissipation capacity depends heavily on the entire history of loading and the deflection mode, but no simple quantitative relations are observed between the initiation of the visible cracks or <b>rupture</b> and the <b>energy</b> dissipation capacity. The maximum value of residual "net" strains ranges from 30 % to 35 %, independent of test parameters...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effects of {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy (HBO) on the mechanical resistance of anastomosis performed in rats' distal colon presenting peritonitis induced by ligature and cecal punction using the Total <b>Energy</b> <b>Rupture</b> biomechanical test (ETR). METHODS: It was used 45 rats divided into three groups of 15 animals each. In Control Group (CG), it was performed anastomosis in distal colon without peritonitis. In Peritonitis Group (PG), it was performed anastomosis six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. In Hyperbaric Chamber Group (HCG), it was performed six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. The animals on CG and PG were kept at place air while the animals on HCG were placed on an experimental hyperbaric chamber in order to inhale oxygen at 100 %, two absolute atmospheres, for 120 minutes, for four consecutive days. Euthanasia {{took place on the}} fifth day of the experiment. All the animals underwent to Total <b>Energy</b> <b>Rupture</b> Biomechanical Resistance test (ETR). Total <b>Energy</b> <b>Rupture</b> was defined as the necessary internal energy stored up to promote the colon rupture after an external traction force imposition. RESULTS: The Peritonitis Group presents smaller average ETR than Control Group. There was no statistical difference between Peritonitis Group and Hyberbaric Chamber Group. CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not alter the mechanical resistance of anastomosis performed in distal colon of rats under the presence of peritonitis induced by ligature and cecal puncture. OBJETIVO: Analisar o efeito da oxigenoterapia hiperbárica (HBO) sobre a resistência mecânica de anastomoses realizadas em cólon distal de ratos na presença de peritonite induzida por ligadura e punção cecal utilizando o teste biomecânico de Energia Total de Ruptura (ETR). MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 45 ratos distribuídos em três grupos de 15 animais. No Grupo Controle (GC), realizou-se anastomose no cólon distal sem peritonite. No Grupo Peritonite (GP), realizou-se anastomose seis horas após a indução da peritonite por ligadura e punção cecal. No Grupo Câmara Hiperbárica (GCH), realizou-se anastomose seis horas após a indução da peritonite por ligadura e punção cecal. Os animais dos GC e GP foram mantidos em ar ambiente. Os animais do GCH foram colocados em uma câmara hiperbárica experimental para inalarem oxigênio a 100 %, a duas atmosferas absolutas, durante 120 minutos, por quatro dias consecutivos. A eutanásia ocorreu no quinto dia do experimento. Todos os animais foram submetidos ao Teste de Resistência Biomecânico Energia Total de Ruptura (ETR). A Energia Total de Ruptura foi definida como a energia interna acumulada necessária para promover o rompimento do cólon após a imposição de uma força externa de tração. RESULTADOS: O Grupo Peritonite apresentou menor média de ETR que o Grupo Controle. Não houve diferença estatística entre o Grupo Peritonite e o Grupo Câmara Hiperbárica. CONCLUSÃO: A oxigenoterapia hiperbárica não alterou a resistência mecânica de anastomoses realizadas no cólon distal de ratos na presença de peritonite induzida por ligadura e punção cecal...|$|R
