50|$|First National Center {{was built}} with an Art Deco, Neoclassical style inside and out, {{featuring}} polished aluminum, granite, glass and several varieties of marble {{from around the}} world. Rising 446 feet above the sidewalk, the building was topped out with an aluminum aviation tower and a red beacon light above a polished aluminum notched roof line. The aviation tower originally housed a massive white rotating beacon that was visible for 75 miles. When radio navigation superseded visual navigation after WWII, the powerful white was replaced with a lower-power <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> The 32nd floor was a public observation deck. One of First National's most distinctive features is its night lighting, where the upper-story setbacks are lit white. There {{have been times when}} the lighting has changed - after 9/11, the setbacks were lit in red, white and blue tiers - which is still done on July 4. For many years, a cross was created by lighting office windows during Christmas.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the role of presentation schedules and information feedback on performance in a forced-choice signal detection task. The experimental results indicate that information feedback facilitates performance, but only for certain presentation schedules. The present study was designed to assess performance in a signal detection task under two conditions of information feedback. In the I-condition, S was told on each trial whether his detection response was correct or incorrect; in the !-condition S was given no feedback regarding the correctness of his response. The task involved a 2 -response, forced-choice auditory detection problem. On each trial 2 temporal intervals were defined and S was required to report which interval he believed contained the signal; i. e., in one interval a tone burst in a background of white noise was presented, while the other interval contained only white noise. A trial will be denoted as s 1 or s 2, depending on whether the signal was embedded in the 1 st or 2 nd interval; the S's response will be denoted A 1 or A 2 to indicate which interval he reported contained the signal. The probability of an s 1 trial will be denoted as y. In this study two values of y were used (. 50 and. 75) and, as indicated above, two conditions of information feedback. Thus there were 4 experimental conditions (501, 50 I, 751, 75 I); each S was run under all 4 conditions. Method Gaussian noise was presented binaurally in S's headphones throughout a test session and the signal was a 1000 -cps sinusoid tone; the tone was presented for 100 msec. including equal fall and rise times of 20 msec. The ratio of signal energy to noise power in a unit bandwidth was 2. 9, and was constant throughout the study. The. S was seated before a stimulus display board. On each trial a <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> was flashed for 100 msec. Two amber lights then came on successively each for 1 sec.; these lights defined the 2 observation intervals. The onset of the signal occurred 500 msec. after the onset of one of the observation intervals. After the second amber light went off, S indicated his response by pressing 1 of 2 wand switches under cards reading " 1 st interval" and " 2 nd interval. " For the !-condition a green light flashed on above the correct response key after S's response; the green light was omitted in the !-condition. Each trial lasted 6 sec. The S's were 12 male college students with normal hearing. They were run for two practice sessions followed by 20 test sessions. Test sessions were run on consecutive days, 350 trials/day. Each day S ran on 1 of the 4 experimental conditions; in successive 4 -day blocks S ran one day on each of the 4 experimental conditions in a random order. Thus, over 20 days each of the experimental conditions was repeated 5 times...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{problems}} affecting residential and light commercial heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are slow refrigerant leaks and dirty air filters. Equipment users {{are usually not}} aware of a problem until most of the refrigerant has escaped or the air filter is clogged with dirt. While a dirty air filter can be detected with a technology based on the air pressure differential across the filter, such as a ''whistling'' indicator, {{it is not easy}} to incorporate this technology into existing HVAC diagnostic equipment. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is developing a low-cost, nonintrusive refrigerant charge indicator and dirty air filter detection sensor. The sensors, based on temperature measurements, will be inexpensive and easy to incorporate into existing heat pumps and air conditioners. The refrigerant charge indicator is based on the fact that when refrigerant starts to leak, the evaporator coil temperature starts to drop and the level of liquid subcooling drops. When the coil temperature or liquid subcooling drops below a preset reading, a signal, such as a yellow warning light, can be activated to warn the equipment user that the system is undercharged. A further drop of coil temperature or liquid subcooling below another preset reading would trigger a second warning signal, such as a <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> to warn the equipment user that the unit now detects a leak and immediate action should be taken. The warning light cannot be turned off until it is re-set by a refrigeration repairman. To detect clogged air filters, two additional temperature sensors can be applied, one each across the evaporator. When the air filter is accumulating buildup, the temperature differential across the evaporator will increase because of the reduced airflow. When the temperature differential reaches a pre-set reading, a signal will be sent to the equipment user that the air filter needs to be changed. A traditional refrigerant charge indicator requires intrusion into the system to measure the refrigerant high-side and low-side pressures. Once the pressures are known, based on the equipment's refrigerant charging chart? or in most cases, based on the technician's experience? the refrigerant charging status is determined. However, there is a catch: by the time a refrigeration technician is called, most of the refrigerant has already escaped into the atmosphere. The new technology provides a real-time warning so that when, say, 20 % of the refrigerant has leaked, the equipment users will be warned, even though the equipment is still functioning properly at rated capacity. Temperature sensors are becoming very accurate and very low in cost, compared with pressure sensors. Using temperature sensors to detect refrigerant charge status is inherently nonintrusive, inexpensive, and accurate. With the addition of two temperature sensors for detecting dirty air filters, the capability of the diagnostic equipment is further enhanced with very little added cost. This report provides laboratory test data on the change of indoor coil refrigerant temperature and subcooling as a function of refrigerant charge for a 2 -ton split heat pump system. The data can be used in designing the indicators for refrigerant loss and dirty air filter sensors...|$|E
50|$|As {{full-size}} {{school buses}} grew larger during the 1950s and early 1960s, they became difficult {{to navigate the}} crowded, narrow streets of urban neighborhoods; other rural routes were extremely isolated, with roads that could not accommodate full-size buses. To fill this role, yellow-painted vehicles such as the International Travelall and Chevrolet Suburban came into use. As they entered production in the 1960s, passenger vans such as the Chevrolet Van/GMC Handi-Van, Dodge A100, and Ford Econoline were converted to school bus use, largely {{by the addition of}} <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and yellow paint. A drawback to using passenger vans and utility vehicles is that, along with their lower seating capacity, they could not offer the same level of safety as a full-size school bus.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} more birds collide with communication towers equipped with <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> than with towers equipped with lights of shorter wavelengths. We used the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration’s National Wildlife Strike Database {{to determine if a}} similar relationship exists for turbine-powered jet aircraft with 2 underwing- or fuselage-mounted engines and bird strikes. We compared bird strikes reported to engine # 1 (left side = red lighting) or to engine # 2 (right side = green lighting) using chi-square tests (α = 0. 05). For both underwing- and fuselage-mounted engines, more (P ≤ 0. 04) strikes were reported for engine # 1 compared to engine # 2 during Day, Night, and Dawn/Dusk flights. These findings suggest that modifying red navigation lights to include shorter wavelengths and the use of supplemental lights specifically designed for avian vision could enhance detection and reduce bird strikes...|$|R

5000|$|In the past, groups {{transporting}} {{children and}} adults that did not need (or afford) a large bus commonly used 15-passenger vans to handle their transportation. However, such vehicles were at a disadvantage by comparison in terms of meeting safety regulations. To provide an alternative to 15-passenger vans (called [...] "non-conforming vans" [...] {{because they do not}} meet any safety standards for school buses), bus manufacturers have designed vehicles as alternatives to 15-passenger vans. These are called Multi-Function School Activity Buses (MFSAB). The basic design of MFSABs differs from yellow school buses because of their intended use. As they are intended for point-to-point transportation instead of route service, MFSABs are not fitted with traffic control devices (i.e., <b>red</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights,</b> stop arm) nor are they painted school bus yellow. MFSAB buses are typically based on Type A school buses, although manufacturers offer MFSAB configurations for full-size buses as well.|$|R
