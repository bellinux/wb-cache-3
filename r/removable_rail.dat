50|$|There are 3 {{different}} handguards {{currently available}} for the X95: one that is rounded and is currently only available for military issue; it is rounded so that one can mount a suppressor and have it sit inside of the handguard. The second is a rectangular one with integrated rails at the 3, 6, and 9 o' clock positions, and has <b>removable</b> <b>rail</b> covers. The third one is an elongated version of the second, made for IWI US X95s. The rounded handguard originally has separate picatinny rails on the receiver and handguard, but IWI has produced a full length flattop rail for it; the other two handguards have integrated flattop rails.|$|E
50|$|Flatbeds {{consist of}} just a load floor and <b>removable</b> side <b>rails</b> and a {{bulkhead}} in front to protect the tractor {{in the event of}} a load shift. They can haul almost anything that can be stacked on and strapped down.|$|R
50|$|The M3 model {{features}} a 6 in match-grade barrel {{along with an}} adjustable match trigger. It also has <b>removable</b> Picatinny-style <b>rails</b> on top of, and underneath the housing. The M3 also comes larger polymer grips, and a quick-release magazine catch.|$|R
40|$|The mock-up {{of a great}} passive {{silencer}} {{used for}} noise attenuation in industrial applications has been designed and tested in laboratory. This mock-up consists of three metal casing containing the noise source and several <b>removable</b> <b>rails</b> and supports, allowing the test of different configurations of parallel absorbing baffles. The output of the silencer radiates in an anechoic chamber in order to simulate free-field conditions. The acoustic attenuation has been measured {{not only at the}} output, but also inside the silencer, with a mobile microphone located at several positions along the axis. Also, the tested configurations include three types of absorbing pillows and several geometrical arrangements. The results show that the maximum insertion loss (dB) measured at the output of the silencer corresponds to frequencies between 800 Hz and 2. 5 kHz and its value strongly depends on the air gaps between baffles. The measurements with the mobile microphone show a linear decrease of the sound pressure level with the distance along the axis (mainly between 100 Hz and 1 kHz), which corresponds to the depth of absorbing material involved in the attenuation. Finally, a comparison with a real-scale silencer shows a fairly good correspondence. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The SCAR has two receivers: The lower is {{constructed}} of polymer, {{and the upper}} receiver is one piece and constructed of aluminum. The SCAR features an integral, uninterrupted Picatinny rail {{on the top of}} the aluminium receiver, two <b>removable</b> side <b>rails</b> and a bottom one that can mount any MIL-STD-1913 compliant accessories. It has a polymer lower receiver with an M16 compatible pistol grip, flared magazine well, and raised area around magazine and bolt release buttons. The front sight flips down for unobstructed use of optics and accessories. The rifle uses a 'tappet' type of closed gas system much like the M1 Carbine while the bolt carrier otherwise resembles the Stoner 63 or Heckler & Koch G36.|$|R
50|$|Diemaco's C7/C8 {{family is}} {{completed}} with two designated marksman variants, the C7CT and C8CT, with CT meaning Custom Tactical. These accurized C7/C8 variants {{are designed to}} provide accurate engagement up to 600 m, while providing system commonality to other fielded weapons. They have two-stage match triggers and weighted stocks to counterbalance the heavy 508 mm or 16 in free-floating barrel surrounded by a tubular forestock. A <b>removable</b> bipod, <b>rails</b> for designators, sling, etc. attach to that forestock. A special, distinctive pistol grip is fitted and the C7-style buttstock can be adjusted with shims. Sound suppressors are usually fitted. The rifle is designed as a sniper spotter weapon or a police containment weapon. The CT series weapons meet or exceed all applicable military standards including: reliability in all environmental and operational conditions, accuracy, lethality, maintainability in field conditions and safety.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, Beretta {{announced}} the M9A3, which was submitted via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) {{in accordance with}} the terms of the current M9 contract. A modified version of the existing M9A1, the new model features a thinner grip, MIL-STD-1913 accessory <b>rail,</b> <b>removable</b> tritium sights, threaded barrel, and a sand-resistant 17-round magazine, produced in a dark earth tone color. Beretta claims likely cost savings over the standard M9 model and meeting almost all of the enhanced handgun requirements. Later that month, the Army decided not to evaluate the M9A3 in favor of pursuing the MHS program, without asking any questions about the upgraded pistol or requesting a sample. Army weapons officials maintain that the M9 design does not meet requirements and a cost-benefit analysis determined the old fleet would cost more to replace and repair than buying a new service pistol. Beretta claims M9A3 upgrade features fix most of the complaints and could be sold for less than the cost of previous M9 versions; the company has suggested a dual-path strategy to evaluate commercially available options while simultaneously evaluating improvements.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, Beretta {{unveiled}} its M9A3 pistol upgrade for {{a separate}} Army effort to identify Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) under its existing contract. The company presented the upgrade to improve the M9's performance as a more cost-effective solution without needing to buy a different handgun. Improvements include a thin grip with a removable, modular wrap-around grip, MIL-STD-1913 accessory <b>rail,</b> <b>removable</b> front and rear tritium sights, extended and threaded barrel for suppressor use, 17-round sand resistant magazine, and other small features, all in an earth tone finish. Later that month, the Army decided not to evaluate the M9A3 in favor of pursuing the MHS program, maintaining that the M9 design does not meet requirements and a cost-benefit analysis determined the old fleet would cost more to replace and repair than buying a new service pistol. Beretta claims M9A3 upgrade features fix most of the complaints and could be sold {{for less than the}} cost of previous M9 versions. The Army formally rejected the M9A3 ECP proposal at the end of January 2015.|$|R
