40|$|AbstractThe Crago double {{flotation}} {{process is}} widely used for upgrading raw phosphate in Florida. However, it is a water-based physico-chemical process and consumes {{a huge amount of}} water and chemicals and is not efficient to remove dolomite from phosphate. In addition, the final phosphate flotation concentrate often has a grade of 30 - 31 % P 2 O 5, which is below the BPL content of 75 % (or 34. 3 % P 2 O 5) required for making the animal feed grade phosphate. This study is performed to evaluate the potential and feasibility of the innovative rotary triboelectrostatic separator (RTS) as a dry phosphate beneficiation process. The RTS technology is characterized by an innovative high efficiency <b>rotary</b> <b>charger,</b> charger electrification, laminar air flow, independent control of charging and separation condition, low energy consumption, etc. Compared to conventional triboelectrostatic separators, the unique RTS technology offers multiple technical advantages: 1) increase particle charge density 4 - 6 times; 2) improve solids throughput by an order of magnitude; 3) enhance process efficiency by up to 70 %; 4) reduce overall energy consumption by more than 80 %. A laboratory scale prototype RTS unit has been used to investigate the effects of major process parameters on particle charging efficiency and phosphate separation efficiency for Florida phosphate samples. Experimental results have shown that the RTS technology upgraded a 10 % P 2 O 5 feed (16 - 35 mesh) to a 30 % P 2 O 5 concentrate with a P 2 O 5 recovery of more than 85 % and acid insoluble rejection of almost 90 %; it also purified a flotation concentrate with 31 % P 2 O 5 to nearly 35 % P 2 O 5. RTS also significantly reduced MgO content from a pulverized high dolomite pebble sample...|$|E

40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} studies of the combustion process in a stratified <b>charge</b> <b>rotary</b> engine (SCRE) {{continue to be the}} subject of active research in recent years. Specifically to meet the demand for more sophisticated products, a detailed understanding of the engine system of interest is warranted.

50|$|Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was {{pioneer in}} {{introducing}} reed valves for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing {{an improvement in}} torque and performances at low rpm and under partial load of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified <b>Charge</b> <b>Rotary</b> Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that reed valves do improve performances at low rpm and under partial load, but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines.|$|R

25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified <b>Charge</b> <b>Rotary</b> Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R

40|$|The Office of Security of Defense 2 ̆ 7 s Assured Fuels Initiative has {{recently}} been pressing for a single fuel battle space. This endeavor requires modifying many of the vehicle power plants currently in operation throughout the Armed Forces. The RQ- 7 Shadow, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) utilized by the Marine Corp and Army for reconnaissance purposes, is powered by UEL 2 ̆ 7 s AR 741 rotary engine and functions on aviation fuel. One effort underway {{has been focused on}} developing this rotary engine system to operate on heavy fuels using direct injection technology and charge stratification. Although the rotary engine has many advantages over standard reciprocating engines, providing a reliable ignition source for the stratified charge within the sweeping combustion chamber presents challenges. This work made effort to compensate for those challenges by utilizing a pilot flame ignition system. The system incorporated a micro-diesel injector and spark plug recessed within an ignition cavity along the housing of the rotary engine. The pilot flame ignition approach was thoroughly evaluated by conducting a parametric study using computational methods to simulate the combustion process. Gambit meshing software was used to build the 3 D rotary engine mesh. ANSYS Fluent was used to formulate and apply the various numerical models describing the combustion phenomena. And lastly, JMP software was used to perform a response surface analysis in effort to determine the optimal parameter values for the ignition system. The goal of the parametric study was to maximize power output and likewise minimize specific fuel consumption. A total of thirty one cases were performed to complete the study. For the rotary engine operating at 6000 rpm an optimal solution was successfully realized within the design space. The rotary engine model generated 5. 313 horsepower (HP) for the complete cycle of one chamber. The overall equivalency ratio allocated in the combustion chamber for the simulations was 0. 55. This resulted in a specific fuel consumption of 0. 395 lb/hp-h.

40|$|Insulators {{used in the}} {{construction}} of spacecraft are irradiated with high-energy electrons in the space environment and this sometimes causes the insulators to charge to very high voltages. Such charged insulators can generate spontaneous electric partial-discharge pulses of the order of mA to tens of A. These pulses sometimes last enough time to destroy the expensive micro-circuitry present in the spacecraft. In evaluating the threat to the spacecraft due to these discharges, calculation of the resistivity becomes a critical parameter since it determines how accumulated charge will distribute across the spacecraft and how rapidly charge imbalance will dissipate. So far, resistivity values for the insulators for spacecraft applications have been simply imported from tabulated results measured using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) methods. This thesis work provides the details of the charge storage method which {{has been found to be}} more appropriate in calculating the resistivity of spacecraft insulators by emulating the space environment better. This method is based on the concept that the resistivity is better measured as the decay of the charge deposited on the surface of an insulator, rather than by the flow of current across two electrodes around the sample which is the case with the classical method of measurements. From the results obtained from the charge storage method, it has been found that the ASTM resistivity values for thin film insulating spacecraft materials have been found to under-predict charge transport values applicable to many spacecraft charging problems, by 10 to 104 times. The charge storage method has only one side of the insulator in vacuum exposed to charged particles, light and plasma, with a metal electrode attached to the other side of the insulator. The chamber for measuring the charge storage decay has been designed with the capability to measure 32 samples simultaneously. The details of the apparatus, instrumentation, test methods, data acquisition methods, and data analysis for measuring resistivity of the spacecraft insulators are given here. Details about the vacuum environment, sample mounting, isolation of the samples, charging of the samples, measurement of the surface <b>charge,</b> <b>rotary</b> motion of the sample carousel, etc., are also given.
