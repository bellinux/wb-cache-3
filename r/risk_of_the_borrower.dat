5000|$|An {{argument}} {{often overlooked}} by those criticizing the payday and title loan industry {{is that these}} loans provide immediate financial aid {{in the face of}} emergencies and hardship. When a disaster strikes, those who are unbanked and have no means of obtaining loans through traditional credit institutions—primarily due to low credit scores—have nowhere else to turn. Small-dollar-credit products such as title loans prove to be invariably useful to these individuals and their families, granting short-term financial relief, provided the loan is paid off quickly, before interest payments compound excessively. Furthermore, once a borrower has reestablished his/her credit history, he/she may choose to take out a more traditional loan to pay off the title loan. While critics may point to this as a way in which individuals find themselves continuing to borrow, it has been shown in a recent study that even larger loan sizes were not correlated with a higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> becoming trapped in a cycle of debt. Additionally, it was discovered that access to title lending decreased the chance an individual would experience bankruptcy, rather than increasing it as is commonly held. Additionally, the study found that larger loan sizes were not correlated with a higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> becoming trapped in a cycle of debt.|$|E
50|$|Peer-to-peer lending, {{sometimes}} abbreviated P2P lending, is {{the practice}} of lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers. Since peer-to-peer lending companies offering these services generally operate online, they can run with lower overhead and provide the service more cheaply than traditional financial institutions. As a result, lenders can earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks, while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates, even after the P2P lending company has taken a fee for providing the match-making platform and credit checking the borrower.

40|$|The author finds {{evidence}} that {{lines of credit}} secured by accounts receivable are associated with business borrowers with a high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> default.

While Huang (1995) attributes relatively low inflation in China to political discipline of the Chinese communists, the banking sector has slowly fallen into quagmire. While harsh retrenchments succeeded in lowering inflation, each monetary expansion brought the Chinese banking sector closer to bankruptcy. The central government controls the overall amount of lending and is therefore responsible for the current banking crisis. If politics is responsible for low inflation, how does it influence lending? My research, in addition to rigorously testing the conventional wisdom that state controlled finance itself leads to suboptimal allocation of capital, also investigates political pressure groups, informal factions, and electoral incentives as possible explanations of the irrational lending problem.

30|$|We follow Ceyhan et al. (2011) in {{modeling}} the bidding {{process as a}} three time step process. Suppose a borrower wants to borrow an amount D and specifies a reserve interest rate of R. Both D and R are publicly listed on the borrower’s listing at time t= 0. Each competing lender, L_i, specifies the amount she is willing to lend, a_i and her bid rate, b_i. Once the total loan amount bid by the lenders with b_i< R, exceeds the requested amount, the borrower has the option to stop the bidding process. We consider this time t= 1. All winners are announced at this point. If the borrower does not stop the bidding process, the lending process carries on until time t= 2, which is the maximum allowable time specified by the marketplace. In our model, we restrict each lender to bid at most once between time step 0 and 1. Note, time length between t= 0 and t= 1 varies for each lending process. Between time t= 1 and t= 2, any lenders not in a winning position may lower their rate bid in order gain a winning position. As each lender bids a lower rate, the latest leading lenders are announced. We assume each lender, L_i has a private rate, r_i which is the lowest rate she is willing to bid based {{on the characteristics of}} the borrower. Between time t= 1 and t= 2, lenders may only lower their bid if each bid increases their utility u_i=x_i(p-r_i), where x_i is the loan amount bid by lender L_i and p is the winning rate. In this section, we drop all notions of a characteristics vector since we talk of one borrower. We assume each lender’s private rate {{is a function of the}} credit <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower.</b> Once a lender is declared a winner any time during the process, she may not pull out of the bidding process. The goal of each lender is to increase their utility. Our goal is to characterize the Nash equilibrium price when lenders are cognizant of credit hunger.|$|E

40|$|Purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study The {{development}} and widespread adoption {{of information technology}} has led to <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> electronic marketplaces, where the traditional intermediaries are being bypassed by an online platform directly connecting the market participants. Within the financial services industry, the consumer lending business of traditional intermediaries such as banks is being disrupted by online peer-to-peer lending platforms, that allow <b>the</b> <b>borrowers</b> to borrow money from the depositors directly without any intermediary. Since its global inception in 2005, and especially after <b>the</b> credit crunch <b>of</b> 2008, peer-to-peer lending has gained significant momentum in various markets, with some US platforms reaching both multi-billion-dollar loan circulation volumes and market capitalizations. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> peer-to-peer lending lags far behind in Europe, but exponential growth is expected to follow there and across the globe. However, the sustainability and continuing widespread adoption of peer-to-peer lending is highly dependent on <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> reliable means to assess <b>the</b> default <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrowers.</b> For this purpose, I study the factors that determine <b>the</b> default <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> peer-to-peer loans using real loan data and provide the first empirical observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish peer-to-peer lending market. Data and methodology I obtain a novel data set of successfully funded loans from the leading peer-to-peer lending platform in Finland. The final sample consist of 6 936 funded loans that had closed as either repaid or defaulted at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> data extraction. Various loan-, borrower- and application specific characteristics {{are included in the}} data that I use to analyze <b>the</b> <b>borrower</b> default behavior.

Big data, on the other hand, may include information that is obtained by the lender via multiple channels of information, which creates a 360 -degree <b>risk</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>borrower.</b> <b>The</b> information that lenders proactively gather may be more objective and cannot be easily manipulated by <b>the</b> <b>borrower,</b> thus reducing information asymmetry. With big data technologies, successful P 2 P lending platforms can help those trustworthy borrowers who cannot access bank financing and exclude those default-likely borrowers who {{may be able to get}} bank financing. Further, by cutting banks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lending process, successful borrowers typically pay a lower interest rate than they would have paid on a traditional bank loan. And lenders can earn higher returns than they would have received by saving their money in bank accounts.|$|R
