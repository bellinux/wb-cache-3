50|$|Ridge-post framing {{is an old}} type {{of timber}} framing.The ridge board of their roof is not carried by king posts based on tie beams, but the ridge posts {{are based on the}} ground work. The German term for this {{construction}} is Firstständerhaus. The free-standing posts in the interior {{of the house and the}} posts in the gable or lateral walls were originally called Firstsäule (ridge columns). On a purlin roof the ridge posts carry the <b>ridge</b> <b>purlin.</b> On the latter are hung the sloping rafters to which the roof is fixed. This type of Firstständerhaus was predominantly built around the 15th century in Baden region.|$|E
5000|$|A large tongkonan [...] {{can take}} a crew of ten about three months to build and another month to carve and paint the outside walls. Bamboo {{scaffold}} is erected {{for the duration of}} the construction phase. Traditionally tongue and groove joinery has been used without the need for nails. A number of components are pre-fabricated with final assembly in-situ. Although built on a log cabin-style sub-structure, tongkonan are set on large vertical wooden piles with mortises cut into their ends to grasp the horizontal tie beams. The tops of the piles are notched for the longitudinal and transverse beams that support the upper structure. The remainder of the sub-structure is assembled in-situ. The transverse beams are fitted into the notched piles, and then notched to fit the longitudinal beams. Side panels, which are often decorated, are then formed on these main horizontal beams. The distinctive curved roof shape is obtained through a series of vertical hanging spars supporting upwardly angled beams. A vertical free-standing pole supports that portion of the ridge pole extending beyond the <b>ridge</b> <b>purlin.</b> Bamboo staves bound with rattan are assembled transversely in layers and tied longitudinally to the rafters forming the roof. The under roofing is of bamboo culm. Wooden boards laid over thick hardwood joists form the floors. Nowadays, zinc roofing sheets and nails are increasingly used.|$|E
