The building was originally planned to have a steel structural framing but because of <b>rising</b> <b>steel</b> prices the structural framing had to be switched to concrete for the final design development. The lower cost of concrete framing meant that the custom stainless steel “skin” could be developed within the University of Toronto’s budget requirements. The building’s exterior had two “skins,” the main “skin” is insulated and waterproof while the separate exterior steel panel “skin” reflected heat. Inside the building are state-of-the-art classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. There is also a student lounge and unique outdoor terrace for students to relax and socialize. [...] Kongats Architects Toronto’s principal Alar Kongats said on an e-mail interview, “The TDHSC is designed to achieve a North American LEED Gold sustainability designation.”. The building has subsequently received a 2012 Governor General's Medal in Architecture. A jury comment described it as [...] "A large institutional building (that) is articulated and humanised by skillful massing and the inventive treatment of the facade. A cladding system of shimmering metal fins animates the stacked box arrangement of volumes, and gives the building a distinctive set-piece quality amid its campus neighbours. Interiors are luminous and civilised with ample natural light, and the sliding stacked volumes create terraces for encounter and engagement. The quality of detailing is exceptional and the sophisticated use of materials lifts the building into a class of its own." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} {{mechanisms of}} horizontal wrinkles and water wave wrinkles on steel casting surface {{have been investigated}} in this study. The horizontal wrinkles, which are the traces of <b>rising</b> <b>steel</b> flow overlapping, are caused by low pouring temperature and slow molten steel flow rising rate. The water wave wrinkles are resulted {{from the use of}} an alcohol-based refractory coating with poor permeability and strong penetration behavior. This coating may penetrate deeply into the pores of sand mold and are not easy to be dried by flame combustion. When pouring the alcohol containing in the coating will volatilize and generate a large amount of gas, forming a gas cushion at steel-mold interface. With the gas escapes gradually, the gas cushion disappears, leaving a gap between the steel and the mold, the solidifying casting surface layer will freely fall down and creep in this gap under gravity itself, resulting in casting surface wrinkling...|$|E
40|$|The {{first glimpse}} for {{humanity}} of global carbon monitoring was the invaluable record of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements {{on the summit}} of Mauna Loa, initiated in 1958 by Charles David Keeling. Terrestrial carbon monitoring at the global scale only became possible {{with the advent of}} earth observation satellites in the early 1980 s. Current science now allows an integration of satellite data, ground stations, and field observations integrated by mechanistic carbon cycle models. However this observational potential has not been realized by current systems, and international investments and coordination are needed. Future policy decisions on mitigating climate change, monitoring carbon credits, and developing biofuels will put a high demand on accurate monitoring and understanding of the global carbon cycle. “The rise in CO 2 is proceeding so slowly that most of us today will, very likely, live out our lives without perceiv-ing that a problem may exist. But CO 2 is just one index of man’s rising activity today. We have rising numbers of college degrees, <b>rising</b> <b>steel</b> production, rising costs of television programming and broadcasting, high rising apartments, rising number of marriages, relatively more rapidly rising numbers of divorces, rising employment, and rising unemployment.

The rapid changes in all factors I [have just] mentioned, including the rapid rise in world population, are probably also transient; these changes, so familiar to us today, not only were unknown to all but the most recent of our ancestors but will be unknown to all but the most immediate of our descendants. ” Keeling et al.

40|$|Deciding which {{activities}} to conduct in-house and which to outsource {{has become increasingly}} important due to its implications on a company's supply chain and overall business model. A number of factors can lead a company to outsource manufacturing processes. As {{a result of this}} outsourcing, the supply chain can become very complex and overwhelming to manage. This thesis will analyze this situation from the perspective of one manufacturer, American Axle and Manufacturing, Inc. (AAM). AAM's Metal Formed Products (MFP) Division currently has a number of challenges: <b>rising</b> <b>steel</b> prices, fixed labor costs and declining sales. All these factors have significantly impacted profitability, forcing senior management to take a comprehensive look at the division and consider developing a plan to improve divisional operations. As a part of this plan, MFP Division's senior management asked for a thorough look into all of the manufacturing processes performed by the division both internally and by outside suppliers. In addition to identifying the processes and suppliers, senior management sought to highlight opportunities for improving the process flow through the re-sourcing of manufacturing processes. This project develops a framework to analyze and evaluate these re-sourcing decisions. This framework employs a five-step approach and incorporates a number of diverse analytical tools. Process flow mapping provided a tool to visually highlight the best opportunities to resource. In addition to a visual representation, process flow mapping also provided the data to financially evaluate alternatives. Strategic and market factors were identified in order to target and prioritize re-sourcing efforts. (cont.) This framework provides a structure for sourcing decisions that balances the financial and strategic concerns. The project concluded in a $ 2 M investment to re-source heat treating to AAM facilities. by Heath M. Holtz. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|International audienceHorizontal {{stability}} of the medium <b>rise</b> <b>steel</b> frame structures is usually ensured by vertical bracings and diaphragm action of composite floors. Load transfer within the composite floor system is made through shear connectors, e. g. headed studs. In an event of explosion, such connectors must reserve sufficient residual stiffness and strength {{in order to avoid}} a sudden or delayed collapse of the building. These remaining capacities have not been experimentally studied yet in the literature. This paper presents large scale horizontal push out tests to determine the residual stiffness of the shear connectors after being initially damaged by explosion. The initial damaging is reproduced by a pull-out test using a quasi-static loading.

A series of five non-linear three-dimensional finite element models were developed using ABAQUS program to study the behavior of the retrofitted connection under cyclic loadings. The outcomes of numerical investigations indicate that the proposed retrofitting method is a proper choice for “special moment frames (SMF) ” and the retrofitted models have sufficient strength and ductility.

40|$|Recently, {{the price}} of steel bars used in {{reinforced}} concrete construction have almost doubled within a year in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere to various degrees. As a lead item of construction material, the sudden <b>rise</b> of <b>steel</b> rebar price {{has led to a}} fluctuation of other construction items prices such as cables, concrete, plasters and others. This <b>rise</b> in <b>steel</b> rebar prices is attributed to numerous economic factors among them: the rise of raw materials, increased global demand, increase of shipping and insurance costs. By and large, there is no consideration of the treatment of escalation of the construction costs quantitatively and contractually in the Arabian Gulf countries since their economies are heavily dependant on the oil price while experiencing a little and stable overall macro inflation. However, alarmingly the recent escalation of the steel bars has created several contractual disputes, claims and breach of contracts. This paper tracks the pattern of the steel bars prices {{for the last two years}} in Saudi Arabia and provides a mathematical model for predicting its future prices.
