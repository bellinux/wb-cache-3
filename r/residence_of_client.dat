40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{recent developments}} in the pharmaceutical retail trade in socialist Ethiopia and {{presents the results of}} two surveys on pharmacy utilization in Addis Ababa. Surveys were carried out in 6 private and 5 government pharmacies. Objectives are: (1) to examine drug retailer utilization in relation to locational, transportation and retailer-related factors: (2) evaluate the role of socioeconomic factors in pharmacy and drug utilization; and (3) determine distance decay associated with clients' trip origins and the location <b>of</b> their <b>residences</b> as indicators <b>of</b> service areas. Although most clients originated in Addis Ababa, large numbers came from rural areas, especially in the pharmacies near large markets and other shopping areas in the inner city. Centrally located retailers also served more Addis Ababa residents and larger sections of the city than peripherally located retailers, largely due to a combination of urban structure, distribution of health care facilities, prevailing drug shopping behavior and population distribution. Government pharmacies had larger service areas and served larger numbers <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> than private pharmacies, primarily due to lower prices and greater availability of pharmaceuticals. Mean distance from pharmacies to places of origin of trips was smaller than mean distance from pharmacies to <b>residences</b> <b>of</b> the same <b>clients.</b> Similarly, distance decay gradients were steeper for the former than the latter in the 4 pharmacies studied {{in the second part of}} the survey, indicating the greater suitability of origin of trip as a parameter of service area. Type and price of drugs purchased were associated with socioeconomic factors, particularly level of education and housing/environmental health conditions in two districts, but there was little variation in the small number of drugs purchased per <b>client.</b> Several forms <b>of</b> drug-purchasing behavior <b>of</b> pharmacy <b>clients</b> and selling practices of private retailers are described as adaptive responses to prevailing economic and sociopolitical conditions. The study concludes that population-based studies of disease occurrence and health behavior are needed to better evaluate the health needs of the population for the planning of additional drug retailers in Addis Ababa's suburban districts. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} edentulism (total absence of natural dentition) trends among adults’ users of public oral {{health care in}} Victoria, Australia and factors associated with these trends. The sample comprised 13, 578 dental <b>clients</b> <b>of</b> public oral health care services, collected between July 2008 and June 2009, from which data were complete. The group <b>of</b> edentulous <b>clients</b> represented 6. 8 % <b>of</b> all <b>clients.</b> Older participants {{were more likely to}} be edentulous (OR = 3. 95; 95 % CI 3. 53 – 4. 43). By language spoken at home, those who spoke English {{were more likely to be}} edentulous than those who spoke other languages (OR = 1. 29; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 63). Aboriginal clients were more likely to be edentulous than non-Aboriginal clients (OR = 2. 21; 95 % CI 1. 15 – 4. 27). By region <b>of</b> <b>residence,</b> <b>clients</b> living in rural locations were more likely to be edentulous than those living in urban regions (OR = 1. 53; 95 % CI 1. 32 – 1. 78). The full model explained 16. 8 % of the variance in being edentulous. Findings in edentulism were lower than what was reported by the National Survey of Adult Oral Health. However, despite this trend, significant variations existed across urban and rural locations. Innovative public health programs and services are essential to prevent inequalities in oral health diseases and conditions for rural populations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{and compares}} different schemes for assignment of replicated services in Jini - an object oriented middleware architecture for network-centric computing. Each client in Jini {{has to be}} assigned a service selected from the pool of available services, which have joined the Jini federation and registered with the lookup service. Both early and delayed assignments are considered as basic options in our evaluation. The information for the system load can be collected at four different levels of detail {{in order to be}} used in the process of assignment decisions. In our analysis, we concentrate on the scenario where the requests for service generated by the clients follow independent user-initiated or machine-initiated transactions. The performance evaluation of the assignment schemes follows the queuing systems methodology. The comparisons are done with regard to the mean <b>residence</b> time <b>of</b> the <b>clients</b> in the system as well as the control overhead imposed by the assignment schemes. A case study of the scheme using the lowest information level proves the effectiveness, applicability and limitations of the delayed assignment in comparison to the early one. These results are a first step towards developing a methodology for building large-scale applications for Jini-based distributed systems. ...|$|R
