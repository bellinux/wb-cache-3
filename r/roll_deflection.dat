50|$|Another way to {{overcome}} deflection issues is by decreasing the {{load on the}} rolls, which {{can be done by}} applying a longitudinal force; this is essentially drawing. Other method of decreasing <b>roll</b> <b>deflection</b> include increasing the elastic modulus of the roll material and adding back-up supports to the rolls.|$|E
50|$|Quarter buckle - This {{is a rare}} defect {{where the}} fibers are {{elongated}} in the quarter regions (the portion of the strip between {{the center and the}} edge). This is normally attributed to using excessive roll bending force since the bending force may not compensate for the <b>roll</b> <b>deflection</b> across {{the entire length of the}} roll.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and work roll bending. CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order polynomial curve into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing {{for control of the}} crown of the rolls dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically crowned rolls, but shifting the ends at an angle so that the gap between the edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic crown control. Work roll bending involves using hydraulic cylinders at the ends of the rolls to counteract <b>roll</b> <b>deflection.</b>|$|E

In {{flatness}} measurement system, the {{flatness measuring}} signal {{can be affected}} by the flatness <b>roll</b> <b>deflection.</b> The flatness roll stress was analyzed and the flatness <b>roll</b> <b>deflection</b> model was obtained by using the influence function method in this paper.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to develop new techniques for rolling mill setup and supervisory control. The study was based around three main components, namely a mathematical model of the process, its associated adaptation and an expert system. A novel architecture was developed to integrate the three components into a setup control system, along with some additional functions. The objective of the mill setup system {{is to determine the}} optimum mill actuator set points and control targets prior to the rolling of the slab. It is the function of the mill setup and supervisory control system to ensure that the material produced is of primary quality and that a high productivity level is achieved.;The novel control architecture incorporates three main components. Firstly, process models are used to predict the states of the rolling process prior to rolling. These models predict the rolling load, motor power and strip temperature, thermal camber of the work <b>rolls,</b> <b>deflection</b> of the mill stack and the profile and shape of the strip. Adaptation ensures that there is a good agreement between measurements and the model predictions. The adaptation is split into two main levels. A Kalman filter is used to predict short term errors in the process model from one pass to the next. Long term variations in the process are tracked using the recursive least squares algorithm. Finally the expert system is used to schedule the mill, diagnose possible faults occurring within the process and to supervise the activities of the other components in the control system.;The system is demonstrated in simulation and comparisons are made with and without the expert system control. The results show that there are distinct improvements to be gained with the application of artificial intelligence to an industrial control problem, in this case a hot aluminium rolling mill...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} paper calender {{was designed}} and built to measure paper strain in the nip of the calender {{as a function of}} machine speed, load and calender roll radius. The effect of <b>roll</b> <b>deflection</b> due to bending was eliminated by making the calender as narrow as possible while still reproducing industrial conditions in all other aspects. The width of the new machine is 75 mm. Permanent paper strains measured with the new equipment reproduced previously published results. In-nip paper strains were obtained under a variety of calendering conditions. Paper strains under load have previously been obtained in a platen press; the new data also reproduce these results. The equipment can now be used for a full experimental program to determine an empirical relationship between paper stress (in terms of the calendering variables) and strain (in terms of paper thickness in the nip) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{at medium}} to high subsonic speeds {{has been conducted}} in the Langley low-turbulence pressure tunnel to determine the static stability and control characteristics and to measure the fin normal forces and moments for {{a model of a}} wingless fin-controlled missile. The data were obtained at Reynolds number of 2. 1 x 10 (6) based on the missile maximum diameter or 17. 7 x 10 (6) based on missile length; this Reynolds number was found to be large enough to avoid any large scale effects between the test and the expected flight Reynolds number. With the horizontal-fin deflection limited to a maximum of 6 degrees, longitudinally stable and trimmed flight could not be maintained beyond an angle of attack of 17 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 88 and beyond 20 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 50 for any center-of-gravity location without the use of some auxiliary stability or control device such as jet vanes. Mach number had no appreciable effect on the center-of-pressure positions and only a slight effect on neutral-point position. There was a shift in neutral-point position of about 1 caliber as the angle of attack was varied through the range for which the neutral point could be determined. Yawing the model to angles of sideslip up to 7 degrees had little effect on the longitudinal stability at angles of attack up to 15 degrees; however, above 15 degrees, the effect of sideslip was destabilizing. With the vertical fins at a plus-or-minus 6 degree <b>roll</b> <b>deflection,</b> the rolling moment caused by yawing the model at high angles of attack could be trimmed out up to angles of sideslip of 6. 5 degrees and an angle of attack of 26 degrees for a Mach number of 0. 50; this range of sideslip angles was reduced to 3 degrees at a Mach number of 0. 88. The data indicated that, at lower angles of attack, the trim range extended to higher angles of sideslip. The total normal-force and hinge-moment coefficients for both horizontal fins were slightly nonlinear with both angle-of-attack and fin deflection. The effect of Mach number was to reduce the slopes of the hinge-moment coefficient with angle of attack and deflection angle. In general, the effort of increasing the sideslip angle was to reduce the values of the fin normal-force and hinge-moment coefficients...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} wrap-around-fin missile configurations {{was conducted at}} Mach numbers from 1. 60 to 2. 86 in the Langley Unitary Plan wind tunnel. The fin configurations investigated included variations in chord length, leading edge sweep, thickness ratio, and leading edge shape. The investigation also included a smooth and a stepped-down afterbody required for flush retraction of the wrap-around-fin configuration. The investigation indicated no unusual longitudinal characteristics; however, all the wrap-around-fin configurations tested indicated erratic lateral behavior, particularly {{in the form of}} induced roll at zero angle of attack and irregular variations of roll with angle of attack and Mach number. The magnitude of rolling moment at an angle of attack of 0 deg is estimated to represent approximately 0. 25 deg or less <b>roll</b> control <b>deflection.</b> The stepped-down afterbody has a marked effect on reducing the induced roll...|$|R

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of a fully controllable thrust reverser on the flight characteristics of a single-engine jet airplane. Tests were made using a cylindrical target-type reverser actuated by a hydraulic cylinder through a "beep-type" cockpit control mounted {{at the base of the}} throttle. The thrust reverser was evaluated as an in-flight decelerating device, as a flight path control and airspeed control in landing approach, and as a braking device during the ground <b>roll.</b> Full <b>deflection</b> of the reverser for one reverser configuration resulted in a reverse thrust ratio of as much as 85 percent, which at maximum engine power corresponded to a reversed thrust of 5100 pounds. Use of the reverser in landing approach made possible a wide selection of approach angles, a large reduction in approach speed at steep approach angles, improved control of flight path angle, and more accuracy in hitting a given touchdown point. The use of the reverser as a speed brake at lower airspeeds was compromised by a longitudinal trim change. At the lower airspeeds and higher engine powers there was insufficient elevator power to overcome the nose-down trim change at full reverser deflection...|$|R

40|$|The LiDAR mapping {{carried out}} using gyrocopters {{provides}} a relatively cheap alternative for traditional mapping involving airplanes. The {{costs of the}} fuel and the overall maintenance are much lower when compared to planes. At {{the same time the}} flight kinematics of the gyrocopter makes it an ideal vehicle for corridor mapping. However a limited payload and a strongly limited space prevent using stabilized platforms dedicated for aerial photogrammetry. As the proper stabilization of the laser scanner during the flight is crucial {{in order to keep the}} desirable quality of the LiDAR data, it was decided to develop the prototype of the stabilized, ultra-light mapping platform that can meet the restricted requirements of the gyrocopter. The paper starts with the brief discussion of the legal and practical aspects of the LiDAR data quality, dealing mostly with the influence of the flight imperfections on the point pattern and point density. Afterwards the mapping system prototype is characterized, taking into account three main components: stabilized platform, sensors and control. Subsequently first in-flight tests are described. Though the data are still not perfect mostly due to vibrations, the stabilization provides a substantial improvement of their geometry, reducing both <b>roll</b> and pitch <b>deflections...</b>|$|R
