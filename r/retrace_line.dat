50|$|The VBI was {{originally}} needed {{because of the}} inductive inertia of the magnetic coils which deflect the electron beam vertically in a CRT; the magnetic field, and hence the position being drawn, cannot change instantly. Additionally, the speed of older circuits was limited. For horizontal deflection, {{there is also a}} pause between successive lines, to allow the beam to return from right to left, called the horizontal retrace or horizontal blanking interval. Modern CRT circuitry does not require such a long blanking interval, and thin panel displays require none, but the standards were established when the delay was needed (and to allow the continued use of older equipment). Blanking of a CRT may not be perfect due to equipment faults or brightness set very high; in this case a white <b>retrace</b> <b>line</b> shows on the screen, from bottom right to top left.|$|E

50|$|Counter-scanned images (CSI, CSIs) are a pair {{of images}} {{obtained}} during counter-scanning. During the counter-scanning {{it is possible to}} obtain one or two pairs of CSIs (see Fig. 1). Each pair consists of a direct image and the image counter to it. First, a conventional image is obtained called the direct image, after that a counter image is obtained by reversing the movement direction along a raster line and the movement direction from line to line of the raster. The direct image of the second pair is formed by the <b>retrace</b> <b>lines</b> of the direct image of the first pair. The counter image of the second pair is formed by the <b>retrace</b> <b>lines</b> of the counter image of the first pair. CSIs are intended for correction of distortions caused by drift of the scanning microscope probe relative to the surface under investigation. To implement correction, it is sufficient to have at least one common feature between the direct and the counter images. As compared to a single CSI pair, the use of two pairs requires twice as much memory and processing time {{but on the other hand}} it allows increasing precision of correction and reducing noise level in the corrected image.|$|R

The proposed method works based on hammering the sample with tapping mode AFM followed by wet cleaning of the residuals. On the area where a specific pattern should be written, the tip-sample interaction force is tuned in a controlled manner by changing the excitation frequency of the cantilever without interrupting the imaging process. Using this method several patterns where transferred to different samples with imaging speed. While the pattern was transferred to the sample in each tracing scan line, the patterned sample was imaged in <b>retracing</b> scan <b>line,</b> thus the outcome was immediately visible during the experiment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Nobel Prize Laureate Robert Lucas {{maintains}} that the design and acquisition of new tools of analysis foster the advancement of scientific research.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} Müller-Lyer illusion on a reaching movement just after the visual and haptic/kinesthetic cues are simultaneously presented. First, a standard experiment on this visual illusion is conducted {{by means of the}} most typical way so as to make sure that participants can experience this illusion; the result shows that all the subjects are deceived by the illusion figure as in many previous results. As the next step, the subjects are asked to physically trace one of three lines—normal line and lines with feathers of an arrow—with the same length displayed on an LCD. After a few traces, the line suddenly vanishes, and then the subjects <b>retrace</b> the invisible <b>line</b> based on only their memory and somatic sensations. During this task, we measure the trajectory of fingertip from a start to the goal using a motion capture system. The result indicates that the Müller-Lyer illusion dominantly affects the reaching task although the haptic/kinesthetic cue was also given just before the task. Thus, this result implies that the visual illusion affects the motion planning, which partly supports a planning-motion model. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{their first}} {{proof of the}}ir index theorem, Atiyah and Singer used cobordism theory, {{inspired}} by Hirzebruch’s proof of the signature theorem, which is a special case of the index theorem. As far as index theory is concerned, it is more natural to move inside the K-theoretic world, and Atiyah-Singer’s second proof of the index theorem does so. We shall here <b>retrace</b> a certain <b>line</b> of devel-opment of phrasing the index theorem, taking us from the 1960 s {{to the present day}} (2009). We shall start out with the original cohomological formulation, move to a formulation in terms of topological K-theory based on complex vector bun-dles, go on to K-theory of commutative C∗-algebras and finally end up with a K-theoretic formulation in terms of deformation groupoids. This final point of view lends itself to a generalization to singular spaces (stratified pseudomani-folds), the point being that while singular spaces do not have a tangent bundle in the classical sense, they do have a tangent groupoid, constructed by Debord, Lescure and Nistor [DLN 09]. Using this viewpoint, they have obtained an index theorem for stratified spaces. Content...|$|R
40|$|When {{using the}} SPM as a {{metrological}} instrument, {{it is essential}} to compensate for the hysteresis between the piezo's movement and the applied control voltage. We disabled the build-in on-line correction of our SPM and scanned samples quasi-static with 0. 1 Hz in various scan ranges from 5 V to 440 V peak-to-peak. One sample consisted of lines spaced by 3. 0 #mu#m, the other was a two-dimensional grid with 200 nm pitch. The typical error in length measurement even after on-line correction remains at 1 - 2 %. In order to improve the error to less than 0. 2 % which represents one pixel in the scanned image, a mathematical model for the rate-independent hysteresis is set up. Instead of regarding each scan line individually as a closed hysteresis loop, we treat the scan lines in the experimentally obtaind images as a sequence of connected hysteresis loops. Each loop consists of the trace and <b>retrace</b> scan <b>line.</b> The five parameters of the model are then fitted to our observed data in order to compensate for the image distortions. A standard deviation of 0. 2 % is reached. Furthermore, the properties of the model reveal what happens when a sudden change in scan range or scan offset is applied: the connected hysteresis loops reveal a rate-independent convergence which can be mistaken as the commonly known creep. This, however, is a time-dependent relaxation phenomenon which is not significant in our experiments. Thus our model predicts the quasi-static piezo movement within the required 0. 2 % error limit even for arbitrary scan movements. The model can also be applied to the critical piezo movement in the z direction. The model will be used online to determine the optimal shape of the control voltage so that the piezo moves linearly during the whole scan process. (orig.)

Valadier also designed some furniture and other decorative arts, such as the rock crystal and silver reliquary for relics of the Holy Crib in Santa Maria Maggiore, for Pope Pius IX. Valadier worked in Rome {{and elsewhere in the}} Papal States, but many of his projects remained on paper. He was named official architetto camerale of the Papal States by Pope Pius VI in 1786. He taught architecture at the Accademia di San Luca was a pioneer archeologist and a restorer of monuments, such as the Milvian Bridge (1805) and the Arch of Titus in Rome, (1819-21). He <b>retraced</b> the ancient <b>line</b> of the Via Flaminia (1805) and restored Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola's neglected Church of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, which influenced his own Church of Santa Maria della Salute in Fiumicino, the newly-establish port for Rome.|$|R
5000|$|Twichell became {{involved}} in Amarillo civic affairs. He was a Methodist and backed prohibition, having once hosted an appearance in Amarillo by Carrie Nation, known for her physical attacks on saloons. Perhaps {{using some of the}} normal school training, he taught from 1895 to 1897 at the forerunner to the community college now known as Amarillo College, where he not only launched the school band but in 1901 organized the Amarillo Concert Band. [...] Subsequent cadastral surveyors <b>retracing</b> his <b>lines</b> found them highly accurate. His survey records, composed of many field books, working sketches, some 200 finished maps, field notes, and about 50,000 pages of correspondence, were purchased by six major oil companies a short time before Twichell's death and were long maintained in a private depository in Midland. On September 29, 2010, Chevron, Atlantic Richfield, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil, which held the remaining Twichell papers, donated the surveys to the office of General Land Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson. Altogether Twichell laid out more than forty towns and surveyed in 165 of the 254 Texas counties. Patterson reflected on Twichell's long-term significance to Texas history and development. Twichell surveyed the developing areas along the Texas and New Mexico boundary, marked lands giving rise to the XIT Ranch, helped to build railroads, developed the funding mechanism for part of the costs of public education, and provided for the abundant exploration of petroleum and natural gas. His survey also extended into Arizona. In 1901, Twichell was called upon to survey the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont in southeastern Texas. His surveying brought him into contact with such figures as the legenday justice of the peace, Roy Bean of Langtry, Texas, as well as author O. Henry, cattleman Charles Goodnight, and the Comanche chief Quanah Parker. He trained the Lubbock surveyor Sylvan Sanders. Twichell surveyed 15 million total acres, having averaged twenty miles in a typical day. He derived much satisfaction from his work because it created a constant demand for mental activity and allowed him the benefits of new experience and travel. Only one mistake was found in Twichell's work, and that was made by an associate.|$|R
40|$|AIM The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of a connective tissue graft (CTG) or a collagen matrix (CM) interpositioned between flaps and non-shedding hard surfaces on wound stability. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty bone dehiscence defects were prepared in five Beagle dogs. Three treatments were performed in 12 sites per dog: (1) repositioned flaps were sutured onto instrumented dentin surfaces (control), (2) repositioning of flaps with an interpositioned CTG and (3) repositioning of flaps with the application of a CM. To allow postoperative healing with n = 5 for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days before evaluation, the sutures were removed, incision <b>lines</b> <b>retraced</b> and tensile forces applied to the flaps. The minimum magnitude of forces required to detach the flaps from the wound bed was recorded. RESULTS After 1 week of healing, 6 N had to be applied to disrupt flaps from their wound bed in the CTG group. In the control group, a similar magnitude of resistance was achieved after 2 weeks (6. 1 N). Flap resistance to tearing was highest in the CTG group (maximum 9. 1 N) 2 weeks postoperatively. On the third postoperative day, the mean tearing forces of all groups differed significantly, displaying a 50 % lower resistance to tearing in the CM compared to the CTG group. In comparison, flap resistance to tearing forces established earlier and in higher magnitude in sites with an interpositioned CTG than in flaps repositioned on dentin or CM. CONCLUSIONS Application of a CTG, sutured to a non-shedding hard surface, significantly increased flap resistance to tearing when applying disrupting forces compared to controls. A less pronounced effect was achieved by interpositioning of a CM...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To read {{efficiently}} with {{a simple}} hand or stand magnifier, people with visual impairment have to move (navigate) the device along each line (forward phase) {{and back to the}} correct position {{at the start of the}} next <b>line</b> (<b>retrace</b> phase). Page navigation difficulties have been implicated as limiting factors when reading with hand and stand magnifiers, but have not been objectively measured. METHODS: Magnifier movements were recorded using a 3 SPACE Isotrak system for 43 participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who read two short stories using their habitual hand or stand magnifier. Page navigation was quantified in terms of magnifier movements and navigation errors for the forward and retrace phases. Visual acuities and visual fields were measured, and magnifier usage and page navigation difficulties were surveyed. RESULTS: During the forward phase, participants primarily used either a straight (47 %) or diagonal downward (46 %) movement, whereas during the retrace phase, the majority (56 %) used a downward movement. On average, forward navigation time was four times longer than retrace navigation time (p< 0. 001). The most common navigation error was incorrect positioning of the magnifier at the end of the retrace movement. Near word acuity correlated strongly with forward time (r= 0. 78), and moderately with retrace time (r= 0. 53) and forward errors (r= 0. 50). Vertical field of view correlated with retrace errors (r=- 0. 53). Participants' estimates of page navigation difficulties were not predictive of objective measures of performance. CONCLUSIONS: We quantified page navigation strategies and difficulties of people with AMD reading with magnifiers. Retrace, which presents the most common difficulty, is not well predicted by vision measures or magnifier characteristics; future studies should investigate the relationship between motor skills and navigation performance, and the impact of training or devices on reducing retrace navigation difficulties...|$|R
