5|$|Her {{story is}} a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{universal}} denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven {{by the light of}} knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him something about his mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|R
50|$|The Castle Coole {{estate was}} {{purchased}} in 1656 by the Belfast merchant John Corry, grandfather {{of the first}} Earl. The estate is named for Lough Coole (from Irish Gaelic cúil, 'seclusion'), a lake surrounded by the Killynure hills. A ráth here and a crannog in Lough Coole itself are <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area has been settled since prehistoric times. Other lakes on the estate include Lough Yoan and Brendrum Lough.|$|R
25|$|A {{vehicle that}} has no front- and rear-position lights fitted or has had those lights {{permanently}} removed, painted or masked-over is exempt from the lighting sections of the MOT test. An advisory note will be provided on the VT32 as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vehicle should only be used during daylight hours and not used at times of seriously reduced visibility.|$|E
25|$|The first {{narrative}} section begins. John baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in {{the wilderness}} for forty days, and is tempted by Satan. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, {{the first of the}} discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the kingdom of God, introduced by the Beatitudes ("Blessed are..."). It concludes with a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd's amazed response leads into the next narrative block.|$|E
25|$|To defuse public {{demand for}} direct federal {{regulation}} of lawyers (as opposed to leaving {{it in the}} hands of state bar associations or courts), the American Bar Association (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing Model Code of Professional Responsibility (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983 it replaced it with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The MRPC have been adopted in part or in whole by 49 states (and is being considered by the last one, California). Its preamble contains an emphatic <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved law schools take a course in professional responsibility (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} five years. For some people time has barely passed. Tuesday, September 11, 2001 feels like yesterday. To others these {{last five years}} seem an eternity. Many people have slipped back into their {{everyday}} lives. The horrific images, unimaginable sadness, security threats and unanswered questions {{have given way to}} a world <b>that</b> on <b>the</b> surface feels predictable and safe. But there are abrupt <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is not safe or predictable; everything familiar to us can change in an instant...|$|R
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process {{for more than five}} hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a white man—Spain's own particular <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E
25|$|Royal Holloway's {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of the Royal Holloway shield and its surrounding elements. There are three crescents shown on the coat of arms, which are taken from Thomas Holloway's own coat of arms. Taken from the Bedford coat of arms, the field is coloured black and gold in a chequered design, {{with the addition of}} ermine spots (feather-like symbols representing ermine tails) from the Royal Holloway coat. Placed between two black lozenges, there is a lamp of learning. Traditionally, the lozenge is worn on the arm of unmarried women or widows, which places significance on the coat of arms' lozenges as it acts as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> colleges were founded for women. Below, the motto is displayed which is taken from the arms of Bedford College, and reads esse quam videri.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted {{unanimously}} to erect a memorial for the ‘comfort women’ of World War II. The memorial itself would stand as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> event did in fact happen, despite repeated denials by the Japanese government, {{and it would be}} a reminder never to let another atrocity like it happen again. However some Japanese members of the community showed concerns over the memorial, believing that it would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community. One of these critics was Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, a large city in Japan. Hashimoto claims in his letter written to the Board of Supervisors that the memorial should be “broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world”. Japanese residents of the area have also shown concerns over the memorial as many believe that it projects hatred towards the Japanese and focuses solely on an event in committed by the Japanese during wartime instead of promoting awareness and future prevention.|$|E

The {{upper section}} of the shield {{contains}} the cross and rays, as <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> primary purpose of Lasallian education is to lead every student to Christ and to spread the Good News of God’s Kingdom. Above the shield is a dove spreading its wings, symbolizing peace and representing the Holy Spirit who sends His light to renew {{the face of the}} earth. The color white represents peace and purity of faith and morals; green, hope and confidence; and gold, love.|$|R
500|$|All {{that exists}} in the scene is a {{procession}} of individuals, and the narrator conjectures on the rest. The altar and town exist as part of a world outside art, and the poem challenges the limitations of art through describing their possible existence. The questions are unanswered because there is no one who can ever know the true answers, as the locations are not real. The final stanza begins with a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> urn is a piece of eternal artwork: ...|$|E

The base is often attached to a copious white mycelium—a visual <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the organism lies unseen below the surface. The ring is membranous, and persistent—not weathering away with time; the ring may be attached to the stem with white fibers. The mushroom has no distinct odor. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown; however, it is generally not recommended to consume Amanita mushrooms of questionable edibility.|$|E
500|$|Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine {{gave the}} episode a C+ grade, saying {{professional}} wrestling {{seems like a}} topic South Park should have mocked long ago. Delgado said the best scenes were the first moments of the boys' wrestling league, but that the [...] "novelty of the idea starts to fade" [...] and the developments become too outrageous. Macleans writer Jamie Weinman criticized the episode and said professional wrestling was [...] "not exactly a timely target". Not all reviews were negative. Salon.com writer Mary Elizabeth Williams called the show [...] "perennially offensive [...] still shockingly funny", and particularly praised Cartman's wrestling character [...] "Bad Irene", who professes a love of and addiction to abortions. Williams called it, [...] "a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heated debate over choice frequently serves as America's prime-time entertainment".|$|E

Evolutionary changes may have taken 20 million years to develop the pronghorn as we know it today.

[...] His [...] "undisputed champions" [...] of the night were the Spice Girls and The Who. [...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the show [...] "had something for every generation" [...] and was an [...] "all-star...crowd-pleaser."

500|$|Crossland's {{delivery}} was {{the cause}} for much discussion throughout his most successful year of 1882, but despite a commonly held view that he threw the ball, umpires never called a no ball against him for throwing in first-class matches. His bowling action during the match against Surrey at the Oval {{was the subject of}} significant complaints from the crowd, who accused him of throwing. During his bowling spell, he was heckled by the crowd, with shouts of [...] "well-thrown" [...] and [...] "take him off", and he was later surrounded by Surrey supporters {{when he returned to the}} changing rooms. The Times addressed the issue in their match report, with a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> umpires are the [...] "judges of fair or unfair play", while the gossip columnist in [...] suggested that it was [...] "very obvious and frequent infringement of the laws defining bowling", and that it was clear that umpires lacked the expertise and the bravery to no ball a bowler.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E

Moore says that, [...] "references to Roman locales must have been stunning for they are not merely references to things Roman, but the most blatant possible <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> production occurs {{in the city of}} Rome".
