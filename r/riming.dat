2500|$|The short poems which {{sometimes}} precede his responsa also show great poetic talent and a pure Hebrew style (see Bacher in Monatsschrift, xliv.56 et seq.). When Abraham ibn Ezra was traveling through France R. Tam greeted him in verse, whereupon Ibn Ezra exclaimed in astonishment, [...] "Who has admitted the French into {{the temple of}} poetry?" [...] (Kerem Ḥemed, vii.35). Another work of his in metric form is his poem on the accents, which contains forty-five strophes <b>riming</b> in; it is found in various libraries (Padua, Hamburg, Parma), and is entitled Maḥberet. Luzzatto has given the first four strophes in Kerem Ḥemed (vii.38), and Halberstam has printed the whole poem in Kobak's [...] "Jeschurun" [...] (v.123).|$|E

2500|$|Some <b>rimes</b> come {{in pairs}} {{in the above}} table: the one to the left {{represents}} a close <b>rime</b> (...) , while the other represents an open <b>rime</b> (...) [...] The close/open <b>rimes</b> are closely related with the tones. As single syllables, the tones of Ĭng-bìng (...) , Siōng-siăng (...) , Iòng-bìng (...) and Iòng-ĭk (...) have close <b>rimes</b> while Ĭng-ké̤ṳ (...) , Ĭng-ĭk (...) and Iòng-ké̤ṳ (...) have the open <b>rimes.</b> In connected speech, an open <b>rime</b> shifts to its close counterpart in the tonal sandhi.|$|R
50|$|Within the Fuqing dialect, {{the open}} <b>rime's</b> vowel {{is always more}} open (alias 'lower') by a degree than the close <b>rime.</b> For example, 知 is read ti as a close <b>rime,</b> with the close vowel i. Listed as the same <b>rime</b> but in a {{different}} tone (i.e. light departing 陽去) is 地, which is instead read as te, an open <b>rime</b> with the half-close vowel e. This is more open than i by one degree. All close <b>rimes</b> becomes their corresponding open <b>rimes</b> according to this rule.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{original}} listing of the <b>rimes</b> in the Qī Lín Bāyīn, the medial vowel did not change with the tones. But in the Fuqing dialect, when the <b>rime</b> is in either one of the departing tones or in the dark entering tone, the medial vowel changes to another, the <b>rime</b> being called the open <b>rime.</b> When in {{either of the two}} level tones, in the rising tone, or in the light entering tone, the <b>rime</b> this time does not change; this <b>rime</b> is called the close <b>rime.</b> In the Fuqing dialect, with the exception of ŋ and iau, all <b>rimes</b> exhibit this close-open alternation.|$|R
60|$|LAYAMON'S BRUT (c. 1200). This is {{the most}} {{important}} of the English <b>riming</b> chronicles, that is, history related in the form of doggerel verse, probably because poetry is more easily memorized than prose. We give here a free rendering of selected lines {{at the beginning of the}} poem, which tell us all we know of Layamon, the first who ever wrote as an Englishman for Englishmen, including in the term all who loved England and called it home, no matter where their ancestors were born.|$|E
6000|$|SPECIMENS OF THE LANGUAGE. A {{glance at}} the {{following}} selections will show how Anglo-Saxon was slowly approaching our English speech of to-day. The first is from a religious book called Ancren Riwle (Rule of the Anchoresses, cir. 1225). The second, written about a century later, is from the <b>riming</b> chronicle, or verse history, of Robert Manning or Robert of Brunne. In it we note the appearance of rime, a new thing in English poetry, borrowed from the French, and also a few words, such as [...] "solace," [...] which are of foreign origin: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{most notable}} {{works of the}} Norman-French period are: Geoffrey's [...] History of the Kings of Britain, which {{preserved}} in Latin [...] prose the native legends of King Arthur; Layamon's Brut, a [...] <b>riming</b> chronicle or verse history in the native tongue; many [...] metrical romances, or stories of love, chivalry, magic and [...] religion; and various popular songs and ballads. The greatest poet [...] of the period is the unknown author of [...] "Sir Gawain and the Green [...] Knight" [...] (a metrical romance) and probably also of [...] "The Pearl," [...] a [...] beautiful elegy, which is our earliest In Memoriam.|$|E

50|$|Within polysyllabic words (of {{two or more}} syllables) or {{characters}} {{within one}} sense unit, if in the departing tone (both light departing and dark departing) or in the dark entering tone, {{and if it is}} not the last character in the unit, the <b>rime</b> undergoes a transformation. This <b>rime</b> change is related to the open/close <b>rime</b> phenomenon: as these three tones only have open <b>rimes,</b> when the character changes tone through tone sandhi, the open <b>rimes</b> will become the corresponding close <b>rimes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>rime</b> {{tables were}} solely {{concerned}} with the pronunciation of syllables of these <b>rime</b> dictionaries, and do not contain dictionary-like material such as definitions.Similarly, {{where a group of}} characters are recorded as homophones in the <b>rime</b> dictionaries, typically only one will occur in a <b>rime</b> table.A <b>rime</b> table book presents these distinct syllables in a number of tabular charts, each devoted to one or more sets of parallel rhyme groups across the tones.|$|R
6000|$|POETICAL FORM. For the Faery Queen Spenser {{invented a}} new verse form, {{which has been}} called since his day the Spenserian stanza. Because of its rare beauty it has been much used by nearly all our poets in their best work. The new stanza was an {{improved}} form of Ariosto's ottava rima (i.e. eight-line stanza) and bears a close resemblance to one of Chaucer's most musical verse forms in the [...] "Monk's Tale." [...] Spenser's stanza is in nine lines, eight of five feet each and the last of six feet, <b>riming</b> ababbcbcc. A few selections from the first book, which is best worth reading, are reproduced here to show the style and melody of the verse.|$|E
6000|$|Other {{types of}} early {{literature}} are the <b>riming</b> chronicles or verse histories (such as Layamon's Brut, a famous poem, {{in which the}} Arthurian legends appear as part of English history), stories of travel, translations, religious poems, books of devotion, miracle plays, fables, satires, ballads, hymns, lullabies, lyrics of love and nature,--an astonishing collection for so ancient a time, indicative at once of our changing standards of poetry and of our unchanging human nature. For the feelings which inspired or gave welcome to these poems, some five or six hundred years ago, are precisely the same feelings which warm {{the heart of a}} poet and his readers to-day. There is nothing ancient but the spelling in this exquisite Lullaby, for instance, which was sung on Christmas eve: ...|$|E
60|$|Obviously it is {{impossible}} to classify such a variety. We note simply that it is mediæval in spirit, and French in style and expression; and that sums up the age. All the scholarly works of the period, like William of Malmesbury's History, and Anselm's[46] Cur Deus Homo, and Roger Bacon's Opus Majus, the beginning of modern experimental science, were written in Latin; while nearly all other works were written in French, or else were English copies or translations of French originals. Except for the advanced student, therefore, they hardly belong to the story of English literature. We shall note here only one or two marked literary types, like the <b>Riming</b> Chronicle (or verse history) and the Metrical Romance, and a few writers whose work has especial significance.|$|E

60|$|At {{first the}} new {{literature}} was remarkably varied, but of small intrinsic worth; {{and very little}} of it is now read. In our study we have noted: (1) Geoffrey's History, which is valuable as a source book of literature, since it contains the native Celtic legends of Arthur. (2) The work of the French writers, who made the Arthurian legends popular. (3) <b>Riming</b> Chronicles, i.e. history in doggerel verse, like Layamon's Brut. (4) Metrical Romances, or tales in verse. These were numerous, and of four classes: (a) the Matter of France, tales centering about Charlemagne and his peers, chief {{of which is the}} Chanson de Roland; (b) Matter of Greece and Rome, an endless series of fabulous tales about Alexander, and about the Fall of Troy; (c) Matter of England, stories of Bevis of Hampton, Guy of Warwick, Robin Hood, etc.; (d) Matter of Britain, tales having for their heroes Arthur and his knights of the Round Table. The best of these romances is Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. (5) Miscellaneous literature,--the Ancren Riwle, our best piece of early English prose; Orm's Ormulum; Cursor Mundi, with its suggestive parallel to the Miracle plays; and ballads, like King Horn and the Robin Hood songs, which were the only poetry of the common people.|$|E
6000|$|Much of the archaic diction {{and antique}} spelling, {{as well as}} the ruder grotesquerie, that in the first edition proclaimed its {{relation}} to the pseudo-balladry of the time disappeared in the later editions. But the archaisms, the [...] "unpoetical" [...] diction, and especially the disregard of tense coherence in the poem as we now have it, contribute greatly to the atmosphere of romance--as of a story removed alike from the commonplace experience of every day and from familiar literary conventions--which it was Coleridge's intention to produce. By a few devotional ejaculations--"Heaven's Mother send us grace!" [...] "To Mary Queen the praise be given!"--we are made to feel that the Ancient Mariner lived before the Reformation, in the ages of wonder and faith. Repetition, as in many stanzas of Part IV., is a device caught from the folk-ballad and modified to produce the effect of a spell, which is so strong a mark of the poem. The abrupt opening, the unannounced transitions in dialogue, the omission of all but the vital incidents of the story, all belong to the ballad style. The verse form is {{what is known as the}} ballad stanza (stanza of four lines--a line of four accents followed by one of three, the second and fourth lines <b>riming)</b> variously extended and modified to suit the mood of the passage. The prose summary in the form of a marginal gloss, first added in the edition of 1817, is a practice taken from early printed books, but not from balladry, which is normally oral.|$|E

60|$|The {{author of}} our old English 'Art of Poesie' begins his work with a {{statement}} which {{may serve as a}} text: 'Poesie,' says Puttenham, writing in 1589, 'is more ancient than the artificiall of the Greeks and Latines, coming by instinct of nature, and used by the savage and uncivill, who were before all science and civilitie. This is proved by certificate of merchants and travellers, who by late navigations have surveyed the whole world, and discovered large countries, and strange people, wild and savage, affirming that the American, the Perusine, and the very canniball, do sing, and also say, their highest and holiest matters in certain <b>riming</b> versicles.' Puttenham is here referring to that instinct of primitive men, which compels them in all moments of high-wrought feeling, and on all solemn occasions, to give utterance to a kind of chant. {157a} Such a chant is the song of Lamech, when he had 'slain a man to his wounding.' So in the Norse sagas, Grettir and Gunnar sing when they have anything particular to say; and so in the Marchen--the primitive fairy tales of all nations--scraps of verse are introduced where emphasis is wanted. This craving for passionate expression takes a more formal shape in the lays which, among all primitive peoples, as among the modern Greeks to-day, {157b} are sung at betrothals, funerals, and departures for distant lands. These songs have been collected in Scotland by Scott and Motherwell; their Danish counterparts have been translated by Mr. Prior. In Greece, M. Fauriel and Dr. Ulrichs; in Provence, Damase Arbaud; in Italy, M. Nigra; in Servia, Talvj; in France, Gerard de Nerval--have done for their separate countries what Scott did for the Border. Professor Child, of Harvard, is publishing a beautiful critical collection of English Volkslieder, with all known variants from every country.|$|E

50|$|The Rhyming Poem, {{also written}} as The <b>Riming</b> Poem, is a poem of 87 lines {{found in the}} Exeter Book, a tenth-century {{collection}} of Old English poetry.
