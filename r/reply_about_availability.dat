40|$|In today’s {{advanced}} world lots {{of innovative}} applications {{are built on}} mobile phone based technologies and more are being developed. Libraries in developed countries have begun using Mobile phone based technologies such as Short Message Service (SMS) and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) to interact with members and utilize it to send alerts and notifications. With one step ahead in this paper, we have proposed a new method {{to get the information}} <b>about</b> the <b>availability</b> of a particular book and its location through an SMS. A library user can send a SMS request with {{the title of the book}} to check the availability by staying at home or any other places. As a response the library database maintained by automatic update and conveys systems send the <b>reply</b> SMS <b>about</b> the <b>availability,</b> number of copies available and its location. This kind of service will not only help the user to save lot of time but also help him to search the book availability in all near-by libraries. Therefore mobile pervasive technology can be used by the libraries to serve their user as well as the patrons to avail the library services in a better way. By implementing this technique the services offered by the libraries to the user will be more effective and efficient manner...|$|R
