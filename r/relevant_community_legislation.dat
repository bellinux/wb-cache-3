The chemical status of water bodies is to be assessed in terms of compliance with the quality standards (QSs) and under other <b>relevant</b> <b>Community</b> <b>legislation</b> setting environmental quality standards (EQSs) [5]. Initial steps for measures under the WFD were: 2005 first pressure and impact analysis (Article 5), 2006 monitoring programmes to be operational (Article 8) and 2009 establishment of the programme of measures (Article 11).|$|E

Part II is a synthesis, based on the principle that a dominant company has, at least in some cases, a duty to supply, if refusal will cause a significant effect on competition...|$|E

Institute for the Control of Biological Products and Veterinary Medicines (ICBMV) is the competent authority in the licensing of veterinary medicinal products, working with European institutions, notably the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), in matters related to the licensing and post-marketing surveillance,together with ANSVSA. In the up mentioned context, ICBMV representatives attending to meetings of Working Groups of the CVMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use) and the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition production and decentralized procedure (CMDv), on different fields. Working groups are meeting in sessions, quarterly, and the CVMP and CMDv Committees meetings are held monthly, according to a timetable.

40|$|Within the {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC, WFD), the European Commission shall review at least every four years the list of priority substances. In this context, an overall prioritisation process has been defined by the Commission and its Working Group E on Priority Substances, which takes into account as agreed by the text of the Directive "the selection of substances of concern undertaken in the <b>relevant</b> <b>Community</b> <b>legislation</b> regarding hazardous substances or relevant international agreements" but also results of a modelling-based approach as well as results of a monitoring-based approach. As regards the monitoring-based approach, a two-step data collection has been put into place so as to gather as exhaustively as possible monitoring data of chemical substances in European member states. Data have been collected from 26 Member States, Norway and Switzerland, gathering 14. 6 million analyses in three different matrices (water, sediment and biota). A tiered algorithm based on risk assessment principles was elaborated to prioritise substances. A list of 38 substances and 2 families of substances was defined in this sense. A first review of the results permitted to detect a number of false-negative and eliminate unfairly selected substances from the first list. Finally, the proposed list includes 19 individual substances, polychlorobiphenyls and dioxins. This outcome will be taken into account in the overall prioritisation process to review the list of WFD priority substances by 13 th January 2011.

This Note follows the progression of <b>Community</b> <b>legislation</b> targeting trafficking from 1997 through today, and analyzes Member States’ compliance with those laws as well as patterns of concern. Because current legislation focuses primarily on penalization and victim’s protections, this note argues that the E.
