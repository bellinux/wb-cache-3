5|$|In 1930, Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin named Albertosaurus pericolosus {{based on}} a tooth from China, that {{probably}} belonged to Tarbosaurus. In 1932, Friedrich von Huene <b>renamed</b> Dryptosaurus incrassatus, not considered a nomen dubium by him, to Albertosaurus incrassatus. Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus, in 1970, Russell also <b>renamed</b> Gorgosaurus sternbergi (Matthew & Brown 1922) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis (Gilmore 1946) into Albertosaurus lancensis. The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus, the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. It was <b>renamed</b> Dinotyrannus in 1995, but is now thought to represent a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex. Also in 1988, Paul <b>renamed</b> Alectrosaurus olseni (Gilmore 1933) into Albertosaurus olseni; this has found no general acceptance. In 1989, Gorgosaurus novojilovi (Maleev 1955) was <b>renamed</b> by Bryn Mader and Robert Bradley as Albertosaurus novojilovi; today this {{is seen as a}} synonym of Tarbosaurus.|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to develop a {{theoretically}} based and empirically grounded process framework to understand radical organisational <b>renaming</b> within service industries, particularly Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The specific research aim was to analyse organisational <b>renaming</b> as an option to rebrand and reposition an unhealthy brand image and to identify and define <b>renaming</b> factors and processes that successful radical <b>renaming</b> utilise. The research design was a semistructured, qualitative, multiple-case study format that incorporated open-ended interview questions with 49 stakeholders from three separate institutions and secondary research data from printed documents, web sites and outside media sources. The early literature review for this study supported the premise that <b>renaming</b> is complicated and driven by individual strategic organisational goals that center around eliminating or softening negatives and strengthening or even creating new positives. This research uncovered the brand flux nature that precedes radical <b>renaming</b> and identified the various processes associated with revitalizing, rebranding, repositioning and <b>renaming</b> which resulted in a Brand Flux Model that depicts how the flux nature of branding critically impacts <b>renaming.</b> Additionally, it identified twelve distinct factors that were grouped into a four stage process framework model; this <b>Renaming</b> Process Model describes the importance placed on each impact factor as well as how the order of the factors influence the overall success of a <b>renaming.</b> Strategic placement on the model represents the continuing strategic realignment and co-created nature inherent in <b>renaming</b> within a service industry. A template that highlights the significance of realigning " 8 Principles of Renaming" to the strategic goals of the institution was also developed. The study contributed to the areas of branding, rebranding and repositioning by defining terms and proposing nuanced definitions, including a working definition for radical <b>renaming.</b> It culminated with the development of the Brand Flux model and a proposed <b>Renaming</b> Process Model that tracks <b>renaming</b> in a service environment. This qualitative research format and accompanying models and processes can be used to study <b>renaming</b> in a variety of industries. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
