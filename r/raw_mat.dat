40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{studying}} nutrition African ostriches for different ages in zoos, nurseries and small farms evaluated the nutritional value and balance {{of each of the}} components of plant feed, providing the needs for normal growth of poultry, development and productivity, to increase body weight, to increase egg production, quality hatching eggs, meat quality, output and quality of the young. Currently, in most cases, bird feed by copying the natural food, but it is the species, age and seasonal specifics, ensure that in the conditions of the zoo, nursery and farm problematic. Therefore, to solve this problem, we proposed the formulation of plant feed for feeding African ostriches in a zoo, nurseries and small farms that promote bird health, increase the rate of feeding, increase egg production, increase their survival, as well as the possibility of replacing expensive <b>raw</b> <b>mat</b> erials at cheaper developed using the optimization program "Food Optima Expert". To sustain ostriches exchange energy feed should be not less than 260 kcal / 100 g, protein content not less than 16 %. The complex research to develop formulations of plant feed for African ostriches in a zoo, nurseries and small farms and the quality of their analysis may be of interest in the full feeding African ostriches. The proposed formulation can extend its range of multi-component feed with a sufficiently high biological, energy value, the balanced composition of essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals adapted for ostriches, as well as the possibility of replacing expensive raw materials at lower cost...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of composition on durability of fast-fired <b>mat</b> <b>raw</b> glazes in hydrochloric acid was studied with several different methods. The {{appearance of the}} corroded glazes was classified according to a standardised visual method. The surface composition of the glaze was studied by SEM/EDXA. The crystalline phases in the glaze were identified by XRD. Changes in surface topography on micro-range were observed by AFM, while macro-range related changed were examined by a non-contact optical profiler. The concentration of dissolved ions in the acid solution after the corrosion test was analysed by ICPS. The results indicate that besides chemical composition also phase composition and surface morphology {{should be taken into}} account in corrosion studies of mat glazes. Corrosion of both amorphous and crystalline phases could be detected. The proportion of unreacted raw material in the glaze also strongly affected the corrosion behavior...|$|R
40|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers were {{prepared}} by electrospinning {{and they were}} modified with hydroxylamine to synthesize amidoxime polyacrylonitrile (AOPAN) chelating nanofibers, which were applied to adsorb copper and iron ions. The conversion of the nitrile group in PAN was calculated by the gravimetric method. The structure and surface morphology of the AOPAN nanofiber were characterized by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. The adsorption abilities of Cu 2 + and Fe 3 + ions onto the AOPAN nanofiber mats were evaluated. FT-IR spectra showed nitrile groups in the PAN were partly converted into amidoxime groups. SEM examination demonstrated {{that there were no}} serious cracks or sign of degradation {{on the surface of the}} PAN nanofibers after chemical modification. The adsorption capacities of both copper and iron ions onto the AOPAN nanofiber mats were higher than those into the <b>raw</b> PAN nanofiber <b>mats.</b> The adsorption data of Cu 2 + and Fe 3 + ions fitted particularly well with the Langmuir isotherm. The maximal adsorption capacities of Cu 2 + and Fe 3 + ions were 215. 18 and 221. 37 mg/g, respectively...|$|R
60|$|There {{are various}} methods of cultivation, {{but this was}} the one adopted by Mr. Hardy. The plants grew rapidly, the ground between them being {{occasionally}} hoed, and kept free from weeds. When they were four feet high the tops were nipped off, and any leaves which showed signs of disease were removed. Each stem had from eight to ten leaves. When the leaves began to turn rather yellow, Mr. Hardy announced that the time for cutting had arrived, and one morning all hands were mustered to the work. It consisted merely in cutting the stems at a level with the earth, and laying the plants down gently upon the ground. By breakfast-time the two acres were cleared. They were left all day to dry in the sun, and a little before sunset they were taken up, and carried up to one of the store-sheds, which had been cleared and prepared for the purpose. Here they were placed in a heap on the ground, covered over with <b>raw</b> hides and <b>mats,</b> and left for three days to heat. After this they were uncovered, and hung up on laths from the roof, close to each other, and yet sufficiently far apart to allow the air to circulate between them. Here they remained until they were quite dry, and were then taken down, a damp covering being chosen for the operation, as otherwise the dry leaves would have crumbled to dust. They were again laid in a heap, and covered up to allow them to heat once more, This second heating required some days to accomplish, and this operation required great attention, as the tobacco would have been worthless if the plants had heated too much.|$|R
40|$|What are Bamboo Splits and Slivers? Bamboo splits and slivers are {{longitudinal}} sections of a bamboo pole (culm). Splits are the full {{thickness of the}} culm wall and have the green outer layer still attached. Slivers are thin, narrow sections of bamboo wood. They are the primary materials used for weaving {{a wide range of}} products. On a small scale they may be used for handicraft items and objects of daily use. On a large scale, one of the most useful products they can be woven into are the mats that are used to produce bamboo matboard. How are they produced? Splits and slivers may be produced by hand splitting or mechanical splitting. Hand splitting is suitable for small-scale production and there is a wide range of tools available, both traditional and modern. Automated splitting machines are more suitable for large-scale production of slivers. Fresh bamboo culms are passed through a series of machines that produce splits of successively smaller sizes until the desired size is reached. What is the market for bamboo splits and slivers? The market for bamboo splits is limited, because they are of limited use. However, bamboo slivers are the primary <b>raw</b> material for <b>mat</b> making and the demand for mats is closely related to the demand for matboard. Matboard is a versatile type of plywood and its markets are increasing rapidly. Often the splitting and slivering unit is established with very close linkages to the matboard factories and weaving facilities and weaving staff may be included in the unit. In some instances the splitting and slivering unit may be a subsidiary part of the matboard factory. What is the role of a bamboo splitting and slivering unit in rural development? The unit requires considerable supplies of raw bamboos, the management and harvesting of which increases employment opportunities for farmers and foresters. Establishing new plantations will benefit the environment and substituting bamboo for wood in products will help conserve natural forests. The unit offers employment opportunities for unskilled, semi-skilled and technically trained personnel for its operation and management. A large unit established with mat-weaving facilities included can provide employment for up to 400 people. How do I establish a bamboo splitting and slivering unit? A regular supply of raw bamboos, labour, electricity and an established market for the slivers, or the mats if mat weaving is included in the unit, is required. A large bamboo splitting and slivering unit with a production capacity of 1300 mats, 1. 2 x 2. 4 m per day, can be established for approximately US $ 300, 000. Smaller facilities can be established for considerably less, depending on their size and intended production rates. Bamboo splits and slivers are the primary materials used for weaving a wide range of product...|$|R
