40|$|In a {{distributed}} environment, where a {{large number}} of computers are connected together to enable the largescale sharing of data and computing resources, agents, especially mobile agents, are the tools for autonomously completing tasks on behalf of their owners. For applications of large-scale mobile agents, security and efficiency are of great concern. In this paper, we present a fast binary dispatch model and corresponding secure <b>route</b> <b>structures</b> for mobile agents dispatched in parallel to protect the dispatch routes of agents while ensuring the dispatch efficiency. The fast binary dispatch model is simple but efficient with a dispatch complexity of O(log 2 n). The secure <b>route</b> <b>structures</b> adopt the combination of public-key encryption and digital signature schemes and expose minimal route information to hosts. The nested structure can help detect attacks as early as possible. We evaluated the various models both analytically and empirically...|$|R

Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to Washington Dulles International Airport in Fairfax County, Virginia. In October 1986, American Airlines senior vice president Thomas G. Plaskett became the president and CEO of Continental Airlines. On February 1, 1987, People Express, Frontier, New York Air, and several commuter carriers were merged into Continental Airlines to create the third-largest U.S. airline (and sixth largest airline in the world) and led to Continental became an even larger player in the northeastern markets. However, the overnight merger of multiple airlines led to poor service that caused an initial loss of passengers. In July 1987, Plaskett was dismissed and Lorenzo returned to the position. 1987 saw the creation of Continental's OnePass frequent flier program (jointly with Eastern Airlines); and, in 1988, Continental formed its first strategic partnership (and the first international airline alliance of its kind) with Scandinavian Airlines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well-known}} that route distance estimates {{are influenced by}} the <b>structure</b> of the <b>route.</b> In particular, the number of features along the route (e. g. landmarks) and the <b>structuring</b> of the <b>route</b> into stretches have been shown to influence distance estimates, usually increasing them (feature accumulation, <b>route</b> <b>structuring).</b> However, the two effects have not been related to one another yet. What is the relation between them? We have approached this question from two perspectives. The paper describes a cognitive model of route representation and processes, which produces both effects as the outcomes of task-specific retrieval procedures. It also describes an experiment whose results support the hypothesis that <b>route</b> <b>structuring,</b> if induced by segmentation, is a special case of feature accumulation. We relate the empirical results to the model, show how they support and constrain each other, and outline what further research is needed. ...|$|R

25|$|Bethune became CEO and {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the board of directors in 1996. Continental went from being ranked last in every measurable performance category to winning more J.D. Power and Associates awards for Customer Satisfaction than any other airline in the world. BusinessWeek magazine named Bethune one of the top 25 Global Managers in 1996 and 1997. Under his leadership Continental's stock price rose from $2 to over $50 per share. Fortune named Continental among the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America for six consecutive years. In his final year piloting the airline Fortune magazine ranked Continental 2004's No.1 Most Admired Global Airline, a title it earned again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. While at Continental, Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the <b>route</b> <b>structure,</b> among others. Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-Boeing fleet. After the opening of the new Denver International Airport on February 28, 1995, Continental management decided that the Denver hub – its historic operational base and heart of the system for almost 60 years – would be abruptly reduced to spoke status (with service only to Houston, Newark, and Cleveland).|$|E

[...] The acquisition of National Airlines for $437million further burdened Pan Am's balance sheet, already under strain after financing the Boeing 747s ordered in the mid-1960s. This acquisition did little to improve Pan Am's competitive position in relation to nimbler, lower-cost competitors in a deregulated industry as National's North-South <b>route</b> <b>structure</b> provided insufficient feed at Pan Am's transatlantic and transpacific gateways in New York and Los Angeles.

40|$|We {{calculate}} mutual-best-response route {{networks for}} profit maximizing airlines serving large US air-traffic-hub cities. A simulated annealing algorithm determines which of over ten thousand potential routes receive direct or hub-and-spoke service.

Simulated <b>route</b> <b>structures,</b> airfares, passenger flows, and market concentration levels closely approximate actual US networks comprising over seventy percent of domestic air travel. The results support several controversial positions regarding airline competition. Average airfares by route are consistent with price-taking behavior. Existing industry concentration levels can be justified by cost-reducing economies of scale and scope. Control of multiple airports by individual airlines currently has minimal effects on airfares or passenger flows. Socially optimal <b>route</b> <b>structures</b> would concentrate traffic at fewer and larger airports—but reduce costs only modestly. Airport pricing and capacity can significantly affect network traffic patterns. Investigation of strategic pricing is left for future research.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a {{parallel}} dispatch model with secure <b>route</b> <b>structures</b> for protecting the dispatch route information of mobile agents. This model facilitates efficient dispatching of agents in a hierarchical manner, and ensures route security by exposing minimal route information to hosts. It also provides the capability for detecting attacks. Based on the secure dispatch model, two extensions are further presented. The first integrates parallel dispatch with small-scale serial migration to keep the number of mobile agents manageable while preserving similar dispatch performance. The second is a route robustness enhanced mechanism with substitute routes that allows temporarily unreachable hosts to be bypassed. We evaluated the various models both analytically and empirically, and report our findings here. ...|$|R
