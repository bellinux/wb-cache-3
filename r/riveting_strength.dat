5000|$|While {{structural}} {{blind rivets}} using a locked mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] blind rivets where the reduced, but still predictable, <b>strength</b> of the <b>rivet</b> without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these <b>rivets</b> use <b>rivet</b> <b>strength</b> figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Current {{recommendations}} {{provided by}} the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for load rating of steel truss bridges were shown to be overly conservative in estimating the rivet capacity in shear by researchers from the University of Washington. Many steel truss bridges in place were constructed during the mid 20 th century and require such load rating to determine if retrofitting, tear down, or a live loading limit is necessary. Past research on riveted connections has not included tests on as-built riveted connections, but rather shop fabricated specimens. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of ultimate <b>rivet</b> shear <b>strength</b> in gusset plates and the relation to connection length could improve the current procedure. Experiments on secondary riveted joints with various connection lengths were tested in a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) to determine the average ultimate shear <b>strength</b> of the <b>rivets.</b> The riveted connection was assembled with supporting members to improve capacity and stability and allow for testing of longer connections through shear failure. The test setup used for this investigation placed each rivet under a uniform load. This differed from previous research performed by Fisher and Rumpf (1967) on lap splices. Their loading mechanism caused the average ultimate <b>strength</b> of the <b>rivets</b> to decrease as connection length increases, and therefore a reduction factor was recommended by AASHTO for connections greater than 50 inches. The results of this test program in combination of past research will serve as an upper and lower bound, respectively, for connection behavior. Results showed that the average ultimate <b>rivet</b> shear <b>strength</b> was not a function of connection length under the designed load mechanism. The average ultimate <b>rivet</b> shear <b>strength</b> was larger than the values used in the load rating procedure and past research. The connecting elements deformed prior to failure of the rivets, which {{is a result of}} the rivets being stronger than the nominal values from the time of construction. This suggest that for gusset plate connections loaded in a distributed manner, that a reduction factor for ultimate <b>rivet</b> <b>strength</b> may not be needed, and there is potential that current reduction factors for longer connections could be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Gusset plate {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} to join members in steel truss bridges. Most gusset plate connections were designed to provide sufficient thickness to resist tensile and shear forces as well as compression buckling based on simple approximations. The 2007 collapse of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minnesota necessitated the safety assessment of gusset plates and prompted several studies of gusset plate behavior. The complex geometry and various loading profiles {{make it difficult to}} analyze and estimate maximum stress in gusset plates and its capacity. This research focuses on numerical simulation of steel truss bridge gusset plate connections. A simple but accurate finite element modeling methodology was developed to efficiently simulate gusset plate connection subassemblages. A rapid procedure for assessing gusset plate safety, namely Triage Evaluation Procedure (TEP), was developed to predict the onset of gusset plate yielding. This procedure considers the worst-case scenario for the interaction of stresses generated by connected truss members and conservatively identifies at risk gusset plates. A Refined Evaluation Procedure (REP) was then developed to predict stress distributions at critical sections using simple and idealized approximate stress distribution models. By using these stress distribution models at the critical sections, the location and magnitude of the maximum stress in the gusset plate connections can be estimated. The TEP and REP are two-step evaluation procedures to provide fast and accurate estimate for gusset plate yield capacity. In addition to the gusset plates, rivet shear resistance needs to be considered to evaluate the overall safety of gusset plate connections. <b>Rivet</b> shear <b>strength,</b> <b>rivet</b> ductility, connected member yielding, and the effect of connection length were identified as factors which affect joint strength. The current AASHTO bridge evaluation code does not consider all four factors and yields an overly-conservative estimate of joint shear resistance. A revised equation which considers ``Strong'' and ``Weak" connected elements and produces a more reasonable estimate of joint shear resistance is recommended...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the existing flush rivet inspection criteria and inspection methods to establish a norm for commercial flush riveted joints. Studies were made of thirty-four flush riveted joint load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on Flush <b>Riveted</b> Joint <b>Strength</b> by ARC <b>Rivet</b> and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of rivet diameter joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values. It was concluded from the countersunk rivet data that permanent set based on rivet diameter is a more reasonable yield criterion than permanent set based on an arbitrary constant. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{test data}} {{reported}} herein {{deals with the}} fundamental behavior of several large structural truss-type connections consisting of 1 / 2 -in. gusset plates and 18 -in. I-beams, fabricated with either <b>rivets</b> or high <b>strength</b> steel bolts. Of the three specimens tested, one was fastened with hotdriven rivets while {{the other two were}} bolted. One of the bolted specimens was assembled with hardened beveled washers against the sloping faces of the I-beam flanges to provide parallel bearing faces for the bolts; the other was fastened using only hardened flat washers. A study of the load-slip and load-strain behavior is made for the three specimens and fundamental differences in their behaviors are pointed out. The distribution of stresses across the critical sections in the webs of the members is analyzed for all stages of the tests to determine what portion of the load on each specimen was resisted by the web. This makes it possible to determine the efficiency of the web and the flanges in resisting the loads applied to the members.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{a description of}} slow and rapid load tests of riveted and bolted column-base and beam-to-column connections, and the results which were obtained. Measurements of load, deflection, strain, and acceleration were taken in order to evaluate the resistance characteristics of the connections. The small number of specimens and variety of connection types limited {{the scope of the}} investigation. The tests clearly indicated that the rate of deformation had an effe~t on the resistance of the connection; rapidly deformed specimens had a greater resistance at a given deflection than those tested slowly. In these tests, the type of fastener, <b>rivet</b> or high <b>strength</b> bolt, had little effect on the moment-rotation characteristics of the connections studied. With respect to the evaluation of specific moment resistance characteristics of connections subjected to rapid loading, this limited pilot study served only to indicate the nature of the resistance function which could be expected for connections of the type te s ted. Also presented in this report is a procedure for evaluating the resistance of a frame with semi-rigid connections as it is loaded into the inelastic range. The method of analysis is such that the resistance characteristics of the connection, {{as well as that of}} the members, are taken into consideration. The method is of particular interest from the research standpoint since strain hardening is included. Research Directorate, Air Force Special Weapons Center. Kirtland Air Force Base.

40|$|Riveted lap joints {{are being}} used {{traditionally}} for long in the aerospace industry. These joints are the crucial zones that are designed under damage tolerance procedures in the civil aircraft industry. Conventional design procedures of riveted lap joints {{are based on the}} assumption that all rivets carry equal load. As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static <b>strength</b> of the <b>riveted</b> joint as well. Hence, in the present study, <b>riveted</b> joint’s static <b>strength</b> experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) riveted lap joints with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the riveted lap joints sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure load. All these riveted lap joints are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the rivet yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the lap joint. The analysis of riveted lap joints shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the rivets in the elastic regime, once the rivets start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the rivets and the load sharing between the rivets is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the rivets share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of riveted joints. To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and rivets tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Damages of {{metallic}} aircraft {{structures that}} occur during manufacturing, assembly and in service require local repair. Especially with current service-life extensions of ageing aircraft fleets, {{the importance of}} such repair methods is increasing. Typically, the repair of smaller damages on aluminium fuselage or wing skins is done by riveting a patch onto the flawed structure. However, the use of <b>rivets</b> reduces the <b>strength</b> of the structure and promotes fatigue. Joining the patch by adhesive bonding would not only offer more homogenous load distribution and weight savings, but even an increase of structural integrity. Metal adhesive bonding is commonly used in aeronautics, but requires elaborated surface treatments of the adherends, employing hazardous chemicals like chromates, due to the high durability demands. Furthermore, these treatments are usually tank processes that are not suitable for local repairs. Hence, {{there is a strong}} need for locally applicable surface preparation methods that allow safe and reliable adhesive bonding of primary aircraft structures. / The aim of this thesis is to assess the – still emerging – method of atmospheric pressure plasma deposition of silicon (Si) containing compounds concerning its suitability as surface preparation for adhesive bonding of aluminium aerostructures. Atmospheric plasma deposition is not yet used in the aircraft industry, and the knowledge on functionality of this technology concerning bonding of aluminium parts is limited. / Moreover, the durability requirements of the aircraft industry greatly exceed the standards in other industries. Hence, special attention is paid to a thorough analysis of the key characteristics of the deposited coupling films and their effectiveness in terms of adhesion promotion as well as joint durability under particularly hostile conditions. In order to do so, the altering mechanisms of the treated joints and the behaviour of the coupling films during accelerated ageing will be investigated in detail {{for the first time in}} this thesis. Furthermore, the influence of the aluminium surface pre-treatment (i. e. topography and oxide properties of the substrate) on the overall joint performance after coupling film deposition is thoroughly examined. Based on these findings, the surface preparation is optimised, and a process is developed to achieve maximal joint performance. / As alternative local surface treatments prior to adhesive bonding, solution derived deposition of silane and sol-gel films have already been widely investigated and can be considered as reference, even though these techniques are rarely used in civil aeronautics. The knowledge on their effectiveness and capabilities in corrosive atmosphere is still very limited. Therefore, all analyses of degradation mechanisms are conducted for both plasma deposition and wet-chemical reference treatments to reveal the differences and communalities of the two Si-based coupling films. Physical and chemical analysis of the films, the oxides and the interfaces reveal differing, but interdependent failure mechanisms that are inhibited differently by the individual coupling films. / Using the optimum deposition parameters, plasma films of only several nanometres in thickness significantly enlarge the corrosion resistance of bonded joints, reaching almost the level of anodising treatments with several micrometres thick oxides and strongly outperforming solution derived silane treatments. However, plasma film performance is found to be largely dependent on the precursor selection. With plasma deposition of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, which has not been reported before, highest joint stability is achieved. Moreover, it is discovered that the properties of plasma and solution derived silane based films are complementary. It is shown that an optimised combined plasma and wet-chemical treatment process provides even superior resistance to bondline corrosion than state-of-the-art anodising techniques...|$|R
