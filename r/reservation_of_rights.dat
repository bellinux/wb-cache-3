50|$|A <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> by a {{liability}} insurance company {{is an expression}} of the insurer’s agreement to defend its policyholder with the limiting condition that it does not waive any right to later deny coverage under the terms of insurance contract.http://www.DutytoDefend.com A <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> permits an insurer to fulfill its broad duty to defend while avoiding waiver, estoppel, or forfeiture of rights or being bound by a judgment entered against its policyholder and serves to warn the policyholder to take steps to protect oneself from the reserving insurer. An insurer that reserves its rights may recover reimbursement from its own policyholder certain sums spent for the costs of defense and the costs of settlement. A right that does not already exist may not be created by reserving it. A valid <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> does not require the policyholder’s consent.|$|E

This doctrine, also known as the Winters doctrine because it originated in Winters v.

In substance, the doctrine means that when water is needed to accomplish the purpose <b>of</b> a <b>reservation,</b> the federal government can take without compensation whatever amount of unappropriated water existed on the date the reservation was established. Cappaert involved an attempt by the Supreme Court to clarify the issues and questions that have arisen from the implied <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> water <b>rights</b> doctrine...|$|R

50|$|An insurer’s <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> is an {{important}} legal step, particularly {{in the context of}} liability insurance. The insurer may provide a defense to the insured, seemingly protecting the insured from the serious liabilities that may result from a civil suit. The liability insurer is alerting the insured defendant that insurance may ultimately not cover the resulting liability, or a portion of the liability.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the insurer}} chooses to defend, it may either defend the claim {{with its own}} {{in-house}} lawyers (where allowed), or give the claim to an outside law firm on a [...] "panel" [...] of preferred firms which have negotiated a standard fee schedule with the insurer {{in exchange for a}} regular flow of work. The decision to defend under a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> must be undertaken with extreme caution in jurisdictions where the insured has a right to independent counsel, also known as Cumis counsel.|$|E
5000|$|The Cumis {{decision}} {{changed that}} practice significantly. Now, in California {{and several other}} states, an insurer faced with a new tender has three options: (1) deny the tender completely and either risk an immediate bad faith lawsuit by the insured or having to sue the insured first to obtain a judicial declaration of no coverage (a [...] "race to the courthouse"); (2) accept the tender without a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and thereby commit to defending the insured to a final judgment (unless the policy is expressly designed so that defense costs [...] "eat away" [...] at policy limits); or (3) accept the tender but issue a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> letter, which may cause the insured to promptly exercise his or her right to Cumis counsel if a potential conflict of interest is already clear enough {{at that point in}} time under the known facts or allegations and the insurer's letter expressly reserves the right to withdraw from the insured's defense and deny indemnity for that reason. In turn, the third option jacks up the insurer's costs because the insurer now has to pay for independent counsel and counsel of its own to monitor the case at arm's length (so that privileged information never reaches the insurer).|$|E

5000|$|Students are {{protected}} from deviation from information advertised {{in the following}} documents: registration materials, manuals, course catalogues, bulletins, circulars, regulations, Ross v. Creighton University class syllabi, student codes, and handbooks. These documents may be binding implied-n-fact contracts. Goodman v. President and Trustees of Bowdoin College (2001) ruled that institutional documents are still contractual regardless {{if they have a}} disclaimer. This decision found that [...] "even though the college had reserved the right to change the student handbook unilaterally and without notice, this <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> did not defeat the contractual nature of the student handbook." ...|$|E

[...] Douglas, in his concurring opinion in the companion case, Doe, stated more emphatically, [...] "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights." ...|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{the insurer}} can decline to defend and also refrain from seeking declaratory judgment. If the insurer is {{absolutely}} certain {{that there is no}} coverage or no potential for coverage, then in most jurisdictions the insurer adequately preserves its defenses to coverage by sending a letter to the insured explaining its position and declining to provide a defense. But this option can be very risky, because if a court later determines that there was a duty to defend all along, then it will hold that the insurer necessarily breached that duty, and may also hold that the insurer is subject to tort liability for bad faith. So insurers will often defend under a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> rather than decline coverage altogether.|$|E

50|$|After {{a number}} of {{pioneering}} insurance bad faith cases in the 1950s and 1960s, it became common for U.S. insurers to reflexively issue <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> letters in response to practically every tender of a third party claim by an insured. Under those earlier cases, it was held that if an insurer withdrew a defense after failing to reserve their rights, they could be (and were actually often held to be) liable for all damages suffered by the insured, including damages {{in excess of the}} policy's limits of coverage. Therefore, insurers wanted to always reserve their right to withdraw if facts were later discovered precluding coverage (e.g., evidence that the insured was guilty of an intentional tort, which is uninsurable).|$|E
5000|$|The insurer {{can also}} seek a declaratory {{judgment}} against the insured {{that there is}} no coverage for the claim, or at least no potential for coverage. This option generally allows the insurer to insulate itself from a bad faith claim, in the sense that an insurer acts in good faith when it promptly brings coverage disputes to the attention of a court, even though it also places the insured in the awkward position of defending itself against two lawsuits: the plaintiff's original complaint and the insurer's complaint for declaratory judgment. Indeed, in some jurisdictions an insurer acting in good faith must seek declaratory relief from a court before declining to defend its insured (e.g., Illinois) or withdrawing from its defense pursuant to an earlier <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> (e.g., Georgia).|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of the second option is that by assuming complete responsibility {{for the defense of}} its insured, the insurer has more control over defense costs. Most insurers operate so-called [...] "captive" [...] law firms (carefully designed to avoid the ban on the corporate practice of law) and also maintain [...] "panels" [...] of preferred defense law firms who agree to carefully negotiated rate structures. In contrast, because independent counsel is separate from the insurer, their billing rates will be somewhat higher since they merely must bill the [...] "reasonable" [...] rate for their defense services. But if the insurer accepts the defense without a <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> it must defend completely and loses the right to recover the cost of defense from the insured even if it later discovers that the entire claim was uninsurable to begin with.|$|E
