25|$|For example, in a {{multiple}} addition of ethyl bromide to benzene, ortho and para substitution is expected {{after the first}} monosubstitution step because an alkyl group is an activating group. However, the actual <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> is 1,3,5-triethylbenzene with all alkyl groups as a meta substituent. Thermodynamic reaction control makes sure that thermodynamically favored meta substitution with steric hindrance minimized takes prevalence over less favorable ortho and para substitution by chemical equilibration. The ultimate <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> is thus {{the result of a}} series of alkylations and dealkylations.|$|E

25|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} exist demonstrating how {{in certain}} autocatalytic reaction systems {{the presence of}} a small amount of <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> with enantiomeric excess {{at the start of the}} reaction can result in a much larger enantiomeric excess at the end of the reaction. In the Soai reaction, pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Scheme 1) is alkylated by diisopropylzinc to the corresponding pyrimidyl alcohol. Because the initial <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> is also an effective catalyst the reaction is autocatalytic. The presence of just 0.2 equivalent of the alcohol S-enantiomer at the start of the reaction is sufficient to amplify the enantiomeric excess to 93%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{photooxidation}} of methacrolein was stud-ied in the {{aqueous phase}} under simulated cloud droplet conditions. The obtained rate constant of OH-oxidation of methacrolein at 6 ◦C in unbuffered solutions was 5. 8 (± 0. 9) × 109 M− 1 s− 1. The measured rate coefficient {{is consistent with}} OH-addition on the C=C bond. This was confirmed by the mechanism established {{on the study of}} the <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> (at 25 ◦C in unbuffered solutions) where methylglyoxal, formaldehyde, hydroxyacetone and acetic acid/acetate were the main <b>reaction</b> <b>products.</b> An upper limit for the total carbon yield was estimated to range from 53 to 85 %, indicating that some <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> remain uniden-tified.

40|$|Carbonation {{resistance}} of concrete is usually tested under accelerated conditions, i. e. by elevating the CO 2 concentration compared to natural conditions {{and keeping the}} RH close to 60 %.

Using SEM-EDS we investigated the composition of the <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> of carbonated and non-carbonated concrete containing 0, 18 and 30 % fly ash exposed to three different carbonation conditions.

50|$|The {{properties}} of hardened blended cements are {{strongly related to}} the development of the binder microstructure, i.e., to the distribution, type, shape and dimensions of both <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> and pores. The beneficial effects of pozzolan addition in terms of higher compressive strength, performance and greater durability are mostly attributed to the pozzolanic reaction in which calcium hydroxide is consumed to produce additional C-S-H and C-A-H <b>reaction</b> <b>products.</b> These pozzolanic <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> fill in pores and result in a refining of the pore size distribution or pore structure. This results in a lowered permeability of the binder.|$|R

25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{also requires}} a base, but there the {{attack of the}} base {{and the elimination of}} the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the SN2-substitution.|$|E
25|$|GTP {{inhibits}} enzyme turnover over a {{wide range}} of conditions by increasing the affinity of GLUD1 for the <b>reaction</b> <b>product,</b> making product release rate limiting under all conditions in the presence of GTP.

A cheaper but less sensitive approach utilizes a 4-chloronaphthol stain with 1% hydrogen peroxide; the reaction of peroxide radicals with 4-chloronaphthol produces a dark purple stain that can be photographed without using specialized photographic film.|$|E
25|$|A {{catalyst}} is {{a substance}} that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but remains chemically unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases {{the rate of the}} reaction by providing a different reaction mechanism to occur with a lower activation energy. In autocatalysis a <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> is itself a catalyst for that reaction leading to positive feedback. Proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Michaelis–Menten kinetics describe the rate of enzyme mediated reactions. A catalyst does not affect the position of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward reactions equally.|$|E
25|$|The MRE {{has been}} in continual {{development}} since its introduction. In 1990, a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH), a water-activated exothermic <b>reaction</b> <b>product</b> that emits heat, allowed a service member {{in the field to}} enjoy a hot meal. In an array of field tests and surveys, service members requested more entrée options and larger serving sizes. By 1994, commercial-like graphics (images) were added to make the packets more user-friendly and appealing, while biodegradable materials were introduced for inedible components, such as spoons and napkins. The number of entrées expanded to 16 by 1996 (including vegetarian options), 20 entrées by 1997 and 24 entrées by 1998. Today, service members can choose from up to 24 entrées, and more than 150 additional items. The variety allowed service members from various cultures and geographical regions to find something palatable.|$|E
30|$|One big {{challenge}} in this technique currently {{lies in the}} extension neutral to <b>reaction</b> <b>products.</b> The Penning ionisation studies performed to date benefitted from the simple and efficient detection of ions which means that even low numbers of <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> can be monitored very efficiently. The detection of neutral <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> requires an additional step, where the neutral is either ionized by REMPI or excited to be detected by Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Both of these processes have a limited total efficiency. Given {{that the number of}} <b>reaction</b> <b>products</b> produced at every experimental cycle is low already (single digits in certain cases of the systems studied here), both REMPI and LIF are not realistic. The solution will be to either develop new, ultra sensitive detection methods that enable the counting basically of single molecules, or do substantially increase the densities and thus the observed reaction rates.|$|R
