The Northern Ireland Family Expenditure Survey (NIFES) was conducted in Northern Ireland from 1967 - 1998, and was the counterpart to the Family Expenditure Survey (FES), which was conducted annually in Great Britain from 1957 - 2001 (see under GN 33057). The FES/NIFES provided reliable data on expenditure and income in relation to household characteristics. The results of the survey show how expenditure patterns {{of different kinds of}} households vary, {{and the extent to which}} individual members of a household contribute to the household income. Although originally commissioned to provide expenditure details for the calculation of weights for the Retail Price Index, the FES/NIFES collected much additional information was also collected on the characteristics of co-operating households and the incomes of their members. It thus became a multi-purpose survey, and provided a unique fund of important economic and social data. From 1968 the Great Britain FES incorporated a sample drawn from the NIFES to become the UK FES. The FES was replaced in 2001 by a new survey series, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) (see under GN 33334), covering the whole of the UK. The EFS is an amalgamation of the previous National Food Survey (NFS) (see under GN 33071) and UK FES. Main Topics : Household Schedule: This schedule was taken at the main interview. Information for most of the questions was obtained from the head of household or housewife, but certain questions of a more individual character were put to every spender aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards). Until the introduction of the community charge, information on rateable value and rate poundage was obtained from the appropriate local authority, as was information on whether the address was within a smokeless zone. Information was collected about the household, the sex and age of each member, and also details about the type and size of the household accommodation. The main part of the questionnaire related to expenditure both of a household and individual nature, but the questions were mainly confined to expenses of a recurring nature, e. g. : Household: housing costs, payment to Gas and Electricity Boards and companies, telephone charges, licences and television rental Individual: motor vehicles, season tickets for transport, life and accident insurances, payments through a bank, instalments, <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> by employer, expenditure claimed by self-employed persons as business expenses for tax purposes, welfare foods, education grants and fees Income Schedule: Data were collected for each household spender. Apart from page 1, the schedule was concerned with income, National Insurance contributions and income tax. Income of a child not classed as a spender was obtained from one or other of his parents and entered on the parent's questionnaire. Information collected included: employment status and recent absences from work, earnings of an employee, self-employed earnings, National Insurance contributions, pensions and other regular allowances, occasional benefits - social security benefits and other types, investment income, miscellaneous earnings of a 'once-only' character, tax paid directly to Inland Revenue or refunded, income of a child. Diary Records Each diary covered fourteen days. Each household member aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards) was asked to record all expenditure made during the 14 days. The NIFES was identical to the UK FES and therefore used the same questionnaires and documentation. However, starting in 1988, a voluntary question on religious denomination was asked of those aged 16 and over in Northern Ireland. <br...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES), which closed in 2001, was a continuous survey with an annual sample of around 10, 000 households. They provided information on household and personal incomes, certain payments that recurred regularly (e. g. rent, gas and electricity bills, telephone accounts, insurances, season tickets and hire purchase payments), and maintained a detailed expenditure record for 14 consecutive days. The original purpose of the FES was to provide information on spending patterns for the United Kingdom Retail Price Index (RPI). The survey was a cost-efficient way of collecting a variety of related data that the government departments required to correlate with income and expenditure at the household, tax unit and person levels. The annual FES began in 1957 (with an earlier large scale survey conducted in 1953 / 54) {{and was one of}} the first Department of Employment (DE) systems to be computerised in the early 1960 s. The UKDA holds FES data from 1961 - 2001. The Northern Ireland Family Expenditure Survey (NIFES), which ran from 1967 - 1998, was identical to the UK FES and therefore used the same questionnaires and documentation. However, starting in 1988, a voluntary question on religious denomination was asked of those aged 16 and over in Northern Ireland. The UKDA holds NIFES data from 1968 - 1998, under GN 33240. Significant FES developments over time include: 1968 : the survey was extended to include a sample drawn from the Northern Ireland FES and a new computer system was introduced which was used until 1985 1986 : DE and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) converted the FES into a new database system using the SIR package 1989 : the Central Statistical Office (CSO) took over responsibility for the survey 1994 : in April, computerised personal interviewing was introduced using lap-top computers, the database system changed to INGRES and the survey changed from a calendar year to financial year basis 1996 : in April, OPCS and CSO were amalgamated into the Office for National Statistics (ONS), who assumed responsibility for the FES 1998 : from April onwards information from expenditure diaries kept by children aged 7 to 15 was included in data, and grossing factors were made available on the database From 2001, the both the FES and the National Food Survey (NFS) (held at the UKDA under GN 33071) were completely replaced by a new survey, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS). Prior to the advent of the EFS, there had previously been considerable overlap between the FES and NFS, with both surveys asking respondents to keep a diary of expenditure. Thus, the 2000 - 2001 FES was the final one in the series. The design of the new EFS was based on the previous FES; further background to its development may be found in the 1999 - 2000 and 2000 - 2001 Family Spending reports. From 2008, the EFS became the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) (see under GN 33334). Main Topics : Household Schedule: This schedule was taken at the main interview. Information for most of the questions was obtained from the head of household or housewife, but certain questions of a more individual character were put to every spender aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards).

Diary Records: The diary covered fourteen days. Each household member aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards) was asked to record all expenditure made during the 14 days. Children aged between 7 and 15 were also asked to complete simplified diaries of their daily expenditure. Data from the children's diaries was included in the survey results for the first time in 1998 - 99. <br...|$|E

[...] During the 1830s, he befriended Kiselyov's aide, Karneev, who was passionate about coin collecting. Vulpea fed this hobby by providing the Russian with coins dug up at Caracal and elsewhere, which Karneev transported to his museum in Saint Petersburg. Meanwhile, however, Vulpea continued his marginal contribution to the nationalist project when, as Logothete, he donated [...] "a years' worth" [...] of estates' socage to Câmpineanu's Philharmonic Society, and allegedly wanted to have Wallachia ruled by a foreign prince, as a guarantee against Russian and Ottoman interference. He also continued to have fights with the other boyars, especially so in 1835, when he asked treasurers Câmpineanu and Iancu Filipescu-Buzatu for a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> his alleged <b>expenses</b> and damages incurred in 1821, which he claimed ran at 287,000 thaler.|$|R

King Edward replied, cordially approving of the enterprise. He also promised to send on the prince's brother John, with a body of troops to accompany the expedition. This John was the one who has already been mentioned as born in Ghent, and who was called, on that account, John of Gaunt. He was also Duke of Lancaster, and is often designated by that name.
