5|$|A {{tradition}} {{going back}} at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon, a ferryman. This is regarded as unhistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> a non-biographical poem. The legend may have resulted in part from a desire to assert Sappho as heterosexual.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> story meetings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{occurrence}} of identifiers and <b>references</b> <b>in</b> computer languages {{is a common}} issue. The same applies for domain specific languages, whose popularity is increasing {{and there is a}} need for aid in their design process. This paper analyses the problem of identifiers and <b>references</b> <b>in</b> computer languages. Current methods use an imperative approach for supporting <b>references</b> <b>in</b> languages; therefore a language designer is required to manually write reference resolving. The method proposed in this paper perceives references and identifiers as language patterns, which can be specified in a declarative manner with much less knowledge about the problem of resolving <b>references</b> <b>in</b> computer languages.

5|$|He claimed three Spitfires in two {{missions}} for {{his final}} victories (victories 171–173) on 26 August. His victims most likely belonged to 421 and 341 Squadron RAF. Between 24 May and 28 August 1944, Lang had claimed 29 aerial victories on the Western Front, including nine P-51 Mustangs. On 6 June 1944, his group {{was the first}} to reach 100 aerial victories over Normandy, earning him and his group a second and final <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the Wehrmachtbericht on 30 August.|$|E
5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another <b>reference.</b> <b>In</b> act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett {{notes the}} irony of the surf music <b>reference.</b> <b>In</b> 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, who claimed to have met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E

5|$|Only {{later did}} Pflanz {{find out that}} it was Wick he saw bailing out. Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the Seenotdienst (air-sea rescue) service, escorted by fighters of JG2, {{continued}} in vain to search for him. He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E
5|$|The Carpathian Basin was {{controlled}} from the 560s by the Avars, a Turkic-speaking people.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French anges à cheval, and {{there appears to be}} no {{significance}} in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to France Wick was {{promoted}} to Hauptmann and on 9 September was named Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of I. Gruppe JG2. During September he continued adding to his score, and on 5 October gained his 41st combat victory {{on his way to}} overtake his two closest rivals, Major Adolf Galland and Oberstleutnant Mölders. The 41st victory earned him his second <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the Wehrmachtbericht on 6 October 1940. He also became the fourth member of the armed forces to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves directly from Hitler at Berghof in Bavaria on 8 September 1940.|$|E

5|$|A single <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> {{the tomb}} of Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet {{indicates}} another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain {{against the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in mid-1940, Wick rose quickly in rank and in profile, {{both in the}} battle zone and as a public figure back in Germany. On 21 July 1940, the just {{promoted}} Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) also became leader of 3. Staffel, succeeding Major Henning Stümpell. Although the fighting in the air grew increasingly difficult, Wick kept adding victories to his tally. He recorded his 20th victory on 24 August and added two more fighters a day later. This achievement earned Wick a <b>reference</b> <b>in</b> the Wehrmachtbericht (his first of five in total), a bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht. Twenty aerial victories also made Wick eligible for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, a higher grade of the Iron Cross. Wick was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 August 1940 at Karinhall by Reichsmarschall (Empire's Marshal) Hermann Göring. He was also interviewed by an Adler (Eagle—the Luftwaffe weekly magazine) journalist prior to the presentation. Several articles about Wick appeared at the time. Wick was granted four days of leave, which he spent with his family in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Five Finger Death Punch, often {{shortened}} to Death Punch and abbreviated as 5FDP or FFDP, is an American {{heavy metal}} band from Las Vegas, Nevada.

The band originally consisted of vocalist Ivan Moody, guitarist Zoltan Bathory, guitarist Caleb Andrew Bingham, bassist Matt Snell, and drummer Jeremy Spencer. Bingham was replaced by guitarist Darrell Roberts in 2006, who was then replaced by Jason Hook in 2009.
