50|$|The <b>{{recording}}</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the Experimental Talking Clock {{is a part}} of {{the recording}} device itself and cannot be easily changed. Seeking to create a more durable recording, Lambert chose to experiment with a cylinder made of lead rather than the more common practice of recording onto a wrapping of tin foil. Lasting 1 minute 40 seconds, the hand-cranked recording features an assortment of peculiar sounds, from Lambert calling out the hours of the day to indistinct speech and what may be chimes or bells. Portions of the recording sound in reverse, which raises the possibility that the phonograph may have been cranked counter-clockwise during certain points of recording.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{characterizes the}} flow {{behavior}} of a Hydraforce SP 08 - 47 CL valve given a specific pulse-width modulation (pwm) duty cycle. With a description of valve behavior, a feed-forward term can be implemented in the positional control loop of a hydraulically actuated robotic prototype. In order to isolate valve behavior, a test bed apparatus consisting of three separate hydraulic cylinders was constructed to decouple joint movement, and multiple tests were conducted, <b>recording</b> <b>cylinder</b> velocities given a constant pwm signal at a system pressure of 3. 45 MPa. After theoretically justifying the empirical results, a quadratic and bi-linear curve fit to the data provided a practical solution to an otherwise computationally expensive problem. by Abby Carey.

40|$|Changing {{the angular}} {{separation}} between two visual stimuli {{attached to the}} wall of a <b>recording</b> <b>cylinder</b> causes the firing fields of place cells to move relative to each other, as though the representation of the floor undergoes a topological distortion. The displacement of the firing field center of each cell is a vector whose length is equal to the linear displacement and whose angle indicates the direction that the field center moves in the environment. Based on the observation that neighboring fields move in similar ways, whereas widely separated fields tend to move relative to each other, we develop an empirical vector-field model that accounts for the stated effects of changing the card separation. We then go on to show that the same vector-field equation predicts additional aspects of the experimental results. In one example, we demonstrate that place cell firing fields undergo distortions of shape after the card separation is changed, as though different parts of the same field are affected by the stimulus constellation in the same fashion as fields at different locations. We conclude that the vector-field formalism reflects the organization of the place-cell representation of the environment for the current case, and through suitable modification may be very useful for describing motions of firing patterns induced by a wide variety of stimulus manipulations...|$|E

All aspects of the experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute, and were in compliance with regulations established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care We recorded from well-isolated single neurons in area MT. Single waveforms were sorted online and then re-sorted offline, using spike-sorting software (Plexon, Inc). Area MT was identified based on anatomical MRI scans, the prevalence of direction-selective neurons, and on the correlation between receptive field size and eccentricity. We recorded from neurons with receptive fields centered at a mean eccentricity of 12. 1 o (s. d. 4. 1 º). The eccentricities for the surround-suppressed neurons were 11. 7 o (s. d. 4. 5 º), while those for the non-suppressed neurons were 12. 4 o (s. d. 3. 8 º).

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{was constructed}} to investigate what effects could be generated in an HCCI engine by altering {{the properties of}} the engine?s intake charge. The principle changes investigated were altering the spatial distribution of the fuel in the intake and adding thermal gradients to the charge. The primary goal of the work was to develop a method to separate the effects of the spatial stratification of the charge from the effects of the thermal gradients in the charge and to study both independently. The laboratory included faculties for measuring the exhaust emissions, <b>recording</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, and monitoring and controlling the many engine inlet and outlet parameters. Auto-ignition state was achieved by externally adding thermal energy to the intake charge utilizing heaters wrapped around the intake piping, this allowed us to generate an intake charge with a very uniform temperature distribution unlike an engine that uses exhaust rebreathing or recompression strategies. Intake temperatures in excess of 350 �C were achievable in this laboratory. Two fueling systems were developed for this work. One was located over two meters away from the inlet to enable thorough mixing and a homogeneous mixture. The other utilized the traditional fueling port to introduce a concentrated shot of fuel and keep it separated from the air as long as possible in order to minimize mixing. In order to separate the thermal and the spatial effects the fuel was heated up to the same temperature as the bulk of the inlet air. The goal was to ensure that the charge in the cylinder started the compression process with a known and controlled temperature. The level of stratification was controlled by manipulating the timing of the injection of the fuel. The results of these experiments validated the experimental setup and confirmed that consistent and repeatable results could be obtained. A series of experiments performed with spatial stratification of the fuel, as well as thermal stratification in the charge, showed that increasing thermal stratification shifted the window of acceptable intake temperatures, over which combustion could be achieved, to higher temperatures. The engine also emitted higher levels of NOx and CO as the stratification increased, but all other indicators were constant when reviewed {{as a function of the}} combustion efficiency. In this setup the premixed fueling system had the lowest window of intake air temperatures and generated the lowest pollutant emissions. A set of experiments conducted with only stratification of the fuel showed that the engine operated over the same set of intake air temperatures for both fueling methods and for all injection timings investigated. In these experiments the engine still emitted higher amounts of NOx and CO compared to the premixed system, but these emissions were lower in this setup than they were in the setup that also introduced thermal stratification. The spatial stratification did not alter the engine?s behavior, in terms of cylinder pressure. Over a range of speeds, air/fuel ratios, and fueling rates the effects of fuel stratification, generated in the intake system, only caused slight increases in the emissions of NOx and CO. While empirical evidence leads to the conclusion that stratification of the fuel does exist inside the cylinder, the results do not provide any evidence as to what level of stratification is actually generated. However, an optically accessible engine has been constructed and installed in the laboratory and will be used, in the near future, to quantify the level of stratification generated...|$|E
