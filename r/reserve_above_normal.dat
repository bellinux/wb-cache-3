40|$|Little {{information}} is available on how desert plant communities that are dominated by perennial species respond to <b>normal</b> and <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> precipitation following prolonged drought. Intuitively, one would expect total canopy cover to increase. Whether a concomitant increase in the density of perennial species also occurs is unknown. Even less is known about how individual species respond to <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> precipitation following drought. From 1987 through 1991 a prolonged drought occurred {{in much of the}} western United States, including the northern Mojave Desert. In March 1991 the northern Mojave Desert received well <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> precipitation. The following two winters (December [...] March) also had <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> precipitation (150 to 200 % of normal, unpublished data). Ongoing vegetation characterization studies by the US Department of Energy (DOE) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, allowed EG&G Energy Measurements to collect data {{that could be used to}} infer how both vegetation associations and individual species respond to <b>above</b> <b>normal</b> precipitation following prolonged drought.
