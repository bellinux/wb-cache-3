[...] Bolshevism and Sadoul's candidacy also alienated moderate leftists from the Young Republic League, who joined efforts with the mainstream conservatives of the National Bloc. As a result, the Bloc came first across the country—Sadoul himself won some 41,300 votes, short of the threshold. The news was welcomed in Europe's right-wing circles: the <b>Romanian</b> <b>D.</b> Nanu noted the socialists' [...] "brazenness" [...] in putting up [...] "the traitor Sadoul"; the results, he argued, showed that [...] "the fatherland ideal" [...] prevailed over the Comintern.|$|R

The study will focus on four political alliances, namely: CDR (the <b>Romanian</b> Democratic Convention), <b>D.</b> A. (Y. E.

5000|$|Inochentism was {{described}} by various outside witnesses as appealing only to ignorant and superstitious masses. Dr. V. S. Yakovenko described its adherents as afflicted by [...] "abuse of liquor and poor food", [...] "spiritual darkness", and a [...] "low level of intellectual and moral development", arguing that this degeneration was favored by anti-Moldavian education policies in the Bessarabia Governorate, before 1917. Yakovenko adds: [...] "In their ignorance Inochentists are very credulous, and take as gospel all they hear, and particularly what comes to them from the church and in their own language." [...] A similar point was made later by Bessarabian historian Nicolae Popovschi, who mentioned some positive aspects of the movement, while also attributing its success to Bessarabian underdevelopment. However, according to <b>Romanian</b> theologian Laurențiu <b>D.</b> Tănase, the ideological source of Inochentism {{is to be found}} in the 17th-century Raskol phenomenon, which split Russian Orthodoxy and had a number of ramifications in Romania. Tănase lists Inochentism together with Lipovan Orthodoxy, the Dukhobortsy, the Molokany, the Skoptsy, the Popovtsy and the Bezpopovtsy.|$|R

5000|$|Călugăru {{regularly}} published two {{or three}} articles per Cuvântul issue. He preserved his editorial position up to 1934, when the newspaper was abruptly banned {{by the government of}} King Carol II for offering support to the violent fascist movement known as the Iron Guard. One of his contributions for the newspaper was the theatrical column, when he filled in for the regular reviewer, Alexandru Kirițescu. This assignment made Călugăru a main protagonist of a 1929 scandal. It was sparked by his highly critical and sarcastic reception of Rodia de aur ("The Golden Pomegranate"), the play co-written by Păstorel Teodoreanu and Adrian Maniu, and culminated with reports that Teodoreanu took revenge by seeking out and physically assaulting Călugăru at his Cuvântul desk. Călugăru later filed a legal complaint against his alleged aggressor, claiming that Păstorel had also made death threats against him. According to writer Vlaicu Bârna, who places the [...] "embarrassing scene" [...] in relation to another one of Păstorel's works, Teodoreanu was proud of assaulting his reviewer, whom he called an [...] "ass". In 1932, Călugăru also played a part in the major cultural debate surrounding literature, censorship and pornography, voicing his opinions on the first <b>Romanian</b> edition of <b>D.</b> H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Adopting the presupposition that religious authority is a relational category, both its nature and forms of expression are explored {{within the context of}} the specific goal of the ecclesial community as defined by the Orthodox paradigm of revelation-communion-deification. Accordingly, the role of authority in Orthodoxy is to enable the people of God and the entire creation to grow towards eschatological self-realization, that is, theosis. The key to understanding authority from a relational perspective is the concept of 'space', which provides for both freedom and relatedness between the elements involved. However, since the concept of space is a dynamic category due to its organic link with concrete historical communities, it follows that every community is challenged by both internal and external factors to re-evaluate its approach to the question of authority. Such a process has taken place within the Romanian Orthodox Church during the twentieth century. More precisely, four events have influenced the Romanian Church's view of authority: the translation of Scripture into modern <b>Romanian</b> by Fr. <b>D.</b> Comilescu; the tension between Scripture and Tradition emphasized in the work of Fr. T. Popescu; the emergence of the 'Lord's Army', a renewal movement founded by Fr. I. Trifa; and, finally, the encounter between the Church and dictatorial Nazi and Communist regimes. The thesis falls into four major sections in an investigation of the impact of these events on the Orthodox approach to the question of authority of : (a) Scripture, from the perspective of the space between episteme and praxis; (b) Tradition, from the perspective of the space between the Apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions; (c) the Church, from the perspective of the space between both the 'Head' and the 'Body', and the 'Spirit' and the 'Institution'; and finally, (d) the Church and the State, from the perspective of the space between history and eschata. The mode in which such a 'space' is conceived in each set of relations leads to the development of either specific or general authority, that is, to either an oppressive or an enabling authority.
