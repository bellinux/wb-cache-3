50|$|As {{part of a}} March, 2015 pilot program, The City {{collected}} approximately 10,000 old computers {{from all}} city departments to jump start the OurCycle LA program. Of those, approximately 3,000 computers were determined to be <b>refurbishable</b> and are being fullyretooled and loaded with software including Microsoft Windows 7, MS Office, and a web browser before being distributed to non-profit partners and families in need.|$|E
40|$|Concept point {{designs of}} low cost and <b>refurbishable</b> spacecraft, subsystems, and modules {{revealed}} payload program savings up to 50 percent. The general relationship of payload approaches to program costs; cost reductions from low cost standardized payloads; cost effective application of payload reliability, MMD, repair, and refurbishment; {{and implementation of}} standardization for future spacecraft are discussed.

40|$|Payloads to be {{launched}} on the space shuttle/space tug/sortie lab combinations are discussed. The payloads are of four types: (1) expendable, (2) ground <b>refurbishable,</b> (3) on-orbit maintainable, and (4) sortie. Economic comparisons are limited to the four types of payloads described. Additional system guidelines were developed by analyzing two payloads parameterically and demonstrating the results on an example satellite. In addition to analyzing the selected guidelines, {{emphasis was placed on}} providing economic tradeoff data and identifying payload parameters influencing the low cost approaches...|$|E

The mission and system requirements are given, and orbiter and booster configuration concepts are evaluated. Systems analyses and trades are discussed for LO 2 -RP propellent, F- 1 engine main propulsion system, winged flyback recovery booster {{and for the}} pressure-fed, ocean recoverable, <b>refurbishable</b> booster system.

40|$|The {{study has}} {{concluded}} that there are very large space program cost savings to be obtained by use of low cost, <b>refurbishable,</b> and standard spacecraft {{in conjunction with the}} shuttle transportation system. The range of space program cost savings for three different groups of programs are shown in quantitative terms. The total savings for the 91 programs will range from $ 13. 4 billion to $ 18. 0 billion depending on the degree of hardware standardization. These savings, principally resulting from payload cost reductions, tangibly support the development costs of the shuttle system...|$|E
40|$|A heat-pipe-cooled Space Shuttle orbiter wing {{leading edge}} was {{compared}} and evaluated against three alternate leading edge candidates: a <b>refurbishable</b> ablative design, {{and two other}} reusable versions employing coated columbium and carbon-carbon high-temperature segments. Each candidate concept was shown feasible in the Phase B environment. The reusable versions were all found to cost nearly the same and substantially less than the nonreusable ablative version. However, since current Shuttle trajectories produce higher heating rates than those used in this study, the carbon-carbon and heat pipe concepts are now the prime candidates for Shuttle leading edge thermal protection...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of the space station will be {{to act as a}} refueling depot for cryogenic-fueled space-based orbital transfer vehicles (OTV), Earth-storable fueled orbit maneuvering vehicles, and <b>refurbishable</b> satellite spacecraft using hydrazine. One alternative for fuel storage at the space station is a tethered orbital refueling facility (TORF), separated from the space station by a sufficient distance to induce a gravity gradient force that settles the stored fuels. The technical feasibility was examined with the primary focus on the refueling of LO 2 /LH 2 orbital transfer vehicles. Also examined was the tethered facility on the space station. It was compared to a zero-gravity facility. A tethered refueling facility should be considered as a viable alternative to a zero-gravity facility if the zero-gravity fluid transfer technology, such as the propellant management device and no vent fill, proves to be difficult to develop with the required performance...|$|E
40|$|The full {{potential}} of infrared astronomy {{can be realized}} only through observations made with space-based telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures. The paper outlines the scientific mission, system description, and focal plane requirements for two cryogenic telescopes: the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). IRAS, a 60 -cm superfluid-helium-cooled telescope system, will perform a one-year 8 - 120 -micron IR sky survey; it will provide results of high reliability and sensitivity, produce the first complete survey data for the 30 - 120 -micron region, and fill in missing portions (spectrally and spatially) of previous surveys short of 30 microns; its focal plane assembly is being designed to approach background-limited performance {{with an array of}} 62 discrete detectors. The SIRTF design will allow detailed follow-up studies in the 1 - 1000 -micron range with a 116 - 160 -cm observatory-class instrument. The Shuttle sortie capability introduces the unique SIRTF concept of an easily <b>refurbishable</b> or replaceable focal plane instrument complement in an orbiting cryogenic telescope...|$|E
40|$|The Reusable Reentry Satellite (RRS) is {{intended}} to provide investigators in several biological disciplines with a relatively inexpensive method to access space for up to 60 days with eventual recovery on Earth. The RRS will permit totally intact, relatively soft, recovery of the vehicle, system refurbishment, and reflight with new and varied payloads. The RRS is {{to be capable of}} three reflights per year over a 10 -year program lifetime. The RRS vehicle will have a large and readily accessible volume near the vehicle center of gravity for the Payload Module (PM) containing the experiment hardware. The vehicle is configured to permit the experimenter late access to the PM prior to launch and rapid access following recovery. The RRS will operate in one of two modes: (1) as a free-flying spacecraft in orbit, and will be allowed to drift in attitude to provide an acceleration environment of less than 10 (exp - 5) g. the acceleration environment during orbital trim maneuvers will be less than 10 (exp - 3) g; and (2) as an artificial gravity system which spins at controlled rates to provide an artificial gravity of up to 1. 5 Earth g. The RRS system will be designed to be rugged, easily maintained, and economically <b>refurbishable</b> for the next flight. Some systems may be designed to be replaced rather than refurbished, if cost effective and capable of meeting the specified turnaround time. The minimum time between recovery and reflight will be approximately 60 days. The PMs will be designed to be relatively autonomous, with experiments that require few commands and limited telemetry. Mass data storage will be accommodated in the PM. The hardware development and implementation phase is currently expected to start in 1991 with a first launch in late 1993...|$|E
40|$|The Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) element {{integrates}} all the subsystems {{needed for}} ascent flight, entry, and {{recovery of the}} combined Booster and Motor system. These include the structures, avionics, thrust vector control, pyrotechnic, range safety, deceleration, thermal protection, and retrieval systems. This represents the only human-rated, recoverable and <b>refurbishable</b> solid rocket ever developed and flown. Challenges included subsystem integration, thermal environments and severe loads (including water impact), sometimes resulting in hardware attrition. Several of the subsystems evolved during the program through design changes. These included the thermal protection system, range safety system, parachute/recovery system, and others. Because the system was recovered, the SRB was ideal for data and imagery acquisition, which proved essential for understanding loads, environments and system response. The three main parachutes that lower the SRBs to the ocean are the largest parachutes ever designed, and the SRBs are the largest structures ever to be lowered by parachutes. SRB recovery from the ocean was a unique process and represented a significant operational challenge; requiring personnel, facilities, transportation, and ground support equipment. The SRB element achieved reliability via extensive system testing and checkout, redundancy management, and a thorough postflight assessment process. However, the in-flight data and postflight assessment process revealed the hardware was affected much more strongly than originally anticipated. Assembly and integration of the booster subsystems required acceptance testing of reused hardware components for each build. Extensive testing was done to assure hardware functionality at each level of stage integration. Because the booster element is recoverable, subsystems were available for inspection and testing postflight, unique to the Shuttle launch vehicle. Problems were noted and corrective actions were implemented as needed. The postflight assessment process was quite detailed and {{a significant portion of}} flight operations. The SRBs provided fully redundant critical systems including thrust vector control, mission critical pyrotechnics, avionics, and parachute recovery system. The design intent was to lift off with full redundancy. On occasion, the redundancy management scheme was needed during flight operations. This paper describes some of the design challenges and technical issues, how the design evolved with time, and key areas where hardware reusability contributed to improved system level understanding...|$|E
40|$|Pyrotechnics {{accomplish}} many functions {{on today}} 2 ̆ 7 s spacecraft, possessing minimum volume/weight, providing instantaneous operation on demand, and requiring little input energy. However, functional shock, safety, and overall system cost issues, combined with emergence {{and availability of}} new technologies question their continued use on space missions. Upon request from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (NASA) Program Management Council (PMC), Langley Research Center (LaRC) conducted a survey to identify and evaluate state-of-the-art nonexplosively actuated (NEA) alternatives to pyrotechnics, identify NEA devices planned for NASA use, and investigate potential interagency cooperative efforts. In this study, over 135 organizations were contacted, including NASA field centers, Department of Defense (DOD) and other government laboratories, universities, and American and European industrial sources resulting in further detailed discussions with over half, and 18 face-to-face briefings. Unlike their single use pyrotechnic predecessors, NEA mechanisms are typically reusable or <b>refurbishable,</b> allowing flight of actual tested units. NEAs surveyed include spool-based devices, thermal knife, Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN), paraffin actuators, and shape memory alloy (SMA) devices (e. g., Frangibolt). The electro-mechanical spool, paraffin actuator and thermal knife are mature, flight proven technologies, while SMA devices have a limited flight history. There is a relationship between shock, input energy requirements, and mechanism functioning rate. Some devices (e. g., Frangibolt and spool based mechanisms) produce significant levels of functional shock. Paraffin, thermal knife, and SMA devices can provide gentle, shock-free release but cannot perform critically timed, simultaneous functions. The FASSN flywheel-nut release device possesses significant potential for reducing functional shock while activating nearly instantaneously. Specific study recommendations include: (1) development of NEA standards, specifically in areas of material characterization, functioning rates, and test methods; (2) a systems level approach to assure successful NEA technology application; and (3) further investigations into user needs, along with industry/government system-level real spacecraft cost benefit trade studies to determine NEA application foci and performance requirements. Additional survey observations reveal an industry and government desire to establish partnerships to investigate remaining unknowns and formulate NEA standards, specifically those driven by SMAs. Finally, there is increased interest and need to investigate alternative devices for such functions as stage/shroud separation and high pressure valving. This paper summarizes results of the NASA-LaRC survey of pyrotechnic alternatives. State of-the-art devices with their associated weight and cost savings are presented. Additionally, a comparison of functional shock characteristics of several devices are shown, and potentially related technology developments are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} of space {{has so far been}} attempted only through a limited sequence of missions, not strictly linked among them in terms of accumulation of achieved experience and hardware utilization. The paper presents an innovative approach to the {{exploration of}} regions beyond Low Earth Orbit, which is assumed to occur through an orderly sequence of interlinked missions, targeted to specific locations, where human outposts are put in place, to progressively enlarge the boundaries of human presence in the Solar System. Each human outpost is built "on the shoulders" of the precedent one, through physical transfer at the new location of all or {{at least some of the}} major building blocks of the previous outpost. Dedicated building blocks may also be considered to build up the final architecture of the new outpost. The new approach proposes therefore the development of an "Itinerant Human Outpost" for future space exploration, growing eventually in complexity and transforming itself. At each step of the space exploration journey the outpost is utilized as technology and operation test-bed to prepare the "next step". The sequence of locations starts with an Equatorial Low Earth Orbit Human Outpost. Next locations are Earth-Moon Lagrangian Points, Near Earth Asteroids Region, Low Lunar Orbits and Martian Orbits to finally build up Martian human outposts in Low Martian Orbits or on one Martian natural satellite. The overall scenario can be considered the "Grand Tour of the Earth Neighbours", performed by the "Itinerant Human Outposts", whose successive multiple utilization and growth potential have to be taken into account as design requirements of each building block. The practice of introducing in the design the "Revolutionary Approach" of the " 6 R Space Systems", i. e. the "Repairable, <b>Refurbishable,</b> Replaceable, Reconfigurable, Retrievable and Reusable Space Systems", has to be adopted as well, in order to optimize in the long term the costs of the outposts building up and of their operations, even if in the front end such an approach requires more complex and costing solutions. The paper describes into some detail the proposed new approach, establishes the main requirements and defines the System of Systems Architecture of the first Human Outpost in Equatorial Low Earth Orbit. The significant endeavours, required to sustain over quite a long period of time such an initiative, are going to offer to new generations perspectives that will act as catalyst of economical growth and will encourage the involvement of the Private Secto...|$|E
