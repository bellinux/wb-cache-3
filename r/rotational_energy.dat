5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered escapement mechanism, which transferred <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> into intermittent motions, {{dates back}} to 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconnection}} {{events are}} analogues to the magnetic substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere. The difference {{seems to be}} their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which moves down the tail. Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.|$|E

5|$|The tidal {{acceleration}} of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance. Friction effects—between the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>energy.</b> These combined effects are expected to increase {{the length of the}} day by more than 1.5hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E
5|$|Water maser {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper maser level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for maser emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} spectroscopy, {{because the}} ratios of the periods of the electronic, vibrational and <b>rotational</b> <b>energies</b> are each {{related to each other}} on scales in the order of a thousand, the Born-Oppenheimer name has also been attached to the approximation where the energy components are treated separately.|$|R
50|$|An {{example is}} the {{calculation}} of the <b>rotational</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> of the Earth. As the Earth has {{a period of about}} 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of 7.29×10−5 rad/s. The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = 8.04×1037 kg·m2. Therefore, it has a <b>rotational</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> of 2.138×1029 J.|$|R
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} is the <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> {{stored in the}} wheels. The pinewood derby car converts gravitational potential energy into translational kinetic energy (speed) plus <b>rotational</b> <b>energy.</b> Heavier wheels have a greater moment of inertia and their spinning takes away energy that would otherwise contribute to {{the speed of the}} car. A standard wheel has a mass of 2.6 g, but this can be reduced to as little as 1 g by removing material from the inside of the wheel. A raised wheel can reduce the <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> up to one-quarter, but this advantage is less with a bumpy track.|$|E

25|$|The {{transfer}} of energy from one chemical substance to another {{depends on the}} size of energy quanta emitted from one substance. However, heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the phonons responsible for vibrational and <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> levels in a substance have much less energy than photons invoked for the electronic energy transfer. Thus, because vibrational and <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels, heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy. For example, ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy.|$|E

25|$|A {{windmill}} is a mill {{that converts}} {{the energy of}} wind into <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> by means of vanes called sails or blades.

25|$|Detections of c-C3H2 in the ISM rely on {{observations}} of molecular transitions using rotational spectroscopy.

25|$|Explorer 1 changed {{rotation}} axis after launch. The elongated body of {{the spacecraft}} had been designed to spin about its long (least-inertia) axis but refused to do so, and instead started precessing due to energy dissipation from flexible structural elements. Later it was understood that on general grounds, the body {{ends up in the}} spin state that minimizes the kinetic <b>rotational</b> <b>energy</b> for a fixed angular momentum (this being the maximal-inertia axis).

25|$|Waterston's key {{paper was}} written and {{submitted}} in 1845 to the Royal Society. After refusing to publish his work, the Society {{also refused to}} return his manuscript and stored it among its files. The manuscript was discovered in 1891 by Lord Rayleigh, who criticized the original reviewer for failing to recognize the significance of Waterston's work. Waterston managed to publish his ideas in 1851, and therefore has priority over Maxwell for enunciating {{the first version of}} the equipartition theorem. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and <b>rotational</b> <b>energy.</b> In 1876, Ludwig Boltzmann expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system.

25|$|Because the Earth's tides are {{ultimately}} due to gravitational {{interaction with the}} Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable energy resource. Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth–Moon system: this {{is a result of}} pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation. During the last 620million years the period of rotation of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its <b>rotational</b> <b>energy.</b> While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years.|$|E
