40|$|A {{significant}} number of men in Australia are victim/survivors of child sexual abuse. While {{a growing number of}} services offer therapeutic support and counselling for men, the issue of men's <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> has not become a public policy issue. It is suggested that conceptualising and responding to male <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> as a public health issue, will help to improve community responses to men and their families. Key Messages: ?? Although there is a growing body of evidence and research on male victim/survivors of child sexual abuse and its impacts, it has not yet become the subject of a considered public policy interventions. ?? A public health approach that taps into learning from work with female victim/survivors and recent men's health strategies offers a framework for action that has the potential to assist male victim/ survivors of child sexual abuse. ?? Male victim/survivors of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> are a diverse group with diverse needs. Evidence suggests that in order to support healing and recovery it is necessary to create gender appropriate services and interventions that: [...] reach out and engage men; [...] address barriers to men's help seeking; [...] assist men and their families to build supportive relationships; [...] provide opportunities for group support; and [...] develop public discussions that offer hope for an improved future.

40|$|Overview This study {{examined}} the intersections between alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and trauma, how both support sectors currently work together, {{and how they can}} respond more effectively to the needs of those affected. The study found that: 	Participants from both the AOD and the sexual assault sectors demonstrated a practical understanding of the interrelationship between drug and alcohol use and <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation.</b> The overlap between <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and alcohol and other drug use was very relevant for AOD and sexual assault counsellors and managers who were aware of the very large numbers of potentially “shared” clients. 	Current practice in the assessment and intake processes in the AOD and sexual assault sectors varies considerably and reflects both the organisational frameworks that guide practice, as well as the initiative and confidence of individuals in the sectors in referring clients to other services. 	Factors that hinder collaboration included insufficient resources; uncertainty about how the other sector works; lack of communication; and role creep, which describes the expansion of demands and activities of a job or role over time that are not balanced by additional resources to support them. 	Practitioners and managers expressed great interest in expanding their understanding of the other sector through a variety of avenues, some of which included: shared focus on client-centred care; openness to discussion and sharing information; previous interagency collaboration; and policy and governance support. Findings from the report informed the development of practice guidelines to assist service providers with the identification, assessment, response and referral of individuals and families affected by co-occurring <b>sexual</b> abuse <b>victimisation</b> and substance use issues.  ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} for this article was undertaken in one South African correctional centre and indicates that men are subjected to <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> on a regular basis. Interviews were conducted with 100 male awaiting-trial child, juvenile and adult detainees (ATDs) {{as well as with}} male juvenile and adult offenders. The researcher aimed to determine the participant’s knowledge of sexual practices in the correctional centre. The majority of the participants (78 %) reported that anal penetration is practiced in this correctional centre, and includes both rape (one-on-one and gang rape) as well as consensual sex between two inmates. An interesting finding is that this type of sex is mentioned across the research sample (children, juveniles and adult males). Sixty-four percent (64 %) of the participants reported that inmates practice interfemoral sex. The third type of sex that is practiced in the correctional centre is oral sex (23 %), followed by masturbation (21 %). Many of the participants replied that the type of sex (anal, interfemoral, oral or masturbation) is often agreed upon by both parties. The reasons why men participate in sex while awaiting-trial include a need for emotional sex, survival sex, compliance sex and forced sex. Regarding the <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> that takes place in this particular correctional centre, {{more than half of the}} participants (57 %) revealed that they had sexual insults directed at them, some every day. However, they do not recognise this as a form of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation,</b> rather as a part of life in a correctional centre. Other sexual acts that the victims have been subjected to include forced oral sex, interfemoral sex and masturbation. With specific reference to rape, the majority (84 %) of the research participants affirmed that they have heard of rape, and offered the following reasons for this act: two inmates not reaching an agreement, corruption by correctional officials, gang involvement and deception. The researcher interviewed six victims of rape and four perpetrators. In the presentation the characteristics of both the victims and the perpetrators will be discussed.

40|$|Background Studies have {{suggested}} that people with intellectual disability are disproportionately involved in crime both as perpetrators and victims. Method A case linkage design used three Australian contact-level databases, from disability services, public mental health services and police records. Rates of contact, and official records of victimisation and criminal charges were compared to those in a community sample without intellectual disability. Results Although people with intellectual disability were {{significantly less likely to}} have an official record of victimisation and offending overall, their rates of violent and <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and offending were significantly higher. The presence of comorbid mental illness considerably increased the likelihood of victimisation and offending; several sex differences were also noted. Conclusions People with intellectual disability are at increased risk for both violent and <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and offending. The presence of comorbid mental illness aggravates the risk of offending and victimisation. Future research should focus on a more nuanced exploration of the risks associated with intellectual disability and specific mental disorders and related indices of complexity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Europe, refugees, {{asylum seekers}} and undocumented {{migrants}} {{are more vulnerable}} to <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> than European citizens. They face more challenges when seeking care. This literature review examines how legal and policy frameworks at national, European and international levels condition the prevention of and response to sexual violence affecting these vulnerable migrant communities living in the European Union (EU). Applying the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method, we reviewed 187 legal and policy documents and 80 peer-reviewed articles on migrant sexual health for elements on sexual violence and further analysed the 37 legal and 12 peer-reviewed articles among them that specifically focused on sexual violence in vulnerable migrants in the EU- 27 States. Legal and policy documents dealing with sexual violence, particularly but not exclusively in vulnerable migrants, apply ‘tunnel vision’. They ignore: a) frequently occurring types of <b>sexual</b> violence, b) <b>victimisation</b> rates across genders and c) specific risk factors within the EU such as migrants’ legal status, gender orientation and living conditions. The current EU policy-making paradigm relegates sexual violence in vulnerable migrants as an ‘outsider’ and ‘female only’ issue while EU migration and asylum policies reinforce its invisibility. Effective response must be guided by participatory rights- and evidence-based policies and a public health approach, acknowledging the occurrence and multiplicity of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> of vulnerable migrants of all genders within EU borders...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of complex trauma as a response to chronic <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and considers what this means for services and service configurations, as well as the implications of acknowledging complex trauma for policy responses in health and human service fields. Abstract: Traumatic events are those that overwhelm the "ordinary human adaptations to life". However, one particular type of trauma is increasingly being recognised as a driver of many complex social and mental health problems in those affected by it. The repeated trauma caused by ongoing sexual abuse that is prolonged, occurs in the developmental stages of a person 2 ̆ 7 s life, and is often perpetrated by an authority figure is now being more readily perceived as a causal feature of multiple social and mental health issues and the consequent need for human services. Although not officially recognised in diagnostic classification, the term "complex trauma" or "complex post-traumatic stress disorder" describes a broad-ranging set of disorders, symptoms and social problems that are not captured by a limited diagnostic category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People suffering complex trauma need treatments that are multifaceted and varied to accommodate their particular range of symptoms. Isolated treatment of particular symptoms may only impact on one aspect of their needs and will not resolve the underlying issues that have created the problem. Key points: The mental health impacts of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> are frequently acknowledged but there are specific and additional impacts where victims have suffered a particular type of abuse that is: interpersonal, commences at an age where emotional development is affected, is ongoing, chronic or features multiple types of abuse. Many researchers and practitioners in the fields of psychiatry, psychology and social work do not see the mental health diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as sufficient to capture these specific effects of multiple types of abuse and chronic victimisation. There have been calls for an additional category called "complex PTSD" or "complex trauma". The impacts of complex trauma symptomatology on victim/survivors can be a driver of need for many human services, including mental health, medical and substance abuse services as well as social services like housing and relationship services. Acknowledging an underlying basis of trauma could enhance service delivery to the victim/survivor that may have multiple needs across services. It is important to acknowledge the link between ongoing <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and complex trauma in order to facilitate a cultural shift towards the connectedness of services and a person-centred approach to service use...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 201. Major: Neuroscience. Advisor: Robert L. Meisel, Ph. D [...] 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 120 pages. Naturally motivated behaviors, such as female sexual behavior, activate neural circuits {{that in turn}} mediate the rewarding aspects of the behavior. Activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system by <b>repeated</b> <b>sexual</b> experience leads to long-term changes in behavioral, cellular, and structural plasticity. Specifically, {{we have found that}} a uniquely stable transcription factor, deltaFosB, accumulates in the core of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) following <b>repeated</b> <b>sexual</b> experience. To further determine the role of deltaFosB in sexual reward, we virally overexpressed deltaFosB in the NAc of female Syrian hamsters and tested them in a conditioned place preference paradigm. Overexpression of deltaFosB in the NAc resulted in enhanced sexual reward and improved copulatory efficiency with a male compared to control females overexpressing green fluorescent protein. Having established a role for this transcription factor in sexual reward, we next wanted to analyze how <b>repeated</b> <b>sexual</b> experience affected the gene expression of targets of deltaFosB mediated transcription in a limbic circuit. <b>Repeated</b> <b>sexual</b> experience resulted in a significant increase in mRNA expression of only one target of deltaFosB mediated transcription, the GluA 2 subunit of the AMPA receptor in the NAc. Interested in the implications of increased GluA 2 expression in the NAc on cellular excitability, we decided to pursue this research by determining whether total protein of GluA 2 and GluA 1 subunits of the AMPA receptor or their trafficking was differentially affected by <b>repeated</b> <b>sexual</b> experience. In contrast to the published changes in both total protein and receptor trafficking reported in the drug addiction literature, our results indicate that neither of these measures are affected by sexual experience, possibly indicating why natural motivated behaviors are typically not addictive. These results demonstrate that deltaFosB is important in mediating the rewarding consequences of female sexual behavior, and through its transcriptional activity alters gene expression that may underlie the consequent long-term behavioral, cellular and structural plasticity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the nature and}} {{consequences}} of the <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> of female students at the University of Venda with specific reference to sexual harassment and rape were explored. To serve as a theoretical background for the study, an integrated model of sexual harassment and rape was formulated. In this model various victim related risk factors, offender related risk factors, institutional related risk factors as well as societal related risk factors, were highlighted as possible factors that may contribute to sexual harassment and rape of female students on campus. Ten research participants who met {{the requirements of the}} study were selected by means of purposive theoretical sampling. Requests for research participation were made through the use of posters as well as the facilitation of a workshop {{on the campus of the}} University of Venda. Two victims of sexual harassment and eight female students, who were subjected to rape on campus, participated in the study. In order to obtain in-depth information on the nature of the research participants’ experiences, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted. Based upon the analysis and interpretation of the data it became evident that most sexual harassment and rape incidents occur on campus between individuals who know each other. Further analysis of the data indicate that victim related risk factors (such as age, level of study, residential status, victim-offender relationship, victim participation and position in class, denial and non-reporting, the acceptance of stereotypes regarding rape and sexual harassment as well as the use of alcohol), offender related risk factors (such as male peer support and the use of alcohol), institutional related risk factors (such as participation in campus activities, the level of surveillance and absence of deterrence) as well as societal related risk factors (such as the legitimisation of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> and the role of significant others) interact with each other and contribute to sexual harassment and rape on the campus of the University of Venda. The findings also show that victims of sexual harassment and rape suffer emotional, physical, social as well as financial consequences as a result of the incidents. Based upon the findings, certain conclusions with regard to the aims of the study were reached and recommendations for further research were also made. Emanating from the feedback from the research participants, recommendations regarding prevention aimed at the victim, perpetrator and the institution (the University of Venda) were also made. The need for the empowerment of female students through educational programmes, the necessity to dispel the stereotypes surrounding sexual harassment and rape as well as the need to encourage the management of the University of Venda to take serious note of <b>sexual</b> <b>victimisation</b> on campus and to implement policy to protect women at this institution, were also emphasised.

The variables studied include: (1) scenario acceptability, (2) victim responsibility, (3) perpetrator responsibility, (4) victim pleasure, (5) victim distress and (6) support for filing a police report. The results indicate that sexual coercion of men is taken less seriously than sexual coercion of women, especially among Dutch men.
