Two strains of Bifidobacterium (B) were isolated from stool of breastfed infants and identified by their 16 S rRNA genes. The strains were identical to B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A. These isolates were conserved by lyophilisation, and the survival rates measured six months after lyophilisation, were 74. 74 % and 99. 6 % for B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 and B. breve M 4 A, respectively. To improve the survival rate in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media used for lyophilisation, the <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> was supplemented with yeast extract, glucose and oligofructose. Supplementation decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count. Statistical analyses showed a nonlinear relationship between <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media and bacterial count number and acid production, which indicates an opposite impact of yeast extract with glucose or oligofructose supplementation in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media. Response surface plots were applied to optimize the supplemented <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> media. Both strains grew more rapidly in supplemented media than in skimmed milk-based medium alone. Acid production was higher in B. breve M 4 A than B. longum subsp. longum FA 1 when inoculated into <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> supplemented with yeast extract, glucose, and oligofructose. The fermentation ability in <b>skimmed</b> <b>milk</b> was dependent on nutrient availability and the carbon source, which decreased the doubling time and increased the viable cell count.

Limited proteolysis with milk-clotting enzymes increased the whiteness of <b>skim</b> <b>milk.</b> the proteases porcine pepsin and chymosin were immobilized onto nonporous ceramic, glass, and controlled pore glass (CPG) beads. The enzymes were coupled to beads either directly or via crosslinker proteins. Pepsin, immobilized onto CPG beads via crosslinker proteins, exhibited the best properties with respect to enzymatic activity, stability, and whitening efficiency. The L value (whiteness) of this immobilized enzyme-treated <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was 79. 5, which approached the whiteness of 1 % fat milk. Immobilized proteases whitened <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> more effectively than did soluble proteases. The whiteness of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was determined at various temperatures from 4 to 90 °C. The L value increased with increasing temperature throughout the range tested. For samples not heated above 50 °C, the increases in L values were completely reversible on cooling. Partial reversibility was observed with samples heated at 70 °C and above. Milk whiteness was also determined at different pH values ranging from 5. 0 to 8. 2 at temperatures of 4, 20, and 30 °C.

Increasing the pasteurization temperature of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> from 61. 8 to 79. 4 C for 30 minutes resulted in 15. 6 % increase in cultured cottage cheese yields. However, the high heat cheese exhibited variable quality and was generally inferior to the control. Cheese making from high heat <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was done by cutting at the A.

The 20 % retentate was produced by concentrating <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> 5 : 1 and then subjecting it to diafiltration with an equivalent volume of deionized water. The acidification of the retentates was accomplished by metering concentrated hydrochloric acid into the vortex of the centrifugal Culture growth in 20 % retentates was inhibited below and soluble phosphate seemed to be an important factor in this inhibition. The yield trials indicated that the increase in yields over cultured cottage cheese made from <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> was 12. 4, 15. 3, 5. 6 and 1. 6 % for 16 % cultured, 16 % direct acid, 20 % cultured and 20 % direct acid cottage cheeses made from retentates. The lower yield increases from 20 % retentates was because of the shattering of the curd while cooking, and the diffusion of the whey proteins.

Considering both high heat treatment of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> and ultrafiltration for increasing cottage cheese yields, ultrafiltration seems to be the better method owing to the much better quality of cheese produced.

Processing of milk, in chilling 0, 4, 16) and heating (W, 1;), induces several changes in MFGM. Some of the reports have indicated a loss of membrane material to the milk serum on cooling (J) and heating of milk (10). Neverthe-less. such a migration is no t weH established a...|$|R

The composition of <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> agar medium was (g/l): casein 5.0  g, glucose 1.0  g, <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> powder 3.0  g, yeast extract 2.5  g and agar 15.0  g as solidifying agent. The pH was adjusted to 7.5. Bacterial isolates were inoculated onto plates and incubated at 37  °C for 48  h. The clear zone forming isolates were selected as keratinase producer. 10 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was flooded on the milk agar plate {{to observe the}} zone clearly (Saran et al. 2007).|$|R

This bacterium produced proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes in all media investigated (<b>skim</b> <b>milk,</b> cheese whey, casein broth, and tryptone soy broth). High levels of &# 945;-glucosidase were produced in <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> broth. Hydrolytic enzymes detected in <b>skim</b> <b>milk</b> broth are of particular concern, indicating that these enzymes could be produced by Pseudomonas sp. during the cold storage of raw milk, contributing to the spoilage problem in milk and dairy products...|$|R
