It is, therefore, of very high relevance for many industries, to have a clear understanding of what are the parameters I need to trigger in order to generate the requested quality. Such understanding was the target of this work. The specific equipments designed at Delft University of Technology enabled us to measure the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> and the resistance to abrasion of both reference coating agents and commercially pre-mixed coating systems. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> was directly related to the intrinsic properties of the coating material, to the process parameters used to apply the coating layer (fluid bed coating in this case) and to the conditions in which the particles are stored. The viscoelastic properties of the coating layers were measured by using nano indentation. Very good correlation between the viscoelasticity term, tan ?, and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> was found. Cast and sprayed films were produced as representation of the coating film. The morphology and the structure of coating layers were mimicked much better by sprayed films which could be obtained by novel equipment designed during this work. To assess the quality of the coating layer and determine how efficient the coating process was, X-Ray micro tomography in combination with image analysis was used. This gave us a very robust set of data which could be used to correlate the quality of the coating layer to the parameters chosen during coating process and those two with the final performance of the {{coated particle}}s in respect of resistance to attrition/abrasion.

40|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} {{is considered}} an indirect method of oxidizing a carbonaceous fuel, utilizing a metal oxide oxygen carrier to provide oxygen to the fuel. The advantage is the significantly reduced energy penalty for separating out the CO 2 for reuse or sequestration in a carbon-constrained world. One of the major issues with chemical looping combustion {{is the cost of}} the oxygen carrier. Hematite ore is a proposed oxygen carrier due to its high strength and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> mechanical <b>attrition,</b> but its reactivity is rather poor compared to tailored oxygen carriers. This problem is further exacerbated by methane cracking, the subsequent deposition of carbon and the inability to transfer oxygen at a sufficient rate from the core of the particle to the surface for fuel conversion to CO 2. Oxygen needs to be readily available at the surface to prevent methane cracking. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the use of steam to overcome this issue and improve the conversion of the natural gas to CO 2, as well as to provide data for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validation. The steam will gasify the deposited carbon to promote the methane conversion. This work studies the performance of hematite ore with methane and steam mixtures in a 5 cm fluidized bed up to approximately 140 kPa. Results show an increased conversion of methane in the presence of steam (from 20 – 45 % without steam to 60 – 95 %) up to a certain point, where performance decreases. Adding steam allows the methane conversion to carbon dioxide to be similar to the overall methane conversion; it also helped to prevent carbon accumulation from occurring on the particle. In general, the addition of steam to the feed gas increased the methane conversion. Furthermore, the addition of steam caused the steam methane reforming reaction to form more hydrogen and carbon monoxide at higher steam and methane concentrations, which was not completely converted at higher concentrations and at these residence times...|$|R

40|$|The {{key element}} in gas-to-liquid {{technology}} is the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis in which liquid hydrocarbons are produced from syngas (CO and H 2). During FT synthesis the catalyst and the catalyst support are subjected to considerable wearing. γ-alumina is considered {{as one of the}} most promising materials for catalyst support in a slurry bubble column reactor although the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> is not satisfying. The γ-alumina is prepared by spray drying and is a highly porous aggregate. In order to improve the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition,</b> the porous support has been modified by impregnation of a metal oxide precursor followed by thermal treatment. The objective of the present thesis was to find the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced mechanical performance of the modified catalyst support based on γ-alumina. The first part of the work was devoted to the processing of the γ-alumina based support, the second part to the thermal evolution of the phase composition and the microstructure of the support and the last part was concerned with the characterization of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition.</b> The distribution of the impregnated salt was investigated by electron probe micro analysis and the element mapping demonstrated that the impregnated salt was not homogeneously distributed in the γ-alumina aggregates. The inhomogeneous distribution of the metal oxide formed by decomposition of the salt reflected the inhomogeneous packing of the primary γ-alumina crystallites in the aggregates, and incorporation of the metal oxide in the initial step to produce γ-alumina would improve the distribution of the metal oxide. Previous investigations have shown that enhancement of the attrition resistance was achieved after calcination at high temperature. In-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction was carried out to investigate the thermal evolution of the phase composition and crystal structure of several impregnated catalyst supports. Refinement of the diffraction data revealed that the chemical reaction between γ-alumina and the impregnated metal oxide was controlled by the valence of the metal oxide and the site preference of the metal cation in the spinel phase formed in the reaction. The reaction with γ-alumina and impregnated NiO or MgO was initiated at around 500 °C. A metastable solid solution between γ-alumina and NiAl 2 O 4 or MgAl 2 O 4 spinel was formed. The reaction between γ-alumina and ZnO was less pronounced and the initiation of the reaction was more challenging to determine. Additional materials prepared by solid state reactions were investigated to elucidate the crystal structure and solid solubility of alumina in NiAl 2 O 4 and similar spinels. The lattice parameter of the metastable solid solution between γ-alumina and the spinel revealed that α-alumina precipitated from the solid solution at around 1100 °C resulting in a reduction of Al 2 O 3 content in the spinel. The formation of the metastable solid solution prevented the direct transformation of γ-alumina to θ- and α-alumina. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the reaction between the impregnated oxide and γ-alumina had a pronounced effect on the final microstructure of the support. Non-impregnated supports transformed to α-alumina crystallites with an approximate size of 200 nm after thermal treatment, while mainly crystallites in the range 20 – 40 nm were observed in the impregnated supports. Dependent of the homogeneity of the γ-alumina aggregates and the amount of the impregnated oxide some large α-alumina crystallites were also formed. The intergranular interface or neck formation between the crystallites was shown to be significantly enhanced by the impregnation. Investigation of γ-alumina, impregnated with a Mn oxide precursor, revealed that the final phase composition and microstructure was strongly dependent on the oxidation state of Mn. By heat treatment in reducing atmosphere, where MnO is stable, a similar microstructure to those impregnated with precursors of MgO, NiO and ZnO was obtained. Heat treatment in air or inert atmosphere, where Mn is stable in a higher oxidation state, the formation of the metastable spinel solid solution did not occur. The influence of the phase composition and the microstructure on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> was investigated by Vickers hardness indentation on individual catalyst support aggregates and a standard attrition test. It was demonstrated that the Vickers hardness showed a very good correlation with the wear resistance. The supports with the modified microstructures exhibited the best mechanical performance, while the pure alumina based supports with larger crystallites showed poor performance. The hardness and wear resistance of the modified supports revealed that the increase in the performance appeared concurrently with the precipitation of α-alumina. It was demonstrated that the most wear resistant microstructure corresponded to the ones with small crystallites of α-alumina and spinel with considerable neck formation or intergranular interfaces between the crystallites. X-ray diffraction revealed that the spinel formed in the modified supports were strained, reflecting the strong interfacial bond between the phases and the thermal mismatch of α-alumina and spinel. Effect of possible epitaxial relationship between the two phases was therefore discussed. Based on the present findings the enhanced mechanical performance of the modified catalyst support reflects a considerable modification of the microstructure, which reduce the grain growth and coarsening of α-alumina and the formation of strong intergranular interfaces between nano-crystalline spinel and α-alumina.

The surfaces of DI-II and normal teeth were tested on the CSM Instruments Scratch Tester machine (producer CSEM Switzerland) by Oliver & Pharr method. The indenter used was Vicker’s VG- 73 diamond indenter. Additionally, the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface of the teeth with DI-II was made. Vickers hardness of the teeth with dental pathology (DI-II) was seven times smaller, and Young’s modulus six times smaller than those of healthy teeth.

40|$|Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} processes for the low-cost capture of CO 2. It is based on the transfer of oxygen from air to the fuel by means of a solid oxygen carrier that circulates between two interconnected fluidized bed reactors: the fuel reactor and the air reactor. CO 2 capture is inherent to this process since air does not become mixed with the fuel. A key issue for the large-scale development of CLC technology is the selection of oxygen carrier materials with suitable properties such as high reactivity and good fluidization. Another important feature that an oxygen carrier must fulfil is to have high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition.</b> For this purpose, several particle characteristics related to attrition resistance were analysed in this work on 23 oxygen carriers, both natural and synthetic, prepared by different methods and using different metal oxides. Particle crushing strength and Air Jet Index (AJI) were determined for the fresh materials, as well as the attrition rate and the corresponding particle lifetime during multi-cycle redox reactions in a continuously operated CLC unit for gaseous fuels. A comparison was made of the different methods used to evaluate attrition behaviour. The AJI-ASTM test for particles subjected to long-term CLC operation was used as a standard screening tool to evaluate the attrition behaviour of the oxygen carriers. Finally, a methodology was proposed for the selection of oxygen carriers as eligible materials for CLC scale-up based on attrition behaviour.

40|$|Combined oxides of {{manganese}} and silicon have earlier {{been identified}} as suitable oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion. In this study, one pure manganese-silicon oxide and one similar material with titanium included in the formulation have been examined as oxygen carriers. Experiments studying the oxygen release and the reactivity with syngas, methane and wood char {{have been carried out}} in a bench-scale circulating chemical-looping combustor and in a batch fluidized-bed reactor in the temperature range 800 - 1050 °C. Both oxygen carriers released oxygen in inert atmosphere and the concentration of oxygen released increased with temperature. The conversion of syngas and methane also increased with temperature for both materials and in both experimental setups. The reactivity with devolatilized wood char showed that the rate of oxygen uncoupling increased with temperature. However, it could be concluded that the main fuel conversion mechanism was CLC and not CLOU for these materials. The inclusion of titanium in the manganese-silicon combined oxide significantly affected the physical properties of the oxygen carrier particles. The MnSi particles could only be operated for 7 h in the bench-scale circulating chemical-looping combustor before the circulation was disrupted due to the large fines formation. The MnSiTi particles were operated for 24 h in the circulating unit without any circulation disruption. It was concluded {{that it is possible to}} greatly decrease the attrition rate of the particles by including titanium in the formulation. However, the inclusion of titanium lowered the reactivity with fuel. As the thermodynamic properties are very similar for the two oxide systems, the reduced reactivity is most probably an effect of the lower porosity of MnSiTi. This emphasizes the importance of optimizing the physical structure of the oxygen carrier particles. The physical structure of the particles was found to be greatly affected by the inclusion of titanium, giving, for example, a higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition.</b> The physical structure of the particles is important for the fuel conversion as well, as it will likely have implications on the internal diffusion in the particles...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{a version}} of CLC for solid fuels, based on a single fluidised bed reactor, operated cyclically, with each cycle containing three stages. (i) Fuel is fed steadily to a bed of oxygen-carrier fluidised with steam or CO 2. The fuel is gasified and the resulting syngas is oxidised by the oxygen-carrier, which is itself reduced: unreacted char accumulates. (ii) Before the oxygen-carrier is completely converted, feeding of fuel is stopped and the remaining char in the bed is gasified. (iii) The fluidising gas is changed to air and the carrier is regenerated. Experiments were undertaken on the continuous feeding of lignite char to a fluidised bed reactor containing either (i) inert silica sand, or (ii) an iron-based oxygen-carrier. The bed was fluidised with CO 2 in N 2 at 800 °C during the gasification stage. The carrier was made from pure haematite (Fe 2 O 3) powder. The gasification of the fuel was rate-limiting whether or not carrier was present, but the rate was higher, and inventory of carbon lower, with the oxygen-carrier. This was attributed to the removal, by the iron oxide, of the principal product of gasification, CO, which inhibits the rate. A mathematical model was devised to describe the fuel-feeding stage. Multiple cycles of chemical-looping combustion were performed using either (i) the granulated iron oxide oxygen-carrier, or (ii) carrier made by impregnating an alumina catalyst support with copper oxide (25 wt%CuO overall). The gasification was in 50 mol% CO 2, balance N 2, at 850 – 925 °C. Four fuels were used. The rates of gasification of bituminous coal and activated carbon were much slower {{than those of the}} lignite and its char, resulting in an unfavourably large accumulation of carbon during stage (i). A conversion of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 of close to 100 % was maintained over the course of 20 cycles for all fuels. No agglomeration was observed. At the temperatures required for gasifying the less reactive coals (> 900 °C), copper oxide was problematic: the CuO formed by oxidation in stage (iii) decomposed very rapidly to Cu 2 O before the feed of fuel could be established. Also, the formation of unreactive copper aluminates was favoured. Both phenomena reduced the oxygen capacity of the particles. Repeated redox reactions decreased the ability of the iron oxide to withstand attrition in a fluidised bed. However, the copper carrier maintained its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> over 10 redox cycles. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThere is {{presently}} very little information available concerning long term operation with group B oxygen carriers for the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process. It is therefore {{difficult to predict}} the attrition at industrial scale based on existing tools and methodologies for the different oxygen carriers available. The CLC process is similar in its configuration to the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process with particles circulating in a loop between different reactors. Therefore for the CLC process development perspectives, {{it is interesting to}} compare the different oxygen carriers with a FCC catalyst of which data at industrial scale are available. A method to compare the mechanical <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>attrition</b> of solids from different fluidization groups was developed in this work. In order to deal with small amount s of particle samples, experiments are conducted using lab scale testing with a Jet Cup rig. Two solids of interest were considered in this study, a Group B oxygen carrier with a density of 3600 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 180 microns, and a group A FCC equilibrium catalyst with a particle density of 1450 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 70 microns. First, we defined a new attrition index that does not depend upon a given particle size. This index is based on the total percentage of particles generated by attrition and it is called TPGI (Total Particles Generated Index). This index also gives the possibility to estimate the maximum diameter of particles generated by attrition. It was found that attrition in the jet cup is proportional to the contact frequency between the air jet and the particles. Therefore it is necessary to estimate the particles circulation within the air jet for each solid tested in order to make sure that particles go through the same mechanical stress. For this purpose, a CFD study using Barracuda™ was carried out on the two solids of interest. CFD results showed that in order to have the same circulation of particles in the air jet, therefore the same mechanical stress, tests should be carried out with the same initial volume of particles. It is important to notice that this conclusion is valid for the two solids of interest, another CFD study should be done for solids with different properties. Finally, the particles mechanical resistance is characterized by the TPGPI increase rate with respect to the test duration. This parameter is then be used to compare the solids tested, the oxygen carrier being more resistant than the FCC catalyst in this study case...|$|E

Predictors of precounseling attrition were a history of child abuse, being non-White, and having more self-reported anger. Younger age and antisocial personality were significant predictors of attrition during counseling in both logit and Zero Inflated Poisson regression analyses. We further identified predictors of attrition by type of group treatment. In cognitive–behavioral groups, younger age, no reports of violence in childhood, and antisocial personality were significantly related <b>to</b> <b>attrition.</b> In process-psychodynamic groups, low income was related <b>to</b> <b>attrition.</b> Program and research implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
