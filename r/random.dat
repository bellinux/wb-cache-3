5|$|A {{classic example}} of a <b>random</b> walk {{is known as the}} simple <b>random</b> walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple <b>random</b> walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this <b>random</b> walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this <b>random</b> walk is called a symmetric <b>random</b> walk.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or <b>random</b> {{process can}} be defined as a collection of <b>random</b> variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each <b>random</b> variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the <b>random</b> variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each <b>random</b> variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sufficiently}} sparse <b>random</b> graph is pseudoforest. That is, if c is {{a constant}} with 0 < c < 1/2, and Pc(n) is the probability that choosing uniformly at <b>random</b> among the n-vertex graphs with cn edges results in a pseudoforest, then Pc(n) tends to one in the limit for large n. However, for c > 1/2, almost every <b>random</b> graph with cn edges has a large component that is not unicyclic.|$|E

The <b>randoms</b> fraction is defined as the fraction of simulated <b>randoms</b> over trues counts. This implementation has already been used in previous work [21, 25].|$|R

5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} <b>random</b> battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, <b>random</b> battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, <b>random</b> battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a <b>random</b> encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|For <b>random</b> {{walks in}} -dimensional integer lattices, George Pólya {{published}} in 1919 and 1921 work, {{where he studied}} {{the probability of a}} symmetric <b>random</b> walk returning to a previous position in the lattice. Pólya showed that a symmetric <b>random</b> walk, which has an equal probability to advance in any direction in the lattice, will return to a previous position in the lattice an infinite number of times with probability one in one and two dimensions, but with probability zero in three or higher dimensions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging, the main function of scatter and <b>randoms</b> corrections is to improve contrast and quantitative accuracy. Both corrections are essential and critically important. Several iterative reconstruction schemes incorporating scatter and <b>randoms</b> corrections have been developed over the years. In this work, the authors propose a new method to incorporate the scatter and <b>randoms</b> corrections into the iterative image reconstruction, which has shown promising results in regards to improving reconstruction performance and image quality {{as compared to the}} standard methods...|$|R

25|$|A <b>random</b> {{variable}} has {{a probability}} distribution, which specifies {{the probability that}} its value falls in any given interval. <b>Random</b> variables can be discrete, that is, taking any of a specified finite or countable list of values, endowed with a probability mass function characteristic of the <b>random</b> variable's probability distribution; or continuous, taking any numerical value in an interval or collection of intervals, via a probability density function that is characteristic of the <b>random</b> variable's probability distribution; or a mixture of both types. Two <b>random</b> variables with the same probability distribution can still differ {{in terms of their}} associations with, or independence from, other <b>random</b> variables. The realizations of a <b>random</b> variable, that is, the results of randomly choosing values according to the variable's probability distribution function, are called <b>random</b> variates.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of <b>random</b> passwords {{depends on the}} actual entropy of the underlying number generator; however, these are often not truly <b>random,</b> but pseudo <b>random.</b> Many publicly available password generators use <b>random</b> number generators found in programming libraries that offer limited entropy. However most modern operating systems offer cryptographically strong <b>random</b> number generators that are suitable for password generation. It is also possible to use ordinary dice to generate <b>random</b> passwords.
