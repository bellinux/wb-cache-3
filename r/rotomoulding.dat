40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the aerodynamic performances of thick blades axial-flow fans {{was carried out}} in this study. Two fans are considered, the first one is <b>rotomoulded</b> (in plastic) and the second one is milled (in aluminium). Both have exactly the same shape, excepting that the <b>rotomoulded</b> fan has hollow blades. They were designed from an existing fan (manufactured by plastic injection process) used in the cooling system of an automotive vehicle power unit. As far as shape is concerned, the only difference between the two first fans and the traditional injected fan is the blade thickness, whereas as far as rigidity is concerned, the only difference between the <b>rotomoulded</b> and the milled fans is the ability of the <b>rotomoulded</b> fan to be deformed easier than the milled fan. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine on the one hand the influence of the blade thickness and on the other hand the way the deformation of the hollow blades may affect the global and the local performances. The global performances of the fans were measured in a test bench designed according to the ISO 5801 standards. The curve of the aerodynamics characteristics (pressure head versus flow rate) and of the global efficiency are slightly lower for the <b>rotomoulded</b> fan. The wall pressure fluctuations were also investigated for three flow rates: one corresponding to the maximum efficiencies of both fans and two others corresponding to an under-flow and an over-flow rate. The power spectral density (PSD) levels, estimated by the Welch method, are between six and nine times higher for the <b>rotomoulded</b> fan at nominal flow rate. At partial flow rate, however, the PSD levels are close for both fans...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} Aerodynamic {{performance}} of axial-flow fans was carried out. Two fans that differ {{only in the}} thickness of their blades were studied. The first fan (Fref), which is the reference, {{was designed to be}} part of the cooling system of an automotive vehicle power unit and has conventional thin blades. The second fan (Ftck) has much thicker blades compatible with the <b>rotomoulding</b> conception process that generates only hollow parts with large edge radius. The global performances of the fans were measured in a test bench designed according to the ISO- 5801 standard. The curve of aerodynamics characteristics (pressure head versus flow rate) is slightly steeper for the fan with thick blades, and its efficiency is lower than the efficiency of the fan with thin blades. To go further in the comparison, we also studied the wall pressure fluctuations at the casing wall in another normalized test bench, for two flow rates corresponding to the maximum efficiencies of the two fans. The total level of fluctuations is lower for the thick blades fan that for the thin blades fan, which is counter-intuitive. The spectral composition of the wall fluctuations are moreover very different for the two fans. These measurements will be used as a benchmark for high-order finite volume CFD codes developed for aeroacoustics in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a facile method of synthesizing {{graphite}} nanoplatelets from commercial expandable graphite and use these as functional fillers in rotational moulding applications and phase change materials for energy storage. Two commercial expandable graphites were evaluated as precursors for the synthesis of graphite nanoplatelets. Microwave radiation treatment was shown to be more efficient in exfoliating expandable graphite than furnace heating. The expandable graphite with better exfoliating characteristics was selected. XRD results of this graphite showed that it was a high stage graphite intercalation compound. Graphite nanoplatelets with an average particle size of 13 μm and an estimated thickness of about 76 nm were prepared by microwave exfoliation and ultrasonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation in isopropanol from the selected expandable graphite. Prior to the selection of isopropanol as the ultrasonication media, various exfoliation media that encompassed different solvents and water with various surfactants had been evaluated, on the basis of their acoustic cavitation characteristics. The graphite nanoplatelets were used as a functional additive to fabricate linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) based nanocomposites using the rotational moulding (<b>rotomoulding)</b> process. The dry blending approach yielded surface resistivities within the static dissipation range (antistatic) at filler loadings as low as 0. 25 wt. % (0. 1 vol. %). However, even at this low graphite content, impact properties were significantly reduced compared to the neat polymers. Bilayer mouldings via the double dumping method proved to be a feasible approach to achieve both acceptable mechanical properties and antistatic properties. This was achieved by <b>rotomoulding</b> nanocomposites with a 1 mm outer layer containing the filler and a 2 mm inner layer of neat LLDPE. Excellent fire resistance, in terms of cone calorimeter testing, was achieved when the outer layer also contained 10 wt. % expandable graphite. Pseudo binary mixtures of stearyl alcohol/commercial triple pressed stearic acid where prepared and characterized as a new phase change material (PCM) for energy storage. A facile method of preparing highly thermally conductive stearyl alcohol/stearic acid phase change material/graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) nanocomposites was developed. Inclusion of the GNPs in the PCM matrix reduced the enthalpy of melting and crystallization marginally. However, the PCM/nanocomposite exhibited negligible super cooling. At 10 wt. % loading, the graphite nanoplatelets enhanced the thermal conductivity of the PCM by close to 600 % and 1200 % in the solid and molten states, respectively. Thermal conductivity modelling showed that the substantial thermal conductivity enhancement was as a result of relatively low interfacial thermal resistance between the PCM matrix and GNPs. The PCM/GNPs nanocomposites also showed excellent thermal reliability after being subjected to accelerated thermal cycling tests of 100 melting and freezing cycles. Settling tests showed the PCM/GNPs nanocomposite with 10 wt. % GNPs was stable after 60 days, with no apparent separation between the PCM matrix and the graphite nanoplatelets.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of specific rotomoulded products being developed at a local company, reinforcement of the hollow core of the products with reaction injection moulded polyurethane (RIM PU) foam was investigated. Improvement of the foam mechanical properties was also investigated, with density variation {{and the addition of}} short glass fibre reinforcement. Testing showed the foam's mechanical properties were not directly relative to density. When foam density was doubled from 300 to 600 kg/m 3, the tensile strength increased by a factor of 2. 7 and the modulus by a factor of 2. 5. For ME 1020 (fibre type) 6 mm chopped fibre reinforced foam, these increases were larger, at factors of 3. 0 and 2. 6 for strength and modulus, respectively. For 300 kg/m 3 foam, fibre made negligible difference to the tensile strength, but the ME 1020 reinforced foam was found to have 29 % higher modulus than the neat foam at the same density (for 5 wt% fibre composites). The 101 C (fibre type) reinforced foam performed poorly, even showing a decrease in strength when compared to the neat foam at 600 kg/m 3 (for 5 wt% fibre composites). The bending creep properties of reinforced foam was found to be higher than that of the neat foam in most cases, with ME 1020 fibre composite foam performing better than 101 C fibre reinforced composites in all cases. 5 wt% ME 1020 fibre reinforced foam was found to have impact strengths over twice that of neat foams at the same density. Impact strength improvements were also seen for 101 C fibre reinforced foam, but to a lesser extent for both foam densities tested. Morphological analysis of foam tensile fracture surfaces was undertaken and many interesting observations were made. Features such as cell elongation and fibre alignment with the foam flow direction were consistent with foam literature, but some unique features were observed. These include a localised 'string' cell packing trend, and also microscopic areas of localised plastic deformation in cell walls, which were visible as wrinkled surfaces on the foam cell walls. Modification of the (rotomoulded) skin to foam interface was investigated, as this parameter will likely affect the service performance of the whole product. Experimentation with various methods to increase the skin/foam interfacial shear strength was undertaken, and large improvements were attained with methods trialled and developed. These included adding particles to the <b>rotomoulding</b> charge, which became embedded in the inner skin of the moulded part, and protrude from the inner surface. These particles 'key' into the foam which fills the product's hollow core. Other interfacial shear strength improvement concepts for equipment to be developed were also proposed. One concept proposed is an innovative modification to plasma treatment equipment currently available, which could be used to treat the inner surface of hollow products, to improve the bonding between the inner rotomoulded surface and the foam. Another concept is proposed which may oxidise the inner rotomoulded part surface, but, only {{at the very end of}} the <b>rotomoulding</b> cycle, so that the bulk polymer is not degraded. The purpose of this deliberate oxidation is to achieve results similar to those attained by plasma or flame treatment currently used by industry for improving the wettability of PE products...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRotational molding of foamed {{polyethylene}} {{has increasingly}} {{become an important}} process in industry because of its thicker walls, low sound transfer, high stiffness and good thermal insulation. However, the foaming process of polyethylene during rotational molding has not been well studied. The focus of thisarticle is to assess the rotomoldability of foamed polyethylene and to investigate how LLDPE foam influence the process of rotational molding and the final product quality. Rotational molding experiments are carriedout in a laboratory scale biaxial machine. Impact tests and melt flow property are performed on the rotationally molded parts. It is found that the MFI and impact strength of <b>rotomoulded</b> product increases as the foam percentage increases up to 6 % after which both decreases. Therefore it is concluded that 6 % of foam is the optimum level to obtain sufficient melt flow index and better impact strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscosity}} {{during the}} earlier {{stages of the}} gelation process of plastisols formulated with 15 different commercial plastici-zers has been obtained. Plastisols prepared were rotomoulded and mouldings obtained were characterized according to their wall thickness distribution. This parameter strongly depends on the minimum viscosity and on the rate of viscosity change during gelation (slope of the curves during the viscosity in-crease), and also on the temperature where no more flow of the plastisol is observed (gelation temperature). These vari-ables are conditioned by {{the characteristics of the}} plasticizer and PVC employed, among other variables. The effect of plate and arm velocity and rotation rate on the wall thickness distribution was also studied. A simple model has been proposed to correlate the initial stage of the gelation of PVC plastisols formulated with the phthalate plasticizers. The suggested model assumes that the plastisol is a suspension constituted by a continuous phase (in-itially pure plasticizer) and a discontinuous phase constituted by PVC particles. It has been considered that the viscosity of the plastisol is influenced by the average mass molecular weight of the continuous phase and the temperature. The quan-tity of PVC dissolved in the continuous phase has been calcu-lated by using a generic n-order kinetic equation for PVC dis-solution rate. Additionally, a swelling process of the PVC particle by the plasticizer has also been considered and its ef-fect on the viscosity of the suspension has also been accounted for. The model proposed provides a very good fitting of the sharp viscosity increase observed and is useful to predict the evolution of the viscosity of the parts in a <b>rotomoulding</b> pro-cess. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{study the effects of}} blade {{thickness}} on the performances of an axial-flow fan. Two fans that differ only in the thickness of their blades were studied. The first fan was designed {{to be part of the}} cooling system of an automotive vehicle power unit and has very thin blades. The second fan has much thicker blades compatible with the <b>rotomoulding</b> conception process. The global performances of the fans were measured in a test bench designed according to the ISO- 5801 standard. The curve of aerodynamics characteristics (pressure head versus ow-rate) is slightly steeper for the fan with thick blades, and the nominal point is shifted towards lower flow-rates. The efficiency of the thick blades fan is lower than the efficiency of the fan with thin blades but remains high on a wider flow-rate range. The mean velocity field downstream of the rotors are very similar at nominal points with less centrifugation for the thick blades fan. The thick blades fan moreover maintains an axial exit-flow on a wider range of flow-rates. The main dierences concern local properties of the flow: Phase-averaged velocities and wall pressure fluctuations strongly differ at the nominal flow-rates. The total level of fluctuations is lower for the thick blades fan that for the thin blades fan and the spectral decomposition of the wall fluctuations and velocity signals reveal more harmonics for the thick blades fan, with less correlation between the different signals. For this kind of turbomachinery, the use of thick blades could lead to a good compromise between aerodynamic and acoustic performances, on a wider operating range...|$|E
