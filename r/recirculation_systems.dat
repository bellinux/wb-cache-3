5000|$|Recirculation systems: Since a {{tankless}} {{water heater}} is inactive when hot water is not being used, they are incompatible with passive (convection-based) hot water <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b> They may be incompatible with active hot water <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> and certainly use more energy to constantly heat water within the piping, defeating one of a {{tankless water heater}}'s primary advantages. On-demand recirculating pumps are often used to minimize hot water wait times from tankless water heaters and save water being wasted down the drain. On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop. Single-cycle pumping events only occur when hot water is needed thereby preventing the energy waste associated with constantly heating water within piping.|$|E

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{was performed on}} the use of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>system</b> for the mass culturing of rotifers at industrial level. Rotifer culture systems with a culture volume of 750 l were operated at three different stocking densities (3000, 5000 and 7000 individuals ml - 1) in a completely closed <b>recirculation</b> <b>system.</b> At all operating rotifer densities, a reliable production of 2. 2 billion rotifers could be obtained on a daily basis during 3 weeks. Excellent water quality was maintained by the use of protein skimmers, the use of ozone and a submerged biofilter. The microbial counts remained stable during the whole culture period (10 6 CFU ml - 1 on marine agar and 10 4 CFU ml - 1 on TCBS after 15 and 23 days, respectively). No difference in HUFA and protein content were obtained between rotifers harvested from the <b>recirculation</b> <b>system</b> or from a conventional batch culture system. Compared to a commercial batch culture system, the use of a <b>recirculation</b> <b>system</b> can contribute to a 43 % saving on the capital investment and the annual operation cost. By using this system, capital investment cost is considerably reduced by 46 %. Savings are also made on labour cost (65 %) and feed cost (21 %) during a 1 -year production.

50|$|Modern fish feeds {{are made}} by {{grinding}} and mixing together ingredients such as fishmeal, vegetable proteins and binding agents such as wheat. Water is added and the resulting paste is extruded through holes in a metal plate. The diameter of the holes sets {{the diameter of the}} pellets, which can range from less than a millimetre to over a centimetre. As the feed is extruded it is cut to form pellets of the required length. The pellets are dried and oils are added. Adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure enables the manufacturers to make pellets that suit different fish farming methods, for example feeds that float or sink slowly and feeds suited to <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b> The dry feed pellets are stable for relatively long periods, for convenient storage and distribution. Feeds are delivered in bulk, in large bags—usually one tonne, or in 25 kilogram bags. Smaller quantities of specialist feeds are supplied for use in fish hatcheries. The three major manufacturers of fish feeds for aquaculture are Biomar, EWOS and Skretting.|$|E
50|$|Positioning (withdrawing or inserting) {{control rods}} is the normal method for {{controlling}} power when starting up a BWR. As control rods are withdrawn, neutron absorption decreases {{in the control}} material and increases in the fuel, so reactor power increases. As control rods are inserted, neutron absorption increases in the control material and decreases in the fuel, so reactor power decreases. Differently from the PWR, in a BWR the control rods (boron carbide plates) are inserted from below to give a more homogeneous distribution of the power: in the upper side {{the density of the}} water is lower due to vapour formation, making the neutron moderation less efficient and the fission probability lower. In normal operation, the control rods are only used to keep a homogeneous power distribution in the reactor and compensate the consumption of the fuel, while the power is controlled through the water flow (see below). Some early BWRs and the proposed ESBWR (Economic Simplified BWR made by General Electric Hitachi) designs use only natural circulation with control rod positioning to control power from zero to 100% because they do not have reactor <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

Water pipes sealed in brick and lime plaster were used. Water conservation and recirculation had gained importance in these dry areas.

40|$|<b>Recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> create unique {{environments for}} fish culture. Opportunistic {{microorganisms}} may cause disease due to favorable conditions occurring in <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems.</b> The biofilters used may become reservoirs of infectious microorganisms. Stressful {{conditions such as}} suspended solids in culture tanks and high rearing densities may contribute to disease outbreaks. Additionally, non-infectious problems such as high nitrite, elevated carbon dioxide or high ozone levels may cause mortalities or produce stress. The major infectious diseases which have been encountered in trout reared in <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems</b> include: bacterial gill disease, furunculosis, amoebic infestation, Colegs sp. infestation, and the parasites Gyrodactylus, Chilodonella, Triichnoodaiina, Ichthyopthirius, and Ichtyobodo.

40|$|As {{environmental}} regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal {{are becoming increasingly}} more important in all aquaculture operations. One of the primary water quality parameters of concern is the suspended solids concentration in the discharged effluent. For example, EPA initially considered the establishment of numerical limitations for only one single pollutant – total suspended solids (TSS). For <b>recirculation</b> <b>systems,</b> the proposed TSS limitations would have applied to solids polishing or secondary solids removal technology.
