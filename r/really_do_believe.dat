His beliefs matter to him {{both on and off}} the track: [...] "I'm a religious man, so I really believe in my God-given ability, that I can do the unexpected. I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E
500|$|On September15,2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warren Campbell filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carey at the [...] 9th Circuit for {{copyright}} infringement, [...] "reverse passing off" [...] and false designation, claiming that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] borrowed heavily from a song they composed called [...] "One of Those Love Songs". It was recorded by the R group Xscape in 1998 for their album Traces of My Lipstick. The lawsuit claimed that Carey wrongfully gave the songwriting credits to Jam and Lewis. Swirsky and Campbell had sold the rights of the song to So So Def Recordings in 1998. [...] "I'm a fan of Mariah Carey; this is nothing personal against her. But I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> there's accountability, and it's very clear what happened here. I've never sued anybody before", Swirsky said. According to the district court, an expert witness (chair of the Musicology Department at the University of California at Los Angeles) determined that the songs shared a [...] "substantially similar chorus". The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B. The expert further remarked that [...] "the emphasis on musical notes" [...] on the two songs was the same, which [...] "contribute to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs." [...] He presented a series of visual transcriptions of his observations. The transcriptions contained details about the pitch sequence of both the songs' chorus, melody, and bassline.|$|E

Then I remembered that such an event was said to have afflicted the old Egyptians in the hour of their pride because they would not [...] "let the people go." [...] Well, these blackguardedly Black Kendah were certainly worse than the Egyptians can ever have been; also they would not let us go. It was not wonderful therefore that Marût should be the victim of phantasies on the matter.|$|R

60|$|Here, in an {{age when}} a new rector had, ceased to be an all-absorbing topic in social life, was a new and {{somewhat}} exhilarating experience. And it may be privately confessed that there were some who sat in St. John's during those first weeks of his incumbency who would indignantly have repudiated the accusation that they were not good churchmen and churchwomen, and who nevertheless had queer sensations in listening to ancient doctrines set forth with Emersonian conviction. Some were courageous enough to ask themselves, in the light of this forceful presentation, whether they <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> them as firmly as they supposed they had.|$|R

60|$|In {{every town}} where we stay, though it be {{only for a}} day, we hold a regular levée or drawing-room, where I shake hands on an average with five or six hundred people, who pass on from me to Kate, and are shaken again by her. Maclise's picture of our darlings stands upon a table or {{sideboard}} the while; and my travelling secretary, assisted very often by a committee belonging to the place, presents the people in due form. Think of two hours of this every day, and the people coming in by hundreds, all fresh, and piping hot, and full of questions, when we are literally exhausted and can hardly stand.

Will it ever end, and can we bear the heavy mass of water we have taken on board, and which has let loose all the table furniture in the officers' mess, and has beaten {{open the door of}} the little passage between the purser and me, and is swashing about, even there and even here? The purser snores reassuringly, and the ship's bells striking, I hear the cheerful 'All's well!' of the watch musically given back the length of the deck, as the lately diving partition, now high in air, tries (unsoftened by what we have gone through together) to force me out of bed and berth.|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{tremendous}} feeling that Beatles <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> all this, and they'd very consciously written an anthemic piece that could be understood worldwide.

Mrs Varden was but a woman, and had her share of vanity, obstinacy, and love of power. She entered into a secret treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, with her insinuating visitor; and <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>believe,</b> as many others would have done who saw and heard him, that in so doing she furthered the ends of truth, justice, and morality, in a very uncommon degree.|$|R
