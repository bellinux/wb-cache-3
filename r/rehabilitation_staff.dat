The effort-reward imbalance and staff job satisfaction were measured using self-administered survey questionnaires. A comparatively higher effort reward imbalance ratio and low satisfaction in work is seen for foreign nationals, respiratory therapists and night schedule workers. The age, higher educational levels of the therapists and adult, geriatric and inpatients' caseloads are also positively associated with a high effort reward imbalance ratio. Job satisfaction of <b>rehabilitation</b> services <b>staff</b> based on the Effort Reward Imbalance Model is significantly correlated to the variables of age, nationality, rehabilitation specialty, work schedule {{and the type of}} patients treated which reflects an increased work stress for these professional categories.

5000|$|AEGIS {{published}} Sans Everything in 1967. Chapters by {{nurses and}} social workers, together with Robb's 'Diary of a Nobody', described scandalous inhumane and inadequate care in long-stay wards in seven hospitals. Wards were over-crowded and under-staffed. Undignified and unkind practices included: rough handling, teasing, slapping, swearing at patients and rushed 'production-line' bathing of over 40 elderly and frail {{patients in a}} single morning. There was little, if any, privacy, including for personal care. Bed time could be as early as 5 pm. Some wards were locked and un-staffed at night, with senior staff disregarding the risks, for example, of fire. There was lack of medical attention, and usually no attempt at <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Staff</b> were rarely deliberately cruel, but harsh, disrespectful and patronizing nursing practices, especially for older people, were accepted by staff as standard. The practices often evolved from attempts to devise time-saving methods {{to get through the}} workload and manage large numbers of patients in overcrowded environments, or were due to ignorance of modern psychiatric and geriatric treatment and care. Widespread, excessively pessimistic, stereotypic understanding of inevitable and hopeless chronic decline in old age, pervaded and contributed to staff negativity. Staff who complained or wanted to change practices were accused of being disloyal, and could be victimized to the point of resigning or being dismissed from their posts. Sans Everything proposed remedies, including: specialist psychiatric services to treat, rehabilitate and support mentally unwell older people, based on the model practised at Severalls Hospital in Colchester, which prevented admission and enabled discharge; building homes for rent on surplus land around the psychiatric hospitals to generate income for the NHS to pay for better services and accommodation for older people; and ways of monitoring to ensure high standards, through improved NHS complaints procedures, a hospital ombudsman and an inspectorate. [...] Discussion at the Ministry did not lead to action.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{describe}} what nursing and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff</b> know and do {{with regard to}} urinary incontinence and risk of urinary incontinence in patients 65 years or older undergoing hip surgery. Background: Urinary incontinence is a common but often neglected issue for older people. Despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines on how to assess, manage and prevent urinary incontinence, {{there are indications that}} these guidelines are not applied in hospital care. Design: A qualitative study with descriptive design was conducted in two orthopaedic units. Methods: Forty-six interviews and 36 observations of care were conducted from January-October 2014 and analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results: Enrolled nurses performed most of the care related to bladder function, with focus on urinary catheterisation and preventing urinary tract infection and urinary retention. Registered nurses' role in urinary matters mainly comprised documentation, while the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff</b> focused on making it possible for the patient to be independent in toileting. The nursing staff considered urinary incontinence a common condition for older people and that it was convenient for the patients to have an indwelling catheter or incontinence pad/pant, although they acknowledged some of the risks associated with these procedures. Conclusions: Urinary incontinence is not a priority in orthopaedic care, and urinary incontinence guidelines are not applied. Further, attitudes and actions are mainly characterised by a lack of urinary incontinence knowledge and the nursing and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff</b> do not take a team approach to preventing and managing urinary incontinence. Relevance to clinical practice: An increased focus on knowledge on urinary incontinence and evidence-based guidelines is needed.

40|$|Objective. To use Donebedian 2 ̆ 7 s Structure-Process-Outcome Model to {{investigate}} Structure* (facility-level) and Process (assistive technology (AT) services) factors on assistive technology device (ATD) prescription (Outcome), controlling for individual-level factors. *Only structure results are presented. Background. ATDs enhance the independence {{and quality of}} life of individuals with disabilities. AT research is challenging because both individual needs and properties of device must be considered. This research looks at ATD provision from multiple perspectives: device, service, individual and facility-level factors. Our prior research found that geographic, small area variation was as strong a predictor of ATD prescription as individual-user need. Methods. A retrospective, population-based (Veterans) design was used. Records from the Functional Status Outcomes Database, National Prosthetic Patient Database, and Medical SAS Datasets for Veterans treated by the VA for stroke during 2007 - 08 were merged. Logistic regression was performed for each of the 11 types of activities of daily living and mobilityrelated ATDs. The predictor variables were facility complexity, CARF certification, <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staffing</b> in FTE, and rehabilitation workload in encounters. The outcome variable was provision of ATDs. Results. Facility-level factors were significant for some but not all types of ATDs. Hispanics, blacks were more likely to receive standard manual wheelchairs, patient lifts, beds, toileting and bathing devices. Veterans who were prescribed ATDs typically had lower physical function but higher cognitive function. C-statistics ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 79; pseudo r 2 ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 09; max-rescaled r 2 ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 15. Conclusion. User-need alone does not determine ATD prescription. Facility-level factors, in addition to individual factors, are significant predictors of some types of ATDs prescribed by the VA. Grants.

40|$|Purpose/Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} among <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff</b> members ’ observations {{of the extent to}} which attention and memory functioning interfered with participants ’ rehabilitation progress and the relationship between these observations and neuropsychological testing. Research Method/ Design: Participants were 39 adults admitted to a Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities-accredited, acute physical medicine rehabilitation unit who were referred for neuropsycholog-ical assessment. For study purposes, participants were administered the Mental Control subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale—Third Edition (D. Wechsler, 1997) and the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (R. A. Stern & T. White, 2003). Occupational therapists, physical therapists, and nurses were asked to rate the extent to which participants ’ attention/concentration and memory interfered with their progress in rehabilitation. Results: Staff ratings of participants ’ attention or memory functioning interfering with rehabilitation progress were strongly and most closely related to their own ratings of the other cognitive domain. Objective attention and memory test performance were weakly and nonsignifi-cantly correlated with each other. Relationships between staff observations and test data were also weak.

40|$|Background: Preterm infants are at {{risk for}} neurodevelopmental disorders, {{including}} motor, cognitive or behavioural problems, which may potentially be modified by early intervention. The EU CareToy Project Consortium ([URL]) has developed a new modular system for intensive, individualized, home-based and family-centred early intervention, managed remotely by <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff.</b> A randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of CareToy training in a first sample of low-risk preterm infants. Methods/Design: The trial, randomised, multi-center, evaluator-blinded, parallel group controlled, is designed according to CONSORT Statement. Eligible subjects are infants born preterm without major complications, aged 3 - 9 months of corrected age with specific gross-motor abilities defined by Ages & Stages Questionnaire scores. Recruited infants, whose parents will sign a written informed consent for participation, will be randomized in CareToy training and control groups at baseline (T 0). CareToy group will perform four weeks of personalized activities with the CareToy system, customized by the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff.</b> The control group will continue standard care. Infant Motor Profile Scale is the primary outcome measure and a total sample size of 40 infants has been established. Bayley-Cognitive subscale, Alberta Infants Motor Scale and Teller Acuity Cards are secondary outcome measures. All measurements will be performed at T 0 {{and at the end of}} training/control period (T 1). For ethical reasons, after this first phase infants enrolled in the control group will perform the CareToy training, while the training group will continue standard care. At the end of open phase (T 2) all infants will be assessed as at T 1. Further assessment will be performed at 18 months corrected age (T 3) to evaluate the long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. Caregivers and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>staff</b> will not be blinded whereas all the clinical assessments will be performed, videotaped and scored by blind assessors. The trial is ongoing and it is expected to be completed by April 2015. Discussion: This paper describes RCT methodology to evaluate CareToy as a new tool for early intervention in preterm infants, first contribution to test this new type of system.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a social}} history of the Uganda Prisons Service in the late colonial and early post-colonial periods. Focusing particularly on prison officers, it advances four key arguments. Firstly, it argues that global visions of the prison were crucial in shaping the Service’s development, its institutional culture, and the professional identities of its personnel. From the late colonial period onwards, this vision was anchored on notions of penal welfarism, which positioned the prison as a centre of <b>rehabilitation,</b> <b>staffed</b> by professionals who possessed technical expertise. Secondly, the penal welfare model was combined {{with an emphasis on}} the prison’s role as a driver of economic development and a source of public revenue – features that were seen as compatible with penal modernity. Thirdly, this vision of the prison gave the Service a particular imaginative capital, which prison officers used as an important resource. It provided them with a common set of principles and norms through which to define their professional role. Senior officers adopted it with alacrity, pursuing further professionalization through engagement with transnational penal reform networks. Others summoned it as a source of claim-making, using it to call on the state to provide them with greater benefits and treat them as respectable public servants. Finally, visions of penal modernity and professionalism were contested throughout the periods under study, leading officers to engage in boundary work. Officers were regularly defining their role in relation to other spaces of incarceration, such as local government prisons and informal detention sites. With the take-over of Idi Amin in 1971 and the militarization of the state, prison officers’ professional identities were profoundly challenged, but also became particularly important, providing them with a conceptual boundary that at least partially demarcated them from Amin’s regime. Ultimately, the case of the Uganda Prisons Service reminds us of the importance of studying prisons beyond their coercive capacities, paying attention to how such institutions became the focal point of debates over modernity, authority, and professionalism. More broadly, this study challenges the narrative of failure that has dominated popular and scholarly portrayals of state institutions on the African continent, rejecting generic depictions of the postcolony as a site of chaos and disorder.
