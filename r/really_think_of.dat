500|$|After {{writing songs}} with themes of {{independence}} for Control and social injustice for Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson desired to devote {{her new album}} to love and relationships, describing the theme of her new album as [...] "intimacy" [...] and that [...] "exual communication {{is the name of}} the game." [...] She stated in an interview with David Wild for Rolling Stone that [...] "hile I was doing Rhythm Nation, I was thinking about how things were so hard, so regimented and so black and white... I thought I'd do something on the sexy side—which is hard for me since I grew up as a tomboy and don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> myself that way. But I think this album is more on the feminine tip." [...] She also commented on how her experience acting in Poetic Justice played a role in taking a new direction with her music. Speaking with biographer David Ritz, she stated that [...] "Rhythm Nation was a heavy record, and Poetic Justice was a heavy movie. I wanted to do something lighter but also daring... When I wrote the album, I was still in a poetic frame of mind, inspired by Maya's beautiful language. You can hear that inspiration or the interludes and especially on the song [...] "New Agenda". This time I felt much freer expressing myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the Battle of Agincourt, victory looks uncertain, and {{the young}} king's heroic {{character}} emerges in his decision to wander around the English camp at night, in disguise, so as to comfort his soldiers and determine what they <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him. He agonizes about the moral burden of being king, noting that a king is only a man. Before the battle, Henry rallies his troops with the famous St Crispin's Day Speech (Act IV Scene iii 18-67), referring to [...] "we few, we happy few, we band of brothers".|$|E

Don Ciccio speaks at angry length {{of how many people}} despise Don Calogero in spite of, or perhaps because of, his {{embodiment}} of a harsh reality - that [...] "every coin spent in the world must end in someone's pocket." [...] Don Calogero, a peasant moneylender, eloped with Angelica's mother, who was the daughter of a penniless Salina tenant. Don Calogero's father-in-law vowed revenge, but his corpse was later found, shot twelve times in the back.|$|E
2500|$|In October, Raisman competed at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tokyo. She became {{team captain}} when Sacramone was injured before the competition. [...] "I'm {{the oldest of}} all my siblings, so {{it just kind of}} came naturally," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as being the team leader; I just wanted to help the others out." [...] She contributed scores of 14.950 on vault, 14.866 on balance beam, and 14.666 on floor toward the American team's first-place finish. Individually, she placed fourth in the {{all-around}} with a score of 57.558. In event finals, she placed fourth on balance beam, scoring 15.066, and third on floor, scoring 15.000. Here Raisman became famous for her first tumbling pass (round off one and a half step out round off back handspring tucked Arabian double front to punch front layout (punch front tuck during 2011)) this pass was previously thought to be impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Dimmu Borgir's older {{releases}} (since 1994 to 1999) are, {{according to}} Allmusic journalist Bradley Torreano, {{strongly influenced by}} Darkthrone, Mayhem, Bathory, Emperor, Celtic Frost, Immortal, Venom and Iron Maiden. The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the band's second album, Stormblåst, to be [...] "the act's last true contribution to black metal". Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, Dimmu Borgir's third album, [...] "distinguished itself in two important areas, firstly forgoing their native language for English and secondly for its dramatic increase in synthesizer content". Significant experimentation started c. 2000, during the era of Spiritual Black Dimensions (due to the addition of Vortex's clean vocals, and the variety of musical ideas from then-new member Mustis), as well as Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia due to addition of influences from composers such as Antonín Dvořák, Enya, Richard Wagner and Frédéric Chopin. As the music strongly differed from the older, rawer black metal style, Jon [...] "Metalion" [...] Kristiansen called Spiritual Black Dimensions [...] "a fine case of melodic, over-produced symphonic metal. If you like this melodic style I can't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anyone doing it better [...] No, I wouldn't call this black metal. Read the interview with Funeral Mist for the right definition of black metal." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play {{as often as you}} did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did get to go to the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E
