5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{purpose is}} [...] "look-down/shoot-down" [...] capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler {{is also used}} for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles. Pulse-Doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation {{in close proximity to}} aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using nap-of-the-earth flying techniques and stealth technology to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require medium PRF which prevents range from being determined directly, and range ambiguity resolution processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. <b>Radial</b> <b>movement</b> is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces audible signals {{that can be used for}} threat identification.|$|E

40|$|In four {{experiments}} involving blindfolded subjects, constant {{errors in}} the haptic judgment of extent in the horizontal plane were found to relate consistently to the time and velocity of limb <b>movement.</b> <b>Radial</b> <b>movements,</b> executed at a slower speed and for a longer time, are judged longer than tangential movements of equal extent. The data {{were considered in relation}} to certain physiological and kinematic properties of the actively moving limb. Taken together with additional information on judgments of movement duration, the results suggest that the illusion of extent is modulated by the perception of differential time cues. In these terms, it was noted that the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with the L figure is another instance of the interaction of apparent space and time commonly found in studies of psychological relativity. Following Reid's (1954) documentation of the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with an L figure, recent {{studies have shown that the}} effect is functionally related to the components of radial and tangential exploratory arm movements as described earlier by Davidon and Cheng (1964). Specifically, <b>radial</b> arm <b>movements</b> toward and away from the body, whether along the sagittal or coronal planes, are judged longer than equal tangential movements along the front or side of the body. The effect operates regardless of the spatial separation of the two extents to be judged (Cheng, 1968) and independently of two different types of movement involving different joints and muscle groups (Day & Wong, 1971). As <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> are specific to the horizontal plane, no relative overestimation of haptic extent is found when the L figure is presented in the vertical (fronto-parallel) Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were completed at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, and supported by New Zealand University Grant...|$|R

The significance of the 0. 0008 -in. clearance curve is that, with design optimizing the seal cross section, it is expected that the seal flexibility could be increased, thereby resulting in a running clearance and thus a leakage flow comparable to those of a rigid seal with only 0. 0008 -in. clearance from an initial clearance of about 0. 0025 in.

50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure at right, threads of equal pitch and angle that have {{matching}} minor diameters, with differing major and pitch diameters, may appear to fit snugly, but only do so radially; threads that have only major diameters matching (not shown) could also be visualized as not allowing <b>radial</b> <b>movement.</b> The reduced material condition, due to the unused spaces between the threads, must be minimized {{so as not to}} overly weaken the fasteners.|$|E
50|$|By {{increasing}} the contact {{area of the}} ball bearings on the shaft to approximately 45 degrees, the side load and direct load carrying capabilities are greatly increased. Each nut can be individually preloaded at the factory to decrease the available radial play to ensure rigidity. This process not only increases the contact area, increasing direct loading capabilities, but it also restricts any <b>radial</b> <b>movement,</b> {{increasing the}} overhung moment capabilities. This creates a sturdier structure that can handle a very strenuous working environment.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{trajectory}} through the reactor, the ideal flow condition for a continuous reactor is plug flow (since this delivers uniform residence time within the reactor). There is however {{a measure of}} conflict between good mixing and plug flow since mixing generates axial as well as <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the fluid. In tube type reactors (with or without static mixing), adequate mixing can be achieved without seriously compromising plug flow. For this reason, these types of reactor are {{sometimes referred to as}} plug flow reactors.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} fluctuations {{specific to}} self-assemblies of biological molecules {{have been investigated}} further with ultrasonic techniques by using frog virus 3 (FV 3). We compared the ultrasonic properties of complete FV 3 virions and of several subparticles that may be obtained from this DNA virus: (i) the central nucleoprotein core versus its component DNA and proteins in a dissociated state; (ii) the core versus the capsidless subparticle, consisting of the core surrounded by the lipid membrane; and (iii) the complete virus versus the capsidless subparticle. The ultrasonic absorption by the core particle was quite large compared with the absorption by other nucleoprotein assemblies, suggesting that the core contains some organized structure. Both the core and the complete virus absorbed ultrasound more than did the capsidless subparticle. The difference spectrum for the virion relative to the capsidless subparticle may represent a single relaxation and is analyzed, by using a recent model, {{in terms of volume}} fluctuations due to <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> in the virion.

50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|R

50|$|The Lorentz force law is {{more easily}} {{used to explain}} the machine's behaviour. This law, {{formulated}} thirty years after Faraday's death, states that the force on an electron {{is proportional to the}} cross product of its velocity and the magnetic flux vector. In geometrical terms, this means that the force is at right-angles to both the velocity (azimuthal) and the magnetic flux (axial), which is therefore in a radial direction. The <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the electrons in the disc produces a charge separation between the center of the disc and its rim, and if the circuit is completed an electric current will be produced.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{validity}} of the assumption that intrinsic kinematic constraints, such as Listing's law, can account for the geometric features of three-dimensional arm movements. In principle, if the arm joints follow a Listing's constraint, the hand paths may be predicted. Four individuals performed 'extended arm', 'radial', 'frontal plane', and 'random mixed' movements to visual targets to test Listing's law assumption. Three-dimensional rotation vectors of the upper arm and forearm were calculated from three-dimensional marker data. Data fitting techniques were used to test Donders' and Listing's laws. The coefficient values obtained from fitting rotation vectors to the surfaces described by a second-order equation were analyzed. The results showed that the coefficients that represent curvature and twist of the surfaces were often not significantly different from zero, particularly not during randomly mixed and extended arm movements. These coefficients for forearm rotations were larger compared to those for the upper arm segment rotations. The mean thickness of the rotation surfaces ranged between approximately 1. 7 degrees and 4. 7 degrees for the rotation vectors of the upper arm segment and approximately 2. 6 degrees and 7. 5 degrees for those of the forearm. During frontal plane movements, forearm rotations showed large twist scores while upper arm segment rotations showed large curvatures, although the thickness of the surfaces remained low. The curvatures, but not the thicknesses of the surfaces, were larger for large versus small amplitude <b>radial</b> <b>movements.</b> In conclusion, when examining the surfaces obtained for the different movement types, the rotation vectors may lie within manifolds that are anywhere between curved or twisted manifolds. However, a two-dimensional thick surface may roughly represent a global arm constraint. Our findings suggest that Listing's law is implemented for some types of arm movement, such as pointing to targets with the extended arm and during <b>radial</b> reaching <b>movements...</b>|$|R

One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft (either directly or via a tappet (lifter) and pushrod) while the other end acts on the valve stem. When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm, the inside presses down on the valve stem, opening the valve. When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the inside rises, allowing the valve spring to close the valve.|$|E
50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a {{carrying axle}} {{connected to a}} coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the carrying axle results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction. However, the carrying axle is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the carrying axle swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running {{are more or less}} evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved and wear and tear reduced on wheel flanges and rails.|$|E
