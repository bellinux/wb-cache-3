For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow,</b> but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world".

Bill <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> when he met Danielle and assumed she was Karen's roommate. Fearful that Bill would be homophobic, Karen was adamant that Bill not find out Danielle was her spouse and that Caroline was their daughter, even as Karen arranged a job interview for Danielle at Spencer. Bill was intrigued by Danielle's international exploits as a freelance writer and thought that Danielle was coming on to him. But when Karen finally explained about her relationship with Danielle, Bill gave Karen his acceptance.|$|E
50|$|The Rogues' {{last game}} ever came at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium against the Houston Hurricane. The Rogues won, 6-1. Tony Field scored the final goal in Memphis Rogues history. He beat the goalkeeper {{and walked the}} ball into the net. When he arrived at the goal line, he got down on his knees and headed {{the ball into the}} net. More skeptical fans and that the Rogues were mathematically {{eliminated}} from the playoffs and the Hurricane only need one goal to qualify, <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> at the result. In the 1980 NASL goals of the year video, you can clearly see the Hurricanes standing still, allowing Field to give the fans one last show.|$|E

Fields merely <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow.</b> [...] "Gentlemen, this is only lemonade. For a little acid condition afflicting me." [...] He leaned on me. [...] "Would you be kind enough to taste this, sir?" [...] I took a careful sip — pure gin. I {{have always been a}} friend of the drinking man; I respect him for his courage to withdraw from the world of the thinking man. I answered {{the producers}} a little scornfully, [...] "It's lemonade." [...] My reward? The scene was snipped out of the picture.|$|E

5000|$|The St. Louis American {{called the}} world premiere {{production}} of 27 a [...] "flawless commissioned portrait of Gertrude Stein," [...] while Ray Mark Rinaldi of The Denver Post said that the opera [...] "tells a great American story, as well as American opera in the 21st century" [...] suggesting that [...] "it is every century's job to define the century before it, and 27 isn't afraid {{to do that with}} certainty and depth." [...] In her review for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Sarah Bryan Miller called the work [...] "serious fun" [...] praising Gordon's creation of [...] "hummable tunes and recurring themes, drama and sweetness, in a well-wrought score. Vavrek is Steinian without stealing Stein and keeps the story moving, for a clever, witty libretto," [...] while Anne Midgette of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Gordon clearly found much to inspire him in this libretto and subject, to judge from a score that has an engaging vitality from the opening bars, and is delightfully studded with allusions (a touch of Lakmé, a hint of Vanessa) and adroit vocal ensembles." [...] Heidi Waleson of The Wall Street Journal commented that [...] "the first thing that you notice about Ricky Ian Gordon's 27, an opera about Gertrude Stein that recently had its world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, is that it moves. Royce Vavrek, the librettist, taking his cue from Stein's own short phrases and cells of text, created a playful, quick-witted libretto that pushed Mr. Gordon beyond his trademark melodies into a brighter, friskier style." [...] Critic Scott Cantrell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "27 is an unabashedly populist treatment of a yeasty artistic period, in musical idioms that wouldn't have <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> in 1920s Paris," [...] and further described Gordon's score as [...] "tuneful, Frenchified neoclassicism" [...] likening it to the work of Lennox Berkeley and Aaron Copland.|$|E
40|$|George C. Williams and John Maynard Smith {{arrived at}} {{slightly}} different {{conclusions about the}} evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction, despite that both were staunch neo-Darwinians, simply because they approached the problem from different angles (life history vs. population genetics). This difference between their perspectives made them notice the so-called paradox of sexual reproduction for the first time. That is, Williams and Maynard Smith used their difference in perspective constructively, {{in order to raise}} a problem that had previously been overlooked by ‘monocular’ views. Evidence from before, during and after the recognition of the paradox supports this thesis of constructive difference. First, Maynard Smith had diagnosed the individual cost of sexual reproduction in full detail by 1958, but nobody <b>raised</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> for a decade. Second, both the correspondence between Williams and Maynard Smith and their publications show that they saw the same problem but against different backgrounds, because they viewed it from different perspectives. Third, further differences between Williams and Maynard Smith concerning the evolution of sex make no sense except {{in the light of the}} initial difference in their perspectives...|$|E

Stephen Holden said in his review in the New York Times that [...] "Pamela Isaacs has only to <b>raise</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> to strike sparks.

As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, {{and no one in}} the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves.|$|R

500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking {{shot out of the}} bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would <b>raise</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|R

40|$|As {{professors and}} tutors have {{traditionally}} had almost total {{control over the}} learning and assessment environment, for most students, the approach to assessment has changed little. The arrival of ‘new media’, ‘digital culture’ and ‘dispersed learning’ threatens this stability and control. Students {{are now able to}} operate in a more open, collaborative, interactive and distributed manner, and this fact challenges many of the traditional perceptions about what constitutes a ‘university experience’ and what are now ‘appropriate’ assessment tasks (Crisp, G,. 2009). Plagiarism is now part of daily life, wiki-referencing barely <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> and now, custom written essays are seen as a very real option for the time poor student. This paper will do three things.

By the end of the keynote I hope to have you <b>raising</b> <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> or two over the absolute necessity of this idea of ‘boy friendly pedagogies’ and reconnecting with your already vast resources to consider how to work with all children, boys included, in ways that will support their gender identities to flourish...|$|R
