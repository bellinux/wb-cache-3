A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (Weaver), S. neuquensis (Burckhardt) and S. quintucoensis (Weaver). S. quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank <b>ribs.</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae.

In the 1980 s, the genetic evaluation program using field records, so-called on-farm progeny testing, was first adopted in Oita, Hyogo, and Kumamoto prefectures. In this study, genetic trends for carcass traits in these 3 Wagyu populations were estimated, and genetic gains per year were compared among the 3 different beef cattle breeding programs. The field carcass records used were collected between 1988 and 2003.

This configuration resulted in high post machining scrap rates, primarily due to porosity associated with solidification shrinkage. Replacement of the sliding core assembly with a squeeze pin unit substantially reduced shrinkage porosity in the critical region, with consequent reductions in the scrap rate.

40|$|A {{new engine}} design concept, {{characterized}} by a single cylinder-double piston and a cycloid crank rotor instead of the conventional crankshaft has been developed recently by Gul & Co Development AB, Sweden. The rotor (crank disc) is equipped with an oval groove {{in the shape of}} a sinusoidal cycloid according to the expression Y=S(-Sin(2 ) /(2 )) where <b>S</b> is the <b>piston</b> stroke and  varies from 0 to 1. Inside the oval groove a ball rolls/ slides in order to transfer force from the piston to the rotor. Such a rotor contains groove surfaces for the valve movement control as well. Each turn of the rotor corresponds to four strokes for both the pistons. Thus, a full 4 -stroke engine cycle is developed for a single nonconventional crankshaft revolution. Having the extra freedom to select an optimal piston movement, the new design is believed to have the potential to provide low emissions, low noise levels and lower fuel consumption. Therefore, it has been subjected to an engine thermodynamics simulation, to provide an insight to engine performance. Simulation results and preliminary laboratory tests have shown that the optimized cycloid crank rotor, which further intensifies the reduction of the piston speed close to both dead centers, gives better conditions for the combustion processes, and thus a higher efficiency. Since the single cylinder-double piston with cycloid crank rotor displays better performance and reduced size compared to conventional combustion engines, it is believed that this new patented Swedish engine will compete with conventional engines in lawn movers, chain saws, outboard motors and other engines in similar small-scaled equipment...|$|R
40|$|The belt-rib {{concept for}} lifting {{surfaces}} with variable camber evolved at DLR recently {{as one of}} the most promising solutions for the adaptive wing. With the belt-rib idea the adaptive wing issue is approached in a new way: instead of a "mechatronic" solution with hinges or linear bearings a "structronic" solution is chosen, where distributed flexibility allows the desired shape changes. The resulting system is not only easier to maintain due to the absence of wear, but also is structurally more reliable and substantially lighter. The new concept evolves from the classical wing structure. The classical <b>rib,</b> which i <b>s</b> in charge of the wing section's stiffness, is replaced by a "belt rib," which allows camber changes within given limits while leaving the remaining in-plane stiffness properties of the section widely unchanged. The evolution of the belt-rib concept was accompanied by experimental tests on different prototypes. After a first development stage, in which mainly the system's shape adaptability and the overall stiffness properties were investigated, further steps followed, focused on manufacturing, weight optimization and strength aspects. Recent developments dealt with the construction of a model with solid-state hinges, realized as hybrid glass fiber-carbon-fiber reinforced composite s tructure. The model is actuated mechanically by cables, which can be replaced by multifunctional actuators-like shape memory wires-in the future. The paper opens with an introduction about shape control of aerospace structures and variable camber in particular, in which the major advantages of a "structronic" approach with respect to classical solutions are discussed. Then the fundamentals of the belt-rib concept are sketched, with some significant results of the feasibility proof phase, followed by the description of the last developments.

40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} {{are known for}} their gender equality agenda and policies. There have been different processes of collaboration on this issue conducted between the Nordic countries and Russia. In today s globalized world, the processes of learning from other countries experiences and transferring best practices in order to solve problems have become more common. However, the concept of universality of provided policy models have been criticized by various researchers since contexts play a great role in adaptation of transferring policies on the ground. Due to the fact that Nordic countries and Russia represent different political, social, and cultural contexts, domestication of the gender equality agenda occurs. Thus, this research, using the postcolonial critique on universality and Alasuutari s concept of domestication, examines how this domestication of the Nordic gender equality norms takes place in the Russian context. The research, first, presents conceptual and theoretical discussion, starting from the critique of universal understanding of knowledge, and the concept of contextuality. Then, the thesis moves on to discuss the main concepts of the study: policy transfer and domestication of transnational models. This is followed by discussion on the Nordic and Russian gender orders. I have chosen two cases to analyse policy transfer and domestication of Nordic gender models in Russia: the case of collaboration between the Nordic Council of Ministers and North-West Russia and the case of the activist Eve <b>s</b> <b>Ribs</b> project have been studied through means of interview conduction, participant observation and searching documents, websites, etc. for primary data.

This research found that domestication of the gender equality agenda is possible only regionally into current Russia. In general, the importance of local communal contexts and their peculiarities are underlined throughout the research. Moreover, the conclusion about differences in two layers of analysis has been made.

40|$|The {{origin of}} all {{stringed}} instruments {{is lost in}} the midst of time, and despite the most patient and laborious research on the part of famous savants, no positive information has as yet been furnished regarding this point. Knowledge of the subject is more or less conjectural, and all that has been definitely established is the existence of the predecessors of the violin - the English crewth, a six stringed bowed instrument which is conspicuous for its rectangular shape, which is strongly reminiscent of the Greek kithara; the rebec, an instrument in the shape of an elongated pear having two strings tuned a fifth apart and played with a bow; the viol da Gamba, an instrument held on or between the legs and played with a bow and usually having six strings; the Arabian rebab, an instrument that is found in various shapes, e. g. elongated boat, halved pear, trapezoid, rectangle, and usually with three strings; the vielle played with the bow, having four strings and a drone string; and the organistrum, a medieval stringed instrument, shaped somewhat like a lute or viol, whose strings were put in vibration by a rotating rosined wheel. This instrument usually had four unfingered strings which produced a drone,and two fingered strings. Caspar A. Duiffopruggar, named Tieffenbrucker, a Bavarian who became nationalized Frenchman, was long reputed to be the first maker of violins, but according to Vidal, Bachmann (1925) all the so-called Duiffopruggar violins are spurious, having been made by Vuillaume, who in 1827, conceived the idea of making violins after the pattern of a viola d 2 ̆ 7 amour built by the former. Vidal estimates that Duiffopruggar worked in Paris from approximately 1515 to 1530, but in spite of the contentions that he was a wonderful artist at inlay work, there is absolutely no proof existing of the authenticity of the violins he is said to have made. The creation of the violin as it is today concerning its shape is veiled in a mystery which the most ardent discussions on the part of specialists {{have not been able to}} solve. It is possible the paternity of the violin may be conceded to Gasparo da Salo, although it is more probable that Amati of Cremona and Maggini of Brescia may be considered the first to give the violin its present form; and in all events, the instruments made by the famous builders according to Bachmann (1925) are authentic in all their parts. According to Farga (1940) it is with Gasparo da Salo that we enter for the first time the field of recorded history in violin-making. That da Salo made instruments at Brescia from 1560 to the year of his death, 1609, is indisputable. Whether the first violins were made by Maggini, da Salo, or by Andrea Amati, the fact remains that they originated during that period. The violins of da Salo were well built, although their appearance does not show the perfection of the later makers. His violins have backs of first class maple, low <b>ribs,</b> large F-hole <b>s,</b> and a dark brown translucent varnish. Giovanni Paolo Maggini was the most important of da Salo 2 ̆ 7 s pupils. Farga 1940) states that he took over da Salo 2 ̆ 7 s workshop after the latter 2 ̆ 7 s death. By that time, the name of Brescia had become famous all over the world owing to da Salo 2 ̆ 7 s instruments. Maggini never ceased experimenting, and improving over da Salo 2 ̆ 7 s models. Unfortunately, very few of Maggini 2 ̆ 7 s instruments have survived, but those that have sta nd up to modern requirements.
