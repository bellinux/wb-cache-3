50|$|After MA-1 was {{destroyed}} in-flight {{due to a}} structural failure, NASA began requesting that Convair deliver Atlases with thicker skin. Atlas 10D (as well as its backup vehicle 20D which was later used for the first Atlas-Able flight), the booster used for the Big Joe test in September 1959, had sported thick skin and verified that this was needed for the heavy Mercury capsule. Atlas 100D {{would be the first}} thick-skinned booster delivered while in the meantime, MA-2's booster (67D) which was still a thin-skinned model, had to be equipped with a steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>band</b> at the interface between the capsule and the booster. Under original plans, Atlas 77D was to have been the booster used for MA-3. It received its factory rollout inspection in September 1960, but shortly afterwards, the postflight findings for MA-1 came out which led to the thin-skinned 77D being recalled and replaced by 100D.|$|E
50|$|Cover, Water Canteen - The group {{rejected}} the test item and retained the M-1967 nylon water canteen cover modified by stiffening the closing flaps {{so that they}} would not collapse and interfere with the insertion of the water canteen; to enlarge the water canteen cover somewhat for easier insertion and extraction of the water canteen cup; to add a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>band</b> {{to the inside of the}} water canteen cover to help prevent the lip of the water canteen cup from rubbing through; and add a grommet drain hole in the bottom. As requested by the NCO Board, the test cover was made without a pile liner, whose purpose was to provide evaporative cooling, and with openings in the bottom to provide better drainage and to make extraction of the water canteen cup easier. However, the test indicated that the pile liner added shape to the water canteen cover and kept it from collapsing completely when empty, making insertion of the water canteen cup much easier. The tests also determined that the openings in the bottom constituted a camouflage hazard as the metal of the water canteen cup bottom was exposed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} Reinforced Hollow Inter- Locking (HIL) Block Masonry {{which offers}} several advantages like cheaper and faster construction, efficient interlocking {{in different directions}} to withstand shear and bearing forces, self alignment to ensure accurate and simple construction practice and to construct both load bearing and non-load bearing wall structure. The developed system is an alternative to traditional bonded masonry system as the blocks are stacked on one another and virtually rules out use of mortar for binding/seating and the interlocking protrusions provided in the blocks make the wall an integral unit. The walls can be reinforced with vertical and horizontal <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bands</b> as in any hollow block masonry. Presented in this paper are results of tests conducted on reinforced HIL block masonry under constant axial load and cyclic lateral loading. The effects of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bands</b> on the lateral resistance and ductility of the walls is studied. The experimental results are compared with the calculated capacity of the wall. As {{a result of the}} study, it is concluded that this type of masonry has adequate robustness and ductility and so can be used in moderately seismic areas...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a work analysis of wooden beams reinforced with glued composite bands {{from the top}} and resin inclusions, {{taking into account the}} rheology of materials. The paper presents numerical model of the multimaterial beam work including rheological phenomena described by linear equations of viscoelasticity. For the construction of this model one used MES SIMULIA ABAQUS environment in which were prepared its own procedures containing rheological models. The calculation results were compared with the literature data. One has done an analysis of the advisability of the use of CFRP <b>reinforcements</b> <b>bands</b> in terms of rheological phenomena...|$|R
30|$|Positive {{correlations}} were observed with closure type, wings <b>reinforcement,</b> and <b>band</b> width. Thus, attractiveness {{of the product}} relate in an inverse way to these attributes, suggesting they were considered less attractive in the chosen favorite products.|$|R
30|$|Arousal was {{positively}} correlated to the agreement that underwire and model are motives for choosing a bra as favorite, suggesting that high Arousal and these attributes are connected. Negative correlations were detected between Arousal and wings <b>reinforcement</b> and <b>band</b> width, demonstrating that the more relaxed women are when wearing a bra, the more they agree that the mentioned attributes are responsible for choosing a bra as favorite.|$|R
30|$|Valence {{has shown}} a {{positive}} relation with the agreement that wing <b>reinforcement</b> and <b>band</b> width {{are responsible for the}} bra choice, indicating that, the more pleasant wearing a bra is, the more is agreed that the referred technical attributes are responsible for choosing a bra as favorite. There is a negative association of Valence with underwire and model, indicating that, the more pleasant the situation of wearing a bra is, the less users agree that underwire and model are the causes of this experience.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outer cover}} was also giving cause for concern. An {{inspection}} by Michael Rope and J. W. W. Dyer, {{head of the}} Fabric Section at Cardington, undertaken on 20 January 1930 revealed serious deterioration of the fabric {{on the top of}} the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bands</b> along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope had shown that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original specified strength for the cover was a breaking strain of 700 lb per foot run (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m). The calculated load at a speed of 76 mph was 143 lb per foot run (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed. [...] An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new cover which would be doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show. For these flights the cover would be further reinforced. Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed and shortly afterwards, a 140 ft tear appeared on the right-hand side of the airship. It was decided to repair these at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the RAF pageant at Hendon could be made.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of optimum design of {{reinforced}} concrete (twoway ribbed) waffle slabs using genetic algorithms. Two case studies are discussed Í¾ the first is a waffle slab with solid heads, and the second is a waffle slab with band beams along column centerlines. Direct design method is used for the structural analysis and design of slabs. The cost function represents the cost of concrete, steel, and formwork for the slab. The design variables are taken as the effective depth of the slab, ribs width, the spacing between ribs, the top slab thickness, the area of flexural reinforcement at the moment critical sections, the band beams width, and the area of steel reinforcement of the beams. The constraints include the constraints on dimensions of the rib, and the constraints on the top slab thickness, the constraints on the areas of steel reinforcement to satisfy the flexural and the minimum area requirements, the constraints on the slab thickness to satisfy flexural behavior, accommodate reinforcement and provide adequate concrete cover, and the constraints on the longitudinal <b>reinforcement</b> of <b>band</b> beams. A computer program is written using MATLAB to perform the structural analysis and design of waffle slabs by the direct design method. The optimization process is carried out using the builtin genetic algorithm toolbox of MATLAB...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} material and geometric variables on the response of U-shaped band-reinforced metallic lugs was performed. Variables studied were reinforcement, adhesive and metallic lug mechanical properties, hole diameter, reinforcement and adhesive thickness, and the distance from the hole s center {{to the end of the}} lug. Generally, U-shaped band reinforced lugs exhibited superior performance than non-reinforced lugs, that is higher load at the conventional lug design criteria of four percent hole elongation. Depending upon the reinforcement configuration the increase in load may be negligible to 15 or 20 percent. U-shaped <b>band</b> <b>reinforcement</b> increases lug load carrying capability primarily through two mechanisms; increasing the slope of the response curve after the initial knee and restraining overall deformation of the metallic portion of the lug facilitating increased yielding of metallic material between the hole and the edge of the metallic portion of the lug...|$|R
