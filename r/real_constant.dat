[...] "Non-spinning" [...] means that it doesn't feel centrifugal forces, but in this coordinate frame it would actually be turning on an axis parallel to the y axis. As we shall see, the dust grains stay at constant values of x, y, and z. Their density in this coordinate chart increases with x, but their density in their own frames of reference is the same everywhere.|$|E
