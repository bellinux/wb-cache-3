5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I felt <b>really</b> disappointed, I {{believed in}} the record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a <b>really</b> tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I <b>really</b> believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
5|$|I reckon it <b>really</b> sums up {{just what}} I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you <b>really</b> do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and I could look people in the eyes and <b>really</b> try and deliver a song.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was <b>really</b> special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; <b>really</b> cool stuff, not typical. They're <b>really</b> fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos <b>really</b> tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|I'm <b>really</b> {{happy to}} do this. I feel rejuvenated by it, I feel excited again. You're very much alive, you're {{very much in the}} moment, so I feel I'm <b>really</b> living.|$|E
5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's <b>really,</b> I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm <b>really</b> proud of it because that's <b>really</b> one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has <b>really</b> very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|The theatre's {{capacity}} is 1,216seats on four levels. <b>Really</b> Useful Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly {{owned by the}} Stoll-Moss Group. Between 1990 and 1993, renovation and improvements {{were made by the}} H.L.M. and C. G. Twelves partnership. In 2014, <b>Really</b> Useful Theatres split-off from the <b>Really</b> Useful Group and owns the theatre.|$|E
5|$|Actors Johnny Flynn and George Mackay are to play Ray and Dave Davies, respectively, in Julien Temple biopic of legendary UK band The Kinks {{entitled}} You <b>Really</b> Got Me.|$|E
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie <b>really</b> wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie <b>really</b> got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is <b>really</b> tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just <b>really</b> brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was <b>really</b> upset my last day of filming because I <b>really</b> thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|Donna Murphy {{believed}} that Gothel did <b>really</b> love Rapunzel {{in her own}} way.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't <b>really</b> have it like they probably think I have it. I'm <b>really</b> still a loser guy, but I'm just <b>really</b> popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't <b>really</b> know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't <b>really</b> that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|I <b>really</b> {{wanted to}} sit down with Wale before I wrote the hook, because to me, it's <b>really</b> lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was <b>really</b> beautiful. People were all <b>really</b> excited like it was <b>really</b> my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|It was not <b>really</b> a feat. I just rode off {{and left}} them.|$|E
5|$|It's <b>really</b> a dance-off {{between a}} more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because we have to learn three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us <b>really</b> dance.|$|E
5|$|Keith David as John Garnett, Erin's {{father and}} Esquire's acquaintance. He is {{unaware of the}} fact that Esquire is lying about who he <b>really</b> is.|$|E
5|$|Mabel Rivera as Pilar, {{the head}} police {{psychologist}} who eventually discovers {{the truth of}} who Benigna <b>really</b> is.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy {{responded that}} {{what people do}} is irrelevant. He argued that what is <b>really</b> needed are {{machines}} that can solve problems—not machines that think as people do.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{is home to}} four opera companies, {{including}} the Minnesota Opera and the Mill City Summer Opera. In recent years, Skylark Opera Theatre and <b>Really</b> Spicy Opera have also gained national prominence – Skylark for its use of site-specific productions, and <b>Really</b> Spicy for its productions of new musicals and operas.|$|E
5|$|The Register (originally <b>Really</b> Good Stuff) is a termly {{newsletter}} documenting significant achievements at the school.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to <b>really</b> set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would <b>really</b> set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go <b>really</b> erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|The video {{reportedly}} cost £50,000. During the shoot, {{the video}} was documented by MTV; in the interview, Allen declared: I {{wanted to do}} a dance routine, even though I'm not <b>really</b> doing a dance routine, other people are doing it, but I'm part of it. I think people are quite used to girls in this industry <b>really</b> being able to move in front of the camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song <b>really</b> calls for not anything <b>really</b> fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music <b>really</b> calls for.|$|E
5|$|We <b>really</b> {{wanted to}} do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was <b>really</b> more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

25|$|Kevin Godley recalled:We {{did a lot}} {{of tracks}} {{in a very short time}} – it was <b>really</b> like a machine. Twenty tracks in about two weeks – a lot of crap <b>really</b> – <b>really</b> shit. We used to do the voices, {{everything}} – it saved 'em money. We even did the female backing vocals.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I <b>really</b> wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were <b>really</b> great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that <b>really</b> made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs <b>really</b> and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't a {{surprise}} to me. It <b>really</b> wasn't. I didn't <b>really</b> have any relationship with the AD. The guy — you guys saw him (Sunday) — the guy's a total p----. I mean, he is. He's a total c---.|$|E
25|$|We <b>really</b> {{hit it off}} and {{we would}} go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar <b>really</b> hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just <b>really</b> inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
