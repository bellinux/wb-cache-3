The aim of our study was to investigate the inhibitory effects on gastric acid secretion of a single oral administration of a proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole 20 mg, and an H 2 -receptor antagonist, <b>roxatidine</b> 75 mg. Methods: Ten Helicobacter pylori-negative male subjects participated in this randomized, two-way crossover study. Intragastric pH was monitored continuously for 6 h after single oral administration of omeprazole 20 mg and <b>roxatidine</b> 75 mg. Each administration was separated by a 7 -d washout period. Results: During the 6 -h study period, the average pH after administration of <b>roxatidine</b> was higher than that after administration of omeprazole (median: 4. 45 vs. 2. 65; P= 0. 0367). Also during the 6 -h study period, a longer duration of maintenance at pH above 2, 5, and 6 was observed after administration of <b>roxatidine</b> 75 mg than after administration of omeprazole 20 mg (median: 90. 6 % vs. 55. 2 %, P= 0. 0284; 43. 7 % vs. 10. 6 %, P= 0. 0125; 40. 3 % vs. 3. 3 %, P= 0. 0125; respectively).

40|$|The {{structural}} {{requirements of}} the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist, <b>roxatidine</b> (2 -acetoxy-N-(3 -[m-(1 -piperidinylmethyl) phenoxy]-propyl) acetamide hydrochloride), for the stimulant effect on mucin biosynthesis and their relation to histamine H 2 -receptor antagonism were identified by considering the structural analogues of this drug using an organ culture system of the rat stomach and competition studies with [125 I]iodoaminopotentidine ([125 I]-APT) binding to membranes of the guinea pig striatum. [3 H]Glucosamine incorporation into mucin during 5 [*]h incubation period was stimulated by <b>roxatidine</b> and its structural analogues A (2 -hydroxy-N-(3 -[m-(1 -piperidinylmethyl) phenoxy]-propyl) acetamide) and B (N-(3 -[m-(1 -piperidinylmethyl) phenoxy]-propyl) acetamide). This effect was seen in mucosal cultures of the corpus, but not antrum, region. Structural analogues, in which {{the length of the}} flexible chain between the benzene ring and the amide structure differs from that of <b>roxatidine,</b> failed to activate mucin synthesis. No significant change in mucus synthesis occurred with the addition of analogues in which the piperidine ring attached to the benzene ring via a methylene bridge was changed. Specific [125 I]-APT binding to the histamine H 2 receptor of guinea pig brain membranes was inhibited by <b>roxatidine</b> and all structural analogues used in this study, except F (N-(3 -[m-(N, N-dimethyl-aminomethyl) phenoxy]-propyl) acetamide). Ranitidine at 10 − 4 [*]M did not suppress the roxatidine-induced increase in [3 H]glucosamine incorporation into mucin. Roxatidine-induced stimulation of [3 H]glucosamine incorporation into mucin was completely blocked by the addition of either NG-nitro-L-arginine (10 − 5 [*]M) or 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5,-tetramethylimidazoline- 1 -oxyl- 3 -oxide sodium salt (10 − 5 [*]M). The inhibitory action of NG-nitro-L-arginine was totally reversed by L-arginine (5 × 10 − 3 [*]M). These results suggest that the cardinal chemical features of <b>roxatidine</b> for the activation of mucin biosynthesis in the corpus region of the rat stomach are the appropriate length of the flexible chain between the amide structure and the aromatic ring system bearing the methylpiperidinyl group at the meta position. The activity of <b>roxatidine</b> and its analogues to stimulate mucin synthesis is not related to their histamine H 2 receptor antagonistic activity. Roxatidine-induced activation of mucin biosynthesis in the corpus tissue is mediated by nitric oxide...|$|E

40|$|Gastric mucus {{glycoprotein}} {{is important}} for the protection of gastric mucosa from acid. UDP-galactosyltransfer-ase (UDP-Gal-T) is a key enzyme for the synthesis of gastric mucus glycoprotein. In this study, we investigted the effects of five acid-secretion blockers, cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, <b>roxatidine</b> and omprazole on the UDP-Gal-T activity in rat gastric mucosa to clarify the interaction of the acid-secretion blocker and the gastric mucosal barrier. Intraperitoneal administration of these drugs to rat increased pH of the gastric mucosal suface and significantly decreased the gastric UDP-Gal-T activies. When we administered citrate phoshate buffer (pH 2) to the rat stomach to inhibit the change of gastric pH induced by the acid-secretion blockers, the effecer of famotidine, <b>roxatidine</b> and omeprazole on UDP-Gal T activties were abolished, but cimetidine and ranitidine significantly decreased the enzyme activiyty When we incubated the acid-secretion blockers with the homogenates of ral gastric mucosa, cimetidine and ranitidine significantly dereased UDP-Gal-T activites, whreas the other drugs showed no apparent influence on the enzyme sctivity. These findins suggest that the acid-secretion blockers decrease gastric mucin synthesis via the increase of the intragastric pH. In addition, among the acid-secretion blockers stydied here, cimetidine and rantidine also have direct inhibitory effects on the gastric UDP-Gal-T activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{histamine}} H 2 -receptor antagonists, {{alone or in}} a combination with bismuth, on • OH-provoked degradation of deoxyribose were studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Published data on {{pregnancy}} outcome {{after exposure}} to H 2 -blockers is scarce. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the data collected by the memberships of the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS). METHODS: The patients were pregnant women who or whose doctor or midwife did contact a Teratology Information Service for risk assessment after the use of a H 2 -blocker in pregnancy. The data were prospectively collected, i. e. before the outcome of pregnancy was known. Standardized procedures for data collection were used by each centre. The data of the exposed women were compared to those of a control group exposed to non-teratogenic substances. RESULTS: Data on the outcome of 553 pregnancies with exposure to an H 2 -blocker were evaluated (ranitidine n= 335; cimetidine n= 113, famotidine n= 75; nizatidine n= 15, <b>roxatidine</b> n= 15). Most of them had been exposed at least in the first trimester. The incidence of premature deliveries was higher in the exposed group compared to the control group. There was no increase in the incidence of major malformations. Two pregnancies with maternal use of famotidine in early pregnancy were terminated after the prenatal diagnosis of a neural tube defect.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveRecent {{epidemiological}} studies identifying {{an association between}} some classes of gastric acid suppressants and Clostridium difficile colitis and community-acquired pneumonia prompted our analysis. Our objective was to retrospectively apply data mining algorithms (DMAs) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug safety database {{to see if they}} might have directed/redirected attention to the reported association of gastric acid suppressive drugs with C. difficile colitis and community-acquired pneumonia, prior to the published epidemiological findings that supported the association. DesignTwo statistical DMAs, proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), were applied to a spontaneous reporting system (SRS) database to identify signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs). ResultsSDRs related to community-acquired pneumonia were observed for two proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole and omeprazole), two H 2 antagonists (famotidine and <b>roxatidine),</b> and one antacid (magnesium silicate hydroxide). For C. difficile colitis, an SDR was generated for one proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole). ConclusionsAlthough our analysis suggests that there may be an association between the SDRs using SRS data and the epidemiological findings, these results may not have alerted public health professionals in advance of published studies to an association between proton pump inhibitors/gastric acid suppressants and C. difficile colitis or community-acquired pneumonia. However, the analysis reveals the potential utility of DMAs to direct attention to more subtle indirect drug adverse effects in SRS databases that as yet are often identified from epidemiological investigations...|$|E
40|$|Major {{physiological}} stress occurs during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. This {{is related to}} hypothermia and artificial organ perfusion. Thus, serious gastrointestinal complications, particularly upper gastrointestinal bleeding, sometimes follow cardiac surgery. We have compared the antisecretory effects of a preanesthetic H 2 antagonist (<b>roxatidine,</b> cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 group, n =  15) and a proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole, cardiopulmonary bypass-PPI group, n =  15) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and also compared in patients undergoing a off-pump {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery (off-pump cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 group, n =  15). Gastric pH (5. 14  ±  0. 61) and gastric fluid volume (13. 2  ±  2. 4  mL) at the end of surgery in off-pump cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 groups was significantly lower and higher than those in both cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 (6. 25  ±  0. 54, 51. 3  ±  8. 0  mL) and cardiopulmonary bypass-PPI (7. 29  ±  0. 13, 63. 5  ±  14. 8  mL) groups, respectively although those variables did not differ between groups after the induction of anesthesia. Plasma gastrin (142  ±  7  pg/mL) at the end of surgery and maximal blood lactate levels (1. 50  ± 0. 61  mM) in off-pump cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 group were also significantly lower than those in both cardiopulmonary bypass-H 2 (455  ±  96  pg/mL, 3. 97  ±  0. 80  mM) and cardiopulmonary bypass-PPI (525  ±  27  pg/mL, 3. 15  ±  0. 44  mM) groups, respectively. In addition, there was a significant correlation between gastric fluid volume and maximal blood lactate (r =  0. 596). In conclusion, cardiopulmonary bypass may cause an increase in gastric fluid volume which neither H 2 antagonist nor PPI suppresses. A significant correlation between gastric fluid volume and maximal blood lactate suggests that gastric fluid volume may predict degree of gastrointestinal tract hypoperfusion...|$|E
40|$|Sirs, We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the recent paper by Fujisawa et al. 1 showing that Helicobacter pylori infection prevents the occurrence of the tolerance phenomenon of histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RAs). They studied 20 healthy male volunteers who underwent 24 -h intragastric pH-metry on the first and 15 th day of administration of 20 mg b. d. famotidine and 10 mg b. d. lafutidine in a crossover fashion. The tolerance phenomenon was not observed in the seven H. pylori-positive subjects, whereas it occurred in the 13 H. pylori-negative ones. The Japanese Authors did not identify the precise mechanism responsible for this protection of H. pylori infection against the development of tolerance to H 2 RAs, although they excluded the possibility of H. pyloriinduced alteration of drug absorption and metabolism. They hypothesize that H. pylori-induced gastric mucosal atrophy may explain their findings, but this kind of histological abnormality capable of reducing gastric acid secretion was not assessed in their study and, more importantly, {{the mean age of}} their infected patients was 36. 7 years, i. e. too young to permit the development of atrophy of oxyntic mucosa in all of them. Several years ago, we have published a study 2 showing that tolerance was not found in a group of duodenal ulcer patients treated with a bedtime dose of <b>roxatidine</b> or ranitidine. At that time, we did not search for the presence of H. pylori infection, but we know that the germ has been detected in about 90 % of duodenal ulcer patients and, therefore, we can suppose that almost all our patients were infected. 3 Our results were in contrast with the demonstration of tolerance in virtually all studies that had been performed in healthy subjects, 4 – 6 but were in agreement with the results achieved in duodenal ulcer patients by others 7, 8 and are now confirmed by the findings of Fujisawa et al. 1 in H. pylori-positive normal subjects. In contrast with the hypothesis of a reduction in gastric acid secretion as effect of H. pylori-induced mucosal atrophy, we believe that an increased antisecretory action of H 2 RAs may prevent the development of tolerance in infected individuals. A series of papers not quoted by the Japanese authors, have specifically addressed this point. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} omeprazole produces a greater decrease in gastric acid secretion in subjects with H. pylori infection than in those who are H. pylori-negative 9 and the same effect has been later confirmed with the use of H 2 RAs in infected individuals, although to a lesser extent than with PPIs. 10 So, it is possible that this greater acid suppression induced by H. pylori infection and probably due to the presence of neutralizing ammonia produced by the germ in the stomach 11 further increases intragastric pH during treatment with antisecretory drugs. This effect may mask the occurrence of tolerance to H 2 RAs in infected subjects and, in keeping with our hypothesis, Labenz et al. 10 have shown that the intragastric pH during treatment with ranitidine depends on H. pylori infection and the tolerance to H 2 RAs develops after eradication of the germ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Biomolecules are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} potentially harmful oxidative stress {{as a consequence}} of free radical formation. Increased free radical generation has been associated with aging as well as neurodegenerative disorders. Antioxidants affect processes associated with oxidative stress by quenching free radicals and acting as oxygen scavengers. Parkinson's disease results from a deficiency in the neurotransmitter, dopamine and it is also evident that damage caused by free radicals {{play an important role in}} the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder. The histamine HI antagonist, diphenhydramine is used to treat mild cases of Parkinson's disease and cimetidine can scavenge hydroxyl radicals. The histamine H 3 antagonists are known to promote the release of dopamine. Together with a free radical scavenging activity, these compounds might have a dual therapeutic effect in the reduction of the progression of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was thus to determine whether histamine antagonists could act as free radical scavengers and to compare the results with aspirin, a known free radical scavenger. Ibuprofen was included to compare the free radical scavenging activities of aspirin to another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The free radical scavenging activities of the following compounds were determined and compared: diphenhydramine; cimetidine; roxatidine; clobenpropit; impentarnine; thioperamide; aspirin and ibuprofen. The ORAC assay was used to determine whether the test compounds were able to scavenge peroxyl radicals and the FRAP assay was used to determine the reducing abilities of the compounds. No meaningll results were obtained from these two assays, suggesting that the compounds were not able to act as direct antioxidants or as peroxyl radical scavengers. The comet assay was used to determine whether the compounds were able to reduce oxidative damage after MPTP administration. No damage was however obtained after a single dose of MPTP and it is suggested that one year old mice and chronic rather than acute treatment is used. Using a cyanide model to induce neurotoxic effects in rat brain homogenates, the neuroprotective properties of the histamine antagonists were examined and compared to aspirin. Superoxide anion levels and malondialdehyde concentrations were assessed using the nitrobluetetrazolium and lipid peroxidation assays. Clobenpropit and thioperamide significantly reduced superoxide anion generation and lipid peroxidation. At a concentration of lmM, these two histamine Hj antagonists reduced lipid peroxidation to values lower than that of the control. Impentamine reduced lipid peroxidation at all concentrations used and superoxide anion generation at a concentration of 1 mM. Diphenhydramine (0. 25 and 0. 5 mM) significantly reduced both variables at lower concentrations. Cimetidine (1 mM) was able to reduce superoxide anion generation and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation at all concentrations Abstract used. <b>Roxatidine</b> (0. 5 mM and 1 mM) significantly reduced the rise in superoxide anion generation and significantly reduced malondialdehyde concentration in a dose dependent manner. Ibuprofen significantly decreased superoxide anions in a dose dependant manner and lipid peroxidation at a concentration of 1 mM. In the lipid peroxidation assay, all the drugs compared favourably to aspirin. The in vivo free radical scavenging effects of the selected compounds were also examined with the nitroblue tetrazoliurn and lipid peroxidation assays. MPP' was used to induce a Parkinsonian like condition. Diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, thioperamide and clobenpropit significantly reduced free radical generation in both assays. Thioperamide and clobenpropit were able to reduce lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion generation to values lower than that of the control, suggesting that these two compounds could be able to attenuate normal free radical processes in the brain. Cimetidine did not have the expected in vivo scavenging effects and it is suggested that blood-brain barrier permeability might play a role. All the compounds, except diphenhydramine had significantly lower in vivo values than aspirin. The superoxide anion plays an important role in the formation of further free radicals. It leads to the formation of peroxyl radicals during the inititation step of lipid peroxidation and also leads to the generation of hydroxyl radicals, where transition metals like iron, is a key factor. Diphenhydramine at lower concentrations, and the newly discovered histamine Hj antagonists, clobenpropit and thioperamide significantly reduced superoxide anion generation and lipid peroxidation. Although the compounds did not have meaningful effects in the FRAY and ORAC assay, their significant ability to reduce lipid peroxidation and superoxide levels make them promising tools to attenuate oxidative damage. This study demonstrates the potential of these agents to be neuroprotective with a dual therpeutic effect by exerting a scavenging effect on superoxide anions and increasing dopamine levels.
