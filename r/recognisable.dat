5|$|Arguably {{the most}} iconic {{toadstool}} species, the fly agaric {{is a large}} white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, {{and is one of}} the most <b>recognisable</b> and widely encountered in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Airship Industries {{managed a}} major {{marketing}} coup with {{the inclusion of}} their Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries were producing a fleet of blimps which were <b>recognisable</b> over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals. As all Bond films have included the most current technology, this included the lighter than air interest.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a symbol}} of {{scientific}} or literary achievement that's <b>recognisable</b> worldwide, the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction. This includes films like The Prize and Nobel Son about fictional Nobel laureates as well as fictionalised accounts of stories surrounding real prizes such as Nobel Chor, a film based on the unsolved theft of Rabindranath Tagore's prize.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the many}} redecorations and renovations it has {{undergone}} in its 800years of existence, the Zytglogge {{is one of}} Bern's most <b>recognisable</b> symbols and, with its 15th-century astronomical clock, a major tourist attraction. It is a heritage site of national significance, {{and part of the}} Old City of Bern, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It {{is for this}} reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily <b>recognisable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily <b>recognisable</b> and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in late summer. Other non-native {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|Since October 2002, Critchlow has {{continued}} to develop his new artistic style in several different 2000 AD stories, contributing {{to the success of}} Lobster Random in particular. While Critchlow's use of muted palettes has been criticised, his style has received praise for being highly <b>recognisable</b> and unique.|$|E
5|$|The second romance, in A minor, {{an exuberant}} piece, {{has a strong}} semiquaver figure {{supporting}} the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later {{to become one of}} Fauré's most <b>recognisable</b> characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the modern, {{sweeping}} version of the madder and white livery was <b>recognisable</b> enough {{to be used with}} different colours; when East Lothian Buses (later Lothian Country Buses) was set up, their fleet used a version in green and beige (the colours of Scottish Midland Buses, which had once run similar routes before being absorbed by First).|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{are among}} the most <b>recognisable</b> and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. They have {{featured}} prominently in ancient mythology and folklore, and continue to be depicted in modern films and literature. They appear on many flags, coats of arms, and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Watts's {{composition}} echoes J. M. W. Turner's 1843 {{treatment of}} the same topic, Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts <b>recognisable</b> human figures, and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure abstract art as Watts's composition.|$|E
5|$|While {{there may}} have been the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, <b>recognisable</b> and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is also very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in {{the centre of the}} dining room, with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being <b>recognisable</b> from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not <b>recognisable</b> as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} <b>recognisable</b> to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
5|$|Famous authors {{include some}} of the world's most studied and praised writers. William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe defined England's Elizabethan period. The British Romantic {{movement}} {{was one of the}} strongest and most <b>recognisable</b> in Europe. The poets William Blake, Wordsworth and Coleridge were amongst the pioneers of Romanticism in literature. Other Romantic writers that followed these figure further enhanced the profile of Romanticism in Europe, such as John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Later periods like the Victorian Era saw a further flourishing of British writing, including Charles Dickens and William Thackeray.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component <b>recognisable</b> to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, one of {{the more}} <b>recognisable</b> canine stars was restaurateur and chef Rick Stein's irrepressible terrier Chalky, who {{frequently}} upstaged his owner on his various cookery series. He was unique in having his own line of merchandise, including plushes, tea towels, art prints, art paw prints and two real ales – Chalky's Bite and Chalky's Bark, which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009. Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Moore was President of the British Astronomical Association, {{co-founder and}} {{president}} of the Society for Popular Astronomy (SPA), author of over seventy books on astronomy, and presenter of the world's longest-running television series with the same original presenter, the BBC's The Sky at Night. As an amateur astronomer, he became known as a specialist in Moon observation and for creating the Caldwell catalogue. Idiosyncrasies such as his rapid diction and monocle made him a popular and instantly <b>recognisable</b> figure on British television.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very few pieces found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt. They are based roughly {{on the size of}} older Roman As and Sestertius in shape and thickness. The design also {{developed}} like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non <b>recognisable.</b> The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17mm.|$|E
5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew <b>recognisable</b> structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese dragon, {{which has}} symbolised unity of Chinese people {{since it was}} the first {{national}} emblem of unified China, is painted in multicolour on Block 15's south and north facing walls because it was the 500th public housing building in Hong Kong. Block 15's distinctive imagery made it a <b>recognisable</b> symbol of Lam Tin and the district's unity. After demolition and reconstruction, Block 15 became part of Ping Tin Estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily <b>recognisable</b> by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.|$|E
5|$|The breed is the {{smallest}} of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately <b>recognisable.</b> In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged {{on the grounds that the}} deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no <b>recognisable</b> remains. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where the fire started, shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the penny of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, {{the period in which}} the House of Hanover reigned, saw its {{transformation}} from a little-used small silver coin to the bronze piece <b>recognisable</b> to modern-day Britons, by 1901 struck in the tens of millions each year. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the blue sky and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting of a blue background over which is placed a white representation of an X-shaped cross, the Saltire is one of Scotland's most <b>recognisable</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{shows the}} view from the boundary of the Nackington Road end of the St. Lawrence Ground with Canterbury Cathedral visible in the background. The painting has Blythe in the action of bowling from the Pavilion End to Johnny Tyldesley. Tayler compressed the view of the playing area so that he could feature all of Kent's eleven players while keeping them <b>recognisable</b> and reasonably sized.|$|E
5|$|The press closely {{followed}} Fender's activities {{in his personal}} life, reporting his activities at dances, races and shooting. As such, he had a high profile, and was easily <b>recognisable</b> to the general public. In September 1924, he married Ruth Clapham, a well-known figure in society and {{the daughter of a}} Manchester jeweller, whom he met in Monte Carlo in 1923. The couple had two children; Ruth died suddenly in 1937 from Bright's disease. Fender remarried in 1962, but his second wife, Susan Gordon, died in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{and easily}} <b>recognisable,</b> the Australian magpie is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The pied butcherbird has a similar build and plumage, but has white underparts unlike the former species' black underparts. The magpie-lark is a much smaller and more delicate bird with complex and very different banded black and white plumage. Currawong species have predominantly dark plumage and heavier bills.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced by earlier forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a <b>recognisable</b> household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|Adidas, the {{official}} match ball supplier to all major UEFA, FIFA and IOC tournaments, unveiled {{the official}} match ball for the 2007 UEFA Champions League final on 9 March 2007, presenting the Adidas Finale Athens. The {{design of the}} Adidas Finale Athens {{was based on the}} widely <b>recognisable</b> UEFA Champions League Starball logo and was blue and white, representing the colours of the Greek national flag. The final matched two of the top goal-scorers in the competition that season. Milan's Kaká finished on top of the scoring charts with ten goals, and Liverpool's Peter Crouch entered the game tied for third with six goals in total.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly <b>recognisable</b> and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and {{clarity of the}} units and combat space was highest priority of the game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the <b>recognisable</b> traits of the units and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be <b>recognisable</b> as a new series.|$|E
5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most <b>recognisable</b> concept albums.|$|E
