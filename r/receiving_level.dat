5000|$|In {{historical}} Kabbalah, {{all levels}} of existence reflect and correspond to higher Divine parallels in their root. In Kabbalah, the Male principle {{is defined as the}} giver/emanator, while the Female principle is the receiver/nurturer. Hasidic thought emphasises the ultimate advantage of the lower Female <b>receiving</b> <b>level</b> as the ultimate purpose of Creation. In the sephirot the Male corresponds to the 6 Emotions centred on Tiferet (Balanced Harmony), reflecting the revelation of Upper Knowledge, while the Female corresponds to Malkuth (Fulfilment in Action), the indwelling Shechinah (Divine Presence) in creation. In turn these principles reflect and are ultimately rooted in the Kav first emanation line into the Vacuum created by the Tzimtzum, and the unfolding sephirot in the scheme of circles. The Male corresponds to Yashar (Line) and the Female to Igul (Circle), reflected in the anatomy of Man and Woman. In general the Male relates to Higher Knowledge and Soul, and the Female to Lower Knowledge and Body. In the Messianic Era, the Female will emerge from its historical subordinate status, as the body will give life to the soul, through Atzmus (Divine essence) being revealed in the Physical. The contemporary emancipation of Women gives a foretaste of this. This is alluded to by the Midrash on Genesis 1 of the Moon's diminished light and future reinstatement with the Sun.|$|E

30|$|In the K-user {{deterministic}} interference channel, each active level conveys one bit. To avoid collision, {{each level}} at the receiver side should be occupied either by a signal bit or by an interference bit. Actually, this interference bit {{can be a}} modulo- 2 addition of several interference bits, since {{it is not necessary}} to decode each of these interference bits separately. In order to leave as many <b>receive</b> <b>levels</b> as possible “free” for reception of signal bits, it will be advantageous if multiple interference bits fall on one <b>receive</b> <b>level.</b> This is the principle of interference alignment in amplitude space: the alignment of interference saves amplitude levels for desired signals and thus the throughput can be increased.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{anthropogenic}} sources of noise (e. g. sonar, seismic surveys) on the behaviour of marine mammals is sometimes quantified as a dose-response relationship, where {{the probability of}} an animal behaviourally 2 ̆ 7 responding 2 ̆ 7 (e. g. avoiding the source) increases with 2 ̆ 7 dose 2 ̆ 7 (or <b>received</b> <b>level</b> of noise). To do this, however, requires a definition of a 2 ̆ 7 significant 2 ̆ 7 response (avoidance), which {{can be difficult to}} quantify. There is also the potential that the animal 2 ̆ 7 avoids 2 ̆ 7 not only the source of noise but also the vessel operating the source, complicating the relationship. The proximity of the source is an important variable to consider in the response, yet difficult to account for given that <b>received</b> <b>level</b> and proximity are highly correlated. This study used the behavioural response of humpback whales to noise from two different air gun arrays (20 and 140 cubic inch air gun array) to determine whether a dose-response relationship existed. To do this, a measure of avoidance of the source was developed, and the magnitude (rather than probability) of this response was tested against dose. The proximity to the source, and the vessel itself, was included within the one-analysis model. Humpback whales were more likely to avoid the air gun arrays (but not the controls) within 3 km of the source at levels over 140 re. 1 μPa s, meaning that both the proximity and the <b>received</b> <b>level</b> were important factors and the relationship between dose (<b>received</b> <b>level)</b> and response is not a simple one...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Counselor {{expectations}} of supervision and counselor burnout were assessed. The {{sample consisted of}} 120 members of the Oregon Personnel and Guidance Association. Subjects were contacted by mail and {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire. The questionnaire contained two instruments: the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Counselor Supervision Inventory (CSI). The MBI is a 22 - item instrument which measured frequency and intensity of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. The CSI is a 60 -item instrument developed for this study which measures ideal and actual perceptions of supervisory counseling, consultation, and teaching. Linear regressions were computed to measure the relationships between level of counselor experience and ideal perceptions of supervision. Pearson correlations were computed to measure the degree of relationship between the counselor supervision variables and the burnout variables. Multiple regressions were computed to measure the relationships between the burnout variables and selected demographic variables. It was found that counselors are dissatisfied with the quality of the supervision they are <b>receiving.</b> <b>Level</b> of counselor experience was not significantly related to supervision needs. Counselor dissatisfaction with supervision was significantly and positively related to frequency and intensity of emotional exhaustion, intensity of depersonalization, and negatively related to frequency of personal accomplishment. Level of academic degree was positively related to frequency of depersonalization, and hours per week of supervision received was positively related to intensity of depersonalization. It was concluded that supervision is effective in preventing counselor burnout {{to the extent that it}} is perceived by counselors as being characterized by expertise and support...|$|E
40|$|Mobile {{communications}} {{has become}} one of the fastest growing sectors in the world today. With the technological advancement, mobile communication has subjected to many upgrades such as 2 G, 3 G, 4 G. The question of “Does a customer get the expected capabilities from it? ” is not answered yet. Even though, the subscribers of all operators pay almost equal charges per minute, most of the time, they do not get the real benefit from the service. At the moment there is no any location based system to capture the availability of signal receiving levels (specially 3 G and 4 G signal for Dongles), when a customer sit in front of the marketing person, asking to provide a new connection. What most of the customers do is to use the equipment for few days and return them with a complaint of malfunction in case of signal unavailability. In this study geostatistical analysis was carried out by the method of Inverse distance weighting and the interpolated maps were generated using ArcMap 10. Maps were uploaded to the map server, with standard color ramp. Thereby, the network users can get a better idea about the variation of mobile signal <b>receiving</b> <b>level</b> in a particular location. The developed web based GIS (Geographic Information Systems) system provides the capability of accessing the mobile signal levels remotely in an online manner prior to dealing with a particular customer.
