50|$|One {{area that}} many times is {{overlooked}} is how to, in an efficient way, transfer the PdM data to a {{computerized maintenance management system}} (CMMS) so that the equipment condition data is sent to the right equipment object in the CMMS system in order to trigger maintenance planning, execution and reporting. Unless this is achieved, the PdM solution is of limited value, at least if the PdM solution is implemented on a medium to large size plant with tens of thousands pieces of equipment. In 2010, the mining company Boliden, as a first, implemented a combined Distributed Control System (DCS) and Pdm solution integrated with the plant CMMS system on an object to object level, transferring equipment data using protocols like Highway Addressable <b>Remote</b> <b>Transducer</b> Protocol (HART), IEC61850 and OLE for process control (OPC).|$|E
5000|$|Binaural-beat {{perception}} {{originates in}} the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the superior olivary complex of the brainstem, where auditory signals from each ear are integrated and precipitate electrical impulses along neural pathways through the reticular formation up the midbrain to the thalamus, auditory cortex, and other cortical regions [...] Listening to binaural beats {{has been shown}} to precipitate auditory driving by which ensembles of cortical neurons entrain their frequencies to that of the binaural beat, with associated changes in self-reported subjective experience of emotional and cognitive state. It is however possible that the real cause of the observed changes is the headphones, rather than the sound itself, as demonstrated in 2002 during a University of Virginia presentation at the Society for Psychophysiologial Research. It was shown that EEG changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a <b>remote</b> <b>transducer</b> by rubber tubes.

5000|$|Hemi-Sync is a trademarked {{brand name}} for a {{patented}} process used to create audio patterns containing binaural beats, which are commercialized {{in the form of}} audio CDs. Interstate Industries Inc., created by Hemi-Sync founder Robert Monroe, is the owner of the Hemi-Sync technology. [...] Hemi-Sync is short for Hemispheric Synchronization, also known as brainwave synchronization. Monroe claimed that the technique synchronizes the two hemispheres of one's brain, thereby creating a 'frequency-following response' designed to evoke certain effects. Hemi-Sync has been used for many purposes, including relaxation and sleep induction, learning and memory aids, helping those with physical and mental difficulties, and reaching altered states of consciousness through the use of sound. The technique involves using sound waves to entrain brain waves. Wearing headphones, Monroe claimed that brains respond by producing a third sound (called binaural beats) that encouraged various brainwave activity changes. In 2002, a University of Virginia presentation at the Society for Psychophysiological Research examined Monroe's claim. The presentation demonstrated that EEG changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones of Monroe's setup were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a <b>remote</b> <b>transducer</b> by rubber tubes.

40|$|ObjectivesAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) sac shrinkage after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) {{is considered to}} be evidence of clinical success. Exclusion of the sac from systemic pressure is the likely cause of shrinkage. We report our continuing clinical experience {{with the use of a}} permanently implantable, ultrasound-activated <b>remote</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> to measure intrasac pressure and its correlation with changes in sac diameter over time. MethodsOver a 22 -month period, 21 patients underwent EVAR of an infrarenal AAA with implantation of an ultrasound-activated <b>remote</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> fixed to the outside of the stent-graft and exposed to the excluded aortic sac. Intrasac pressures were measured directly with an intravascular catheter and by the remote sensor at the time of stent-graft deployment. Follow-up sac pressures were measured by remote sensor and compared with systemic arterial pressure at every follow-up visit. Mean follow-up was 11. 4 ± 5. 0 months (range, 1 to 26 months). Twenty patients had follow-up of ≥ 6 months. Mean pressure index (MPI) was calculated as the ratio of mean sac pressure to mean systemic pressure. ResultsPressures could be obtained at all visits in 15 of the 21 patients. Fourteen of these 15 patients had follow-up of at least 6 months. Aneurysm sac shrinkage of > 5 mm was seen in seven (50 %) of these 14 patients. No aneurysm enlargement was observed in any patient. The MPI was significantly lower in patients with sac shrinkage at 6 months and at final follow-up. ConclusionsEndovascular aneurysm repair results in marked reduction of sac pressure in most patients. Patients with aneurysm shrinkage after EVAR have significantly lower MPI; however, the absence of sac shrinkage does not imply persistent pressurization of the sac. Further clinical follow-up will delineate the role of long-term sac pressure monitoring in surveillance after EVAR...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThis thesis presents {{new developments in the}} computational analysIs of sculptured surface products and in non-contacting vibration measurements based on the laser Doppler technique. The work is applied to the study of elastic deformation during impact where a detailed measurement and analysis capability is demonstrated using the golf impact as a principal example. A study of quadrilateral finite element mesh generation on sculptiired surface product families has shown that the versatility of an existing paving mesh generation algorithm can be improved significantly by dividing the product geometry into an anatomy of features and further subdividing primary features into smaller areas with four curvilinear sides. The hollow golf club head {{is an example of a}} sculptured surface product and is used to demonstrate the mesh generation difficulties which are overcome using the proposed approach. A computational analysis of a hollow golf club head under steady state dynamic conditions and in impact with a golf ball is presented which is of greater accuracy and superior detail to any previously reported. These tools are necessary for the development of a greater understanding of the detailed mechanical behaviour during impact in terms of energy transfer and 'feel' characteristics and are of importance to the golf equipment industry. Experimental validation of impact models is achieved through the introduction of a system of measurements which is suited to the analysis of high-speed, short duration impacts between lightweight bodies in which large elastic deformation occurs. A wealth of short duration golf impact data is captured efficiently using laser Doppler vibrometers and piezo-electric accelerometers. When using <b>remote,</b> non-contacting <b>transducers</b> such as the vibrometer, whole body translation of the target body causes the point on the target interrogated by the laser beam to change during the impact. A displacement compensation technique is introduced which permits close approximation of the vibration of fixed points on bodies undergoing whole body translation using data recorded from <b>remote</b> <b>transducers.</b> The technique is of additional importance in matching the available experimental data to points of interest in a computational model of the body. The improvement in data quality, relative to a single remote measurement, is quantified by reference to both simulated and actual experimental data in the case of steady state vibration and transient pulse propagation in impact. The golf impact is one of an increasing number of applications to exceed the measurement range of the available non-contacting instrumentation. Accordingly, the first practical demonstration of the laser Doppler accelerometer, a new non-contacting laser transducer which is directly sensitive to the acceleration of a target surface, is reported. The instrument has several advantages including an easily adjustable working range with effectively no upper measurement limit, straightforward operation and use of low cost optical components. Practical issues in the successful isolation of the particular optical beat frequency which carries the acceleration signal are descnbed and recommendations for the future development of this important new instrument are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The NE 5230 is a {{very low}} voltage {{operational}} amplifier that can perform with a voltage supply as low as 1. 8 V or as high as 15 V. In addition, split or single supplies can be used, and the output will swing to ground when applying the latter. There is a bias adjusting pin which controls the supply current required by the device and thereby controls its power consumption. If the part is operated at ± 0. 9 V supply voltages, the current required is only 110 �A when the current control pin is left open. Even with this low power consumption, the device obtains a typical unity gain bandwidth of 250 kHz. When the bias adjusting pin {{is connected to the}} negative supply, the unity gain bandwidth is typically 600 kHz while the supply current is increased to 600 �A. In this mode, the part will supply full power output beyond the audio range. The NE 5230 also has a unique input stage that allows the common−mode input range to go above the positive and below the negative supply voltages by 250 mV. This provides for the largest possible input voltages for low voltage applications. The part is also internally−compensated to reduce external component count. The NE 5230 has a low input bias current of typically ± 40 nA, and a large open−loop gain of 125 dB. These two specifications are beneficial when using the device in transducer applications. The large open−loop gain gives very accurate signal processing because of the large “excess ” loop gain in a closed−loop system. The output stage is a class AB type that can swing to within 100 mV of the supply voltages for the largest dynamic range that is needed in many applications. The NE 5230 is ideal for portable audio equipment and <b>remote</b> <b>transducers</b> because of its low power consumption, unity gain bandwidth, and 30 nV/√Hz noise specification...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesEndovascular {{stent graft}} repair of {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) prevents rupture by excluding the aneurysm sac from systemic arterial pressure. Current surveillance protocols after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) follow secondary markers of sac pressurization, namely, endoleak and sac enlargement. We report the first clinical {{experience with the}} use of a permanently implantable, ultrasound-activated <b>remote</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> to measure intrasac pressure after EVAR. MethodsOver 7 months, 14 patients underwent EVAR of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with implantation of an ultrasound-activated <b>remote</b> pressure <b>transducer</b> fixed to the outside of the stent graft and exposed to the excluded aortic sac. Twelve patients received modular bifurcated stent grafts, and 2 patients received aortouniiliac devices. Intrasac pressures were measured directly with an intravascular catheter and by the remote sensor at stent-graft deployment. Follow-up sac pressures were measured with a remote sensor and correlated with systemic arterial pressure at every follow-up visit. Mean follow-up was 2. 6 ± 1. 9 months. ResultsExcellent concordance was found between catheter-derived and transducer-derived intrasac pressssure intraoperatively. Pulsatile waveforms were seen in all functioning transducers at each evaluation interval. One implant ceased to function at 2 months of follow-up. In 1 patient a type I endoleak was diagnosed on 1 -month computed tomography (CT) scans; 3 type II endoleaks were observed. Those patients with complete exclusion of the aneurysm on CT scans had a significant difference in systemic and sac systolic pressures initially (P <. 001) and at 1 month (P <. 001). Initial sac diastolic pressures were higher than systemic diastolic pressures (P <. 001). The ratio of systemic to sac systolic pressure increased over time in those patients with complete aneurysm exclusion (P <. 001). Four of 6 patients with no endoleak and greater than 1 -month follow-up had diminution of sac systolic pressure to 40 mm Hg or less by 3 months. ConclusionThis is the first report of a totally implantable chronic pressure transducer to monitor the results of EVAR in human beings. Aneurysm exclusion leads to gradual diminution of sac pressure over several months. Additional clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether aneurysm sac pressure monitoring can replace CT in the long-term surveillance of patients after EVAR...|$|R

This search indicated that such a device could be made to function for temperatures up to approximately 200 C.

Repair or replacement of individual probes was difficult, costly, and time-consuming because (1) {{it was necessary to}} remove entire rakes in order to unbraze individual malfunctioning probes and (2) the heat of unbrazing a failed probe and of brazing a new probe in place could damage adjacent probes. In contrast, the modules in the present probe are designed to be relatively quickly and easily replaceable with no heating and, in many cases, without need for removal of the entire rake from the wind tunnel. To remove a malfunctioning probe, one first removes a screw-mounted V-cross-section cover that holds the probe and adjacent probes in place. Then one removes a screw-mounted cover plate {{to gain access to the}} steady-state pressure tubes and dynamicpressure wires. Next, one disconnects the tube and wires of the affected probe. Finally, one installs a new probe in the reverse of the aforementioned sequence. The wire connections can be made by soldering, but to facilitate removal and installation, they can be made via miniature plugs and sockets. The connections between the probe flow passages and the tubes leading to the remote pressure sensors can be made by use of any of a variety of readily available flexible tubes that can be easily pulled off and slid back on for removal and installation, respectively...|$|R

The first open wireless communication standard specifically designed forprocess measurement and control applications, WirelessHART (HighwayAddressable <b>Remote</b> <b>Transducer)</b> was officially released in September 2007 (as apart of HART 7 specification). Currently in industry the performance of machines are monitored in real-timescenario, which include from vibration measurement to surveillance monitoring. Sometimes data {{can be in the}} burst mode or sometimes it comes in a liner fashion. Therefore in order to achieve precise result an accurate time is mandatory. Various techniques and protocols are used and designed for the data collectionfrom different devices in industry located in different areas, among them isWirelessHART. WirelessHART networking is becoming popular for wirelesscommunication systems in industrial automation plants, which is a newlydeveloped protocol which is specifically designed to be used in industrialenvironment. The technique which has been used for data collection inWirelessHART is Time Synchronization and Channel Hooping (TSCH). However this technique sometimes has drawbacks and get failed when there is atransmutation of data in burst mode. Therefore the main object of this thesis work is to implement the Floodingtime Synchronization Protocol (FTSP) over Time Synchronization Protocol(TSCH) in WirelessHART communication standard...|$|E

First, the existing industrial applications are explored, following with {{a review of the}} advantages of adopting WSN technology for industrial control. Then, challenging factors influencing the design and acceptance of WSNs in the process control world are outlined, and the state-of-the-art research efforts and industrial solutions are provided corresponding to each factor. Further research issues for the realization and improvement of wireless sensor network technology on systematic industry are also mentioned. improvements. By utilizing WSN technology, sensing and action devices will communicate wirelessly with an access point (e. g., a gateway or router), which is connected to the control station wirelessly or through wired methods (e. g., Ethernet, Modbus). An example WSN application to replace the wired process control system in Fig. 1 is illustrated in Fig. 2. Most of the process control applications are mission critical and have stringent requirements. Failure of a control loop may cause unscheduled plant shutdown or even severe accidents in process-controlled plants.

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{standards}} in the wireless sensor networks domain,WirelessHART (HART (Highway Addressable <b>Remote</b> <b>Transducer)),</b> was introduced to address industrial process automation and control requirements. This standard {{can be used as}} a reference point to evaluate other wireless protocols in the domain of industrial monitoring and control. This makes it worthwhile to set up a reliable WirelessHART simulator in order to achieve that reference point in a relatively easy manner. Moreover, it offers an alternative to expensive testbeds for testing and evaluating the performance of WirelessHART. This paper explains our implementation of WirelessHART in the NS- 2 network simulator. According to our knowledge, this is the first implementation that supports the WirelessHART network manager, as well as the whole stack (all OSI (Open Systems Interconnection model) layers) of the WirelessHART standard. It also explains our effort to validate the correctness of our implementation, namely through the validation of the implementation of the WirelessHART stack protocol and of the network manager. We use sniffed traffic from a realWirelessHART testbed installed in the Idrolab plant for these validations. This confirms the validity of our simulator. Empirical analysis shows that the simulated results are nearly comparable to the results obtained from real networks. We also demonstrate the versatility and usability of our implementation by providing some further evaluation results in diverse scenarios. For example, we evaluate the performance of the WirelessHART network by applying incremental interference in a multi-hop network...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Sound and Vibration [Elsevier (© Academic Press) ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] vibration measurements using the laser Doppler technique are a practical and increasingly popular alternative to the use of contacting transducers. This study concerns aspects of non-contact measurements that result when the vibrating target additionally undergoes larger scale whole body translation. The characteristics of a single remote measurement of steady state vibration on a body undergoing whole body translation are investigated in both the time and frequency domains, where waveform distortion and whole body target displacement induced harmonics are observed. A technique which compensates for the relative whole body displacement between the target and a <b>remote</b> <b>transducer</b> is introduced, in which two simultaneous remote measurements are combined to derive a closer estimate of the measurement which would be made by a contacting transducer attached to the target surface. A substantial improvement in the data quality obtainable from a single remote measurement is demonstrated using a numerical simulation and in experimental data captured remotely from a golf club head during and immediately following an impact with a golf ball. Remote measurements are particularly suited to analysis of impacting bodies and the displacement compensation technique is thus developed in this paper to investigate transient pulse propagation effects. The improvement in data quality obtained is demonstrated using data pertaining to the deformation of a golf ball during an impact in which the whole ball accelerates forwards rapidly...|$|E
40|$|RTOS (Real Time Operating System) is a Process {{which is}} done between {{hardware}} and application {{in order to}} provide time constraints. Each industry has their own priority among the various tasks according to their process. RTOS is used here to assign the priorities. The values obtained in plant have to be transmitted to the control room. These values are sent in the form of packets. Packets have to be sent at particular time. During the packets transmission some collision may occur. To overcome this collision wireless HART (Highway Addressable <b>Remote</b> <b>Transducer)</b> is used. This project is implemented in two sections as prototype. First one runs with RTOS and LPC 2148 as master node and another as normal data acquisition node to which sensors are connected. Second section contains a controller as per the need. Communications between two nodes are accomplished through wireless HART. The basic view of this technique is to reduce the possibility of collision (and thus increase the communication reliability), and to meet the critical requirement of industrial applications. This is essential to increase the communication reliability, and to meet the requirement of timing determinism of industrial applications. To do this, all the nodes must be synchronized precisely. Also, the stack designer must guarantee that the node can finish everything within the time slot. It offers benefits in terms of platform independency, product life cycle, safety and security, system integration complexity, and performance scalability...|$|E
