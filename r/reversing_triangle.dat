This research aims at studying the results of <b>reverse</b> <b>triangle</b> screw fixation in patients suffering from femoral neck fractures in two groups with perfect and imperfect position of the mentioned screw. In a cohort study, 51 patients with femoral neck fracture appointed for the so-called <b>reverse</b> <b>triangle</b> screw fixation {{were divided into two}} perfect and imperfect groups considering surgeon comment on position of the screws. The patients were followed up for 12 months and the resulted outcomes were compared. There were 34 patients in the perfect group with mean age of 48. 7 ± 18. 6 (18 - 80) and 17 patients in the imperfect group with mean age of 50. 4 ± 15. 9 (19 - 80) years old. Both groups were the same considering underlying causes and fraction grades. The overall frequency of nonunion and avascular necrosis was 7. 8 and 3. 9 %, respectively.

On {{both sides of the}} fault, marls and sandstones are detected. In between these rocks there stands a 40 - to 100 -m-thick alluvium layer (Şengör et al., 2005). IAF is an active branch of the NAFZ, which accommodated 17 August, 1999, magnitude 7.4 İzmit earthquake. The AMT-A profile lies approximately 5 km east of the 1999 earthquake’s epicenter (Fig. 2, Frame A).
