5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would <b>rip</b> <b>it</b> off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E

[...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite of the year is Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur".

Comparing Heaven Up Here with Joy Division's 1980 album Closer, Reynolds said they are [...] "harrowed by the same things [...] hypocrisy, distrust, betrayal, lost or frozen potential". However, he said that [...] "Closer shows Ian Curtis fatally mesmerized by his own dread visions, Heaven Up Here ultimately turns its face towards the light" [...] with the tracks [...] "No Dark Things"– which he describes as renouncing [...] "death-wishful thinking"– and [...] "All I Want"– which he describes as [...] "a blasting celebration of desire for desire's sake" [...] and [...] "pure intransitive exhilaration".|$|E

Reynolds then describes the songs as being rooted in [...] "doubt, anguish, despair" [...] while the [...] "tightness and brightness of their sound transmits contradictory sensations of confidence, vigour and euphoria." [...] He also describes how the line [...] "Stars are stars and they shine so hard"– from the track [...] "Stars Are Stars"– showed how the band felt no embarrassment in their wish to be famous. In 1989 McCulloch told Reynolds how, as a teenager, he felt there was [...] "a big movie camera in the sky". McCulloch described the opening line of the track [...] "Going Up"– [...] "Ain't thou watching my film"– as a terrible line and he went on to say, [...] "It was meant to be tongue in cheek, but that was what spurred me on." ...|$|E

500|$|No {{systematic}} {{studies have}} been done on the diet of the black currawong, but it is known to be omnivorous, feeding {{on a wide variety of}} foodstuffs including insects and small vertebrates, carrion, and berries. [...] Birds forage on the ground most often, but also in tree canopies. They use their bills to probe the ground or turn over clods of earth or small rocks looking for food. Birds have been seen using walking tracks to forage along. A group of ten birds were observed trying to break open ice on a frozen lake. They have been recorded foraging along the beach for fly larvae in beached kelp. Most commonly, black currawongs forage in pairs, but they may congregate in larger groups—flocks of 100 birds have descended on orchards to eat apples or rotten fruit. The species has been observed in a mixed-species flocks with forest ravens (Corvus tasmanicus), and silver gulls (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae), white-faced herons (Egretta novaehollandiae), white-fronted chats (Epthianura albifrons), and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on the beach at Sundown Point. They have been observed securing dead larger prey to ease subsequent dismemberment; a parent currawong had wedged a dead chicken's wings under a log to facilitate pulling off portions such as legs and entrails to feed to its young, and another time hooked a dead rabbit on a spur of a log to <b>rip</b> <b>it</b> into pieces.|$|E

The Cure, The Glove, XTC's side-project The Dukes of Stratosphear, The Church and The Legendary Pink Dots. There were occasional mainstream acts that dabbled in neo-psychedelia in the US, including Prince's mid-1980s work and some of Lenny Kravitz's 1990s output, but it has mainly been an influence on alternative and indie-rock bands. These singers were joined by the Paisley Underground movement, based in Los Angeles, with acts like Dream Syndicate, The Bangles and Rain Parade. [...] The late 1980s saw the birth of shoegazing in the UK, which, among other influences, took inspiration from 1960s psychedelia. Critic Simon Reynolds described this movement as [...] "a rash of blurry, neo-psychedelic bands". With loud walls of sound, where individual instruments and even vocals were often indistinguishable, they followed the lead of noise pop and dream pop bands such as My Bloody Valentine (often considered as the earliest shoegaze act), The Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Cocteau Twins. Major acts included Ride, Lush, Chapterhouse, and The Boo Radleys, who enjoyed considerable attention in the UK, but largely failed to break through in the US.|$|E

500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything I always wanted to be as a player. I wanted to be tough, making big throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes. It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there's trees on each side and water and you just go 'Man, I'm gonna <b>rip</b> <b>it</b> down the middle.' And no other thought crosses your mind." [...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team.

[...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, <b>rip</b> <b>it</b> off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see."
