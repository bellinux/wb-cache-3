It has also been proposed as a third form of sexual selection, along with intersexual selection and intrasexual selection, even though prevailing scientific opinion is that sexual coercion is a manifestation of sexual conflict, stemming out of the natural discord between males and females. In some species of salamanders, females that are territorial and aggressive also intimidate males. Plethodon cinereus females aggressively punish males who are exhibiting social polygyny. Males have been shown to punish females that partake in mating polyandry, forcing them into mating monogamously.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{examined}} the barrier effects of large rivers on animal dispersal and gene flow, few studies have considered the barrier effects of small streams. We used displacement experiments and analyses of genetic population structure {{to examine the effects of}} first-order and second-order streams on the dispersal of terrestrial <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818). We marked <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> from near the edges of one first-order stream and one second-order stream, and experimentally displaced them either across the stream or an equal distance farther into the forest. A comparison of return rates indicated that both streams were partial barriers to salamander movement, reducing return rates by approximately 50 %. Analysis of six microsatellite loci from paired plots on the same side and on opposite sides of the second-order stream suggested that the stream did contribute to genetic differentiation of salamander populations. Collectively, our results imply that low-order streams do influence patterns of movement and gene flow in <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders.</b> We suggest that given the high density of first-order and second-order streams in most landscapes, these features may have important effects on species that, like <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> have limited dispersal and large geographic ranges...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} how {{exposure duration}} (time that two individuals initially interact) and separation interval (time between the initial interaction and a subsequent interaction) affect recognition memory of conspecifics in male <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> Plethodon cinereus. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that this species aggressively defends territories. We recorded aggressive behavior to assess recognition memory, because aggression is more intense toward previously unencountered individuals compared to previously encountered individuals in this species. We found that with 15 -min exposures and 5 -day separation intervals, focal males did not spend significantly more time threatening ‘unfamiliar’ intruders than ‘familiar’ intruders. After either 8 -hour exposures and 5 -day separation intervals and 5 -day exposures and 5 -day separation intervals, focal males spent significantly more time threatening unfamiliar intruders than familiar intruders. These results suggest that male <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> can remember familiar conspecifics (e. g., territorial neighbors) after at least an 8 -hour exposure duration and that memory persists at least as long as 5 days. After 5 -day exposure and 15 -day separation intervals, we found no significant difference in aggressive behavior toward familiar and unfamiliar intruders. Long separation intervals (15 days) may lead either to loss of memory of previously familiar individuals or, alternatively, aggressive reassessment of individuals as only a change in behavior indicates positively that memory has occurred. Thus, variance in territorial defense within an individual may depend on its ability to recognize conspecific males [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 326 – 334, 2013]...|$|R
50|$|Males {{and females}} {{typically}} establish separate feeding and/or mating territories underneath rocks and logs. However, some <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> {{are thought to}} engage in social monogamy, and may maintain codefended territories throughout their active periods. Breeding occurs in June and July. Females produce from four to 17 eggs in a year. The eggs hatch in six to eight weeks.

40|$|Amphibians possess {{beneficial}} skin {{bacteria that}} {{protect against the}} disease chytridiomycosis by producing secondary metabolites that inhibit the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Metabolite production may be a mechanism of competition between bacterial species that results in host protection as a by-product. We expect that some co-cultures of bacterial species or strains will result in greater Bd inhibition than mono-cultures. To test this, we cultured four bacterial isolates (Bacillus sp., Janthinobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Chitinophaga arvensicola) from <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) and cultured isolates both alone and together to collect their cell-free supernatants (CFS). We challenged Bd with CFSs from four bacterial species in varying combinations. This resulted in three experimental treatments: 1) CFSs of single isolates; 2) combined CFSs of two isolates; and 3) CFSs from co-cultures. Pair-wise combinations of four bacterial isolates CFSs were assayed against Bd and revealed additive Bd inhibition in 42. 2 % of trials, synergistic inhibition in 42. 2 % and no effect in 16. 6 % of trials. When bacteria isolates were grown in co-cultures, complete Bd inhibition was generally observed, and synergistic inhibition occurred in four out of six trials. A metabolite profile of the most potent co-culture, Bacillus sp. and Chitinophaga arvensicola, was determined with LC-MS and compared with the profiles of each isolate in mono-culture. Emergent metabolites appearing in the co-culture were inhibitory to Bd, and the most potent inhibitor was identified as tryptophol. Thus mono-cultures of bacteria cultured from <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> interacted synergistically and additively to inhibit Bd, and such bacteria produced emergent metabolites when cultured together, with even greater pathogen inhibition. Knowledge of how bacterial species interact to inhibit Bd {{can be used to}} select probiotics to provide amphibians with protection against Bd...|$|R

40|$|Question: Does habitat {{heterogeneity}} promote trophic polymorphism in a terrestrial <b>salamander?</b> Hypothesis: Eastern <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) in upland and lowland habitats differ morphologically {{because their}} prey’s size differs between those habitats. Field site: Five mature hardwood forests in central New York and northern Pennsylvania, USA, with known differences in diet between upland and lowland habitats. Methods: We collected animals and examined their stomach contents and their cranial morphology, the latter with digital stereomicroscope images and morphometric methods. Results: We found morphological differences between upland and lowland salamanders, {{although there was}} a considerable phenotypic range for both habitats. Lowland salamanders generally had relatively shorter heads and a lower jaw/head ratio, and upland salamanders generally had the converse. Within and among habitats, cranial morphology was associated with diet, where salamanders with lowland-like morphology consumed more large prey and fewer small prey, and salamanders with upland-like morphology consumed the converse.

40|$|General EcologyRed-backed {{salamanders}} {{were observed}} {{to see how}} they colonized the forest edges of northern forests.

Soil and air temperature, light intensity, humidity, soil moisture, pH and percent understory cover were measured. Observing the population of salamanders under the artificial logs and surrounding natural habitat, we obtained significant results that salamanders did not choose to populate the forest edge. All abiotic measurements were different between forests, but air temperature, humidity, and percent soil moisture were predictors of salamander densities. Low air temperature, high humidity, and moderate levels of percent soil moisture was favored by <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> and lead to more dense populations in the mature hardwood forest.

Amphibian species richness was positively correlated with buffer strip width, however even wide buffers (> 40 m) had fewer species than unmanaged forests. The abundance of each amphibian species was only weakly associated (R 2 < 0. 42) with habitat characteristics that I measured or estimated.

40|$|The disease chytridiomycosis, {{which is}} caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is {{associated}} with recent declines in amphibian populations. Susceptibility to this disease varies among amphib-ian populations and species, and resistance appears to be attributable in part to the presence of antifungal microbial species associated with the skin of amphibians. The betaproteobacterium Janthinobacterium lividum has been isolated from the skins of several amphibian species and produces the antifungal metabolite violacein, which inhibits B. dendrobatidis. In this study, we added J. lividum to <b>red-backed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Plethodon cinereus) to obtain an increased range of violacein concentrations on the skin. Adding J. lividum to the skin of the salamander increased the concentration of violacein on the skin, which was strongly associated with survival after experimental exposure to B. dendrobatidis. As expected from previous work, some individuals that did not receive J. lividum and were exposed to B. dendrobatidis survived. These individuals had concentrations of bacterially produced violacein on their skins that were predicted to kill B. dendrobatidis. Our study suggests that a threshold violacein concentration of about 18 M on a salamander’s skin prevents mortality and morbidity caused by B. dendrobatidis.
