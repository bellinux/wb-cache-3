The following month LordErne's tenants were due to pay their <b>rents.</b> He had agreed to a 10per cent reduction owing to a poor harvest, but all except two of his tenants demanded a 25per cent reduction. Boycott said that he had written to LordErne, and that Erne had refused to accede to the tenants' demands. He then issued demands for the outstanding <b>rents,</b> and obtained eviction notices against eleven tenants.|$|E

40|$|The {{social costs}} of <b>rent</b> seeking are {{generally}} evaluated with respect to <b>rent</b> dissipation. A common assumption is complete <b>rent</b> dissipation so {{that the value of}} a contested <b>rent</b> is the value of social loss. When <b>rent</b> seekers earn taxable income, there is interdependence between the social cost of <b>rent</b> seeking through <b>rent</b> dissipation and the excess burden of taxation. Through the addition of substitution to <b>rent</b> seeking beyond leisure, <b>rent</b> seeking increases the excess burden of taxation under risk neutrality when leisure is non-inferior. We derive a condition for <b>rent</b> seeking to increase the excess burden of taxation under risk aversion. Our conclusion is that, when <b>rent</b> seekers can earn taxable income, <b>rent</b> seeking is more socially costly than is inferred from contest models alone, because of an increased excess burden of taxation...|$|R

40|$|Urban land <b>rent</b> {{theory has}} both fascinated and {{repelled}} researchers. The fascination {{stems from the}} idea that <b>rent</b> holds the key to urban spatial structures and distributional conflicts. The repulsion is based on bemusement at the complexity and jargon of the <b>rent</b> literature and rejection of <b>rent's</b> assumed centrality. In this paper the author surveys the urban <b>rent</b> literature and presents an alternative interpretation {{of the role of}} urban <b>rent.</b> It is suggested that the ambiguous theoretical status of urban land <b>rent</b> stems from an overemphasis in the <b>rent</b> literature on the distributional implications of <b>rent</b> mechanisms at the expense of their potential influence on the social relations of building provision. The neoclassical economics model of urban <b>rent</b> and land use is critically evaluated and the extensive attempts to apply Marx's theory of <b>rent</b> to the urban situation are questioned. The ability to revive Marxist urban <b>rent</b> theory through the treatment of <b>rent</b> as a component of structures of building provision is then elaborated by reference to housing provision and office development. When placed in such a historical context, it is suggested, <b>rent</b> takes on a more meaningful, if less messianic, role. ...|$|R

5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this {{was the result of}} improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend. Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up <b>rents,</b> enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium <b>rents.</b> The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories. 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent.|$|E
