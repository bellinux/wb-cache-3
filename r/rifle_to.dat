5|$|To {{reduce crime}} in Tombstone, on April 19, 1881, {{the city council}} passed {{ordinance}} 9, requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife, dirk, pistol or <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town.

5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> detonate dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E

5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA {{personnel}} in Bulawayo used civilian vehicles to smuggle weapons and equipment, including mortars, into their Entumbane camp {{over the next}} few days. C Company, 1RAR, comprising 96 men under Major Lionel Dyck (including a detachment from Support Company) and eight armoured vehicles, noticed this while they were garrisoning the Alamo on 11 February. The major reported to Brigade headquarters that the number of ZIPRA troops at Entumbane appeared to have swelled considerably, and that the chain link fence surrounding the camp had been taken down. Superiors ordered him not to intervene. Anticipating an imminent attack, Dyck used a silenced <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> shoot out the floodlights surrounding the Alamo, lined up his vehicles against the surrounding walls so his men could stand on them while defending, and ranged mortars on a variety of targets in the ZIPRA complex.|$|E

They meet each other at a destroyed building where both of them notice each other and circle around with weapons in their hand. They come close and instead of attacking they throw away the weapons, embrace each other and engage in a dance-routine. After they complete their dance, and the song ends, the couple notice a little boy watching them from the destroyed building. The video ends with the couple leaving the city with the little boy hand-in-hand together with a large dog, and a panorama of the destruction.|$|E

5000|$|James rifle is {{a generic}} term to {{describe}} any artillery gun <b>rifled</b> <b>to</b> the James pattern {{for use in}} the American Civil War. Charles T. James developed a rifled projectile and rifling system. Modern authorities such as Warren Ripley and James Hazlett have suggested that the term [...] "James rifle" [...] only properly applies to 3.80" [...] bore field artillery pieces <b>rifled</b> <b>to</b> fire James' projectiles. They contend that the term does not apply to smoothbores that were later <b>rifled</b> <b>to</b> take the James projectiles in 3.67" [...] caliber or other calibers, and that those should instead be referred to as [...] "Rifled 6 (or other) pounder", etc.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps {{tested the}} M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, a lighter, magazine-fed <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> {{supplement}} and partially replace the M249. With {{plans to buy}} up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 will remain in service) held at platoon level, it acquired 450 of the Heckler & Koch HK416–based weapons for testing. The Marines started fielding the M27 in 2010, but kept both weapons in the inventory due to the M249's greater ammunition capacity and higher sustained fire rate; rifle companies are typically issued 27 IARs and six SAWs. The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners {{to make up the}} difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.|$|E

25|$|The Model 1895 was {{the first}} Winchester <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> feature a box {{magazine}} located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design, which had remained fundamentally unchanged from the Winchester 1866. This allowed the <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> safely chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) bullets. The M1895 was also {{the last of the}} lever-action rifles to be designed by John Browning, and featured a rear locking bolt as in his previous designs dating back to the Winchester 1886. The M1895 is the strongest lever-action rifle Winchester has produced, designed to handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful smokeless powder cartridges entering common use {{at the time of its}} introduction. By today’s standards however, the design is considered relatively weak, and not suited to high pressure loads.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, the American M1 Garand was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} <b>rifle</b> <b>to</b> replace its nation's bolt-action rifle as the standard-issue infantry weapon.

After years of research and testing, the first production model of the M1 Garand was unveiled in 1937. During World War II, the M1 Garand gave American infantrymen an advantage over their opponents, {{most of whom were}} issued slower firing bolt-action rifles.|$|E
