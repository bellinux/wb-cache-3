50|$|Another {{method of}} making tea eggs is to boil the eggs until fully cooked inside, then remove the hard boiled eggs from their shells {{and let them}} steep in the spiced tea mixture at low heat for a little longer. The eggs and the mixture are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> {{transferred}} to a glass or ceramic container for further steeping. This method requires a shorter steeping time than the traditional method, however, the egg is less visually appealing without the marbled effect from the traditional crack shell method of preparation. The eggs can be eaten at any time; however, the longer {{they are allowed to}} steep, the richer the flavor will be. The perfect spiced-tea egg should have a balance between the egg's natural flavor and that of the spices. The cracking method is the formal feature in this traditional egg recipe.|$|R

50|$|Heat {{exhaustion}} {{is considered}} by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke (hyperthermia). It may even resemble heat stroke, with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact. Heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Symptoms may include diarrhea, headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tachycardia, malaise, and myalgia. Definitive therapy includes <b>removing</b> patients <b>from</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> replenishing their fluids. Most patients will require fluid replacement with IV isotonic fluids at first. The salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known. After discharge from the hospital, patients are instructed to rest, drink plenty of fluids for 2-3 hours, <b>and</b> avoid the <b>heat</b> for several days. If this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke.|$|R
500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heat.</b> Okra <b>and</b> roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>heat</b> when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art".

25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. <b>Remove</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heat</b> source <b>and</b> begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|R
30|$|SIPPs, {{stabilized}} {{with the}} various fatty amines, were synthesized using slight modifications of a procedure we have described previously [2, 8, 9]. Briefly, 1.0  mmol of Fe(NO 3) 3 [*]·[*] 9 H 2 O and 1.0  mmol of Pt(acac) 2 were combined with 12.5  mmol ODA in a 25 -mL three-neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Alternately, HDA, TDA, or DDA were used instead of ODA. Refluxing (340 °C to 360 °C) was continued for either 30 or 60  min, and then the reaction flask was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting black particles were collected in approximately 80  mL of hexane. The 20 -mL aliquots of the collected particles, in hexane, were placed in 50 -mL conical tubes and diluted with 30  mL of ethanol (EtOH). The suspensions were then centrifuged at 1, 462 [*]×[*]g for 10  min. The solution was discarded and the pelleted particles were again suspended in 20  mL hexane. The resuspended particles were then equally divided in the two 50 -mL conical tubes, diluted with 40  mL of EtOH, and centrifuged at 1, 462 [*]×[*]g for 5  min. The EtOH serves to wash the excess ligand from the nanoparticle solutions. Finally, the solution was discarded, and the purified SIPP pellets were collected in a total volume of 20  mL hexane and stored at room temperature in glass scintillation vials.|$|R

5000|$|Plastisol is {{used for}} slush molding or slush casting, a form of spin casting that {{is more complex than}} {{relatively}} simple resin casting, but less expensive and less sophisticated than the injection molding used for most plastic products. It involves metal molds that are filled with liquid plastisol. When the open mold cavities are filled, the mold is spun on a heavy duty, high speed centrifuge to force the liquid vinyl into all of the fine detail on the interior of the mold. Then the metal mold is placed into a heating solution, usually an industrial salt heated to about [...] The liquid vinyl cooks for a few seconds. The mold is then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>heating</b> solution <b>and</b> the remaining liquid is poured out. This leaves a thin skin of vinyl on the interior of the metal mold.

40|$|The {{method of}} <b>heat</b> {{recovery}} <b>from</b> {{the ground below}} solar ponds is investigated in the present brief note. Solar ponds lose considerable amount of <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> its bottom to the ground due to temperature gradient between them. This waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground, which is at different temperature at different depths decreasing downwards {{from the bottom of}} the solar pond, can be extracted to enhance the thermal performance of the solar pond. This note addresses the technique to <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground <b>and</b> shows the enhancement of the <b>heat</b> removal <b>and</b> efficiency in doing so. Thermal performance of solar ponds is investigated and compared for the cases where the heat extraction fluid (HEF) flux through the LCZ and ground is constant and when they are different. Results show that constant HEF flux through LCZ and ground is a preferable option for heat removal. Also it is evident that the <b>heat</b> recovered <b>from</b> ground may reach a significant quantity which may almost be equal to the <b>heat</b> extracted <b>from</b> LCZ. Hence not recovering <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> ground leads to loss of up to 50 % thermal energy...|$|R
40|$|Cooling systems <b>remove</b> <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> {{components}} <b>and</b> industrial equipment. Water cooling, employing natural waters, {{is typically}} used for cooling large industrial facilities, such as power plants, factories or refineries. Due to moderate temperatures, cooling water cycles {{are susceptible to}} biofouling, inorganic fouling and scaling, which may reduce <b>heat</b> transfer <b>and</b> enhance corrosion. Hypochlorite treatment or antifouling coatings are used to prevent biological fouling in these systems. In this research, we examine biofouling and materials’ degradation in a brackish seawater environment using a range of test materials, both uncoated and coated. The fouling and corrosion resistance of titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), super austenitic stainless steel (254 SMO) and epoxy-coated carbon steel (Intershield Inerta 160) were studied in the absence and presence of hypochlorite. Our results demonstrate that biological fouling is intensive in cooling systems using brackish seawater in sub-arctic areas. The microfouling comprised a vast diversity of bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and protozoa. Chlorination was effective against biological fouling: up to a 10 – 1000 -fold decrease in bacterial and archaeal numbers was detected. Chlorination also changed {{the diversity of the}} biofilm-forming community. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that chlorination enhances cracking of the epoxy coating...|$|R

40|$|The term rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) {{is widely used}} to describe technologies which create physical prototypes directly from digital data. The first methods for {{rapid prototyping}} became available in the late 1980 s and were used to produce models and prototype parts. Three-dimensional (3 D) rapid prototyping methods are widely employed in various areas of manufacturing, research, and education. Typical applications include engineering, architecture, and medicine. The present level of technical and commercial demand requires the development of faster and cheaper methodologies for the design and execution of structures. Various techniques based on CAD platforms and rapid prototyping are available. Parts can be produced {{in a variety of}} materials: polymers, metal, paper, ceramics, and composites. The RP method also enables the production of prototypes useful for analysing the characteristics of a complex system (e. g. interference between dynamic parts, geometric evaluation, quality, and reliability). RP technologies can produce very complex parts which are impossible or difficult to produce by traditional methods. This paper presents typical applications of rapid prototyping technology for the manufacture of mechanical parts for fuel cells, such as housing parts or bipolar plates which supply reactants (hydrogen to anodes and oxygen to cathodes), conduct electrons from one cell to the next, <b>remove</b> waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> cells, <b>and</b> provide mechanical support for cells in a stack. Conventional graphite or composite materials can be replaced by lighter metallic materials characterised by vastly superior manufacturability and cost effectiveness, greater mechanical strength, increased durability and resistance to shock and vibration, and zero permeability. The potential for the application of this method for the manufacture of metallic bipolar plates (BPP) for use in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is presented and discussed. Special attention is paid to the fabrication of light elements for the construction of PEMFC stacks designed for mobile applications such as aviation technology and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) ...|$|R
