25|$|When Rockefeller {{observed}} this, {{he began}} to acquire {{many of the new}} pipelines. Soon, his Standard Oil companies owned a majority of the lines, which provided cheap, efficient transportation for oil.

25|$|The sugar <b>refining</b> <b>industry</b> often uses bone char (calcinated animal bones) for decolorizing. About 25% {{of sugar}} {{produced}} in the U.S. is processed using bone char as a filter, the remainder being processed with activated carbon. As bone char {{does not seem to}} remain in finished sugar, Jewish religious leaders consider sugar filtered through it to be pareve and therefore kosher.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of his salt {{business}} in Saginaw, Flagler returned to Bellevue in 1866 and reentered the grain business as a commission merchant with The Harkness Grain Company. During this time he worked to pay back Steve Harkness. Through this business, Flagler became acquainted with John D. Rockefeller, {{who worked as a}} commission agent with Hewitt and Tuttle for the Harkness Grain Company. By the mid-1860s, Cleveland had become the center of the oil <b>refining</b> <b>industry</b> in America and Rockefeller left the grain business to start his own oil refinery. Rockefeller worked in association with chemist and inventor Samuel Andrews.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{numerous}} refineries that were started were several along a new rail link to Cleveland, Ohio, where John D. Rockefeller {{and his partner}} Maurice Clark owned a grocery produce shipping business. [...] Rockefeller and Clark also got in the refining business, and in 1865 the partners decided to hold a private auction between the two, with Rockefeller being the successful bidder. [...] The <b>refining</b> <b>industry</b> was intensely competitive, and by 1869 there was three times the capacity needed, a situation which lasted many years, {{with the number of}} refineries reaching 6000.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Canadian oil <b>refining</b> <b>industry</b> is foreign-owned, {{and except}} for Alberta, {{international}} companies preferred to build refining capacity elsewhere than in Canada. The result is a serious imbalance between Canadian oil production versus Canadian oil refining. Although Canada produces much more oil than it refines, and exports more oil and refined products than it consumes, {{most of the new}} production is heavier than traditional oil and concentrated in the landlocked provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. The remainder of Canadian oil production is exported, almost all of it to the US. At the same time Canada imports [...] of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Standard {{controlled}} 91 {{percent of}} production and 85 percent of final sales. Most of its output was kerosene, of which 55 percent was exported around the world. After 1900 it {{did not try to}} force competitors out of business by underpricing them. The federal Commissioner of Corporations studied Standard's operations from the period of 1904 to 1906 and concluded that [...] "beyond question ... the dominant position of the Standard Oil Co. in the <b>refining</b> <b>industry</b> was due to unfair practicesto abuse of the control of pipe-lines, to railroad discriminations, and to unfair methods of competition in the sale of the refined petroleum products". Due to competition from other firms, their market share had gradually eroded to 70 percent by 1906 which was the year when the antitrust case was filed against Standard, and down to 64 percent by 1911 when Standard was ordered broken up and at least 147 refining companies were competing with Standard including Gulf, Texaco, and Shell. It did not try to monopolize the exploration and pumping of oil (its share in 1911 was 11 percent).|$|E
2500|$|Needing {{capital for}} his new venture, Rockefeller {{approached}} Flagler in 1867. Flagler obtained $100,000 (equivalent of $ million in [...] ) from family member Stephen V. Harkness {{on the condition that}} Flagler be made a partner. The Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler partnership was formed with Flagler in control of Harkness' interest. The partnership eventually grew into the Standard Oil Corporation. It was Flagler's idea to use the rebate system to strengthen the firm's position against competitors and the transporting enterprises alike. Flagler was in a special position to make those deals due to his connections as a grain merchant. Though the refunds issued amounted to no more than fifteen cents on the dollar, they put Standard Oil in position to undercut other oil refineries. By 1872, it led the American oil <b>refining</b> <b>industry,</b> producing [...] The Flagler family moved to New York in 1877 since New York was becoming the center of commerce in the US. [...] In 1885, Standard Oil moved its corporate headquarters to New York City to the iconic 26 Broadway location.|$|E

40|$|Types of land {{disposed}} residuals from selected {{metal smelting}} and <b>refining</b> <b>industries</b> are described, {{as are the}} origin and disposition of land disposed residuals from the primary copper industry as an example. Quantities of land-disposed or stored residuals, including slags, sludges, and dusts, are given per unit of metal production for most primary and secondary metal smelting and <b>refining</b> <b>industries.</b> Assessments of the hazard potential of residuals are given. Present treatment and disposal of residuals are discussed and assessed for health and environmental protection. Possible technologies for protection of ground and surface water contamination are presented. These include lined lagoons, chemical fixation of sludge, and ground sealing. Possibilities of resource recovery from residuals are discussed. Data are presented showing attenuation of heavy metal ions and fluorides in selected soils. The leachability and mobility of smelting and refining residuals constituents, including heavy metals and fluorides, and other potential toxicants in specific soil, geologic, and hydrologic disposal environments must be carefully considered in setting disposal requirements...|$|R
