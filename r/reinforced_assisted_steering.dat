50|$|Power {{disc brakes}} and power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> were {{standard}} equipment on both body {{styles of the}} VE VIP. Additionally the Safari station wagon received an electrically operated tailgate window.|$|R
50|$|The Stilo was {{the second}} car {{worldwide}} to use the TRW Column-Drive Electric Power <b>Assisted</b> <b>Steering</b> (EPS) technology after the Fiat Punto MK2, later introduced on the 2003 Nissan Micra and Renault Mégane.|$|R
5000|$|A retuned, 20 mm lowered sports {{suspension}} {{included a}} 30 percent stiffer spring rate and 40 percent more compression damping in the shock absorbers. Speed-sensitive [...] "servotronic" [...] power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> was also standard.|$|R

50|$|All C4 S4s' came {{equipped}} {{as standard}} with a conventional fixed-assistance {{rack and pinion}} power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (PAS) system. An electronically controlled 'servotronic' system, which varied the level of assistance {{in accordance with the}} road speed, was available as an option.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a 6,230 cc 90-degree V8 with twin SU carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission. The car had massive drum brakes and a wheelbase of 3,683 mm. Four speed automatic transmission and power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> were standard.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "t" [...] {{was home}} to other Ferrari firsts: It used power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> {{for the first time}} and had a 3-position {{electronically}} controlled suspension for a variable tradeoff between ride quality and road holding. It also had standard ABS.|$|R
50|$|The main {{mechanical}} differentiator {{between the}} new Ka and its Fiat sibling is that the Ford has better shock absorption than the Fiat 500. Fitting a rear anti-roll bar enabled 30 percent softer springs and accordingly retuned dampers to improve ride performance over uneven road surfaces. Some of these improvements were subsequently adopted on Fiat 500 Abarth and Fiat 500C models. Changes were also made to the 500's steering geometry for the Ka, although as the new Ka uses an electrically <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> system, it lacks the communication of its predecessor's hydraulically <b>assisted</b> <b>steering.</b> However, the electric steering system does make the steering much lighter and more energy efficient than its predecessor.|$|R
25|$|Changes include: {{intelligent}} cruise control, lane departure prevention, lane departure warning, forward collision warning, {{front seat}} emergency brake sensing pre-crash seat belt, intelligent brake <b>assist,</b> <b>steering</b> wheel switches (audio navigation, voice command, hands-free phone, intelligent cruise control, lane departure prevention) become standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|This {{system should}} not be {{confused}} with variable <b>assist</b> power <b>steering,</b> which varies <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> torque, not <b>steering</b> ratios, nor with systems where the gear ratio is only varied as a function of steering angle. These last are more accurately called non-linear types (e.g. Direct-Steer offered by Mercedes); a plot of steering-wheel position versus axle steering angle is progressively curved (and symmetrical).|$|R
5000|$|Power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (set on {{most modern}} cars) make the torque steer effect less {{noticeable}} to the driver. Steer-by-wire also hides {{the effect of}} torque steer from the driver. EPAS can be calibrated to directly suppress the torque effect at the handwheel, and the steer effect on the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a 12-cylinder D-12A-525A diesel engine located {{directly}} behind the cab. This engine provides preheating as well. The drivetrain of the MAZ-537 consists of a hydrodynamic transmission transferring power to the two front axles over a torque converter and a planetary three-stage gearbox with <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> (power steering) gear.|$|R
25|$|This {{new type}} of {{variable}} <b>assist</b> power <b>steering</b> has since spread throughout the vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|R
5000|$|... the yawl, {{characterized}} by a two mast configuration with the largest mast forward, is distinguished from the ketch by the smaller size of the mizzen mast, typically aft of the rudderpost in traditional sailing craft, but is not a driving sail. The mizzen mast is used to <b>assist</b> <b>steering</b> the boat and balancing the helm.|$|R
50|$|Most new {{vehicles}} now have power steering, {{owing to the}} trends toward front wheel drive, greater vehicle mass, and wider tires, which all increase the required steering effort. Heavier vehicles, as are common in some countries, would be extremely difficult to maneuver at low speeds, while vehicles of lighter weight may not need power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> at all.|$|R
50|$|When {{carrying}} cadets, {{the ship}} is usually steered from the manual stern rudder station, which is operated by four steering wheels with two men each. At other times, the hydraulically <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> on the bridge is used. Except for the anchor winch, the winches aboard are not power operated. The bridge is equipped with sophisticated modern electronic navigation instruments.|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} linkage between {{the steering wheel}} and the steering gear is retained in EPAS. In the event of component failure or power failure that causes a failure to provide assistance, the {{mechanical linkage}} serves as a back-up. If EPAS fails, the driver encounters a situation where heavy effort is required to steer. This heavy effort {{is similar to that of}} an inoperative hydraulic <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> system. Depending on the driving situation, driving skill and strength of the driver, <b>steering</b> <b>assist</b> loss may or may not lead to a crash. The difficulty of steering with inoperative power steering is compounded by the choice of <b>steering</b> ratios in <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> gears vs. fully manual. The NHTSA has assisted car manufacturers with recalling EPAS systems prone to failure.|$|R
50|$|By mid-1996 SOFASA {{decided to}} {{experiment}} {{a much more}} flexible way to offer cars to the market. Called R9 Personnalité, the idea allowed customers to choose from different engines and accessories so they could assemble the car they wanted within their budget. This was possible through special software in dealerships. A year later, a face-lifted version featured fuel injection, <b>assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> and a completely new interior.|$|R
50|$|The Lancia 2000 and 2000 HF coupé were technologically {{advanced}} {{for the day}} with features such as 5 speed transmission, power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> and electronic fuel injection on the 2000 HF. The cars offer sporty but also very refined and comfortable transport and are very capable in modern traffic and motorway cruising. They are very well appointed with polished stainless steel brightwork, as opposed to chromed mild steel.|$|R

The new 42 V power voltage system is a very attractive design for a steering electric motor, both from a cost and size perspective. A four-phase 8 / 6 SRM drive is designed for a rack type EPAS which should provide a maximum force of 10 kN. Two-dimension finite element analysis is used to validate the design...|$|R
50|$|The AEC Regal VI was a rear-engined single-decker {{bus chassis}} {{manufactured}} by AEC in the 1960s. It was unveiled at the 1960 Commercial Motor Show and {{was intended to}} be a purely export chassis. It was an updated version of the underfloor-engined AEC Regal IV, having an 11.3-litre AH690 engine instead of the Regal IVs 9.6-litre AH590 engine. It was available in both left and right hand drive versions, other options included power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering</b> and air suspension.|$|R
5000|$|The Gentry was {{a limited}} edition 205, {{although}} arguably not a GTI model {{as it used}} a detuned [...] 1.9 litre engine with auto gearbox. Only 300 models were made in Sorrento Green and Aztec Gold (sometimes called Mayfair Beige). They came with full-leather and real wood trim, power <b>assisted</b> <b>steering,</b> ABS and heated mirrors. The Gentry came with the same body side trims as the GTI, {{which led to the}} Gentry often being mistaken for a GTI.|$|R
