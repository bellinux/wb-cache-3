40|$|In most {{traffic signal}} {{optimization}} problems, pedestrian traffic at an intersection receives minor consideration compared to vehicular traffic, and {{usually in the}} form of simplistic and exogenous constraints (e. g., minimum green time). This could render the resulting signal timings sub-optimal especially in dense urban areas with significant pedestrian traffic, or when two-stage pedestrian crosswalks are present. This paper proposes a convex (quadratic) programming approach to optimize traffic signal timings for an isolated intersection with one- and two-stage crosswalks, assuming undersaturated vehicular traffic condition. Both vehicle and pedestrian traffic are integrated into a unified framework, where the total weighted delay of pedestrians and vehicles at different types of crosswalks (i. e. one- or two-stage) is adopted as the objective function, and temporal and spatial constraints (e. g. signal phasing plan and spatial capacity of the <b>refuge</b> <b>island)</b> are explicitly formulated. A case study demonstrates the impacts of incorporating pedestrian delay as well as geometric and spatial constraints (e. g., available space on the <b>refuge</b> <b>island)</b> in the signal optimization. A further analysis shows that a two-stage crosswalk may outperform a one-stage crosswalk in terms of both vehicle and pedestrian delays in some circumstances...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{locality}} of Pietraroia (Lower Albian, southern Apennines, Italy) {{has provided}} two fully articulated crocodylomorphs, exposed in ventral and in dorsal aspect, which are described here as representing {{a new species}} of a new genus, Pietraroiasuchus ormezzanoi gen. nov, sp. nov. The new taxon {{is found to be}} the sister taxon of Pachycheilosuchus trinquei from the Albian of the Glen Rose Formation, Texas. Pietraroiasuchus ormezzanoi resolves the phylogenetic position of the controversial P. trinquei, and is crucial in enabling an extensive understanding of the family Hylaeochampsidae. Phylogenetic analysis places Hylaeochampsa vectiana as a sister group of Iharkutosuchus makadii plus Pachycheilosuchus and Pietraroiasuchus. The phylogenetic result reveals the presence of an evolutionary mosaicism within non-crocodylian eusuchians. Mosaic features in Pietraroiasuchus are denoted by the combination of primitive character states, such as the position of the choana with its anterior margin formed by an inverted V-shaped palatine processeses, and the presumed presence of a tiny antorbital fossa, in conjunction with derived states involving the slight vertebral procoelia, the presence of tetraserial segmented dermal armour with an accessory lateral row, and isolated nuchal osteoderms. The disjoint occurrence between Pachycheilosuchus and Pietraroiasuchus species suggests that Pietraroia was a <b>refuge</b> <b>island</b> inhabited by endemic forms...|$|E

50|$|Signalised {{pedestrian}} crossings clearly separate {{when each}} type of traffic (pedestrians or road vehicles) can use the crossing.

40|$|AbstractRoad traffic crashes {{result from}} a {{combination}} of factors related to the road layout, the vehicles, the road users and the way they interact. First the main causes of pedestrian fatalities and the safety effects of road measures (traffic lights, roundabouts and refuge islands) at pedestrian crossings before and after implementation were investigated. The results indicate that there is a strong evidence for the positive effect of these measures especially on the number of the pedestrian related accidents. In the next phase a site survey was conducted in order to estimate the irregular crossing manoeuvres of car drivers and pedestrians at designated pedestrian crossings. Having analysed the irregular movements according to the type of crossing it was found, that car drivers behave the most irregularly at crossings without a <b>refuge</b> <b>island.</b> Crossings equipped with flashing yellow lights, refuge islands and traffic lights require a much more appropriate behaviour from car drivers. In the next phase of the research the waiting time of pedestrians and the delay of vehicle drivers again at pedestrian crossings were surveyed. Our results suggest {{that there is a need}} for a strong contribution of the human and the engineering fields to obtain an even more positive change in the safety of vulnerable road users...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} year, the San Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic (DPT) {{conducted}} an intensive pedestrian-safety engineering study, the PedSafe Study. PedSafe {{was funded by}} the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) *, which also funded companion studies in Las Vegas and Miami. The study was designed to analyze pedestrian injuries by zones (i. e., neighborhoods or districts) and to identify those most amenable to prevention efforts. The DPT expects to utilize the methodology and information from the PedSafe study to help shape a citywide pedestrian master plan. This paper describes the technical procedures and the pedestrian countermeasure plan that resulted. The paper analyzes pedestrian injury problems both citywide and in study zones, using crash data and field observations. It also compares two software packages {{that can be used to}} analyze crash patterns: PBCAT 1 (Pedestrian and Bicycle Crash Analysis Tool), which is available for no charge, and the CrossroadsTM 2 package, available commercially. The countermeasure plan is described for multiple funding levels, and a plan is outlined for evaluation and public outreach. The countermeasure plan proposes basic traffic engineering countermeasures including advance limit lines, curb bulbs, impactable YIELD TO PEDESTRIAN signs, median <b>refuge</b> <b>island</b> improvements, modified signal timing, pavement stencils, pedestrian head start, pedestrian scramble, and vehicle left-turn phases. In addition, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) countermeasures are recommended that include animated eyes signals, automated detection of pedestrians to adjust signal timing, modern flashing beacons, pedestrian countdown signals, radar speed display signs, roadway lighting improvements and smart lighting, and signal visibility improvements. pedestrian injuries, pedestrian safety, pedestrian fatalities, crash analysis, PBCAT, ITS countermeasures...|$|E
40|$|Cost 358 is {{to present}} a {{handbook}} on Pedestrians' Quality Needs in 2010 for all age groups. One age group is children. The main objective is to provide knowledge of pedestrians' quality needs and how these needs relate to structural and functional interventions, policy making and regulation to support walking conditions across the EU and other interested countries. This paper suggests {{a new way to}} satisfy children's rights to road safety. According to the UN ‘Children's Charter', its Convention on Children's Rights, their rights include road safety, and ratifying countries, are obliged to take all appropriate measures to implement the Convention. Child Consequence Analyses, i. e. preliminary tests of the consequences that an intended decision may have on children and young people and on their right to health, survival and to play etc. should be carried out to ensure that Children's Rights are fulfilled according to the convention. Free movement of children in the physical environment is important for their health as well as for their social, cognitive, and motor development. With increasing age, children's desire for free movement increases - and their territory gradually expands. However, this leads to increased exposure to risk: accidents to children as pedestrians are a function of mobility. The objektive is that children of preschool age should not encounter cars in their play areas or where they walk; though in some cases, vehicles travelling at a maximum of walking pace (or crawling speed) can be accepted. Children 7 to 12 should not cross streets at locations where vehicle speeds exceed 15 - 20 km/h. For older children, the same principles apply as for adult unprotected road users: they should not cross at locations where motor vehicle speeds exceed 30 km/h. This applies to routes to school, to leisure activities, and to friends. However, other measures than low speed is needed to accomplish systematic traffic planning for children. Approaches should have only one entry and one exit lane, and typically be separated by a <b>refuge</b> <b>island</b> where pedestrians cross. This is proposed to be systematically provided at bus stops, at schools, in residential areas, and other places where children can be expected to walk. For traffic quantity and composition, the aim is that traffic flows should be low, with few or no heavy vehicles. Layouts and sections should have clear visibility and clarity. Countermeasures are proposed to be used in a systematic way to achieve a safe and independent freedom of movement for children. Godkänd; 2010; 20101216 (chjo...|$|E
