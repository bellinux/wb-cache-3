50|$|Due to {{his poor}} health, Prince Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi {{went to live}} in Rome and his cousin Prince Paolo Boncompagni Ludovisi and his son Alessandrojacopo came to help him run the estate. Recognizing Alessandrojacopo’s passion for the job, Prince Alberico gave him the <b>replanting</b> <b>rights</b> and {{a small portion of}} the estate and, {{considering}} him as his successor, suggested he replant the vineyard (The Prince said he would destroy all his vines rather than see Piero get hold of them. I do not think he likes the modern methods that Piero uses to make Antinori wine. When the Prince was asked if he would save the vines for his grandchildren, he said that they learned about wine from their father, Piero, and not from him.). Under Prince Alberico’s precise instructions, Alessandrojacopo restored the vineyard by planting Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot to resume production of Fiorano Rosso wine. As for the white grapes, Prince Alberico insisted that the old varieties be abandoned in favor of Grechetto and Viognier to make Fiorano Bianco wine. Alessandrojacopo did everything Prince Alberico told him to do, from the choice of soils, to the clones and the system of vine-training, all done by organic method, right through to the making of the wine which is still done with the same craftsmanship as under Prince Alberico. In other words, Alberico gave all his past experience. Alessandrojacopo inherited Tenuta di Fiorano estate after Prince Alberico died in 2005, enhanced its vineyards and put Fiorano Rosso back on the market starting with vintage 2006. Today Tenuta di Fiorano is run by Prince Alessandrojacopo Boncompagni Ludovisi and extends for a total of some 200 hectares including vineyards, olive groves, crop and pasture land. And above all there is the historic cellar with the wines that Prince Alberico so jealously conserved and where only a lucky few, including Veronelli, were allowed to visit. Out of respect for Prince Alberico, Alessandrojacopo continues this tradition even today.|$|E
40|$|The {{premise of}} this paper is that {{viticulture}} is an expression of history and social relations. In this sense, we embrace a post-modern vision of development that characterized both economic and cultural geography and agricultural economics. Such an approach does consider culture as an element of mediation between humans and the nature, placing it {{at the heart of the}} wine-growing territory. So history and social relations have influenced the today spatial densification by types of grape and the persistence, the reduction and/or disappearance of vines’ cultivations due to the different level of integration between humans and wine territories in the Italian region of Sardinia. In this region, there are selected areas where winegrowers have been forced to grub vineyards up, depleting the regional viticultural heritage, others–within which the fabric of the system of social relationships were denser–and where we saw a real rush to purchase of <b>replanting</b> <b>rights</b> for the expansion of the production surface for the increasing of production. The aim {{of this paper}} is to highlight the role of history and social relations in the determination of the structure of the regional viticulture through the identification and analysis of diverse case studies...|$|E
