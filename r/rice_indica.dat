40|$|Abstract Background The Oryza sativa L. indica {{subspecies}} is {{the most}} widely cultivated rice. During the last few years, we have collected over 20, 000 putative full-length cDNAs and over 40, 000 ESTs isolated from various cDNA libraries of two indica varieties Guangluai 4 and Minghui 63. A database of the <b>rice</b> <b>indica</b> cDNAs was therefore built to provide a comprehensive web data source for searching and retrieving the indica cDNA clones. Results <b>Rice</b> <b>Indica</b> cDNA Database (RICD) is an online MySQL-PHP driven database with a user-friendly web interface. It allows investigators to query the cDNA clones by keyword, genome position, nucleotide or protein sequence, and putative function. It also provides a series of information, including sequences, protein domain annotations, similarity search results, SNPs and InDels information, and hyperlinks to gene annotation in both The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) and The TIGR Rice Genome Annotation Resource, expression atlas in RiceGE and variation report in Gramene of each cDNA. Conclusion The online <b>rice</b> <b>indica</b> cDNA database provides cDNA resource with comprehensive information to researchers for functional analysis of indica subspecies and for comparative genomics.

The strategy involved the induc-tion of calli from mature rice embryos and exposing the calli to different doses of gamma rays. The efficacy of different media compositions were evaluated both for callus induction and for plantlet regeneration. Selections for cold tolerance were carried out by attempting to induce the irradiated calli to regenerate at 12 °C. The putative mutants were evaluated for agronomic per-formance under controlled environments and field conditions. Data are presented on the optimal media compositions for both callus induction and plant regeneration for both indica and ja-ponica rice varieties.

To investigate {{the evolution of}} this family, four haplotypes from the two subspecies of <b>rice,</b> <b>indica</b> and japonica, were analyzed. Comparative sequence analysis of 34 genes of 10 types of paralogs of the family revealed haplotype polymorphisms and pronounced paralog diversity.

30|$|As {{the second}} most common type of {{polymorphism}} and the most abundant structural variant (Mullaney et al. 2010), InDel markers provide a higher density than traditional SSR markers and utilize the same experimental procedure as that used for SSR markers. Because InDel markers have more practical value for laboratories without the infrastructure to perform SNP genotyping (Liu et al. 2013) and because they occur more frequently than SSR markers in the rice genome and use the same experimental approaches that are routinely used for SSR markers, they have received an increasing amount of attention. Recently, InDel markers have been successfully used for genetic studies in wheat (Raman et al. 2006), rice (Hayashi et al. 2006; Ji et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2012), citrus (García-Lor et al. 2012), Arabidopsis (Hou et al. 2010; Păcurar et al. 2012) and natural populations of dogs (Väli et al. 2008). Specifically, for rice, 50 InDel markers developed by Shen et al. (2004) have successfully been used to distinguish the Basmati rice variety from other fragrant rice varieties (Steele et al. 2008).

Despite {{a number of studies}} that reported the Pi-ta gene in domesticated rice and wild species, little is known about how the Pi-ta gene has evolved in US weedy rice, a major weed of rice. To investigate the genome organization of the Pi-ta gene in weedy rice and its relationship to gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US, we analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Pi-ta gene and its surrounding 2 Mb region in 156 weedy, domesticated and wild rice relatives. We found that the region at and around the Pi-ta gene shows very low genetic diversity in US weedy rice. The patterns of molecular diversity in weeds are more similar to cultivated <b>rice</b> (<b>indica</b> and aus), which have never been cultivated in the US, rather than the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon. In addition, the resistant Pi-ta allele (Pi-ta) found in the majority of US weedy rice belongs to the weedy group strawhull awnless (SH), suggesting a single source of origin for Pi-ta. Weeds with Pi-ta were resistant to two M. oryzae races, IC 17 and IB 49, except for three accessions, suggesting that component(s) required for the Pi-ta mediated resistance may be missing in these accessions.

Consistent with the intuition of the simple Heckscher-Ohlin model, the results strongly suggest that China has a comparative advantage in labor-intensive crops, and a disadvantage in land-intensive crops. Specifically, land-intensive grain and oilseed crops are less socially profitable than fruits and vegetables. Within the grain sector, high quality rice and high quality north wheat have a more comparative advantage than early <b>indica</b> <b>rice</b> and south wheat, respectively. The findings suggest that China’s current grain self-sufficiency policy incurs efficiency losses.

40|$|Asian rice, Oryza sativa, {{is one of}} world's {{oldest and}} most {{important}} crop species. Rice {{is believed to have}} been domesticated ∼ 9, 000 y ago, although debate on its origin remains contentious. A single-origin model suggests that two main subspecies of Asian <b>rice,</b> <b>indica</b> and japonica, were domesticated from the wild rice O. rufipogon. In contrast, the multiple independent domestication model proposes that these two major rice types were domesticated separately and in different parts of the species range of wild rice. This latter view has gained much support from the observation of strong genetic differentiation between indica and japonica as well as several phylogenetic studies of rice domestication. We reexamine the evolutionary history of domesticated rice by resequencing 630 gene fragments on chromosomes 8, 10, and 12 from a diverse set of wild and domesticated rice accessions. Using patterns of SNPs, we identify 20 putative selective sweeps on these chromosomes in cultivated rice. Demographic modeling based on these SNP data and a diffusion-based approach provide the strongest support for a single domestication origin of rice. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses implementing the multispecies coalescent and using previously published phylogenetic sequence datasets also point to a single origin of Asian domesticated rice. Finally, we date the origin of domestication at ∼ 8, 200 – 13, 500 y ago, depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used, which is consistent with known archaeological data that suggests rice was first cultivated at around this time in the Yangtze Valley of China...|$|E

Microcolinearity, when present, could allow map-based cloning of agronomically important genes from {{large and small}} genome species.

The presence, order and transcriptional orientation of sh 2 and a 1 homologues are conserved among maize, rice and sorghum, but the physical distance between sh 2 and a 1 homologues is only about 20 kb in both rice and sorghum. We have completely sequenced the sh 2 / a 1 -homologous regions from indica rice (30, 035 bp), japonica rice (29, 877 bp) and sorghum (42, 446 bp). A putative transcriptional regulatory gene X was found between sh 2 and a 1 homologues in both rice and sorghum. Comparison of colinear regions of rice and sorghum indicates that only the homologues of sh 2, a 1 and gene X are conserved, while comparison of orthologous regions of indica and japonica rice reveals that sequence homology is 99 % across the two regions. The rate of divergence in the intergenic region is more than 3 -fold higher than the rate of divergence in introns and synonymous substitutions within exons.

40|$|Excessive salt is a {{major factor}} {{limiting}} crop productivity. Rice is an important food crop worldwide, and provides a major source of calories for billions of people in tropical and subtropical developing countries. In many regions throughout Southeast Asia, rice is grown in low-lying coastal regions, which are prone to ingress by seawater. Rice is highly sensitive to salt stress, with mild salinity resulting in large reductions in yield. Improving salt tolerance in rice is essential for ensuring food security for many individuals throughput the developing world. ^ In this work, the overall goals were to characterize a diverse collection of cultivated rice for salt tolerance, and elucidate the genetic basis of salt tolerance-related traits. To this end, a multidisciplinary approach that combined aspects of classical plant physiology, molecular biology, computational biology, and quantitative genetics was employed. Considerable natural variation was observed for salt-tolerance related traits. Moreover, the five subpopulations of <b>rice</b> (<b>indica,</b> temperate japonica, tropical japonica, aromatic, and aus) exhibited contrasting phenotypes, suggesting that there may be inherent differences between the subpopulations of cultivated rice for salt tolerance. ^ Phenotypes derived from classical end-point phenotyping, and temporal non-destructive imaging, were used for genome-wide association mapping. For the majority of the traits analyzed, numerous loci were identified that accounted for {{only a small portion of}} the phenotypic variation. These results indicate that many genes collectively contribute to salt-tolerance in rice. However, a single gene, HKT 1; 1, was identified and was shown to regulate root sodium content. Moreover, variants of HKT 1; 1 were shown to underlie the divergence of Indica and Japonica subspecies of rice for root Na+ content. Transcriptome data from 91 diverse accessions of the rice diversity panel were leveraged to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying the complex salt tolerance-related traits. Together, this work provides a comprehensive phenotypic and genetic analysis of the responses to moderate salinity. ...|$|E

Resultsshowed that medium without putrescine produced an earlier senescence of indica rice anther than that of japonica. The addition of 10 - 3 M putrescine into the culture media inhibited ethylene biosynthesis as anther senescence delayed, increased the three polyamines contents, and decreased the ACC content as well as ACC oxydase activity in anther-derived calli.

Molecular species of ACNs in black rice have been well documented in previous studies; however, information about the metabolic mechanisms underlying ACN biosynthesis during black rice grain development is unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine changes in the metabolic pathways that are involved in the dynamic grain proteome during the development of black <b>rice</b> <b>indica</b> cultivar, (Oryza sativa L. indica var.

Approximately 928 proteins were detected, of which 230 were differentially expressed throughout 5 successive developmental stages, starting from 3 to 20 days after flowering (DAF). The greatest number of differentially expressed proteins was observed on 7 and 10 DAF, including 76 proteins that were upregulated and 39 that were downregulated. The biological process analysis of gene ontology revealed that the 230 differentially expressed proteins could be sorted into 14 functional groups. Proteins in the largest group were related to metabolic process, which could be integrated into multiple biochemical pathways. Specifically, proteins with a role in ACN biosynthesis, sugar synthesis, and the regulation of gene expression were upregulated, particularly from the onset of black rice grain development and during development. In contrast, the expression of proteins related to signal transduction, redox homeostasis, photosynthesis and N-metabolism decreased during grain maturation. Finally, 8 representative genes encoding different metabolic proteins were verified via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, these genes had differed in transcriptional and translational expression during grain development. Expression analyses of metabolism-related protein groups belonging to different functional categories and subcategories indicated that significantly upregulated proteins were related to flavonoid and starch synthesis. On the other hand, the downregulated proteins were determined to be related to nitrogen metabolism, as well as other functional categories and subcategories, including photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, tocopherol biosynthetic, and signal transduction.

Six weeks old, scutellum derived calluses of <b>indica</b> <b>rice</b> viz., ASD 16, White Ponni, Pusa Basmati, Pusa Sugandh 4, Pusa Sugandh 5 were cocultivated with A. tumifaciens strain EHA 105, harbouring the binary vector pCAMBIA 1305. 1 with the β-glucouronidase (GUS) and hygromycin phospho transferase genes in the T-DNA region. Addition of Acetosyringone (AS) to the pre induction medium and cocultivation medium induced higher levels of transient GUS expression than that obtained with the addition of AS to either of the stages. Adddition of sucrose to both the media revealed that the transient expression levels were similar to those obtained by the addition of AS. The resultant fertile plants were stable ttransformants as revealed by GUS histochemical assay and PCR analysis for the GUS and HPT genes. The results indicated that the addition of phenolics like AS may not be essential for the induction of vir genes and development of transgenic <b>indica</b> <b>rices</b> are also possible under AS free conditions...|$|R
