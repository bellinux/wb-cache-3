40|$|The {{effect of}} tip {{clearance}} {{on the performance}} of a single stage axial flow (6000 cfm) fan was investigated for tip clearances ranging from 0. 003 in. to 0. 252 in. It was found that, at the <b>rated</b> <b>flow,</b> the stagnation pressure rise (mass flow weighted) across the fan rotor was a maximum for the smallest tip clearance and a minimum for the largest tip clearance. However, it was found also that at the <b>rated</b> <b>flow,</b> the stagnation pressure rise was larger at a tip clearance of 0. 022 in. than at a tip clearance of 0. 015 in. At a flow of 4000 cfm (two thirds of <b>rated</b> <b>flow)</b> the effect of tip clearance was found to be negligible over the entire range of clearances tested. At flows in excess of 6500 cfm, the stagnation pressure rise was highest for a tip clearance of 0. 022 in. Plotting a performance map of stagnation pressure rise across the rotor versus volume flow also revealed that as the peak pressures became higher, these peaks shifted to lower values of flow. This would indicate a shifting of the surge line vertically and horizontally on the performance map as the tip clearance is varied. The flow pattern in the original fan, as manufactured, was investigated also. This revealed that, at the <b>rated</b> <b>flow,</b> the suction sides of the stator blades were stalled over approximately the after one-half of their surface while the pressure sides were completely unstalled. This study also showed that, at all flows tested, the flow pattern at the rotor tip was somewhat turbulent, while the pattern at the rotor root was stable at high flows but became very unstable at low flows. At flows below 000 cfm reversal of flow started near the rotor tip.

Sixteen impellers are designed based on the quadratic regression orthogonal test, which have three factors including impeller outlet slope, impeller blade outlet stagger angle, and impeller blade outlet width.

The United Kingdom’s geographical location means that it {{has one of the most}} significant wave and tidal resources in the world. The implications of controlling horizontal axial flow, variable speed tidal stream turbines for the purpose of optimising energy capture, regulating power and reducing mechanical loads has been investigated. The research was separated into two main areas: control of the turbine in below <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> speeds where the objective was to maximise energy capture, and control of the turbine in high flow speeds where the aim was to regulate power, shed load and ensure the survivability of the turbine. A control strategy that maximises the power output of a tidal stream turbine in below <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> speeds, by allowing the rotor speed to be varied, was implemented. The performance of the control strategy was assessed in simulation and then implemented on a hardware in the loop test rig. In both cases the controller performed well and was able to maximise power output from the turbine by varying the rotor speed to maintain the optimum tip speed ratio. Two control strategies for regulating the output power from a tidal stream turbine in high flow speeds were investigated and compared. The first strategy relies on adjusting the pitch angle of the rotor blades to regulate power and the second assumes fixed pitch rotor blades and relies on the stall characteristic of the blades to regulate power. Models of both the pitch and stall regulated turbines were developed and simulated using the commercially available software GH Tidal Bladed®. The control system design behind both strategies was developed in Matlab. Following control implementation a comparison of each model was carried out in terms of performance under turbulent flows, loading and energy yield. Following the comparison it was concluded that the performance of the pitch regulated tidal stream turbine was superior to that of the stall regulated turbine. The research also revealed that the dynamics of each turbine model are significantly different for above <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> speed operation.

40|$|Stand-alone micro {{hydro power}} schemes {{providing}} electricity to rural villages in hilly areas in Sri Lanka where the grid electricity {{is not available}} has become a viable and popular alternative to grid electricity. For generation of electricity, most of the micro hydro schemes employ induction generators converted from ordinary induction motors. Due to many advantages such as robustness, lower cost, less maintenance, readily availability, induction machines are popular over traditionally used synchronous machines in this application. Micro hydro power plants, which employ capacitor-excited (self-excited) induction machines have been considered in this research work. Stand-alone micro hydro schemes are often located on streams and small rivers where the flowing water can be diverted to the generation of power without constructing reservoirs or ponds. Since these plants are usually less than 50 kW in capacity, they require little amount of water flow for its rated power output. Even though the water source of the plant is capable of supplying required flow for the majority period of an average year, there are some extended periods of drought, which results in reducing the <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> to the plant. In such situations, micro hydro systems have problem of maintaining its power quality in terms of voltage and frequency, since the control systems are designed only for <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. This results in variations in supply voltage and frequency thus making difficulties to the consumers such as reduction of voltage at customer end, inability to use fluorescent and CFL lamps, difficulty in using electrical motors and other appliances such as TVs. In this research work, the problem was analyzed using the existing micro hydro controllers and discussed the suggested solution by analyzing the required level of control of voltage and frequency in plant output in part flow conditions. Even though there are expensive alternatives for voltage and frequency control in such situations, emphasis made to economical development of such system to suit and feasible for actual implementation in community based micro hydro schemes. The suggested control system was designed using power electronics and discrete electronic components and it was tested at partial load conditions. Further another control system was suggested for simultaneous voltage and frequency control in <b>rated</b> <b>flow</b> conditions where existing controllers have the facility of controlling either voltage or frequency.

40|$|Addressing {{the urgent}} need to develop LCOE {{competitive}} renewable energy solutions for US energy security and to replace fossil-fuel generation with the associated benefits to environment impacts including a reduction in CO 2 emissions, this Project focused on the advantages of using hydraulic energy transfer (HET) in large-scale Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) systems for harvesting off-shore tidal energy in US waters. A recent DOE resource assessment, identifies water power resources have a potential to meet 15 % of the US electric supply by 2030, with MHK technologies being a major component. The work covered a TRL- 4 laboratory proof-in-concept demonstration plus modeling of a 15 MW full scale system based on an approach patented by NASA-JPL, in which submerged high-ratio gearboxes and electrical generators in conventional MHK turbine systems are replaced by a submerged hydraulic radial pump coupled to on-shore hydraulic motors driving a generator. The advantages are; first, the mean-time-between-failure (MTBF), or maintenance, can be extended from approximately 1 to 5 years and second, the range of tidal flow speeds which can be efficiently harvested can be extended beyond that of a conventional submerged generator. The approach uses scalable, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, facilitating scale-up and commercialization. All {{the objectives of the}} Project have been successfully met (1) A TRL 4 system was designed, constructed and tested. It simulates a tidal energy turbine, with a 2 -m diameter blade in up to a 2. 9 m/sec flow. The system consists of a drive motor assembly providing appropriate torque and RPM, attached to a radial piston pump. The pump circulates pressurized, environmentally-friendly, HEES hydraulic fluid in a closed loop to an axial piston motor which drives an electrical generator, with a resistive load. The performance of the components, subsystems and system were evaluated during simulated tidal cycles. The pump is contained in a tank for immersion testing. The COTS pump and motor were selected to scale to MW size and were oversized for the TRL- 4 demonstration, operating at only 1 - 6 % of rated values. Nevertheless, in for 2 - 18 kW drive power, in agreement with manufacturer performance data, we measured efficiencies of 85 - 90 % and 75 - 80 % for the pump and motor, respectively. These efficiencies being 95 - 96 % at higher operating powers. (2) Two follow-on paths were identified. In both cases conventional turbine systems can be modified, replacing existing gear box and generator with a hydraulic pump and on-shore components. On a conventional path, a TRL 5 / 6 15 kW turbine system can be engineered and tested on a barge at an existing site in Maine. Alternatively, on an accelerated path, a TRL- 8 100 kW system can be engineered and tested by modifying a team member's existing MHK turbines, with barge and grid-connected test sites in-place. On both paths the work can be expedited and cost effective by reusing TRL- 4 components, modifying existing turbines and using established test sites. (3) Sizing, performance modeling and costing of a scaled 15 MW system, suitable for operation in Maine's Western Passage, was performed. COTS components are identified and the performance projections are favorable. The estimated LCOE is comparable to wind generation with peak production at high demand times. (4) We determined that a similar HET approach can be extended to on-shore and off-shore wind turbine systems. These are very large energy resources which can be addressed in parallel for even great National benefit. (5) Preliminary results on this project were presented at two International Conferences on renewable energy in 2012, providing a timely dissemination of information. We have thus demonstrated a proof-in-concept of a novel, tidal HET system that eliminates all submerged gears and electronics to improve reliability. Hydraulic pump efficiencies of 90 % have been confirmed in simulated tidal flows between 1 and 3 m/s, and at only 1 - 6 % of rated power. Total system efficiencies have also been modeled, up to MW-scale, for tidal, and wind, systems. Projected efficiencies are between 81 % (full <b>rated</b> <b>flow)</b> and 86 % (1 / 3 <b>rated</b> <b>flow).</b> This high efficiency in a wide operating range compares favorably with conventional systems having a performance range of 87 % (full <b>rated</b> <b>flow)</b> to 0 % (1 / 3 <b>rated</b> <b>flow)</b> efficiency.
