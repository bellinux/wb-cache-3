25|$|Many modern CPU {{architectures}} (including {{the popular}} Intel x86 architecture) include {{some form of}} <b>ring</b> <b>protection,</b> although the Windows NT operating system, like Unix, does not fully utilize this feature. OS/2 did to some extent, using three rings: ring 0 for kernel code and device drivers, ring 2 for privileged code (user programs with I/O access permissions), and ring 3 for unprivileged code (nearly all user programs). Under DOS, the kernel, drivers and applications typically run on ring 3 (however, this is exclusive to the case where protected-mode drivers and/or DOS extenders are used; as a real-mode OS, the system runs with effectively no protection), whereas 386 memory managers such as EMM386 run at ring 0. In addition to this, DR-DOS' EMM386 3.xx can optionally run some modules (such as DPMS) on ring 1 instead. OpenVMS uses four modes called (in order of decreasing privileges) Kernel, Executive, Supervisor and User.|$|E

50|$|Ethernet <b>Ring</b> <b>Protection</b> Switching, or ERPS, is {{an effort}} at ITU-T under G.8032 Recommendation to provide sub-50ms {{protection}} and recovery switching for Ethernet traffic in a ring topology {{and at the same}} time ensuring that there are no loops formed at the Ethernet layer.

50|$|In a {{telecommunication}} network, a {{ring network}} affords fault tolerance {{to the network}} because there are two paths between any two nodes on the network. <b>Ring</b> <b>protection</b> is the system used to assure communication continues {{in the event of}} failure of one of the paths. There are two widely used protection architectures: 1+1 protection and 1:1 protection.|$|E
50|$|This {{architecture}} {{was implemented}} in the 1990s {{with the introduction of}} the SONET/SDH networks, and employed the distributed protection technique. It utilizes either path-based (UPSR) or span-based (BLSR) protection, and its recovery path is precomputed before the occurrence of a failure. ADM-based <b>ring</b> <b>protection</b> is capacity-inefficient, unlike the DCS-based mesh restoration, but has a faster recovery time (50 ms).|$|E

50|$|In ERPS {{there is}} a central node called RPL Owner Node which blocks one of the ports {{to ensure that there}} is no loop formed for the Ethernet traffic.

25|$|In {{computer}} science, hierarchical protection domains, {{often called}} <b>protection</b> <b>rings,</b> are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by improving fault tolerance) and malicious behaviour (by providing computer security).

40|$|Link {{failures}} in wide area networks are common. To recover from such failures, {{a number of}} methods such as SONET <b>rings,</b> <b>protection</b> cycles, and source rerouting have been investigated. Two important considerations in such approaches are the recovery time and the needed spare capacity to complete the recovery. Usually, these techniques attempt to achieve a recovery time less than 50 ms. In this paper we introduce an approach that provides link failure recovery in a hitless manner, or without any appreciable delay. This is achieved {{by means of a}} method called diversity coding. We present an algorithm for the design of an overlay network to achieve recovery from single link {{failures in}} arbitrary networks via diversity coding. This algorithm is designed to minimize spare capacity for recovery. We compare the recovery time and spare capacity performance of this algorithm against conventional techniques in terms of recovery time, spare capacity, and a joint metric called Quality of Recovery (QoR). QoR incorporates both the spare capacity percentages and worst case recovery times. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed technique provides much shorter recovery times while achieving similar extra capacity, or better QoR performance overall...|$|R
50|$|Callbacks {{are used}} to program {{applications}} in windowing systems. In this case, the application supplies (a reference to) a specific custom callback function for the operating system to call, which then calls this application-specific function in response to events like mouse clicks or key presses.

One designated Ethernet Ring Node, the RPL Owner Node, is responsible for blocking traffic at one end of the RPL.Under an Ethernet ring failure condition, the RPL Owner Node is responsible for unblocking its end of the RPL (unless the RPL has failed) allowing the RPL to be used for traffic. The other Ethernet RingNode adjacent to the RPL, the RPL Neighbour Node, may also participate in blocking or unblocking its end of the RPL.|$|E

With {{respect to the}} TWI technology, a new development of the upside down "T" shape TWI is reported {{for the first time}} in this thesis comparing to the existing straight TWI, and it shows better electrical properties and allows more robust processing capability. This thesis describes two structures of the photodiode integration with the TWI: via-outside-pixel (VOP) and the via-inside-pixel (VIP). The VIP structure shows advantages over the VOP structure with compact photodiode pixel arrangement. Moreover, it allows sophisticated guard <b>ring</b> <b>protections</b> to further improve the photodiode characteristics. This thesis reports experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of two different guard ring designs to the photodiode application. Upon the design and the fabrication of the novel photodiode chip, the properties of the photodiode are characterized in three aspects (electrical, optical and thermal properties) in this thesis. All the measurement and simulation data show that the demonstrated photodiode samples with the novel design can either meet or exceed the requirements (better image resolution, faster scanning speed and higher coverage rate) of the modern CT detector...|$|R
