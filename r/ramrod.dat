5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: <b>Ramrod</b> (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter <b>Ramrod</b> (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{set about}} {{changing}} the wing's tactical approach. He quickly forced the wing to abandon the line-astern tactics for the finger-four formation which offered much more safety in combat; enabling multiple pilots to participate in scanning the skies for enemy aircraft {{so as to avoid}} an attack, and also being better able to spot and position their unit for a surprise attack upon the enemy. Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson's wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a fighter sweep, <b>Ramrod</b> 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. Unteroffizier Hans Hiess from 6 Staffel bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} models had iron fittings, {{but these}} were replaced by brass in models built after 1736. Wooden <b>ramrods</b> were used with the first guns but were replaced by iron ones, although guns with wooden <b>ramrods</b> were still issued to troops on American service until 1765 and later to loyalist units in the American Revolution. Wooden <b>ramrods</b> were also used in the Dragoon version produced from 1744-71 for Navy and Marine use.|$|R

25|$|Spencer {{was wounded}} between the Spaniards' {{first and second}} {{attempts}} at boarding. He was again wounded during the fighting on deck when he received a blow from a cutlass against his head, knocking him down.

25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that could go wrong with the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the <b>ramrod</b> from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E

25|$|Further {{operations}} followed, but disaster came on 3 May 1943, when an 11-aircraft <b>Ramrod</b> raid– one to {{be continued}} regardless of losses– against Amsterdam resulted {{in the loss of}} {{all but one of the}} squadron's Venturas. After crossing the Dutch coast, the Venturas were bounced by a group of 70 to 80 German fighters. They penetrated the Spitfire escort and got in amongst 487 Squadron's bombers, damaging one and forcing it to return to base. The squadron pressed on, with further losses; by the time the Venturas had begun their bomb run, only five aircraft remained. The Germans then proceeded to pick them off, although they fought back as best they could, with Squadron Leader Leonard Trent downing one attacker with his machine-guns as the German fighter flew across his nose. Finally only Trent's aircraft remained in the air. Reaching the target, he pressed home his attack, dropping his payload– narrowly missing the target, but causing some damage– before he too was shot down.|$|E

500|$|Nock {{produced}} many innovative weapons. [...] In 1793 {{he made a}} double-barrelled pistol with {{a removable}} stock for the Royal Horse Artillery. [...] However, this weapon was impractical with the stock removed and was usually used as a carbine. [...] In 1797 Nock put into production a 9-inch pistol (pattern 1796) for heavy dragoons with a calibre matching their carbines. [...] Some of these pistols had a novel lock designed by Nock, originally intended for an abandoned musket design requested by the Duke of Richmond in 1786 while serving as Master-General of the Ordnance. [...] The new lock could be dismantled by removable pins rather than the previous more cumbersome and time-consuming screws. [...] The pattern 1796 had no butt-plate and the <b>ramrod</b> was stored in the holster rather than attached to the barrel. [...] This feature made it unpopular with users and many guns were modified to take a conventional swivel <b>ramrod.</b>|$|E
500|$|Coyotes were {{probably}} semidomesticated by various pre-Columbian cultures. Some 19th-century writers wrote of coyotes being kept in native {{villages in the}} Great Plains. The coyote is easily tamed as a pup, but can become destructive as an adult. Both full-blooded and hybrid coyotes can be playful and confiding with their owners, but are suspicious and shy of strangers, though coyotes being tractable enough {{to be used for}} practical purposes like retrieving and pointing have been recorded. A tame coyote named [...] "Butch", caught in the summer of 1945, had a short-lived career in cinema, appearing in Smoky and <b>Ramrod</b> before being shot while raiding a henhouse.|$|E
500|$|Once on site, {{they would}} be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some {{protection}} to the artillery crew. Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation. The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although {{there was still no}} effort to standardise calibres. The usual loading equipment consisted of a copper loading scoop, a <b>ramrod,</b> and a felt brush or [...] "sponge". A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon. Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool down the barrel, while acids could also be added to the water to clean out the inside of the barrel. Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going.|$|E

500|$|The {{accident}} {{contributed to}} the Royal Navy changing to breech-loading guns, which could be more conveniently worked from inside the turrets. The fragments of the destroyed gun were re-assembled and displayed {{to the public at}} the Woolwich Arsenal. The committee of inquiry decided that the gun had been double-loaded, but this view was widely questioned, including by Sir William Palliser, designer of the Palliser shell used by these guns. Palliser's view instead was that the shot had been obstructed by a portion of the millboard disc rammed above the shell. Hydraulic power-ramming was thought to be implicated in the double loading as the telescopic hydraulic rammer had not made the double loading obvious, as a manual <b>ramrod</b> would have done. One piece of evidence supporting the double loading theory was the presence of an additional stud torn from a Palliser shell, found amongst the wreckage within the turret. Thunderer was then regarded as an unlucky ship and was placed in reserve at Malta in 1881 and had her machinery [...] Her armament was augmented with a pair of [...] torpedo launchers and a half-dozen 1-inch (25mm) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck. She was recommissioned in 1885 and remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until she was paid off at Chatham Dockyard. The future King George V served aboard Thunderer in 1885–86.|$|E
