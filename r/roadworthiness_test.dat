40|$|AbstractMathematical and {{computational}} {{techniques are}} {{developed for the}} analysis of annual MOT (<b>roadworthiness)</b> <b>test</b> data that the UK Department for Transport has placed in the public domain. This paper focusses on {{the development of a new}} theory which has the potential to estimate fine-scale temporal variations (e. g., monthly) in vehicle mileage at a population level, that we call the spot rate — derived from coarse-scale (e. g., annual) mileage data at an individual vehicle level. Due to the availability of data, the focus is on the UK situation, but the theory has applications to any data set internationally, where odometer readings of individual vehicles are monitored on an occasional basis. Numerical time-stepping schemes are derived from the theory and are tested on synthetic data to permit comparison with a known ground-truth mileage rate. It is found that for practical applicability, the methods need to pre-process data with smoothing filters (a full investigation of which is beyond the scope of this paper). Finally, we consider first steps in applying the methods directly to the MOT data set and the remaining problems that must be solved for them to become a practical reality...|$|E
50|$|In Sweden {{the main}} source of grey market {{vehicles}} is the US via Germany, which has more liberal laws and better tax deals on new imported cars.

Previous legislation provided only for the vehicles of repeat offenders to be forfeited to the Crown, but the Car Hoons Act allowed for them to be used in crash testing by the Roads and Traffic Authority, for educational and deterrence purposes, and <b>roadworthiness</b> <b>testing</b> in the context of modifications.|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} heavy-duty motor vehicles’ emissions measured at cyclic <b>roadworthiness</b> <b>tests</b> of regularly used vehicles {{in the framework of}} the measurement system and comparison of various emission measurement systems. The thesis consists of two thematic sets. The first one {{discusses the}} theory of heavy-duty vehicles’ emissions with the emphasis on measurable particulate matter at the emission source and the particulate matter related theoretical threats for life and health of people. The second set discusses the preparation and implementation of particulate matter measurements on randomly selected emission rates of heavy-duty motor vehicles as well as the analysis and evaluation of measurements. These evaluations together with emission measurements on various individual longitudinal carriageway elements represent the basis for calculations and estimations of the rate of environmental burden increase due to particulate matter...|$|R

50|$|Until 2008 {{the vehicle}} {{inspection}} {{was limited to}} administrative checks (whether all taxes have been paid) and a visual check if the car matches the documents. In August 2005 the Turkish government decided to introduce a vehicle inspection scheme following the directive 96/96/EC of the European Union. Since there was no technical equipment available for real <b>roadworthiness</b> <b>tests</b> a contract was laid out with the German TÜV SÜD that was presenting itself for the task in syndication with two Turkish corporations. The TÜV Türk trust is given a monopoly on car inspection for 20 years. Beginning with 2009 the TÜV test is mandatory for all cars with the inspection scheme to follow the German inspection scheme - however there is a transition period up to 2013 where established TÜV regulations are not followed as strictly as in mainland Europe. The shift in vehicle inspection policies is nevertheless rather sharp - since the old vehicle inspection service was strickened with corruption no staff members were taken over to the TÜV Süd, the internal inspection protocol is stricter than in Germany as to prevent any corruption. The introduction of the TÜV was accompanied with a strong propaganda program to agitate the requirement for a modern inspection scheme (e.g. the number of fatal road accidents was three times as high as in mainland Europe despite {{most of the country}} to be very rural). Additionally, it is expected that the connection with the German Turks allows for most citizens to have some knowledge how to cope with the TÜV inspection scheme.Also, private vehicle inspection company otorapor.com is inspecting vehicles. Otorapor is doing 150 point inspection and 99 point inspection.|$|R
50|$|States {{that require}} <b>roadworthiness</b> and {{emissions}} <b>testing</b> as a requirement of continued licensing also require that inspectors be certified and/or {{licensed by the}} State. Those mandatory states require a minimum training level for state inspectors who typically work at fixed inspection stations. For independent pre-purchase inspectors, sometimes called 'for-hire' inspectors, states vary on licensing requirements. The {{presence or absence of}} a state license is not a guarantee of a thorough and factual pre-purchase evaluation. Rather, the defining characteristic of pre-purchase vehicle evaluators is deep automotive experience that is useful to prospective buyers. Commercial vehicle inspectors must meet applicable state and federal regulations.|$|R
