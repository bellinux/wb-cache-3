5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E

Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.|$|E

Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped.

5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E
5|$|Stalin <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters {{with a major}} political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> news calmly.

Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|A skilful pilot, Hull {{dedicated}} {{much of his}} pre-war {{service to}} aerobatics, flying Hawker Audaxes, Furies and Hurricanes. He <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of war with enthusiasm and achieved No. 43 Squadron's first victory of the conflict in late January 1940. Reassigned to Norway in May 1940 to command a flight of Gloster Gladiator biplanes belonging to No. 263 Squadron, he downed four German aircraft in an hour over the Bodø area south-west of Narvik on 26 May, a feat that earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was shot down the next day, and invalided back to England. Hull returned to action {{at the end of}} August, when he was made commander of No. 43 Squadron with the rank of squadron leader. A week later, he died in a dogfight over south London.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak's {{decision}} to discontinue the NP trains caused consternation in Montana. Mike Mansfield (D-Montana), then Senate Majority Leader, {{pointed out that}} the Empire Builder bypassed Montana's major population centers, and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt. The new company <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure and announced a resumption of service over the ex-Northern Pacific, to begin on June 14. This service took the form of an unnamed section of the Empire Builder running separately between Minneapolis and Spokane, Washington. Mansfield's intervention earned the train the nickname “Mike Mansfield Limited”. The Northern Pacific route, which included the Yellowstone River, Homestake Pass and Bitterroot Mountains, was praised for its scenery. Amtrak considered the route one of the company's six most beautiful. The train also provided a convenient connection to Yellowstone National Park at Livingston, Montana.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after he ran into a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the right to the left. Liverpool continued to press for a winner as the half drew to a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake. Neither team managed to score before full-time and the match went to extra time, {{the first time this}} happened since the 1947 final.|$|E
5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the first-half, it was Alavés who started the half the better of the two sides. Contra put a cross from {{the right side of}} the pitch into the penalty area, which was met by Moreno, whose header beat Westerveld to make the scoreline 3–2. Four minutes later Alavés had equalised. They were awarded a free-kick 25 yards away from goal and Moreno went straight through the Liverpool wall and into the goal past Westerveld. Liverpool <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scoreline being levelled at 3–3 by substituting Stéphane Henchoz with Vladimír Šmicer. Steven Gerrard was placed in the right-back position as a result of the change. Three minutes later, Owen was brought down by defender Antonio Karmona, who was subsequently booked. Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, which Gary McAllister hit into the Alavés wall. In the 64th minute, both sides made substitutions. Liverpool replaced Emile Heskey with Robbie Fowler, while Alavés goalscorer Javi Moreno with Pablo.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E
5|$|News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans {{in early}} December, and the colonists there began to panic. The city {{depended}} upon grain {{and other supplies}} from the Illinois settlement, and shipments {{up and down the}} Mississippi River would be threatened by the loss of Fort Rosalie. Governor Périer <b>reacted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of Choctaw people into the city, for fear that they were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack. He then ordered slaves and French troops to march downstream and massacre a small village of Chaouacha people who had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been intended to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists. Many Louisiana colonists—Dumont de Montigny in particular—blamed Chépart (who was killed by the Natchez) and Périer for the massacre; Louis XV, the French king, ordered Périer back to France in 1732. Périer's replacement was his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region. A year earlier, the French West India Company had given up control of the colony to Louis XV because it had been costly and difficult to manage even before the rebellion.|$|E
