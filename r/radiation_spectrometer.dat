40|$|The Internal Discharge Monitor (IDM) was {{designed}} to observe electrical pulses from common electrical insulators in space service. The sixteen insulator samples included twelve planar printed circuit boards and four cables. The samples were fully enclosed, mutually isolated, and space radiation penetrated 0. 02 cm of aluminum before striking the samples. Pulsing began on the seventh orbit, the maximum pulse rate occurred on the seventeenth orbit when 13 pulses occurred, and the pulses slowly diminished to about one per 3 orbits six months later. After 8 months, the radiation belts abruptly increased and the pulse rates attained a new high. These pulse rates were in agreement with laboratory experience on shorter time scales. Several of the samples never pulsed. If the pulses were not confined within IDM, the physical processes could spread to become a full spacecraft anomaly. The IDM results indicate {{the rate at which}} small insulator pulses occur. Small pulses are the seeds of larger satellite electrical anomalies.

40|$|Monte Carlo {{method was}} used to {{simulate}} the pulse-height response function of high-precision germanium (HPGe) detector for photon energies below 1 MeV. The calculations address the uncertainty estimation due to inadequate specifications of source positioning and to variations in the detector's physical components: dead layer thickness, spectrometer angular positioning and the presence/absence of aluminium holder. A detailed Monte Carlo model was developed using the MCNP 4 C code. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} uncertainty due to the dead layer thickness has larger effect on photons energies below 100 keV, where for 15 keV incident photon energy the total counts are by a factor of 7 times higher when the thickness is 50 % larger. Small variations in source position and angular spectrometer have minimum effect on the photon energies modelled. The absence of A 1 -holder in the Monte Carlo model reduces the Compton region information for higher energy regions. This analysis has indicated that Monte Carlo methods can represent a valuable tool for the quantitative uncertainty analysis of <b>radiation</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> They can furthermore be instrumental in the gamma-ray detector quantitative calibration and benchmarking processes, thus minimizing the need for deployment of radioactive sources.
