5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} has been popular {{in terms of}} his appearance. Nick Levine of media reporting website Digital Spy claimed in a section aimed specifically at gay <b>readers,</b> <b>that</b> Declan (played by Sorensen at the time) {{was one of the main}} reasons to tune into Neighbours after its move in the UK to Five. Levine was commenting on the character's appearance and favoured the character different occasions branding him as 'something nice to look at' and has commented that he is a 'fittie'.|$|E
5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them lately, you have been afraid, dear <b>readers,</b> <b>that</b> something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
50|$|The unmarked {{category}} {{can form}} the identifying {{mark of the}} powerful. The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else. For most Western readers, it is posited that if a protagonist's race is not indicated, it will be assumed by the <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the protagonist is Caucasian; if a sexual identity is not indicated, it will be assumed by the <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the protagonist is heterosexual; if the gender of a body is not indicated, will be assumed by the <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> it is male; if a disability is not indicated, it will be assumed by the <b>reader</b> <b>that</b> the protagonist is able bodied, just {{as a set of}} examples.|$|R

5|$|Three Mile Island is J. Samuel Walker's fourth book as the {{official}} historian of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In the book's preface, Walker tells <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> he had complete independence in its authorship—that the NRC placed no restrictions on what could be said. However, Walker provides a historical account and does not assess {{the performance of the}} NRC.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Chabon {{published}} Summerland, {{a fantasy}} novel written for younger <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> received mixed reviews but sold extremely well, {{and won the}} 2003 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award. Two years later, he published The Final Solution, a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man, whom the reader can guess to be Sherlock Holmes, during {{the final years of}} World War II. His Dark Horse Comics project The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, a quarterly anthology series that was published from 2004 to 2006, purported to cull stories from an involved, fictitious 60-year history of the Escapist character created by the protagonists of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay. It was awarded the 2005 Eisner Award for Best Anthology and a pair of Harvey Awards for Best Anthology and Best New Series.|$|E
5|$|In late 1809, while {{mourning}} {{the death of}} his 17-year-old fiancée Matilda Hoffman, Irving completed work on his first major book, A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809), a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Prior to its publication, Irving started a hoax akin to today's viral marketing campaigns; he placed a series of missing person advertisements in New York newspapers seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a crusty Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, Irving placed a notice—allegedly from the hotel's proprietor—informing <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> if Mr. Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript Knickerbocker had left behind.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale {{returned}} to Bucharest: in summer 1912, {{with help from}} journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, L'Indépendence Roumaine, informing his <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, if there ever was certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E

25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the mysteries}} of our {{intellectual}} history that these explicit statements of Maimonides, together with his other extensive instructions on how to read his book, have been so widely ignored.

25|$|When the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again {{wrote to}} defend the {{original}} series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers. The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> the series had been subjected to strong criticism. He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the series, but also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.|$|E

He comes to feel, in spite of himself, that the Roman Church is the true Church. He is also {{inclined to}}wards celibacy. Although he is much younger than Newman himself was when he converted, Reding is commonly seen as an autobiographical figure. Newman did, though, warn <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> the novel was not autobiographical and that no identification of characters should be made.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their <b>readers</b> <b>that</b> the NESARA announcement {{is going to happen}} in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
