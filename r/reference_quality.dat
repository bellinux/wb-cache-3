40|$|Growth {{in digital}} image {{processing}} technologies have completely change our way of life. In our day-to-day life, we are using a number of image processing applications knowingly or unknowingly. Many times image gets distorted somehow during the acquisition, processing, transmission, storing or sharing. So the evaluation of image quality is essential component for many image processing applications. Such image quality assessment techniques are the state-of-the-artresearch area. This paper provides a detailed survey on various image quality assessment methods. This review isprimarily focussed on three objective quality assessment methods viz. (full <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> assessment (FR-IQA), reduced <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> assessment (RR-IQA), and No <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> assessment (NR-IQA).

40|$|International audienceThe main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} lies {{in the context of}} the quality assessment of spectral image processing operators or algorithms. Several means to define quality measurements for low-level spectral image processing tools are explored, i. e. Spectral distance and spectral image filtering. The quality assessment starts from simple theoretical validation on simulated spectra to reduced and full <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> assessment on real spectral data. Spectral image of a pigment patch with different shades and a simple model of spectral noise are proposed to be used in reduced and full <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> assessment. Finally, given an application purpose, this quality assessment protocol will aid reader in selecting a correct spectral distance which will be the core of other distance-based spectral image processing tools...|$|E
40|$|Remanufacturing of {{returned}} products {{has been}} increasingly recognized in industries {{as an effective}} approach to face environmental responsibility, government regulations, and increased awareness of consumers. In this paper, we address a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) in which the manufacturer produces the brand-new products, {{as well as the}} remanufactured goods while the retailer sells these products to customers. We consider several different scenarios: the manufacturer and the retailer adopt a steady-state price or a dynamic price with <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> effects in a centralized case; either, neither or both the manufacturer and the retailer price dynamically with <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> effects, respectively, in a decentralized model. We solve the problem with the retailer recycling the sold copies and deduce the optimal pricing strategies while the manufacturer in charge of recovering the used items in such a CLSC. The result shows that dynamic pricing strategies are much more profitable for the supply chain and its members when compared with pricing statically; the dynamic pricing strategies with time-varying quality characterized by <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> are more suited to a long-term and cooperative closed-loop supply chain. Moreover, the optimal recycling fraction relies on the recovery cost coefficient and proves to be uniform despite adopting a dynamic price and quality in all distinct cases...|$|E

40|$|Image quality {{assessment}} {{has become a}} meaningful research field due to the explosive growth of image processing technologies in imaging industries. It is becoming more usual to quantify the quality of an image using image quality metrics, rather than carrying out time-consuming psychometric experiments. However, there is little research {{on the performance of}} image quality metrics on quality enhanced images. In this paper, we focus on images that have been enhanced by sharpening. A psychometric experiment was designed with observers giving scores to different images enhanced by sharpening on a display in a controlled dark environment. The results showed that full <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> metrics performed well when sharpening did not improve the visual image quality, while in images where sharpening increased the visual quality the performance was lower. No <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> metrics show better predictions than full <b>reference</b> image <b>quality</b> metrics in most cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study optimal {{contract}} design {{between a}} monopolist and {{a continuum of}} potential buyers under asymmetric information and reference-dependent preferences. In our model, the consumer’s total valuation for product quality is composed of the intrinsic consumption valuation, which is affected by privately known types, and an additional gain-loss valuation that depends on deviations of purchased quality from the <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> level. Buyers are loss-averse, so that deviations from the reference point are evaluated differently depending on whether they are gains or losses. As Kőszegi and Rabin (2006), we let gains and losses relative to the reference point be evaluated in terms {{of changes in the}} consumption valuation, but we differ in terms of how comparisons take place. In particular, each consumer evaluates actual consumption relative to his own, type-dependent <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> level alone. We consider different ways in which <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> levels are formed, capturing this process by a reference plan as a monotone function of consumer types. We derive optimal menu of contracts for loss-averse consumers and show that, depending on how reference points are formed, there is substantial difference between optimal contracts for loss-averse consumers and optimal contracts in the absence of loss aversion, and there are novel effects for product line design due to the interaction of loss aversion and incomplete information. 1...|$|E

40|$|We study optimal price {{discrimination}} when a monopolist faces {{a continuum of}} consumers with reference-dependent preferences. A consumer's valuation for product quality consists of an intrinsic valuation affected by a private state signal (type), and a gain-loss valuation that depends on deviations of purchased quality from a reference point. Following Koszegi Rabin (2006), we consider loss-averse buyers who evaluate gains and losses in terms {{of changes in the}} consumption valuation, but in our model each buyer evaluates consumption outcomes relative to his own state-contingent <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> level. We capture the process by which reference qualities are formed via a reference consumption plan, and use a generalization of the Mirrlees representation of the indirect utility to fully characterize optimal contracts for loss-averse consumers. We find that, depending on the reference plan, optimal {{price discrimination}} may exhibit (i) downward distortions beyond the standard downward distortions due to screening; (ii) efficiency gains relative to second best contracts without loss aversion; (iii) upward distortions above first best quality levels without loss aversion. We consider ex-ante and ex-post consistent contracts in which quality offers by the firm coincide, in expectations or at every state realization, respectively, with the <b>reference</b> <b>quality</b> levels. We find the firm's unique preferred ex-ante and ex-post consistent contract menu and specify conditions under which, for the second case, it also constitutes the consumers' preferred menu...|$|E
