50|$|Brick {{cheese is}} a cheese from Wisconsin, US, made in brick-shaped form. The color ranges from pale yellow to white, and the cheese has a {{sweet and mild}} flavor when young, and matures into a strong <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese</b> with age. It is a medium-soft cheese.|$|E
50|$|While rennet was {{traditionally}} produced via extraction {{from the}} inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber of slaughtered young, unweaned calves, most rennet used today in cheesemaking is produced recombinantly. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey and, at most, may be present in cheese in trace quantities. In <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese,</b> the type and provenance of chymosin used in production cannot be determined.|$|E
50|$|Torta del Casar is {{a cheese}} made from sheep's milk in the Extremadura region of Spain. It {{is named after}} Casar de Cáceres, its city of origin. The milk is curdled using a {{coagulant}} found in the pistils of the cardoon, a wild thistle. This ingredient lends a subtle bitterness to the otherwise rich and slightly salty tasting cheese. It is aged for at least sixty days. The fully <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese</b> has a creamy consistency in the center, and is traditionally eaten by slicing off the top and scooping out the inside.|$|E

An onstage refrigerator holding fresh fruit which could be offered to the audience was an essential item demanded by the band from any serious concert promoter. Indeed, the fridge itself was a revered item for the Mustapha family (as it keeps food fresh) hence the cry often heard in intense moments of performance: [...] "Can we {{take it to the}} fridge?

40|$|Solid-phase microextraction {{coupled with}} gas {{chromatography}} {{was used for}} the analysis of volatile aroma compounds in Niva cheese. The extraction conditions were very mild, which minimises thermal, mechanical, or chemical modification of the sample; the method is rapid, simple, and cheap. In total, 54 compounds were identified in Niva cheese using this method: 3 hydrocarbons, 5 aldehydes, 11 ketones, 18 alcohols, 3 esters, 10 fatty acids, and 4 sulphur compounds. These aroma compounds were quantified and subsequently the changes in the concentrations of them were studied throughout the ripening period. Most of the volatile compounds identified were present at all stages of the cheese ripening, their amounts changing significantly, however, in most cases the final concentration in the <b>ripe</b> <b>cheeses</b> was similar to the initial concentration in the unripe cheese...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the insects}} taste fairly bland when deep-fried, {{somewhat}} like popcorn and prawns. But when deep-fried together with kaffir lime leaves, chilies and garlic, the insects become an excellent snack {{to go with}} a drink. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the maeng da or maelong da na (Lethocerus indicus) has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very <b>ripe</b> gorgonzola <b>cheese.</b> This giant water bug is famously used in a chili dip called nam phrik maeng da. Some insects, such as tadpoles, ant eggs and silk worms, are also eaten boiled in a soup in Isan, or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|Nduja is {{made using}} {{meat from the}} head (minus the jowls, which are used for guanciale), {{trimmings}} from various meat cuts, some clean skin, fatback, and roasted hot red peppers which give [...] nduja its characteristic fiery taste. Nduja originates from {{the southern part of}} Calabria, namely from the small town of Spilinga and its neighborhood. It is mainly served with slices of bread or with <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese.</b> Its unique taste makes it suitable for a variety of dishes. For example, it can be added to pasta sauces.|$|E

[...] Michael Cragg of musicOMH felt that the album [...] "offers {{little in the way}} of musical experimentation" [...] and that [...] "most of it sounds like a strange amalgam of Fleetwood Mac and MGMT, as if the latter had been transposed from the slightly grubby streets of Brooklyn to the beaches of Australia." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that the duo [...] "have lots of straightforward pop chops, but they prefer to get wonky with cheesetastic, Eighties-flavored keyboards and nonsense rhymes like 'Hotdog belt donut melt/Magpie knelt by itself'", adding that the album [...] "sounds like Europop on Special K". At The Guardian, Dorian Lynskey commented that [...] "the slick, pastel-wardrobed MOR of the title track and 'We Are the People' demonstrate melodic agility and sun-dazzled charm", but viewed the album as [...] "a <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese,</b> best not consumed whole." [...] Alex Denney of The Observer remarked that [...] "the record settles upon a cooler hue, favouring minor-key shuffles that, at their best, sound like prime Bangles cuts, but tend towards pedestrian 1980s pop hackery at their worst."

40|$|PMID: 16786853 High-pressure {{processing}} is {{an appropriate}} technique for improving the microbiological safety of packaged ready-to-eat foods. The effect of high-pressure treatment on Listeria monocytogenes Scott A inoculated into fresh Hispánico-type cheese and ripe Mahón cheese was investigated. A 3. 8 -log reduction in the counts of L. monocytogenes Scott A in fresh cheese was recorded after 3 min at 400 MPa and 12 °C, whereas 18 min under the same conditions was required to obtain a 1 -log reduction in <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese.</b> Dry matter values were 48. 96 % for fresh cheese and 58. 79 % for <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese,</b> and water activity (aw) values were 0. 983 and 0. 922, respectively. In dehydrated fresh cheese (58. 20 % dry matter) in which 5 % NaCl was added to achieve a 0. 904 aw value, L. monocytogenes Scott A counts were lowered by only 0. 4 log after treatment for 10 min at 400 MPa. On the other hand, in a 60 : 40 mixture of ripe cheese:distilled water with a 0. 976 aw value, the reduction under the same conditions was 3. 9 log. Within the aw range of 0. 945 to 0. 965, L. monocytogenes Scott A barotolerance was significantly higher in fresh cheese than in <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese</b> for equivalent aw values. Carbohydrate content was higher in fresh cheese than in <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese.</b> The addition of lactose at a concentration of 5 mg/g to an 85 : 15 mixture of ripe cheese:distilled water did not influence L. monocytogenes Scott A barotolerance during treatment for 10 min at 400 MPa. Galactose at a concentration of 5 mg/g had a protective effect during high-pressure treatment, and glucose at a concentration of 5 mg/g favored L. monocytogenes Scott A survival during refrigerated storage of pressurized samples at 8 °C for 5 days.

50|$|Lüneberg is a cow's-milk cheese made in {{mountain}} valleys in Vorarlberg in western Austria. Cheesemaking was introduced into this region from Switzerland; copper kettles and Swiss-type presses {{are used to}} make Lüneberg cheese. Milk is coloured with saffron and warmed to around 90 F; enough rennet is added to coagulate in 20 to 30 minutes. The curd is cut into pieces the size of hazelnuts and is heated, while stirring, to 122 F. It is then placed into cloths which are pressed lightly in wooden forms. After 24 hours in the press, during which time the cheeses are turned and the cloths are occasionally changed, the cheeses are taken to a curing cellar. They are salted on the surface, and rubbed and washed occasionally while curing. When <b>ripe,</b> the <b>cheese</b> {{is said to be}} about midway in characteristics between Emmental and Limburger.|$|R
40|$|Cheddar cheese {{has been}} {{manufactured}} with Lactobacillus casei Zhang as the dairy starter adjunct. L. casei Zhang {{had previously been}} isolated from koumiss collected from Xilin Guole in Inner Mongolia and characterized in detail {{with regard to their}} probiotic potential. The addition of L. casei Zhang to Cheddar cheese had no adverse effects on sensory criteria. The cheese made with 0. 1, 1 and 2 % of the probiotic strain L. casei Zhang adjuncts contained high levels of the Lactobacillus after 6 months of ripening with final counts of 9. 6 · 10 ^ 7, 7. 7 · 10 ^ 7 and 1. 02 · 10 ^ 8 CFU/g, respectively. In the <b>ripe</b> control <b>cheese,</b> without the addition of probiotic strain L. casei Zhang, the number of Lactobacillus reached 5. 7 · 107 CFU/g. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR) analysis was used to distinguish the added L. casei Zhang from the natural flora of the cheese and to determine whether L. casei Zhang grew in the cheese. ACE-inhibitory activity and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the cheese were measured. Compared with control cheese, experimental cheese with 0. 1, 1 and 2 % of probiotic strain L. casei Zhang revealed some increase in ACE-inhibitory activity and GABA mass fraction. In the present study, the production of both ACE-inhibitory activity and GABA in the probiotic cheese with the L. casei Zhang adjunct isolated from koumiss has been found for the first time. The results suggest that cheese with the probiotic strain L. casei Zhang showed good potential for application in the management of hypertension...|$|R

In this study, biphasic approach was carried out for identification and typing the Lactobacilli isolates of Motal cheese.|$|E
40|$|Kortowski cheese (Műnster type) was salted for 100, 75, 50 and 25 % {{of their}} {{standard}} salting time, which is 48 hours. Cheese after 3 weeks of ripening and cheese immediately after salting were stored for 6 and 12 months at - 27 °C. Cheese of lower salting level ripened faster, both after salting and after frozen storage. The process of protein degradation occurred during frozen storage of ripe cheeses. The content of N-amino acid in <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese</b> after frozen storage and in cheese ripening after storage was {{almost twice as}} high as in the cheese that ripened after salting. Separations on Sephadex gel confirm the process of protein degradation during frozen storage of cheese.

40|$|The {{undefined}} microbial floras {{derived from}} the surface of <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese</b> which are used for the ripening of commercial red smear cheeses have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as single-strain starter cultures on model red smear cheeses to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ. On cheeses ripened with lin+ strains, a growth reduction of L. ivanovii and L. monocytogenes of 1 to 2 log units was observed compared to cheeses ripened with lin strains. Linocin M 18 activity was detected in cheeses ripened with lin+ strains but was not found in those ripened with lin strains. We suggest that production of linocin M 18 contributes to the growth reduction of Listeria observed on model red smear cheeses but is unsufficient to explain the almost complete inhibition of Listeria caused by some undefined microbial floras {{derived from the}} surface of ripe cheeses...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the growth, {{survival}} and peptidolytic activity of Lactobacillus plantarum I 91 in a hard-cheese model {{consisting of a}} sterile extract of Reggianito cheese. To assess {{the influence of the}} primary starter and initial proteolysis level on these parameters, we prepared the extracts with cheeses that were produced using two different starter strains of Lactobacillus helveticus (Lh 138 or Lh 209) at three ripening times: 3, 90 and 180 days. The experimental extracts were inoculated with Lb. plantarum I 91; the control extracts were not inoculated, and the blank extracts were heat-treated to inactivate enzymes and were not inoculated. All extracts were incubated at 34 ºC for 21 days, and then the pH, microbiological counts and proteolysis profiles were determined. The basal proteolysis profiles in the extracts of young cheeses made with either strain tested were similar, but many differences between the proteolysis profiles of the extracts of the Lh 138 and Lh 209 cheeses were found when <b>riper</b> <b>cheeses</b> were used. The pH values in the blank and control extracts did not change, and no microbial growth was detected. In contrast, the pH value in experimental extracts decreased, and this decrease was more pronounced in extracts obtained from either of the young cheeses and from the Lh 209 cheese at any stage of ripening. Lb. plantarum I 91 grew up to 8 log during the first days of incubation in all of the extracts, but then the number of viable cells decreased, the extent of which depended on the starter strain and the age of the cheese used for the extract. The decrease in the counts of Lb. plantarum I 91 was observed mainly in the extracts in which the pH had diminished the most. In addition, the extracts that best supported the viability of Lb. plantarum I 91 during incubation had the highest free amino acids content. The effect of Lb. plantarum I 91 on the proteolysis profile of the extracts was marginal. Significant changes in the content of free amino acids suggested that the catabolism of free amino acids by Lb. plantarum I 91 prevailed in a weakly proteolysed medium, whereas the release of amino acids due to peptidolysis overcame their catabolism in a medium with high levels of free amino acids. Lb. plantarum I 91 was able to use energy sources other than lactose to support its growth because equivalent numbers of cells were observed in extracts containing residual amounts of lactose and in lactose-depleted extracts. The contribution of Lb. plantarum I 91 to hard-cooked cheese peptidolysis was negligible compared to that of the starter strain; however, its ability to transform amino acids is a promising feature of this strain.

A number of aroma active {{substances}} contribute to flavour of cheese. From the chemical point of view they are volatile compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, esters, lactones, terpenes etc. Their content increases during ripening by influence of proteolytic and lipolytic changes and creates aroma, which is characteristic for type of cheese. The development of these components was monitored in chosen Edam cheese (30 % fat in dry matter) by headspace-SPME/GC method. The fiber CARTM/PDMS 85 µm was used for extraction of aroma compounds. The samples were taken from cheesemilk up to technologically <b>ripe</b> <b>cheese.</b> In total 30 aromatic compounds were identified, their content increased during ripening. The first increase was observed after pressing and then especially in second part of ripening. For comparison Edam cheese samples were also sensorially evaluated during ripening.
