40|$|Degradation {{mechanism}} of laser-induced damage of porous ZrO 2 /SiO 2 high <b>reflective</b> <b>films</b> was discussed in vacuum. The experimental {{results show that}} the laser-induced damage (LIDT) in vacuum dropped to 57 % of its atmospheric value and 65 % of the value filled with air after vacuum pumping for the high <b>reflective</b> <b>films.</b> Typical damage micrographs of the films in air and in vacuum were obtained, showing the distinct damage morphologies. Such a degradation {{mechanism of}} laser-induced damage was found to originate from the water desorption on the surface and internally in porous films, which could cause a decrease of the thermal conductivity. A theoretical and kinetic model was used to illustrate the occurrence of the damage and corresponding damage morphologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

The fact that the reflectors move the light source far away from the eye of anyone who would happen to look into them helps to further eliminate glare problems.|$|R

40|$|Monolayer ZrO 2 and {{multi-layer}} ZrO 2 /SiO 2 {{films were}} contaminated deliberately with toluene in vacuum environments. Laser-induced damage tests {{were made on}} clean and contaminated ZrO 2 /SiO 2 high <b>reflective</b> <b>films.</b> Surface adsorption layer model was presented to evaluate the impact of organic contaminations on the laser-induced damage. Based on this model, the distributions of electric field and temperature field in multi-layer ZrO 2 /SiO 2 films were calculated. Results show that the mere organic contaminations cannot induce the thermal damage of optical films. The inter-coupling between defects and organic contaminations is probably attributed to the decrease of the laser-induced damage threshold in contaminated samples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} UK conservatories {{came to a}} halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of insulated glass in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using insulated glass. In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter. Technologies include argon-impregnated glass, heat <b>reflective</b> <b>film,</b> thermal ribbons or thermal breaks - hollow sections of glass that intercept heat.|$|E
40|$|Light plays a {{fundamental}} role in plants in many ways, including plant growth, development and productivity. In kiwifruit, vines can often produce a dense canopy {{that results in}} low light levels in the fruiting zone at the lowest portion of the canopy. Therefore, to improve the light environment by changing the distribution of light throughout the canopy, <b>reflective</b> ground <b>films</b> can be applied in orchard. These films have now begun to see routine use in horticultural production in New Zealand, particularly within the pipfruit industry for fruit colour finishing. However, there are arguably extremely limited studies to date describing the reflective covers application in kiwifruit. In our study, the Ultramat white UV woven reflective ground cover was tested in a 22 year-old ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit orchard applied with T-bar in Plant Growth Unit of Massey University, New Zealand in Season 2011 / 2012. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of the use of <b>reflective</b> <b>films</b> on the light environment in a kiwifruit orchard; on regulating fruit quality i. e. fruit fresh weight, fruit skin colour, fruit dry matter percentage and compounds such as phenolics in fruit skin as well as on enhancing bud break, return bloom and fruitset. From our results, films had positive effects on fruit quality parameters, such as fruit fresh weight, firmness, soluble solids content and dry matter percentage, especially in fruit lower canopy. Besides the enhancements of individual fruit quality, films also showed a tendency to promote fruit quality consistency in fruit fresh weight and dry matter percentage. The application of <b>reflective</b> <b>films</b> may also appear to have an enhancement of bud break, return bloom and fruitset in the following season. However, there are still several aspects unknown in this study such as the relationship between reflective ground covers and kiwifruit skin phenolics content, and many of the differences described here were not statistically significant. Thus, to fully understand the effects of reflective ground covers in the future, more experiments are needed, and moreover, sample fruits should be measured based on storage time to further understand the effects of reflective ground covers on kiwifruit storage life...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} effects of bagging and <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> on peach fruit coloration, this study explored the effects of applying <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> before harvest on fruit appearance quality of peach (Prunus persica), and discussed the influencing mechanism on fruit coloration. Yellow outside and black inside double-layer bags were removed from fruit twelve days d before harvest. Peel color, pigment content, enzyme activity as well as the gene expression related to fruit coloration of a well-colored and late-ripening peach cultivar ‘Xiahui 8 ’ with different treatments (non-bagging with non-reflective film mulching, debagging with non-reflective film mulching, debagging with <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> mulching) were researched. The results showed that both debagging with non-reflective film mulching and debagging with <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> mulching could significantly improve red and green color difference value (a*), a*/b* (b* is yellow and blue color difference value), chroma (C), anthocyanin (Ant) content and reduce hue angle (h), while debagging with <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> mulching had higher Ant content than debagging with non-reflective film mulching (P < 0. 05). The two treatments up-regulated the transcript level of anthocyanin biosynthetic related genes (UFGT, CHS) at the beginning of the experiment, however, the expression of DFR, LDOX and F 3 H were enhanced along with the testing process. A downward trend on peel phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity of non-bagging with non-reflective film mulching was observed during the experiment, however, the peel PAL activity of the other two treatments first increased and then decreased. What’s more, peel PAL activity of debagging with <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> mulching was higher than debagging with non-reflective film mulching. These results suggested that Ant synthesis in the peel was the result of cooperation among several genes, and debagging with <b>reflective</b> <b>film</b> mulching had better effect on promoting Ant accumulation than debagging with non-reflective film mulching...|$|E
