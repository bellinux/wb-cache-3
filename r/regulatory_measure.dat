40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Situation of Municipalities with Extended Competence in Planning and Implementing <b>Regulatory</b> <b>Measures.</b> The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} and how the municipalities with extended competence in the South Bohemian and Vysočina regions are ready to execute <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> and if the level of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> corresponds with the needs of citizens to whom the measures are applied. In the theoretical section of this thesis, the municipality with extended competence with its authorities is defined. The <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures,</b> their preparation and implementation are introduced. In the research section two hypotheses were stated. The first was focused on quality and adequate training of the staff of municipalities with extended competence so that to minimize the risks associated with inadequate planning and implementation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures.</b> The research has proved that from the perspective of municipalities with extended competence there are considerable uncertainties in the interpretation of the practical implementation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> by administrative authorities. Significant differences were found in the documentation focused on <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures.</b> The second hypothesis was focused on shortcomings after the implementation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> among the population of the South Bohemian and Vysočina regions, {{in the sense that it}} negatively affects the tolerance limits. It has been found that most respondents would tolerate the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures,</b> but according to the response, the readiness of crisis management workers has been rather inadequate. In this thesis, the method of quantitative research was chosen. The technique of data collection was anonymous questionnaires made up for 32 municipalities with extended competence and 100 residents in the South Bohemian and Vysočina regions and for 50 residents of the South Bohemian region. In municipalities with extended competence all 32 municipaties were addressed, but only 24 questionnaires were returned. In the residents all 100 respondents were addressed the return rate of questionnaires was 100 %. The results are shown in graphs and as percentages...|$|R

A key concept in this discussion is the mandatory break up of vertically integrated gas companies, also known as unbundling. This master thesis examines several of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> introduced in the 2003 and 2009 gas directives. A theoretical model with the aim to predict the effects of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> is devised. This model defines the price level as the dependent variable and several of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> as explanatory variables. With a fixed effects panel regression the model is tested. Data on the European gas market is gathered from Eurostat, the European Commission and OECD. None of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> could be determined to have a significant effect on gas prices. The main explanatory variable was found to be the price of oil lagged on year, reaffirming a close link between the gas and oil markets...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of antibiotics}} increases the appearance of bacterial resistance and forces the use of more expensive alternatives. The Chilean Ministry of Health is regulating the consumption of antibiotics since September 1999. These <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> restricted the sale of antibiotics only when these were prescribed by an MD or an DS. Aim: To study {{the impact of these}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> on antibiotics sales in pharmacies. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of antibiotics sales in pharmacies from 1996 to 2000. The information was obtained from the International Marketing System (IMS Health), an auditing system of pharmacy sales. The consumption unit used was the Defined Daily Dose per 1000 inhabitants/day (DDD). Results: There was an important reduction in DDD, after the introduction of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures,</b> for amoxicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulpha, chroramphenicol, cloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin. There was also a important fall in sales, expressed in dollars. Conclusions: The <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> of the Ministry of Health, had an immediate and great impact on antibiotics sales in Chile (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 1265 - 72) ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> - {{the degree}} of {{economic}} action to solve the economic recession. In this thesis the author presents the basic view of the regulatory system of the measures as a degree of economic action {{to deal with the}} economic recession. The introductory part of the thesis is addressed to become familiar with {{the current state of the}} issue of the control measures, the types of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> and their application when there is an emergency situation. There is also an outline of the use of control measures in this area of activity. The thesis further contains an analysis of available documentation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> for economic recession situation and the authentication of the hypothesis whether municipalities with extended authority in the Czech Republic have sufficiently prepared documentation dealing with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> for these type of situations. As a part of this thesis, a research was conducted through questionnaires. The research was focused on the level of processed documentation of municipalities with extended authority in the Czech Republic and the readiness of these communities in an economical critical situation. Based on the evaluation of these questionnaires the hypothesis was confirmed. The author has pointed out the inconsistencies (disunity) in the quality of processed documentation of municipalities with extended authority and a lack of uniformity among the financial management personnel to deal with an economic crisis. As a result of this thesis training aids and materials for the decision making and management to solve an economic crisis and on the use of specific <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> have been prepared...|$|R

5000|$|The awkwardness of the baseball-football conversion, {{as well as}} the low seating {{capacity}} (around 54,000 for football) and that the prime seating on the east side consisted of temporary bleachers led the Raiders to explore other stadium options. One such option was Memorial Stadium on the UC Berkeley campus. Several preseason games were played there in the early 1970s along with one regular season game in 1973 (a 12-7 victory over the Miami Dolphins during September while the A's regular season was going on). However, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raiders games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive.

50|$|Senate Bill 375 was {{introduced}} as {{a bill in}} order to meet the environmental standards set out by the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). Since its implementation in 2006, AB 32 has facilitated the passage of a cap-and-trade program in 2010 which placed an upper limit on greenhouse gas levels emitted by the state of California. AB 32 has contributed to its initial objectives of curbing climate change by establishing a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various sources throughout California. AB 32 mandates that California reaches 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, which is a twenty five percent decrease from the current levels in the state. Firstly, AB 32 purports to ratify a scoping plan to reach the most practicable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from different sources. This scoping plan outlines how actions will be taken to reduce these emissions and how particular regulations and strategies or plans can contribute to this goal. Also, AB 32 identifies the levels of emissions, sets feasible limits, and adopts a <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> to necessitate the mandatory reporting of these emission measures. The main components within the AB 32 policy have been to institute the cap-and-trade project, increase fuel efficiency in vehicles, decrease the carbon content in fuel, and motivate communities to become energy efficient. In order to fulfill these objectives, SB 375 aims to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by vehicles, reduce the amount of carbon in fuel, and reduce the distance in vehicle trips. SB 375 serves as the nation’s first ever law to associate global warming with land use planning and transportation. SB 375 addresses these issues by tracking the levels of emissions from vehicles and by modifying the planning allocations of regional housing and transportation in order to create transportation and land use patterns such that the public will drive their vehicles less. Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) within California are now concerned with carrying out these roles in order to amend these patterns and incentivize the restructuring of plans that contribute in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.SB 375 went into effect on January 1, 2009 and endured twelve amendments from various groups which modified its initially more stringent mandates. SB 375 takes travel time into account by acknowledging that the development of transportation and land systems affects the amount of time that the public spends driving. The bill’s objective is to lead each of California’s regions to adopt more long-term sustainable investments across multiple sectors by lessening the extent to which Californians spend time driving and reducing air pollution through these efforts. These sustainable investments are meant to decrease driving distances in order to make driving less necessary. Multiple regional planning commissions, local governmental bodies, and state environmental groups are responsible for SB 375’s implementation.|$|E

30|$|In short, as a {{first step}} {{identification}} as SVHC according to Article 57 of the REACH regulation needs to be considered. Such substances become included in the REACH candidate list. Article 57 of the REACH Regulation allows to include substances on the candidate list that (i) are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR) category 1 A or 1 B, (ii) have persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or (iii) very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) properties according to REACH (Annex XIII), or (iv) have an equivalent level of concern as CMR or PBT/vPvB substances. The inclusion of a substance in the candidate list results in obligations for the manufacturer to provide information to downstream users and to consumers (if >  0.1 % proportion in articles). This <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> alone is not sufficient to control the emissions of short-chain PFASs. But the inclusion into the candidate list is a strong signal itself since it contains all substances of very high concern identified within the EU. For substances on the candidate list REACH foresees authorisation as the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure.</b> In such case, using the substance is only allowed if authorization was granted. However, an authorisation does apply only for the substance itself and does not include any precursor substances. Furthermore, the authorisation procedure does not include imported articles, probably contributing to the emissions of short-chain PFASs in Europe. Consequently, starting the authorisation procedure would not constitute an effective risk management option. A restriction (Article 67) can cover the placing of a substance on the market, the content of a substance in (imported) articles, the use of such a substance on its own or in a mixture and respective precursors. Thus, a general restriction can address all relevant emission routes and is considered the appropriate <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> for short-chain PFASs under REACH. To decide if certain exemptions might be appropriate, further detailed information on uses and alternatives are necessary. Once in force, the restriction is valid for the European Economic Area (EEA), having a population of more than 500 million people.|$|E
