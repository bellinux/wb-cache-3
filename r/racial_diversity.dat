5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce <b>racial</b> <b>diversity</b> at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v.

In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve <b>racial</b> <b>diversity.</b> In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{is often}} {{said to be a}} {{cultural}} melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music {{can be traced back to}} specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation of West African music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and <b>racial</b> <b>diversity</b> has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of being a supporting character in her own film, having been relegated to the secondary role of love interest. The character has garnered mixed reviews, with much denunciation directed towards her storyline and personality, both of which critics have dismissed as uninteresting and unoriginal; they have also accused Jasmine of lacking the depth of her predecessors Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991), respectively, to whom she continues to be heavily compared. However, as the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise's first non-white member, the character is credited with introducing <b>racial</b> <b>diversity</b> to Disney's princess genre, although she has at the same time been criticized for being Westernized and Anglicized in both appearance and demeanor. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdins sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to the role.

State racism culminated in the 2004 Citizenship Referendum, in which, at a majority of four to one, the Irish electorate voted for the removal of birth right citizenship to children of migrants. Based on Goldberg?s theory of the racial state, which, in constructing homogeneity, obscures existing heterogeneities, and on Foucault?s theory of biopolitics, leading to the state supposedly caring for the population through a series of technologies aiming to regulate and manage <b>racial</b> <b>diversities,</b> the article examines recent developments in Ireland?s immigration and asylum policies.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} {{political}} implications of <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity.</b> Unlike previous research, this study seeks to provide a more inclusive examination of race and ethnicity. More specifically, the analysis of this dissertation encompasses multiple racial and ethnic groups, including whites, blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian Americans. The focus of the examination centers on the impact of <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity</b> on individual-level attitudes and congressional election outcomes. The specific questions posed herein revolve around the issues of when and how <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity</b> impacts American politics. The findings produced in this study not only indicate that diversity is related to attitudes and electoral outcomes, but also suggests {{the nature of the relationship}} is complex. The analysis indicates that individual-level attitudes vary across racial and ethnic groups. Indeed, attitudes across minority groups are more similar than when compared to the majority. Additionally, the findings suggest that the impact of <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity</b> varies across <b>racial</b> and ethnic groups. When considered concurrently, this portion of the dissertation suggests that the impact of diversity on attitudes is complex. The second portion of the dissertation examines the electoral implications of <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity.</b> The analysis indicates as diversity increases electoral volatility increases. In fact, the findings suggest that increased diversity is associated with an increased risk of incumbent turnover and electoral competition. Further, the examination indicates the increased volatility associated with higher levels of diversity increases the likelihood that quality challengers will emerge to oppose the incumbent candidate. The findings presented in this dissertation offer valuable insight to the role of racial and ethnic groups in the American political system. This information serves not only as a stepping stone for future research, but is also suggestive of implications for individual-actors involved in the political system. Future research must extend previous work to provide a more inclusive and systematic analysis of the implications of <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>diversity.</b> Finally, politicians may find the results useful in their attempts to represent constituents and seek election (and re-election) ...|$|R

At the same time, the church struggled with how to deal with increasingly pluralistic voices within the church and within Mormonism.

Among 75 SNPs analyzed, 13 and 10 SNPs were associated with VWF antigen levels in EA male and EA female subjects, respectively. However, only one SNP (RS 1063857) was significantly associated with VWF antigen in AA females and none was in AA males. Haplotype analysis of the ARIC samples and studying <b>racial</b> <b>diversities</b> in the VWF gene from the 1000 genomes database suggest a greater degree of variations in the VWF gene in AA subjects as compared to EA subjects.
