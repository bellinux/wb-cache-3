5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a <b>renewable</b> <b>resource.</b> Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Renewable</b> <b>resources</b> are {{available}} each year, unlike non-renewable resources, which are eventually depleted. A simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, {{if it is}} managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy <b>resources</b> are <b>renewable</b> <b>resources.</b> <b>Renewable</b> <b>resources</b> {{account for more than}} 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves.

40|$|We {{consider}} a generalization {{of the classical}} resource constrained project scheduling problem. We introduce so-called partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources</b> by assuming for each resource a capacity on subsets of periods. The concept of partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources</b> is a fundamental tool in order to make, e. g., timetabling and shift scheduling aspects, amenable to project scheduling. In addition, partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources</b> serve to model complicated labor regulations. Furthermore, they cover traditional <b>renewable</b> and nonrenewable <b>resource</b> constraints as special cases. We consider makespan minimization as objective. For the exact solution of the problem we employ a basic enumeration scheme. In order to speed up convergence, we formulate bounds which take into account future resource consumption of partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources.</b> Moreover, we generalize the serial scheduling scheme {{in order to get}} fast approximation methods. A rigorous assessment of the procedures is provided by solving ProGen instances generated under a full factorial test design. Besides the well-known problem parameters we employ additionally three parameters which control the generation of partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources.</b> project scheduling, <b>resource</b> constraints, partially <b>renewable</b> <b>resources,</b> branch-and-bound algorithm, serial scheduling scheme...|$|R
