25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear <b>stress</b> <b>reversal.</b> If <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place.

In this thesis potential for introducing a secondary fracture along a different azimuth to the primary fracture is also investigated. In view of this a series of numerical models to simulate fracture propagation in poroelastic medium, production and capture the <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> due to production were formulated. The hydraulic fracture model {{takes into account the}} interaction of the fracture, wellbore and the reservoir in a fully coupled manner. This allows a realistic simulation of near fracture behaviour such as leak-off and back stress. It was found that fracture propagation pressure is higher for poroelastic medium than that for elastic medium. The rate of fracture growth was high at high injection rates, low values of fracture toughness and in low permeability reservoirs. A wide fracture is achieved for formation with high values of fracture toughness and also in case of high viscous fluids used for fracture treatment. It was also found that horizontal permeability anisotropy has a significant impact on production from a hydraulically treated reservoir: production is high when ky (in the direction perpendicular to fracture azimuth) is higher than kx. The <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> induced by production from a hydraulically stimulated reservoir was dependent on many factors. A larger <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> window was obtained in case of reservoirs with low permeability, low stress differential (difference between minimum and maximum horizontal stress) and high pressure differential (difference between initial reservoir pressure and wellbore pressure). For longer initial fracture half lengths, larger <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> regions were obtained. Based on combinations of horizontal permeability anisotropy and initial fracture half length optimal time window for refracturing was evaluated. From {{the results of this study}} it was observed that conducting of a secondary fracture treatment is more beneficial with short initial hydraulic fracture half length and favourable horizontal permeability anisotropy (kx > ky).

In the presence of hydrogen we analyzed the applicability of idealized <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> curve for amorphous silicon thin films deposited by DC, pulsed DC (PDC) and RF sputtering. We are successfully able to correlate the microstructure with the <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> and hardness. We observed a <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> from compressive to tensile with hydrogen incorporation. It was found that unlike in idealized <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> curve case, though the energy of plasma species is less in DC plasma, DC deposited films exhibit more compressive stress, followed by PDC and RF deposited films. A tendency towards tensile stress from compressive stress was observed at similar to 13, 18 and 23 at%H for DC, PDC and RF deposited films respectively, which is in exact agreement with the vacancy to void transition in the films. Regardless of the sputtering power mode, the hardness of a-Si:H films is found to be maximum at C-H similar to 10 at%H. Enhancement in hardness with C-H (up to C-H similar to 10 at%H) is attributed to increase of Si-H bonds. Beyond C-H similar to 10 at%H, hardness starts falling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen new, {{emerging}} innovation of Ultrasonic Testing (UT). Specifically, multiple manufacturers have produced Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) systems. The PAUT systems embed a matrix of multiple (some up to 128) single transducers into one probe used for scanning elastic materials.

40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} and acoustic emission {{were used}} in a single in situ experiment in order to study the deformation twinning of two ZM 20 Mg alloys with significantly different grain sizes at room temperature. The combination of these two techniques facilitates the distinction between twin nucleation and twin growth. It is shown that yielding and immediate post-yielding plasticity in compression along the extrusion direction is governed primarily by twin nucleation, whereas plasticity at higher strains is presumably governed by twin growth and dislocation slip. It is further shown that, in the fine-grained alloy, collaborative twin nucleation in many grains dominates yielding, whereas twin nucleation in the coarse-grained alloy is progressive and occurs over a larger strain range. In addition, it is shown that, despite twin nucleation stresses increasing with decreasing grain size, roughly the same overall volume fraction of twins is formed in both fine and coarse parent grains. This confirms {{the difficulty of the}} alternative deformation modes and suggests a negligible suppressive effect of grain size on twinning {{in the case of the}} strongly textured fine-grained alloy.

In the model, there are three exogenous changes that are considered as possible determinants of the reversal: a) time-varying labor market returns to education; b) time-varying values to the husband and wife of the wife 2 ̆ 7 s home time. c) time-varying cohort size and fertility rate. The model also incorporates gender heterogeneity in the utility value of schooling net of its effort cost as another possible driving force. Estimation is done by Simulated Method of Moments. From the counterfactual experiments based on the estimated model, I find that the relative increase of women 2 ̆ 7 s skill rental price is the key driving force of the relative increase of women 2 ̆ 7 s educational attainment. However, the relative increase of women 2 ̆ 7 s skill rental price itself cannot replicate the reversal. On the other hand, neither the declining value of the wife 2 ̆ 7 s home time (to both husbands and wives) nor the gender heterogeneity in the net consumption value of schooling alone can explain the relative increase in women 2 ̆ 7 s educational attainment.

40|$|Abstract. Under seismic actions, {{reinforced}} concrete columns are generally damaged {{by a combination}} of repeated <b>stress</b> <b>reversals</b> and high <b>stress</b> excursions. An experimental study was undertaken to investigate cumulative damage in {{reinforced concrete}} rectangular columns subjected to repeated cyclic loadings. Fourteen identical half-scale concrete columns were fabricated and tested to failure.

A companion paper will present the results of variable amplitude tests to develop an analytical model of cumulative damage for rectangular reinforced concrete columns. Test observations indicate two potential failure modes: low cycle fatigue of the longitudinal reinforcing bars; and confinement failure due to rupture of the confining hoops. The former failure mode is associated with relatively large displacement amplitudes, while the latter is associated with a larger number of smaller amplitude cycles.

30|$|Alternatively, Sibson ([2013]) {{interpreted}} this <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> {{associated with}} the Tohoku-Oki earthquake by the fault valve model (Sibson, [1992]), where the pore fluid pressure is built up before the earthquake, and this lowers the effective normal stress and results in seismic rupture on the fault plane. According to his model, although the stress field in the forearc hanging wall above the megathrust was in an E-W horizontal compression state and a vertical extension before the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, that was switched to an E-W horizontal extension and vertical compression immediately after the earthquake due {{to the release of}} horizontal stress and fluid discharge leading to a decrease in the pore fluid pressure. Fluids, which were discharged from the megathrust, are inferred to have percolated along the vertical cracks under the horizontal, extensional stress in the hanging wall. In fact, such vertical, extensional fault-fracture systems of different scales were reported from ancient accretionary prisms where fluid percolation along the fractures was exemplified by the formation of mineral veins precipitated from the solution. Sibson ([2013]) argued that different scales of extensional fault-fracture systems exist, which depend on the degree of release of seismic energy, and for example, one can refer to the large-scale Alsaska-Juneau Au deposit hosted by quartz veins (Goldfarb et al.[1988]; Miller et al.[1994]) and the small-scale quartz-carbonate veins in the Nobeoka thrust zone in the Shimanto accretionary complex in Kyushu, Japan (Yamaguchi et al.[2011]). The forearc horizontal extension immediately after the earthquakes is again succeeded by horizontal compression when the fractures along the megathrust are sealed by mineral veins and the strength is recovered. Therefore, the <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> in the present calcite vein sample can be also interpreted in this way. However, if the present calcite vein is originally formed in the horizontal direction {{associated with the}} buildup of pore fluid pressure along the megthrust, the <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> is caused immediately after the earthquake when the vertical stress is switched from σ 3 to σ 1. Although we cannot determine which model is most likely for the present case, it is worthwhile mentioning that such a <b>stress</b> <b>reversal</b> has been found {{for the first time at}} depths reaching up to 2, 000 mbsf in the presently forming accretionary prism, and the exact cause for this might be deciphered if the oriented core samples with a known kinematic framework are analyzed in the future.|$|R

For both samples, the c-axes of calcite grains are preferentially oriented {{perpendicular to the}} vein wall, which is indicative of competitive growth of calcite during the vein opening caused by vein normal extension.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a new framework for modeling design earthquake loads for inelastic structures. Limited information on strong ground motions {{is assumed to}} be only available at the given site. The design earthquake acceleration is expressed as a Fourier series, with unknown amplitude and phase angle, modulated by an envelope function. The design earthquake is estimated by solving an inverse dynamic problem, using nonlinear programming techniques, such that the structure performance is minimized. At the same time, the design earthquake is constrained to the available information on past recorded ground motions. New measures of the structure performance that are based on energy concepts and damage indices are introduced in this paper. Specifically, the structural performance is quantified in terms of Park and Ang damage indices. Damage indices imply that the structure is damaged by a combination of repeated <b>stress</b> <b>reversals</b> and high <b>stress</b> excursions. Furthermore, the use of damage indices provides a measure on the structure damage level and thus a decision on necessary repair is possible. The material stress-strain relationship is modeled as either bilinear or elastic-plastic.

The damage spectra for the site are also established, which provide upper bounds of damage under possible future earthquakes...|$|R

The first group of proteins (SMARCAL 1 and ZRANB 3) have the unique ability to re-anneal RPA coated single stranded DNA (ssDNA), which may be necessary to convert standard replication forks to reversed forks. The second group of proteins (e. g. the E 2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC 13 and polyubiquitinated PCNA) was selected as previous studies suggested the error-free branch of PRR to operate via template switching mechanisms, possibly entailing replication fork reversal. We could indeed determine that ZRANB 3 is required for efficient fork slowing and <b>reversal</b> upon genotoxic <b>stress</b> and we are currently uncovering which domains are crucial for this function. We also uncovered the contribution of UBC 13 and PCNA ubiquitination to active fork slowing and replication fork <b>reversal</b> upon genotoxic <b>stress...</b>|$|R
