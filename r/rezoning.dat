5|$|An {{extension}} of the Flushing Line was then proposed {{as part of the}} New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic Committee would vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid. However, in a report entitled No. 7 Subway Extensionâ€“ Hudson Yards <b>Rezoning</b> and Development Program, the government of New York City, devised a <b>rezoning</b> plan for the Hudson Yards area and proposed two new subway stations to serve that area. The subway extension was approved following the successful <b>rezoning</b> of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets, which became the Hudson Yards neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was {{opposition to the}} construction of Trump Tower and other buildings in the area. The New York Committee for a Balanced Building Boom was concerned about the planned <b>rezoning</b> of the area that would arise due {{to the construction of}} high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, several {{portions}} of Downtown Brooklyn were rezoned to promote more commercial, residential, and retail development. This <b>rezoning</b> allowed for greater density of development, and {{combined with an}} increased demand for housing, these areas experienced a boom {{in the construction of}} tall buildings. In addition to Downtown Brooklyn, high-rise buildings are also concentrated in the Fort Greene and Williamsburg neighborhoods, although other Brooklyn neighborhoods have significant numbers of high-rises.|$|E
50|$|Areas {{were given}} to the new districts by quadrants. Students north of Michigan Avenue and west of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Wayne-Westland Community School District. Students north of Michigan Avenue and east of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Robichaud High School in the Westwood Community School District. Students south of Michigan Avenue and west of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Romulus High School in the Romulus Community School District. Students south of Michigan and east of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to the Taylor School District.|$|R

5|$|In 2007, the {{government}} unveiled {{a proposal to}} redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the <b>rezoning</b> of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme. One of the criticisms was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business, and neglected the arts and community events. The proposal was scrapped in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, the WA Planning Commission {{presented}} Metropolitan Region Scheme Amendment 1089/33 to the Western Australian parliament, {{which was}} approved and took effect from 2 April 2006. The amendment rezoned an {{area known as}} East Landsdale Precinct 64, west of Alexander Drive, from rural to urban. In August 2006, Wanneroo City Council, the local government area responsible for Landsdale, submitted corresponding changes to the District Plan for approval. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will eventually have to relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the <b>rezoning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Klein ISD creates {{attendance}} zones for neighborhoods {{within the}} boundaries of the district. All neighborhoods are zoned to a specific elementary school, intermediate school, and high school. When a new school opens, or a school becomes overcrowded, the district begins realigning and <b>rezoning</b> certain neighborhoods to ensure that there is balance among all schools. Students must attend the assigned schools for their neighborhood, with the exception of students who attend the International Business Academy at Klein Forest High School or the International Baccalaureate program at Klein Oak High School.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Smithville was <b>rezoned</b> from Kempner to Austin, with grades 9-10 {{immediately}} zoned to Austin, {{and grades}} 11-12 zoned to Kempner, with a phasing in by grade. Smithville had since been <b>rezoned</b> back to Kempner.|$|R
5000|$|In fall 2007, {{some areas}} zoned to Germantown for 9th and 10th graders in south Shelby County were <b>rezoned</b> to Southwind High School. In turn, some areas zoned to Houston High School were <b>rezoned</b> to Germantown.|$|R
50|$|Previously most of Inkster {{was within}} the Inkster Public Schools district. As of summer 2013, the Inkster Public Schools District was entirely dissolved. The {{remaining}} students were split up among the Taylor, Romulus, Wayne-Westland and Westwood districts. Inkster High School, the high school of the Inkster district, closed in 2013. Areas {{were given to the}} new districts by quadrants. Students north of Michigan Avenue and west of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Wayne-Westland. Students north of Michigan Avenue and east of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Westwood. Students south of Michigan Avenue and west of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Romulus. Students south of Michigan and east of Middlebelt were <b>rezoned</b> to Taylor.|$|R
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a <b>rezoning</b> allowing a controversial pub.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 a <b>rezoning</b> {{modified}} much of {{the zoning}} in East Village. The area affected by the <b>rezoning</b> roughly bounded by East 13th Street on the north, Third Avenue on the west, Delancey Street on the south, and Avenue D on the east. It {{was the first time}} that a <b>rezoning</b> had occurred in the area since 1961.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rezoning</b> of the {{neighbouring}} area, known as East Landsdale Precinct 64, from rural to urban {{took place on}} 2 April 2006. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will eventually have to relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the <b>rezoning.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior to North Rocks being <b>rezoned</b> around 1958, it housed around 40 farms, {{including}} {{peach and}} nectarine orchards, poultry farms and piggeries. When {{the area was}} <b>rezoned,</b> one of many new housing estates was named Lynwood Estate.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, the City of Norwood <b>rezoned</b> {{the city}} council from four to six wards, {{reflecting}} {{the increase in the}} city's population. The six wards would later be <b>rezoned</b> back to four after the population declined in the 2000s.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rezon</b> {{is unusual}} in that it has an {{exceptionally}} poor soundtrack, yet no other aspect of development was sacrificed. Blandia is a similar game, also by this developer; unlike that game, <b>Rezon</b> was never ported to any platform, so it never received a soundtrack upgrade like Blandia did.|$|R
25|$|Cooley {{closed in}} 1980. Shortly {{afterwards}} HISD began housing {{offices in the}} Cooley building. In 1997 {{a small portion of}} the Houston Heights was <b>rezoned</b> to Waltrip.

25|$|On May 11, 2005, the New York City Council {{passed a}} {{large-scale}} <b>rezoning</b> of the North Side and Greenpoint waterfront. Much of the waterfront district was rezoned to accommodate mixed-use high density residential buildings with a set-aside (but no earmarked funding) for public waterfront park space, with strict building guidelines calling for developers {{to create a}} continuous two-mile-long string of waterfront esplanades. Local elected officials touted the <b>rezoning</b> as an economically beneficial way to address the decline of manufacturing along the North Brooklyn waterfront, which had resulted {{in a number of}} vacant and derelict warehouses in Williamsburg.|$|E
25|$|Far West Village <b>Rezoning,</b> {{approved}} in 2005, {{was the first}} downzoning in Manhattan in many years, putting in place new height caps, thus ending construction of high-rise waterfront towers {{in much of the}} Village and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings.|$|E
