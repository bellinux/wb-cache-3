25|$|Much Christian art {{borrowed}} from Imperial imagery, including Christ in Majesty, {{and the use}} of the halo as a symbol of sanctity. Late Antique Christian art replaced classical Hellenistic naturalism with a more abstract aesthetic. The primary purpose of this new style was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. <b>Realistic</b> <b>perspective,</b> proportions, light and colour were ignored in favor of geometric simplification, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. Icons of Christ, Mary and the saints, ivory carving, and illuminated manuscripts became important media – even more important in terms of modern understanding, as nearly all of the few surviving works, other than buildings, from the period consist of these portable objects.|$|E

The use of software measurement is regarded as an essential component for a quality development program, in terms of prediction, control, and adaptation as well as the communication necessary for stakeholders’ <b>realistic</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Some recipes for failure are briefly considered so as to enable some degree of contrast between what is currently perceived to be good and bad practices. This is followed by an evaluation of the quality-at-all-costs model, including a brief pragmatic investigation of quality in other, more mature, disciplines. Several programs that claim to assist in the pursuit of quality are examined, with some suggestions made as to how they may best be used in practice...|$|R

500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a <b>realistic</b> <b>perspective.</b> [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Kahlo {{began her}} career as an artist in the 1920s, the Mexican art scene was {{dominated}} by muralists. They created large public pieces in the vein of Renaissance masters and Russian socialist realists: they usually depicted masses of people and their political messages were easy to decipher. Although she was close to muralists such as Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siquieros, and shared their commitment to socialism and Mexican nationalism, the majority of Kahlo's paintings were self-portraits of relatively small size. Particularly in the 1930s, her style was especially indebted to votive paintings or retablos, which were postcard-sized religious images made by amateur artists. Their purpose was to thank saints for their protection during a calamity, and they normally depicted an event, such as an illness or an accident, from which its commissioner had been saved. The focus was on the figures depicted, and they seldom featured a <b>realistic</b> <b>perspective</b> or detailed background, thus distilling the event to its essentials. Kahlo had an extensive collection of approximately 2,000 retablos, which she displayed {{on the walls of}} La Casa Azul. According to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, the retablo format enabled Kahlo to [...] "develop the limits of the purely iconic and allowed her to use narrative and allegory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still-life {{paintings}} often {{adorn the}} interior of ancient Egyptian tombs. It was believed that food objects and other items depicted there would, in the afterlife, become real and available {{for use by the}} deceased. Ancient Greek vase paintings also demonstrate great skill in depicting everyday objects and animals. Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a panel painter of [...] "low" [...] subjects, such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii: [...] "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects". Similar still life, more simply decorative in intent, but with <b>realistic</b> <b>perspective,</b> have also been found in the Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics unearthed at Pompeii, Herculaneum and the Villa Boscoreale, including the later familiar motif of a glass bowl of fruit. Decorative mosaics termed [...] "emblema", found in the homes of rich Romans, demonstrated the range of food enjoyed by the upper classes, and also functioned as signs of hospitality and as celebrations of the seasons and of life. By the 16th century, food and flowers would again appear as symbols of the seasons and of the five senses. Also starting in Roman times is the tradition of the use of the skull in paintings as a symbol of mortality and earthly remains, often with the accompanying phrase Omnia mors aequat (Death makes all equal). These vanitas images have been re-interpreted through the last 400 years of art history, starting with Dutch painters around 1600.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in the present paper aims at evaluating the opportunity of the eddy current method to characterise the decarburising extent which can occur during usual heat treatments of steel like austenising. The present work is based on previous studies highlighting the ability of eddy current to detect superficial defects such as cracks, pores or the possibility to corroborate its signal intensity with the mechanical microhardness modifications generated by carburising of steel. That is why eddy current is used here to systematically compare non-affected sample with the decarburised ones {{at different levels of}} decarburising. Among the techniques available to characterise the extent of decarburising, i. e. optical observations and microhardness profile, the eddy current technique provides a non-destructive method which is often required from an industrial control point of view. The results obtained show a strong correlation between the eddy current signal and the decarburised depth of the samples. As a consequence, they open <b>realistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> to characterise decarburising industrially...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{thrust of}} this paper is to examine the debates and expositions on the scope of {{security}} studies in the Post-Cold War era.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} entrepreneurship education at universities on the intentions of students to become entrepreneurs or self-employed in the short-term (immediately after graduation) and in the long-term (five years after graduation). A difference-in-differences approach is applied that relates changes in entrepreneurial intentions {{to changes in the}} attendance of entrepreneurship classes in the same period. To account for a potential bias due to self-selection into entrepreneurship classes, only individuals having no prior entrepreneurial intentions are analyzed. Our results indicate a stimulating effect of entrepreneurship education on students' intentions to become entrepreneurs or self-employed in the long-term but a discouraging effect on their intentions in the short-term. These results support the conjecture that entrepreneurship education provides more <b>realistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> on {{what it takes to be}} an entrepreneur, resulting in sorting. Overall, the results indicate that entrepreneurship education may improve the quality of labor market matches, the allocation of resources and talent, and increase social welfare.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{academic}} institutions have {{become aware of the}} importance of innovation in education, as well as its broader role in strengthening the economy. Creativity and innovative thinking are not easily taught in the classroom, but they can be developed through practice and experience. Evaluating innovation as part of product design courses has thus become very important to increase the probability of students becoming innovators in the real world. Innovation tournaments provide universities with an opportunity to develop innovative design thinking in students while they gain practical experience. Understanding design innovation at a deeper level in the context of student design projects is critical to develop <b>realistic</b> <b>perspectives</b> among students. Determining the appropriate dimensions for understanding and measuring innovation is the main objective of this paper. Toward that objective, we conducted initial experiments in conjunction with an innovation award to develop and assess innovation metrics. The results reveal several dimensions of innovation: differentiability, creativity, need satisfaction, and probability of commercial success emerged as key dimensions.

Apart from biomass, no other renewable energy sources, besides hydroelectricity, play a relevant role in the energy mix. The potential for wind and wave energy is very large. Brazil's Santa Catarina state government is starting a clean energy program in the state, which is expected to bring more than 1 GW of capacity. Assessment of wave energy resources is needed along the coastline. This work studied the potential wave energy along the north-central coasts of Santa Catarina, in Southern Brazil, by analysis of the hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The annual offshore wave power was found to be equal to 15. 25 kW/m, the bulk of which is provided by southeastern waves.

30|$|In real outdoor scenes, objects {{distant from}} the {{observer}} suffer from a natural effect called aerial perspective that fades {{the colors of the}} objects and blends them to the environmental light color. The aerial perspective can be modeled using a physics-based approach; however, handling with the changing and unpredictable environmental illumination as well as the weather conditions of real scenes is challenging in terms of visual coherence and computational cost. In those cases, even state-of-the-art models fail to generate <b>realistic</b> synthesized aerial <b>perspective</b> effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-time, turbidity-based, full-spectrum aerial perspective rendering approach. First, we estimate the atmospheric turbidity by matching luminance distributions of a captured sky image to sky models. The obtained turbidity is then employed for aerial perspective rendering using an improved scattering model. We performed a set of experiments to evaluate the scattering model and the aerial perspective model. We also provide a framework for real-time aerial perspective rendering. The results confirm that the proposed approach synthesizes <b>realistic</b> aerial <b>perspective</b> effects with low computational cost, outperforming state-of-the-art aerial perspective rendering methods for real scenes.|$|R
