50|$|After being caught, small shrimp are unloaded, <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> <b>drained</b> {{before being}} dried. Drying {{can be done}} on plastic mats {{on the ground in}} the sun, on metal beds on low stilts, or using other methods. After several days, the shrimp-salt mixture will darken and turn into a thick pulp. If the shrimp used to produce the paste were small, it is ready to be served as soon as the {{individual}} shrimp have broken-down beyond recognition. If the shrimp are larger, fermentation will take longer and the pulp will be ground to provide a smoother consistency. The fermentation/grinding process is usually repeated several times until the paste fully matures. The paste is then dried and cut into bricks by the villagers to be sold. Dried shrimp paste does not require refrigeration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sauerkraut}} {{is often}} <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> <b>drained</b> before being chopped and mixed with shredded fresh cabbage. The proportion {{depends on the}} sauerkraut's maturity - the longer it has cured, the more sour it tastes, calling for more fresh cabbage to balance the flavor. Traditionally, cabbage was pickled in fall, so [...] made at that time could be made with only half-cured sauerkraut, but by early spring, the sauerkraut had to be combined in equal parts with fresh cabbage. The mixture is precooked in {{a small amount of}} water before being mixed with the braised meat and left to simmer for several hours. Ideally, the stew should thicken through evaporation alone, but flour, roux, crumbled rye bread or a grated raw potato may be added to it to take up excess moisture.|$|E
40|$|Serial dilutions of Clostridium difficile culture filtrates were {{incubated}} overnight with HeLa cell monolayers. Cells {{were fixed}} in formalin, stained with crystal violet, <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drained.</b> Cell rounding could be observed microscopically in the stained monolayers. Absorbance of the retained dye on monolayers in the drained wells was measured at 595 nm- 405 nm. End points {{could also be}} estimated visually. The dilution at which dye absorbance was reduced by 50 % agreed with that determined by microscopic observations. Five replicate dilution series showed high reproducibility. Specificity was verified by neutralisation with crude rabbit antibody to C difficile toxins. Cytotoxicity in faecal specimens was assayed in the same way, allowing reporting of titres, comparison with standard toxin preparations, and determination {{of the extent of}} neutralisation to be made. This novel assay technique has proved effective and reliable in a clinical setting and should allow the gathering of more information on the epidemiology of antibiotic associated colitis...|$|E
2500|$|The raw fruit {{can have}} a {{somewhat}} bitter taste, or even an astringent quality, but becomes tender when cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. The fruit is capable of absorbing large amounts of cooking fats and sauces, making for very rich dishes, but salting reduces the amount of oil absorbed. Many recipes advise salting, <b>rinsing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>draining</b> the sliced fruit (a process known as [...] "degorging") to soften it and {{to reduce the amount}} of fat absorbed during cooking, but mainly to remove the bitterness of the earlier cultivars. Some modern cultivars—including large purple ones commonly imported into western Europe—do not need this treatment.|$|R
5|$|In the {{preparation}} of bean dip, various types of beans can be used, including black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, lima beans and edamame, a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod. Some bean dips incorporate several bean varieties into the dish, such as three-bean dip. Raw beans that are soaked and cooked are used, as are prepared canned beans and refried beans. The use of canned beans {{can result in a}} creamier dip, because beans prepared in canneries are pressure cooked in the can. Canned beans may have a salty flavor, which can be reduced by <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> then <b>draining</b> them. Fresh cooked beans may contribute to a more flavorful dish compared to using canned beans. Prepared canned green chili peppers are also sometimes used as a main ingredient.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} widely used for sterilization of bone allografts. However, gamma irradiation alters proteins. This is favorable when it reduces immunogenicity, but is undesirable when osteoinductive proteins are damaged. Although the effect of gamma irradiation on BMPs has been studied, the effect of irradiation {{on the process of}} incorporation of morselized bone chips remains unclear. We studied the effects of sterilization by gamma irradiation on the incorporation of impacted morselized allografts. METHODS: Bone chambers with impacted allografts, rinsed impacted allografts, allografts that were <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> subsequently irradiated, and an empty control were implanted in proximal medial tibiae of goats. Incorporation was evaluated using histology and histomorphometry. RESULTS: Histology revealed evidence of bone graft incorporation, which proceeded in a similar way in unprocessed, <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> both <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> irradiated bone grafts. After 12 weeks, no difference in bone and tissue ingrowth was found between the unprocessed, the <b>rinsed,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rinsed</b> <b>and</b> subsequently irradiated allografts. The amount of unresorbed graft remnant was highest in the unprocessed bone grafts. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that sterilization with gamma irradiation does not influence the incorporation of impacted rinsed bone allografts...|$|R

In a {{previous}} study, we {{have suggested that}} the salivary ATP swab test provides a simple and valid method to establish oral hygiene. (The assessment of oral hygiene with the ATP detection test : A comparative study of tooth brushing and garglerelated variation using the salivary ATP swab test) The purpose of the current study is to assess oral hygiene before and after tooth-brushing followed by either <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling three times with 150 mL tap water or twice with 150 mL saline. Saliva ATP values were 4. 12 and 2. 98 times higher than the baseline after first <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water and saline, respectively. In addition, after second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling either with tap water or saline, the ATP values were close to those of the saliva before tooth-brushing. Moreover, after third <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with tap water, the ATP value was lower prior to tooth-brushing. Significant difference was found in comparing the mean ATP values in saliva. First <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling with saline increased ATP values, whereas, the second <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> gargling decreased ATP values to below the pre-rinsing baseline, although the difference was not statistically significant.

40|$|Introduction: Bacterial {{elimination}} {{from the}} root canal {{is the ultimate}} goal of endodontic treatment. Many supplementary systems and substances have been introduced to improve root canal disinfection. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of sonic and ultrasonic-activated irrigation, a chlorhexidine (CHX) final <b>rinse,</b> <b>and</b> a calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] dressing in eliminating bacteria after chemomechanical preparation of root canals using the self-adjusting file (SAF). Methods: Eighty maxillary and mandibular premolars were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis for 4 weeks, instrumented with SAF, and randomly distributed into four test groups (n =  15) according to the supplementary approach used for bacterial elimination: EndoActivator (EA) irrigation, passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), CHX final <b>rinse,</b> <b>and</b> Ca(OH) 2 dressing. Two groups (n = 10) used as a positive and negative controls. Bacteriological samples were obtained from the canals before and after SAF preparation and after the supplementary approaches. The number of bacteria in each sample was determined by plate count. Results: The bacterial population significantly decreased after SAF preparation (P <  0. 001). EA irrigation and PUI were significantly more effective than the CHX <b>rinse</b> <b>and</b> Ca(OH) 2 dressing in decreasing bacterial colony-forming units (P <  0. 05).

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of multiple decontamination procedures for salivary contamination after curing of a universal adhesive on dentin bond strength according to its etch modes. Materials and Methods Forty-two extracted bovine incisors were trimmed by exposing the labial dentin surfaces and embedded in cylindrical molds. A universal adhesive (All-Bond Universal, Bisco) was used. The teeth were randomly divided into groups according to etch mode and decontamination procedure. The adhesive was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions for a given etch mode. With the exception of the control groups, the cured adhesive was contaminated with saliva for 20 sec. In the self-etch group, the teeth were divided into three groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive. In the etch-and-rinse group, the teeth were divided into four groups: control, decontamination with <b>rinsing</b> <b>and</b> drying, decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, <b>and</b> adhesive, <b>and</b> decontamination with <b>rinsing,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive. A composite resin (Filtek Z 350 XT, 3 M ESPE) was used for filling and was cured on the treated surfaces. Shear bond strength was measured, and failure modes were evaluated. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variation and Tukey's HSD test. Results The etch-and-rinse subgroup that was decontaminated by <b>rinse,</b> drying, re-etching, <b>and</b> reapplication of adhesive showed a significantly higher bond strength.
