It brings together broadcasters, manufacturers, standards bodies and trade associations. This is a critical activity for the industry as the dynamics of the industry are rapidly changing with new players vying for a share of the revenue pie and changing viewer consumption habits. Not only do media companies need to be more flexible to respond quickly to new opportunities to monetize content, but they are also seeking to take advantage of economies of scale by leveraging the massive R&D investments being made in IT. The JT-NM counts more than 290 participants from 165 organizations. Results of Phase 1 The Task Force has developed a number of fundamental principles that guide our work. Among these are the facts that, this effort must be user-driven, and that it must leverage IT technologies. To this end, the Task Force solicited 167 use cases from industry peers, and from these, it produced a superset of 16 generalized user stories. It issued a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technology,</b> seeking technologies that could be potentially employed to address user requirements.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines U. S. technology security policy in a transitional period {{marked by a}} rapidly changing security environment and an era of economic globalization. It provides an historical analysis of this policy since {{the onset of the}} Cold War and a financial analysis of the $ 40 million budget <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>technology</b> security, counter-proliferation, and export controls in the Clinton Administration's FY 1994 defense budget presentation. The historical analysis is based largely on the evolution and roles of two multilateral control regimes [...] CoCom and the MTCR. The crux of this analysis is a detailed examination of the fate of the $ 40 million request as it moved through the congressional budget process. This analysis identifies problems and policy issues surrounding resource allocation <b>for</b> <b>technology</b> security. Based on the treatment of the budget request by the defense committees of Congress, a number of conclusions were drawn. Although technology security is considered a high priority item by both the executive and legislative branches of government, Congress appropriated funding for only 20 percent of the Administration's request. Significant decreases are attributed to inter-agency turf struggles, the slowness with which DoD policy-making positions were filled, and an initial spending plan that was perhaps overly ambitious and prematurely presented. Ultimately, two reviewing bodies were born out of legislative compromise; however, potentially redundant reporting likelihood of a decisive review of current proliferation policy.

The ultimate objective of these efforts is positive economic impact, an improved quality of life, and a more competitive U. S. posture in international markets. The Technology Utilization Office (TUO) currently serves seven states with its technology transfer efforts.

The lack of thorough, reliable and easily understood technology information is a major obstacle in effective assessment of technology development progress, trade studies, metric calculations, and <b>technology</b> selection <b>for</b> integrated testing. OTIS will provide a formalized, well-organized protocol to communicate thorough, accurate, current and relevant technology information between the hands-on technology developer and the ALS Community. The need {{for this type of}} information transfer system within the Solid Waste Management (SWM) element was recently identified and addressed. A SWM Technology Information Form (TIF) was developed specifically <b>for</b> collecting detailed <b>technology</b> information in the area of SWM. In the TIF, information is requested from SWM technology developers, based upon the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Basic information is <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> low-TRL <b>technologies,</b> and more detailed information is requested as the TRL of the technology increases. A comparable form is also being developed for the wastewater processing element. In the future, similar forms will also be developed for the ALS elements of air revitalization, food processing, biomass production and thermal control. These ALS element-specific forms will be implemented in OTIS via a web-accessible interface,with the data stored in an object-oriented relational database (created in MySQLTM) located on a secure server at NASA Ames Research Center. With OTIS, ALS element leads and managers will be able to carry out informed research and development investment, thereby promoting technology through the TRL scale. OTIS will also allow analysts to make accurate evaluations of technology options.
