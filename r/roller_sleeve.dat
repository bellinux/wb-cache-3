5000|$|It has {{two pairs}} of {{grinding}} rollers, each pair of roller composed of two narrow rollers, mounted on the same axis and can rotate at different speeds. There are two circular disc slot, and roller to the tire shape, work pressure in the tank. Disc roller and the relative sliding velocity between small and roller can swing, even if the <b>roller</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the disc after the liner wear can guarantee a good abrasive, will not affect the grinding effect. Roller symmetrical structure, one side can be upside down after use and wear.Material grinding process: hydraulic pneumatic roller device through the pressure applied to the material on the crushing of materials, the materials have been moved to crush the edge of disc, from the disc around the nozzle from the exhaust air to improve these materials to Separator.Meal to separate returns after a concentrated mill, fine powder was collected in the precipitator unloading. In the gas flow is small, the meal can not be increased to enhance air flow, they would fall through the nozzle discharged outside the mill, bucket elevator to be transported to the feeder of vertical roller mill, and was re-grinding mill feed people.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{used the}} finite element {{software}} ANSYS {{to simulate the}} thermal assembly process of the <b>roller</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the HFCG 160 roller press, and study the change of the temperature field. And then, comparing the simulation temperature with the test temperature, {{the results show that}} the simulation temperature is basically consistent with the test temperature, while there are slight biases on the individual points within a certain period of time. The main reason for biases between the simulation temperature and the test temperature is that the convective heat transfer coefficient is average during the simulation, which ignoring the convective heat transfer coefficient decreases with the decreasing of temperature. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} three-segment loop-like damage of sleeve under rolling load case, to quantitatively analyze bearing failure mechanism, a {{mathematical}} model of oil-film bearing for producing the 3 -D contact pressure and shear stress distribution between sleeve and roll neck was developed by 3 D elastic contact boundary element method. Some programs for automatically creating 3 -D surface grid model {{have been developed to}} check data and display deformation, as well as to plot the deformation fields of <b>roller</b> and <b>sleeve.</b> Analytical results provide an effective way to decrease wear and adhesive damage of sleeve, and help to increase the load capacity of oil-film bearing and service life as well...|$|R
50|$|Sagendorph was an {{inventor}} {{as well as}} a manufacturer. From 1879 to 1905 he secured more than 100 U.S. and foreign patents for sheet metal manufacturing machinery such as <b>roller</b> dies, the <b>sleeve</b> die, automatic feeding mechanisms for press work, power squaring shears, toggle presses, machines for shearing and punching sheet steel, and the original method of corrugating sheets by means of rolls.|$|R
40|$|Economically {{advantageous}} microfabrication {{technologies for}} lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices substituting commonly used glass etching or injection molding processes {{are one of}} the key enablers for the emerging market of microfluidic devices. On-site detection in fields of life sciences, point of care diagnostics and environmental analysis requires compact, disposable and highly functionalized systems. Roll-to-roll production as a high volume process has become the emerging fabrication technology for integrated, complex high technology products within recent years (e. g. fuel cells). Differently functionalized polymer films enable researchers to create a new generation of lab-on-a-chip devices by combining electronic, microfluidic and optical functions in multilayer architecture. For replication of microfluidic and optical functions via roll-to-roll production process competitive approaches are available. One of them is to imprint fluidic channels and optical structures of micro- or nanometer scale from embossing rollers into ultraviolet (UV) curable lacquers on polymer substrates. Depending on dimension, shape and quantity of those structures there are alternative manufacturing technologies for the embossing roller. Ultra-precise diamond turning, electroforming or casting polymer materials are used either for direct structuring or manufacturing of <b>roller</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Mastering methods are selected for application considering replication quality required and structure complexity. Criteria for the replication quality are surface roughness and contour accuracy. Structure complexity is evaluated by shapes producible (e. g. linear, circular) and aspect ratio. Costs for the mastering process and structure lifetime are major cost factors. The alternative replication approaches are introduced and analyzed corresponding to the criteria presented. Advantages and drawbacks of each technology are discussed and exemplary applications are presented...|$|R
50|$|The roller-locked bolt {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} bolt head, two <b>rollers,</b> a striker <b>sleeve,</b> bolt body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the {{bolt assembly}} into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|R
50|$|The SIG MG 710-3 is an automatic, {{air-cooled}} belt-fed weapon {{operated by}} roller-delayed blowback and fires {{from an open}} bolt. The machine gun's bolt differs from other contemporary designs employing the short recoil method of operation (such as CETME and Heckler & Koch designed weapons), being a 3-piece design that consists of a bolt head with two locking <b>rollers,</b> a striker <b>sleeve</b> and the bolt carrier which is connected telescopically with the bolt head. When a round is chambered pressure from the return spring drives the bolt and carrier assembly forward; simultaneously both rollers engage camming surfaces which drive the rollers outward from their compressed travel position into recesses in the barrel extension. Upon firing, the bolt carrier and striker assembly recoil to the rear and the geometry of the fixed camming surfaces drives the rollers inward unlocking the bolt breech and increasing {{the speed at which}} the striker sleeve withdraws relative to the bolt. As the slower bolt continues rearward it impacts the returning striker sleeve (this impact decelerates the bolt).|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of <b>rollers,</b> the striker <b>sleeve,</b> bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker <b>sleeve,</b> force the <b>rollers</b> outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
