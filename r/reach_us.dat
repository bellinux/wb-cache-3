5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> $5 million, easily {{four or five times}} more than most companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of attention}} in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda.|$|E

More than one million people played Halo 4 on Xbox Live within the first 24 hours of release. While Halo 4 debuted {{at the top of}} the UK Video Games Chart and became the eighteenth biggest launch ever in the UK, it failed to beat the week one sales records of Halo 3 and Halo: <b>Reach.</b> <b>U.S.</b> retail {{tracking}} firm NPD reported that Halo 4 was the second most sold retail video game of November 2012, the third most sold retail video game of December 2012, and the third most sold retail video game of the year. In the United States Halo 4 became the best-selling Microsoft Studios title for sales counted during respective launch years. In 2012, Halo 4 was the third most played game on Xbox Live based on average unique users per day.|$|E
5|$|State Route 190 {{begins at}} State Route 99 {{just south of}} {{downtown}} Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing {{the south side of}} Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin turns in order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the South Fork Middle Fork {{and the end of the}} western segment of SR 190. The county-maintained Western Divide Highway continues south to a point west of Johnsondale, where traffic can turn east to <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 395 via Sherman Pass and County Route J41.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} sign route system {{was created in}} 1934, Sign Route 190 was {{assigned}} to the portion of Route 127 west of Death Valley Junction, while the remainder to Baker became part of Sign Route 127. However, the highway was not continuous, with the roadway from Tipton (which had been built by Tulare County) ending at Quaking Aspen (east of Camp Nelson) and that from Death Valley ending southwest of Lone Pine. In 1923, Tulare County businessmen had begun to push for a new trans-Sierra highway connecting Porterville with Lone Pine, but were set back by a lack of state aid, as the road was not a state highway. The first piece, which {{would turn out to be}} the only one built, opened in early July 1931 to Quaking Aspen (and became a state highway in 1933). Grading of the 15-mile (24km) Western Divide Highway, a county road that was supposed to continue south to State Route 155 at Greenhorn Summit, was completed from Quaking Aspen south to near Johnsondale in July 1962. A new road from Johnsondale across Sherman Pass, maintained by the United States Forest Service and Tulare and Inyo Counties (the latter as County Route J41), was completed in 1976, allowing traffic on the western segment of SR 190 to <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 395, though via a longer route than the proposed SR 190.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 paper {{published}} in Nature, {{as part of}} their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1 per gigayear from all events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, whose frequencies we have adequate direct measures of.|$|E

25|$|Together, these {{features}} seemed to promise unprecedented accuracy in day bombing from high altitudes; in peacetime testing the Norden demonstrated a {{circular error probable}} (CEP) of , an astonishing performance for the era. This accuracy allowed direct attacks on ships, factories, and other point targets. Both the Navy and the AAF saw this {{as a means to}} achieve war aims through high-altitude bombing; for instance, destroying an invasion fleet by air long before it could <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> shores. To achieve these aims, the Norden was granted the utmost secrecy well into the war, and was part of a then-unprecedented production effort on the same scale as the Manhattan Project. Carl L.

He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's Law {{is relevant to}} the old conundrum known as Olbers' paradox: if the Universe were infinite, static, and filled with a uniform distribution of stars, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as bright as {{the surface of a}} star. However, the night sky is largely dark. Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the Big Bang theory and in part on the Hubble expansion. In a universe that exists for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had a chance to <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> yet, and the paradox is resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects recede from us, which causes the light emanating from them to be redshifted and diminished in brightness.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} feature of the Big Bang spacetime {{is the presence of}} particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to <b>reach</b> <b>us.</b> This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never [...] "catch up" [...] to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future {{that we will be able}} to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our universe.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Route113 Alternate (US113 Alternate) was an {{alternate}} route of US113 that extended [...] from US113 and DE1 in Little Heaven {{north to the}} intersection of US13 and US113 in Dover. US113Alternate followed the original path of the DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and US13 in Dover. The DuPont Highway was paved through Rising Sun by 1920, and {{the entire length of}} the Selbyville–Wilmington highway was complete by 1923. When the U.S. Highway System was finalized in 1926, US 113's northern terminus was at Coopers Corner south of Dover, and US 13 followed State Street through the state capital. US 113 was extended north along State Street to the junction of State Street and Governors Avenue on the south side of Silver Lake after US 13 was placed on a reconstructed Governors Avenue in 1930. After US 113's bypass of Dover was completed in 1935, US 113 Alternate was established along US 113's former course from Little Heaven to Dover and along State Street and joined US 13 to cross Silver Lake to <b>reach</b> <b>US</b> 113's northern terminus at the intersection of DuPont Highway and State Street.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{because the}} {{expansion}} of the universe is accelerating, it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never be able to <b>reach</b> <b>us</b> at any time in the infinite future, because the light never reaches a point where its [...] "peculiar velocity" [...] towards us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance).
