5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household nutrient availability, with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> most extensive study on nutrient availability was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition did not change significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all beneficiaries, however most improvements were noted for very low-income beneficiaries versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E
5|$|Although Sondheim was {{cautious}} of a cinematic {{adaptation of}} his musical, he was largely {{impressed by the}} <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> film received largely positive reviews, with Depp's performance receiving critical praise — the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 221 reviews, and Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 39 reviews. Sweeney Todd appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.|$|E

5|$|General E. P. Scammon led the December expedition, {{which was}} a {{diversion}} with mixed <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the diversion was to draw Confederate forces away from a Union force led by General Averell, which was conducting a raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad near Salem, Virginia. Although Scammon captured Lewisburg, he soon retreated—making the situation for Averell more difficult. Beginning December 1863, the regiment {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed {{command in}} January 1945 and {{initially}} {{continued to use}} the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities but much of the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E

5|$|Prognosis of {{spontaneous}} cervical arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> overall functional prognosis {{of individuals with}} stroke due to cervical artery dissection {{does not appear to}} vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used. In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8–2.1%.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain. Seeds do not require any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 37 to 40 days to germinate. Propagation by cutting has not been attempted, but might be possible, since the closely related B.cuneata has been propagated this way, albeit with unpredictable <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at a sheltered site. It is recommended to prune it when young, to encourage branching.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} {{football}} program with several students forming a loose-knit troop of footballers called the Blacksmiths. On November 5, 1892, Tech played its first football game against Mercer University. The team lost to Mercer 12–6 in Macon, Georgia. Tech played two other games {{during their first}} season and lost both of them for a season record of 0–3. Discouraged by these <b>results,</b> <b>the</b> Blacksmiths sought a coach to improve their record. Leonard Wood, an Army officer and Atlantan, heard of Tech's football struggles and volunteered to player-coach the team.|$|E

5|$|The census {{question}} on religion has been criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to find very different <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> 2015 British Election Survey found 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's <b>results,</b> <b>the</b> general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E

5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the <b>results.</b> <b>The</b> controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel <b>results,</b> <b>the</b> Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E
