50|$|Transmin {{has created}} 3 brands {{of their own}} {{geological}} machinery. In 1995, they created their first <b>rockbreaker</b> boom system, now branded as Boomer. Transmin also developed their award-winning RockLogic <b>rockbreaker</b> brand, in 2004, and in 2016 developed ConveyorPro, its own brand of Conveyor belts and feeders.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} from the CSIRO implemented remote-operation functionality for a Transmin <b>rockbreaker</b> located at Rio Tinto's West Angelas iron ore mine from Perth, over 1000 km away.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Transmin {{developed}} the first commercially available automation system for pedestal <b>rockbreakers.</b> The system was first installed at Newcrest's Ridgeway Deeps gold mine providing collision avoidance and remote operation functionality.|$|R
5000|$|West Angelas is {{the site}} of Rio Tinto's [...] "Mine of the future" [...] project. The mine {{operates}} automated trucks, automated <b>rockbreakers,</b> automated drills and blasts, which are controlled from a Perth operations centre rather than local operators on site.|$|R
50|$|High {{temperatures}} and humidity {{may result in}} heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, which can be fatal. The presence of heavy equipment in confined spaces also poses a risk to miners. To improve the safety of mine workers, modern mines use automation and remote operation including, for example, such equipment as automated loaders and remotely operated <b>rockbreakers.</b> However, despite modern improvements to safety practices, mining remains a dangerous occupation throughout the world.|$|R

50|$|A {{group of}} timber frame, {{corrugated}} iron clad buildings comprising an almost intact crushing and treatment plant. The battery shed contains four ore bins, a <b>rockbreaker,</b> four 5 head stamp batteries including three with timber blankets draining to three wilfley tables, and six berdan pans. The battery shed also houses a forge, workshop and office. Brick flues {{connect with the}} base of a square brick chimney, the boiler having been removed in favour of electric mains power in 1946.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rockbreaker</b> is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to manipulate large rocks, including reducing large rocks into smaller rocks. They are typically {{used in the}} mining industry to remove oversize rocks that are too large or too hard to be reduced in size by a crusher. Rockbreakers consist of two major components, a hydraulic hammer (used to break rocks) and a boom (the arm). There are two major types of rock breakers, mobile and stationary - typically placed on a pedestal or slew frame.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally <b>rockbreakers</b> are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|R
50|$|Mechanized mining {{refers to}} using heavy {{equipment}} {{to speed up}} the mining process. The first attempt at a mechanized 10 by 10 ft tunnel was around 1975. Referred to as '4250' (level) was collared and connected to the conventional rail drift in 1976. Much of the area was widened, tracks taken out, and a junction was created at 3900 level with three separate tunnels. One tunnel went to a massive repair facility '#7' and garage for servicing underground equipment. In 1979 #1 tunnel, which became the main tunnel, was collared and a new drift created at 4800 level to recover silver {{at the top of the}} mine. Heavy equipment including jumbos, various air or electric scoop trams in 2 to 8 yd configurations, rockbolt jumbos, giraffes, shotcrete machines, hyabs, mancarriers, dozers, graders, and jeeps were used. <b>Rockbreakers,</b> downhole drills, fan drills, long hole drills, and TNT drills were some of the equipment used to drill for blasting tunnel faces. As the mining for ore pillars continued, most shops were moved above ground for safety.|$|R
50|$|The ore {{was crushed}} in a fifteen-stamp mill. The weight of stamps was seven {{hundred and fifty}} pounds, {{dropping}} seven inches 90 times per minute, and crushing through No. 5 round-punched screens. The duty per stamp was one and two-thirds tons per day. No <b>rockbreakers</b> or self-feeders were used, but {{the introduction of the}} same was contemplated. Steel shoes and iron dies were used. The sulphurets were saved on six Frue concentrators. The chlorination plant owned by the mine was formerly the property of the Merrifield Company. It contained one roasting furnace 75 x 10 ft inside measurement. It had a capacity of four tons per day; when sufficient sulphurets had accumulated, a run is made. The sulphurets of the Mountaineer Mine was usually treated in these works. The cost of treatment was $8 per ton. The mine was provided with water power throughout; three Pelton wheels were used: a 5 ft for plunger, and an 8 ft for hoisting. Power for the mill was obtained from a 5 ft wheel. Altogether a total of 75 inches of power water was used under a head of 120 ft feet.|$|R
50|$|The galeb duhr {{appears in}} the Monster Manual for this edition (2008), {{including}} the galeb duhr earthbreaker and the galeb duhr rockcaller. According to the fourth edition Manual of the Planes, galeb duhr {{can be found in}} Celestia, one of the astral dominions, and according to The Plane Below: Secrets of the Elemental Chaos (2009), galeb duhr can be found living in the Elemental Chaos on the earthmotes of Irdoc Morda and Allrock. Dungeon #198 (January 2012) presents two new variations of galeb duhr, the galeb durh <b>rockbreaker</b> and the galeb duhr rockspawn.|$|E
50|$|The ore is then {{dumped into}} a truck to be hauled {{to the surface}} (in {{shallower}} mines). In deeper mines the ore is dumped down an ore pass (a vertical or near vertical excavation) where it falls to a collection level. On the collection level, it may receive primary crushing via jaw or cone crusher, or via a <b>rockbreaker.</b> The ore is then moved by conveyor belts, trucks or occasionally trains to the shaft to be hoisted to the surface in buckets or skips and emptied into bins beneath the surface headframe for transport to the mill.|$|E
50|$|From 1904, 2,500 tons of wolfram {{valued at}} £250,000 were {{produced}} at Wolfram Camp, {{half of which}} went through John Moffat's Irvinebank Company mill. John Moffat, a large speculator and enterprising investor in north Queensland mining, was diversifying his interests through steady exports of rare metals. The Irvinebank Mining Company spent upwards of £1,000 on development work on the main mines the Weate, Tully, Weate United and Comerford in 1905. The Irvinebank Company set up the battery in 1906 on Bulluburrah Creek in the lower valley using the technology for separating molybdenite which was developed by local miners. W.A. Pepper was the battery manager. The battery comprised: a <b>rockbreaker,</b> Cornish rolls, a Krupp table, and a Frue vanner to remove the quartz. This battery was a stabilising influence on Wolfram Camp - treating ore from the Mulligan, United, Downfall, Nichol's, Forget-me-Not, Bonner, Tully, Weate, Larkin United, Murphy's and Leinster's claims. The mill was closed for long periods throughout 1909 because of strikes over the 44-hour week. It operated again from 1910 to 1912 and was closed in the rationalisation of the Irvinebank Mining Company's assets that year.|$|E
50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 <b>rockbreakers,</b> either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905 new stamper {{foundations}} and storage bins were constructed, a further 10 head stamps were added {{and the old}} 20 head were replaced. New rolls were put in between <b>rockbreaker</b> and battery, and a travelling [...] "grizzly" [...] to take the crushed ore with the roughs taken out on a moving elevator. A Krupp ball mill reground the coarser parts of the battery pulp. All the pumps were replaced by new return pumps throughout the mill. The bases of the vanners were built in and the brickwork of the Merton furnace was repaired and relined. A slime buddle was also put in to deal more efficiently with the overflow slimes. The gravitation water supply was brought by wooden fluming about 2 km up the river, except at times of reduced flow, when a system of pumping from, and returning to a dam in the river was resorted to. Motive power for the battery was supplied by a 350 hp Robey compound engine and for the dressing plant by a 30 hp high- pressure engine, steam being generated in Babcock and Wilcox boilers.In 1905 the small township of Rocky Bluffs had [...] "some 200 inhabitants and ... a good hotel, store and provisional school". The battery supplied electricity {{to the school and}} some of the principal buildings in the township. The township was also reticulated from the gravitational water supply.|$|E
40|$|The {{repetitive}} impacting {{of solid}} components in industry {{can result in}} wear damage which may significantly limit service life. Impact wear problems have been encountered in hydro-powered stoping equipment (eg rockdrills and impact rockbreakers) developed for deep level gold mining in South Africa. This research project was {{a study of the}} repetitive impact wear of reciprocating valve components (eg poppet valves within the impact <b>rockbreaker)</b> under simulated conditions. A laboratory apparatus, capable of producing impacts varying in energy from 2 - 5 J and varying in frequency from 5 - 50 Hz in an aqueous environment (distilled water), was designed and built for this purpose. Impact tests were conducted in order to: a) rank materials according to impact wear resistance, b) to determine modes and mechanisms of wear, c) to determine material, microstructural, design and operating parameters of importance in minimising wear, d) to make recommendations concerning the above, to facilitate productivity and longlife of poppet valves within impact rockbreakers. The materials selected for testing (817 M 40, 1210 and AISI 304, AISI 431 and AISI 440 C) are steels currently used by the gold mining industry in different applications and known to perform satisfactorily in service. These materials are not all ideally suited to application in valves. They were chosen in order to illustrate how different steel compositions, microstructures and heat treatments influence the rate and mode of wear...|$|E
40|$|When you blast in the mountain, some of {{the rocks}} {{turn out to be}} to large for transport. To deal with this, rockbreakers are placed {{at the top of the}} mine shafts to crush these before transport. The reasons for having a rock breaker is to prevent large {{boulders}} to block the ore shafts, crushes or the filling station. This also gives a opportunity to discover unwanted objects such as rock bolts and other metal objects. Today it takes quite a lot of time to steer the <b>rockbreaker</b> arm into the right position. The operator also has to check every bucket emptied by the loader, on the grizzly. If the grizzly is empty, the operator gives a clear signal. There is not a range camera on the market today that can meet the requirement that are needed for scanning such a large area in such environment. The project consists of constructing a range camera, made of a CCD camera and a light projector, in order to get a 3 D image over the rock. The report is describing the range camera and the possible setups and alterations for it. The image quality will vary a lot, so a discussion on how to filter the images in the most effective way is presented. Methods of visualization is also included. A complication is that some times the rock is not with the optimal position upwards. So finding the right angle of attack is important. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
