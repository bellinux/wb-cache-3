The market structure and economic policies of the Chola dynasty were more conducive to a large-scale, cross-regional market trade than those enacted by the Chinese Song Dynasty. A Chola record gives their rationale for engagement in foreign trade: [...] "Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and decent dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents and allowing them profits.

30|$|Copepods {{represent}} the main {{component of the}} marine mesozooplankton, contributing about 80 % to the total abundance (Verity and Smetacek 1996). This group also plays important <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>linking</b> primary production to higher trophic levels in pelagic food webs (Cushing 1989). Importantly, small species (as well as early developmental stages of larger species) represent a key component in marine ecosystems due to their high abundance, wide distribution (Turner 2004), high weight-specific ingestion rate (Levinsen et al. 2000), and year-round presence and reproduction (Lischka and Hagen 2005; Madsen et al. 2008). Therefore, empirical studies of specific properties of these small copepods such as variations in productivity may help clarify their contributions to marine ecosystem functioning.|$|R

For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal <b>roles</b> <b>in</b> <b>Link's</b> quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important <b>role</b> <b>in</b> later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this similarity between the spatial and temporal effect could be explained by the natural scene statistics in which spatial and temporal context always share features, since objects are typically smooth and change slowly.

30|$|The {{self-interference}} problem {{arises in}} wireless networks when a node transmits and receives simultaneously {{in the same}} frequency band. The main reason for this problem is the huge imbalance between the transmitted signal power and the received signal power of nodes. Typically, the transmitted signal strength is few order of magnitude larger than the received signal strength. Thus, when a node transmits and receives simultaneously in the same channel, the useful signal at the receiver of the incoming link is overwhelmed by the transmitted signal of the node itself. As a result, the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) values at the incoming link of a node that simultaneously transmits in the same channel is very small. Therefore, the self-interference problem plays a central <b>role</b> <b>in</b> <b>link</b> scheduling and rate/power control in wireless networks.|$|R
