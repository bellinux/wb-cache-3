Lack of fresh air inside the bus compartment could increase the contaminant concentration level and affect the passenger's health. This research presents field measurement on contaminant concentration level of particulate matter and carbon monoxide inside the passenger compartment of a university's shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the passenger compartment. Computational fluid dynamics software was used to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus passenger compartment.

40|$|Good {{ventilation}} {{system in a}} bus passenger compartment is important for providing clean, healthy air and comfortable micro-environment for the passengers. Lack of fresh inside the bus passenger compartment due to poor {{ventilation system}} could increase the contaminants concentration which could affect the passenger’s health. This research reports findings of field measurement on the contaminants concentration of particulate matter (PM 1) and carbon monoxide (CO) inside the passenger compartment of a university’s shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the passenger compartment. Measurements of PM 1 and CO were done continuously in the morning, afternoon and evening. A CFD software was employed to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus passenger compartment. Velocity and temperature boundary conditions were prescribed at the air supply diffusers, {{based on the measured}} data. Meanwhile, the contaminants concentration was prescribed at the door. Flow analysis was carried out using RNG k-? turbulent model for air flow, discrete phase and species transport for contaminants. Four cases of air supply diffuser locations namely mixing ventilations (MV 3 and MV 4), mixing ventilation with displacement ventilation (MV 2 +DV) and mixing ventilation with underfloor air distribution (MV 2 +UFAD) were examined. Two cases of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grille</b> locations namely three <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grilles</b> (3 RG) and four <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grilles</b> (4 RG) were also examined in this research. It was found from the field measurement that the contaminants concentration of PM 1 and CO were high at the front location of the passenger compartment. This is due to insufficient ventilation inside the bus passenger compartment. Result of the CFD simulation shows that the MV 2 +DV, MV 2 +UFAD and 4 RG of air supply diffuser and <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grille</b> locations could reduce the contaminants concentration of CO and PM 1 in the occupied zone inside the bus passenger compartment...|$|R
40|$|A vacant unit, {{once used}} by a Portuguese Deli, was {{converted}} to a bar/music room in Toronto. The unit was divided into two spaces along its north-south axis. The western portion {{was designed as a}} music room that would provide a performance space from a solo artist to a Jazz combo to a small rock band. The eastern part was designed as a regular bar/dining area. The plan also called for a microbrewery unit {{at the back of the}} unit. The bar music can be loud, while the music room can be pianissimo to forte depending on the type of performance. The acoustical design aspects are critical for the music room. In addition, the acoustical separation between the two spaces is equally important. The music room/bar is currently in use. The design results are compared to actual field measurements. The results showed that the music venue performed satisfactorily. The acoustical separation between the music venue and the bar/restaurant was better than expected other than an installation deficiency of the south side sound lock doors. The background sound along the northern portion was NC- 35 or less. However, the southern portion’s background sound exceeded NC- 35 due to the hissing of the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> <b>grille.</b> The acoustical design and the performance results of the music venue-bar/restaurant are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Ventilation {{system in}} a bus is {{employed}} to provide good indoor air quality and thermal comfort for passengers. Poor ventilation system will increase the concentration level of air contaminants which could affect the passenger’s health. The presence mixing ventilation system used in many buses is not efficient in removing the air contaminants from the passenger compartments. This article presents {{a study on the}} effects of using different ventilation setups on the concentration level of gases and particulate matters inside a passenger compartment of a university’s shuttle bus. The goal is to find a suitable layout of the air supply diffusers and <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grilles</b> that would lower the concentration level of contaminants inside the passenger compartment. Field measurements were carried out to quantify the concentration of gases (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde) and particulate matters (PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10). The measurements were done at the front section of the bus compartment, close to the front door. The data were acquired in the morning, afternoon and evening hours during a clear and sunny day. The bus travelled along an in-campus road with no passengers. A simplified three-dimensional model of the bus compartment was developed using computational fluid dynamics software. Flow analyses were carried out to predict distribution of gases and particulate matters concentration. The concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and particulate matters obtained from the field measurements were used as boundary conditions and for validating the computational model. A parametric study was carried out to identify a suitable layout of air supply diffusers and <b>air</b> <b>return</b> <b>grilles</b> that would lower the concentration level of the air contaminants. Two types of ventilation systems were considered namely a displacement ventilation and an underfloor air distribution. Results show that the underfloor air distribution system is more effective in reducing the concentration level of gases and particulate matters inside the passenger compartment compared to the displacement ventilation system...|$|R

40|$|The use and {{interest}} in underfloor ventilation systems has been growing due to the systems’ energy savings and inherent flexibility. Because the air distribution openings are in the floor, there has been concern over excessive sound transfer between adjacent spaces through the floor plenum, {{which could lead to}} unacceptable levels of speech privacy and other acoustical problems. Charles M. Salter Associates was hired to provide acoustical input for room acoustics and sound isolation between spaces in an office building incorporating an underfloor air distribution system. The office spaces had differing acoustical requirements, for which five wall types were specified based on the levels of noise reduction and speech privacy required between spaces. Standard offices had walls that terminated {{at the top of the}} raised floor and the floor plenum was left open, while executive offices and conference rooms had an acoustical septum added in the floor plenum at the location of the common wall. This septum was installed to reduce the transfer of noise in the floor plenum between adjacent spaces. Finally, full-height walls were specified for adjacent spaces requiring the highest level of noise reduction. All partitions were extended to the slab above, with offset <b>return</b> <b>air</b> transfer <b>grilles</b> installed on the corridor or open plan side of the offices, to minimize the potential flanking sound path. After construction was completed, acoustical measurements were conducted to quantify the level of noise reduction and speech privacy between adjacent spaces. The overall level of speech privacy between all the various tested spaces met normal privacy standards. The noise reduction performance of the walls without acoustical septums was generally a few points lower than the noise reduction of the same wall as tested in a laboratory without a raised floor. The noise reduction performance of the walls with the acoustical septum was generally the same as the same wall’s performance in the laboratory. This data seems to indicate that the acoustical septum was effective in reducing noise transfer through the floor plenum, and an acoustical septum may be warranted for spaces requiring high levels of speech privacy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a multi-evaporator load emulation unit (ME-LEU) for air conditioning and refrigeration (AC 2 ̆ 6 R) systems. Through a combination of on-line real-time modeling and hardware actuation, LEUs are able to mimic the dynamics of a variety of cooling loads. A virtual container model simulates the thermal dynamics of the cooled space and determines the appropriate <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature to the evaporator for a given application. The LEU uses an actuated slide to mix warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> with colder supply air to track the desired <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature from the model. Depending on the physical design of the LEU, control of the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature may become difficult due to non-monotonic and nonlinear dynamics. The presented LEU design achieves monotonic and nearly linear dynamics between the actuation mechanism and the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature, allowing for a simple yet robust controller to be designed for the system. The experimental implementation of the ME-LEU on a dual evaporator AC 2 ̆ 6 R system permits independent loading of each evaporator, thereby increasing the emulation capabilities to a larger set of real world systems...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{application}} of heat pipes which greatly enhances dehumidification performance of air-conditioning systems is presented. When an air-to-air heat pipe heat exchanger is placed between the warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> and cold supply air streams {{of an air}} conditioner, heat is efficiently transferred from the <b>return</b> <b>air</b> to the supply air. As the warm <b>return</b> <b>air</b> precools during this process, it moves closer to its dew-point temperature. Therefore, the cooling system works less to remove moisture.

40|$|Introduced in {{this article}} is a 1 : 15 brine model {{experiment}} rig with an actual large space building as the research object, which provides different concentration brine for a simulation of the stratified air conditioning in the steady-state flow field featured with columnar air supply in the bottom, heat source on the ground, the central <b>air</b> <b>return,</b> and <b>air</b> exhaust from roof in a large space. According to the similarity theory, it is concluded that the similarity criterion numbers applied here are Reynolds number (Re) and Archimedes number (Ar) for designation of experiment rig size, choosing device type, and confirming experiment condition. In the designation of key components of experiment rig, the application of automation control makes brine recovery and recycling in the process; designation of electrical control system makes a centralized control of experiment start–stop and the adjustment of the pipeline flow, realizing automation in the whole experiment process. Particle image velocimetry testing technology is used to get velocity vector field of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> mouth area in the model under various working conditions, and also proper orthogonal decomposition method is applied to analyze flow field structure of <b>air</b> <b>return</b> mouth area and reconstruct it. Consequently, we can get a kinetic energy ratio of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> entrainment of lower air-conditioning section and upper non-air-conditioning section in large space. Experiments show that under the conditions of same air supply, indoor environment temperature difference, and height and direction of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> inlet, fastening the speed of <b>return</b> <b>air</b> suction, the entrainment of flow field around it strengthens accordingly.

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The <b>air</b> <b>return</b> value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the <b>returned</b> <b>air.</b> This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio, three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio. The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed <b>air</b> <b>return</b> ratio of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The <b>return</b> <b>air</b> in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the <b>return</b> <b>air.</b> This induces a larger amount of radiationbeing given off in the infrared region.

40|$|The {{supply air}} {{temperature}} set point for a singleduct constant air volume air handling unit (AHU) system is often reset based on either <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature or outside air temperature {{in order to reduce}} simultaneous cooling and heating energy consumption. Both reset strategies make engineering sense as long as the reset schedules are reasonable. Quite often the decision to use one over the other is made with the assumption that they will all achieve some sorts of energy savings. However, the impact of these two strategies on AHU energy consumption could be very different. A comparison of these two commonly used {{supply air temperature}} reset strategies for a single-duct constant air volume system is presented in this paper. It is shown that from either the building energy consumption or building comfort point of view, the reset strategy based on outside air temperature is inherently better than that based on <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature. Significant amount of heating energy savings can be achieved by switching from <b>return</b> <b>air</b> temperature based reset to outside air temperature based reset. The reset strategy can also benefit variable air volume (VAV) AHUs.
