5|$|Athletes from 87 {{countries}} won medals, leaving 115 countries {{without a}} medal, and 54 of them won {{at least one}} gold medal. Both of these categories set new records until surpassed in 2016. Athletes from China won the most gold medals, with 48 gold medals. Athletes from the United States won the most total medals, with 111. Afghanistan, Mauritius, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold) and Panama won their first gold medals. Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić won the first medal for the country as an independent NOC. Serbian athletes have previously won medals as nationals of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.

5|$|Great Britain's medal {{performance}} at the 2008 Summer Olympics was its best in a century; only its {{performance at}} the 1908 Summer Olympics, which Britain hosted in London, resulted in more gold medals being awarded. The total medal count, 47, is also the fourth highest Great Britain has ever achieved, with only the 1908, 2012 and 2016 Games resulting in more medals. Following retests of doping samples in 2016 {{in connection with the}} Russian doping scandal, 4 further medals, all bronze, are expected to be awarded in athletics, retrospectively bringing the total gained to 51. As of October 2017, the award of the bronze medals to the Men's and Women's 4 x 400 metres relay teams has brought the official medal total to 49.

5|$|British {{participants}} {{were involved in}} a number of controversies regarding the <b>reallocation</b> of medals during the Games. Shelly Woods was initially awarded the silver medal in the women's 5000m T54, but a rerun was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) after the Australian, US and Swiss teams protested the result because six competitors {{were involved in a}} crash on the penultimate lap. When the race was rerun Woods won the bronze medal. David Weir believed he had won the gold medal in the men's 800m T54 but a rerun of the race was ordered after it was discovered that the Australian silver medallist, Kurt Fearnley, had begun the race in the wrong lane. Following a letter from Fearnley and the Australian authorities to the IPC, which asked that the result not be overturned in the spirit of sportsmanship, the rerun was cancelled and Weir's medal reinstated. Discus thrower Rebecca Chin was originally awarded the silver medal in the women's F37–38, but her classification was challenged and Chin was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased. The decision was particularly controversial given that Chin had already been assessed earlier in the Games whilst she competed in the women's F37–38 shot put final.|$|E

This is done by decomposing aggregate TFP growth into its sources, TFP growth arising from within individual industries and from the <b>reallocations</b> of capital and labour.

5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for <b>reallocation</b> to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{established}} colonial settlements {{to extend}} their power over the surrounding territory, and to serve as administrative centres. They preferred to locate these towns in areas with dense native populations, or close to easily exploitable mineral wealth. Many Spanish towns were founded close to pre-Columbian centres of population. Trujillo was founded near the native settlement of Guaimura, and Comayagua was founded upon a pre-existing town of the same name. In {{the first half of}} the 16th century, towns were abandoned or moved for a variety of reasons, including native attacks, harsh conditions, and the spread of Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria. In many cases, towns were moved for purely political reasons owing to infighting between Spanish factions, with those currently in power seeking to undermine the work of those who had come before them. The frequent relocation of colonial towns and the <b>reallocation</b> of encomiendas served to prolong political instability, and delay the progress of the conquest.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how both inter- and intra-sectoral <b>reallocations</b> {{of workers}} {{contribute}} to {{fluctuations in the}} aggregate unemployment rate. On {{the basis of the}} Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data for the 1986 - 96 period, we construct a monthly longitudinal data set that enables us to track each individual's experience of unemployment duration as well as labor movement across and within sectors. This data set shows strong evidence that inter-sectoral <b>reallocations</b> of workers {{play a major role in}} explaining fluctuations in the unemployment rate at the business cycle frequency. While the number of intra-sectoral movers is generally greater and more countercyclical than that of inter-sectoral movers, the longer duration of unemployment of the latter enables the impact of inter-sectoral movements to be more pronounced in explaining fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Moreover, the asymmetric effects that increase, rather than decrease, in unemployment are by far better explained by inter-sectoral movers, which suggests that high unemployment is closely associated with inter-sectoral <b>reallocations</b> of workers. fluctuations of unemployment, sectoral shocks, sectoral <b>reallocations,</b> duration of unemployment,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} evaluating the effects of reallocating an indivisible input across production units, taking into account resource constraints by keeping the marginal distribution of the input fixed. When the production technology is nonseparable, such <b>reallocations,</b> although leaving the marginal distribution of the reallocated input unchanged by construction, may nonetheless alter average output. Examples include <b>reallocations</b> of teachers across classrooms composed of students of varying mean ability. We focus {{on the effects of}} reallocating one input, while holding the assignment of another, potentially complementary, input fixed. We introduce a class of such <b>reallocations</b> [...] correlated matching rules [...] that includes the status quo allocation, a random allocation, and both the perfect positive and negative assortative matching allocations as special cases. We also characterize the effects of local (relative to the status quo) <b>reallocations.</b> For estimation we use a two-step approach. In the first step we nonparametrically estimate the production function. In the second step we average the estimated production function over the distribution of inputs induced by the new assignment rule. These methods build upon the partial mean literature, but require extensions involving boundary issues. We derive the large sample properties of our proposed estimators and assess their small sample properties via a limited set of Monte Carlo experiments. ...|$|R

Some fiscal institutions are designed to increase the allocative efficiency of public spending by {{making it easier for}} policy-makers to allocate funds towards the most important priorities. Whether fiscal institutions have an effect on allocations is still unclear. Chile provides an opportunity to investigate both ideas. Using an interactive model, the paper finds that budget allocations were more rigid the less additional money was available, and that institutional reforms designed to increase flexibility managed to break the link between spending and <b>reallocations,</b> as well as having a significant and positive effect on the size of annual <b>reallocations...</b>|$|R
