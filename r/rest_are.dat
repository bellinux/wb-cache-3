40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare the {{performance}} characteristics of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Representational State Transfer (<b>REST),</b> which <b>are</b> methods of supporting interactions among Web services. They differ in both context and usage; SOAP is a protocol while <b>REST</b> <b>is</b> architecture. SOAP is a well-developed protocol used in the Web industry and is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C). <b>REST</b> <b>is</b> the outcome of Dr. Roy Thomas Fielding’s 2000 PhD dissertation, “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-Based Software Architecture. ” <b>REST</b> <b>is</b> gaining in popularity due to its simplicity, scalability, and architectural dependence on the World Wide Web. Major software companies, such as Google and Amazon, among others, have started using REST. The main {{difference between the two}} methods is SOAP is a tightly coupled system, whereas <b>REST</b> <b>is</b> a loosely coupled system; both have advantages and disadvantages. We built SOAP and REST based Web services that performed the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions on a database. We utilized response time and throughput metrics to compare the performance of these Web services. In comparing the two technologies, we found <b>REST</b> <b>was</b> considerably faster, compared to SOAP, because the response times of <b>REST</b> <b>were</b> better than those of SOAP. As an ancillary outcome, we found building Web services using SOAP was easier, due to considerable tool support, whereas developing Web services using <b>REST</b> <b>was</b> time consuming, as it provides no tool support...|$|R

5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the <b>rest</b> <b>are</b> benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
