25|$|When critics {{closed in}} and accused Samuel Ireland of forgery, his son {{published}} a confession – An Authentic Account of the Shaksperian Manuscripts – but many critics {{could not believe}} a young man could have forged them all by himself. One paper published a caricature in which William Henry is awed by the findings {{when the rest of}} the family forges more of them (as opposed to what was <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on). Samuel Ireland's reputation did not recover before his death in 1800.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of what is <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) {{turn out to be}} on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
500|$|John Fogerty said, [...] "Hair {{is such a}} {{watered down}} version of what is <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on that I can’t get behind it at all." [...] Gene Lees, writing for High Fidelity, claimed that John Lennon found it [...] "dull", and he wrote, [...] "I do not know any {{musician}} who thinks it's good." ...|$|E

50|$|The band {{began in}} 2005 with just Lóa and Árni Rúnar Hlöðversson but didn't <b>really</b> get <b>going</b> {{properly}} until Árni Vilhjálmsson and Örvar Þóreyjarson Smárason joined.|$|R

"I {{will tell}} you now, first off, I'm Christian, and my career is {{evidence}} of God in my life, and I think {{that most people are}} already thinking that Gaga and the blasphemy and they're premeditating the approach and I think they'll be very shocked to find out how huge and really groundbreaking the message is and how freeing the message is for all the right reasons. And it's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to shock the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Koufax tried {{one more}} year of {{baseball}} and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. I decided I was <b>really</b> <b>going</b> {{to find out how}} good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E
500|$|On Diorama, Silverchair {{worked with}} a new producer, David Bottrill, who {{replaced}} Nick Launay. Though Launay had produced the band's three previous albums, lead singer Daniel Johns decided that he needed someone [...] "who understood {{where he wanted to}} go". Johns believed Diorama would be [...] "the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to hate", and needed a producer who would understand the band's new direction. He interviewed several candidates, eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co-producer himself.|$|E

500|$|Then in August 2010, Moroccan {{producer}} RedOne {{was interviewed}} by the BBC. In the interview, he revealed {{he had been working}} on Scherzinger's album. [...] "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent. Her new record– people are <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to go crazy about it because it's the real her." [...] Scherzinger's boyfriend Lewis Hamilton selected [...] "Poison" [...] as the album's first single. It debuted on her official YouTube account on October 14, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Randazza {{filed an}} appeal on June 5, 2007, and {{the matter was}} {{scheduled}} for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Acworth told Orlando Weekly he considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO. He {{said he was not}} intending to be the adult industry's representative for First Amendment rights. Acworth stated to Orlando Weekly, [...] "Marc talked me into it. I'm not normally this sort of person. Marc thought he had a pretty good shot at it. I'm <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on his advice.... I have no real agenda with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written by Jules Shear, and included on his 1983 debut solo album, Watch Dog. Shear later recalled in an interview, [...] " [...] {{like a big}} bonus really. Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I just thought, 'No one's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to hear this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E

500|$|In mid-September, the Brazilian singer Latino {{released}} the song [...] "Despedida de solteiro" [...] ("The Bachelor's Party"), {{which is supposed}} to be a cover of [...] "Gangnam Style". Many felt offended by his disrespectful lyrics, and some have called it a plagiarized copy of [...] "Gangnam Style". While Psy's original lyrics talk about the lifestyle of the Gangnam people, Latino's version is about a man that is enjoying his bachelor's party in a club, wanting (and having) sex with many women, so drunk that he says he does not know if he's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to get married the next day. Latino had stated that it was an authorized version.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect anything else, you know. I don't even mind. It just {{would be nice}} because I would finally get some money after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm {{certainly not going to}} the concert. My lawyer is following the case. I'm <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|When the Game Boy was released, Tajiri {{thought the}} system was perfect for his idea, {{especially}} because of the link cable, which he envisioned would allow players to trade Pokémon with each other. This concept of trading information was new to the video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. [...] "I imagined a chunk of information being transferred by connecting two Game Boys with special cables, and I went wow, that's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be something!" [...] said Tajiri. Tajiri was also influenced by Square's Game Boy game The Final Fantasy Legend, noting {{in an interview that}} the game gave him the idea that more than just action games could be developed for the handheld.|$|E

5000|$|... 1889: The Great Southern Railway {{was opened}} with {{subsequent}} economic growth to the regions along the line. The wheat industry did not <b>really</b> get <b>going</b> until construction of railways. A railway line had reached Coolgardie (from Perth) by 1896.|$|R
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was <b>really</b> <b>going</b> away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E
500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record. [...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, is <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If I had to work at McDonald's {{for the rest of my}} life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Kreisberg, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said, [...] "It's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to be an adventure with the Arrow and Flash on both episodes. Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's {{one of the most}} fun parts, ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E
25|$|The 1964 Coloured Persons Representative Council {{turned out}} to be a {{constitutional}} hitch which never <b>really</b> got <b>going.</b> In 1969, the Coloureds elected forty onto the council to supplement the twenty nominated by the government, taking the total number to sixty.|$|R

500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on in the world right now".|$|E
500|$|Rex Britten, {{portrayed by}} Dylan Minnette, is Michael's son who is {{featured}} in Michael's [...] "green reality". Green is Rex's favorite color. He is a teenage school student. Outside of school, Rex claims {{he is going}} to the beach, although he is <b>really</b> <b>going</b> to his best friend Cole's house to work on a motorbike with him. Like Hannah, Rex is also very emotional, and often gets angry, due to Hannah's death in the crash. He kept a tennis racket to remain, and make him deal with Hannah's death. However, Cole accidentally broke it, Rex fights with him because of this. He later apologizes to him. He hates [...] "cereal and soda night" [...] because Michael doesn not cook [...] "actual food" [...] for dinner. Rex has an aunt named Carol, who is mentioned in [...] "Two Birds", in Michael's [...] "green reality". She wants {{to spend more time with}} Rex since the crash.|$|E
