50|$|Shulman's threats {{led to an}} {{investigation}} by the FBI, the New York Police Department Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the United States Department of Justice. Shulman was in the possession of the toxins cyanide, castor beans and <b>rosary</b> <b>peas</b> {{at the time of his}} arrest by the FBI in February 2011. Shulman was held without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.|$|R
5000|$|Shulman {{was indicted}} on six {{criminal}} counts {{in connection with}} his threats against George and Pavone. As part of a plea bargain, Shulman pleaded guilty to one count of transmitting a threat to injure another person, in that he wrote on the First Things website, [...] "If Roeder is acquitted killing Wichita abortion doctor George Tiller, someone will respond by killing George of University and Pavone of PRIESTS FOR LIFE." [...] Shulman was sentenced by Federal Judge Paul A. Crotty to 41 months' imprisonment, 3 years' supervised release and assessed a $100 special fee. [...] As part of the plea deal, Shulman's sentence was {{at the low end}} of the sentencing guidelines, and he did not face weapons charges for possession of the cyanide, castor beans and <b>rosary</b> <b>peas.</b>|$|R

50|$|There are {{not many}} predators that {{tolerate}} the strong oils of this mint, so herbivory is not a serious problem. Mildew affects the flowers sometimes, however, causing fruit destruction. Invasive plant species that threaten the habitat include Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), <b>rosary</b> <b>pea</b> (Abrus precatorius), Natal grass (Rhynchelytrum repens), and Guinea grass (Panicum maximum).|$|E
5000|$|In addition, seeds {{containing}} amygdalin—apple, apricot, bitter almond, peach, plum, cherry, quince, and others—when {{consumed in}} sufficient amounts, may cause cyanide poisoning.Other seeds that contain poisons include annona, cotton, custard apple, datura, uncooked durian, golden chain, horse-chestnut, larkspur, locoweed, lychee, nectarine, rambutan, <b>rosary</b> <b>pea,</b> sour sop, sugar apple, wisteria, and yew.

50|$|Abrin is {{a highly}} toxic toxalbumin found in {{the seeds of the}} <b>rosary</b> <b>pea</b> (or jequirity pea), Abrus precatorius. It has a median toxic dose of 0.7 micrograms per {{kilogram}} of body mass when given to mice intravenously (approximately 31.4 times more toxic than ricin, being 22 micrograms per kilogram). The median toxic dose for humans ranges from 10 to 1000 micrograms per kilogram when ingested and is 3.3 micrograms per kilogram when inhaled.|$|E
50|$|Abrus precatorius, known {{commonly}} as jequirity, Crab's eye, or crab's eye creeper, cock's eyes, <b>rosary</b> <b>pea,</b> paternoster pea, love pea, precatory pea or bean, prayer bead, John Crow Bead, coral bead, red-bead vine, country licorice, Indian licorice, wild licorice, Jamaica wild licorice, Akar Saga, coondrimany, gidee gidee, Jumbie bead ratti/rettee/retty, or weather plant, is a slender, perennial climber that twines around trees, shrubs, and hedges. It is a legume with long, pinnate-leafleted leaves.|$|E

50|$|Abrin is {{not known}} to have been weaponised. Abrin {{naturally}} occurs in the seeds of the <b>rosary</b> <b>pea,</b> a plant common to tropical regions that is occasionally employed as an herbal remedy for certain conditions. While the outer shell of the seed protects its contents from the stomachs of most mammals, the seed coats are occasionally punctured to make beaded jewelry. This can lead to poisoning if a seed is swallowed, or if such jewelry is worn against damaged skin. Abrin has been shown to act as an immunoadjuvant in the treatment of cancer in mice.|$|E
40|$|Seeds of Abrus precatorius (<b>rosary</b> <b>pea)</b> were {{identified}} as a new and potential source of hydroxynitrile lyase. Hydroxynitrile lyase from the seeds of this plant was purified up to 9 fold with specific activity of 577 Umg - 1 protein by using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques. The purified enzyme was a heteromer with estimated native molecular mass 205 kDa and its subunits showed two bands of molecular mass of 42. 0 and 36. 5 kDa in SDS-PAGE, respectively. The enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 30 ºC with 0. 1 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 5). It has K M of 13 mM and V max of 625 Umg - 1 of protein with mandelonitrile as a substrate. In 120 ml of reaction mixture containing 25 ml of benzaldehyde (substrate) and 6. 75 mg of purified enzyme produced 17. 5 g of mandelonitrile.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Abrin, one of {{most potent}} toxins known to man, {{is derived from}} the <b>rosary</b> <b>pea</b> (jequirity pea), Abrus precatorius and is a {{potential}} bioterror weapon. The temperature and pH stability of abrin was evaluated with an in vitro cell free translation (CFT) assay, a Vero cell culture cytotoxicity assay, and an in vivo mouse bioassay. pH treatment of abrin had no detrimental effect on its stability and toxicity as seen either in vitro or in vivo. Abrin exposure to increasing temperatures did not completely abrogate protein translation. In both the cell culture cytotoxicity model and the mouse bioassay, abrin’s toxic effects were completely abrogated if the toxin was exposed to temperatures of 74 °C or higher. In the cell culture model, 63 °C-treated abrin had a 30 % reduction in cytotoxicity which was validated in the in vivo mouse bioassay with all mice dying but with a slight time-to-death delay as compared to the non-treated abrin control. Since temperature inactivation did not affect abrin’s ability to inhibit protein synthesis (A-chain), we hypothesize that high temperature treatment affected abrin’s ability to bind to cellular receptors (affecting B-chain). Our results confirm the absolute need to validate in vitro cytotoxicity assays with in vivo mouse bioassays...|$|E
