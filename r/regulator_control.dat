50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the brake valve in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective brake valve in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the <b>regulator</b> <b>control</b> from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully.

Fur-regulated sRNAs/CDSs were found to have upstream Fur Binding Sites (FBS). We have constructed a Positional Weight Matrix from 100 known FBS (19 nt) and tracked the `Orphan' FBSs. Possible Fur regulated sRNAs and CDSs were identified by comparing their genomic locations with the `Orphan' FBSs identified. Thirty-eight `novel' and all known Fur regulated sRNAs in nine proteobacteria were identified. In addition, we identified high scoring FBSs in the promoter regions of the 304 CDSs and 68 of them were involved in siderophore biosynthesis, iron-transporters, two-component system, starch/sugar metabolism, sulphur/methane metabolism, etc. The present study shows that the Fur <b>regulator</b> <b>controls</b> {{the expression of}} genes involved in diverse metabolic activities and it is not limited to iron metabolism alone.

We analyzed the genome-wide transcriptional profile of V. cholerae grown at different NaCl concentrations and determined that the expression of compatible solute biosynthesis and transporter genes, virulence genes, and genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation is differentially regulated. We determined that salinity modulates biofilm formation, and this response was mediated through the transcriptional regulators VpsR and VpsT.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{focuses on}} a new {{controller}} design for both AC output voltage and DC voltage sides of a 3 -level voltage source converter (VSC) of STATCOM based on complex transfer function. With this approach, the current <b>regulator</b> <b>control</b> with two-input two-output for the AC side of VSC can be represented by a complex transfer function with single-input single-output. In addition, the complex pole-zero compensation by the complex proportional integral (PI) controller is proposed to eliminate the cross coupling effect between the real and reactive currents in the current regulator. As a result, the practical current <b>regulator</b> <b>control</b> loop can be implemented to control the AC output voltage of VSC. For the DC side, the DC voltage control loop is also established by a PI controller. Parameters of PI controllers in both AC and DC control loops are designed by modulus optimum and symmetrical optimum criteria. Simulation results by PSCAD/EMTDC show that the proposed controller provides superior stabilizing effects on the cross coupling over the decoupling control.
