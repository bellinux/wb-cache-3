5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish).|$|E

5|$|From June 1967, Line 9, that <b>ran</b> <b>along</b> the Lilleaker Line via the Skøyen Line to {{the city}} center and onwards along the Østensjø Line, was {{truncated}} to Jernbanetorget, as the Østensjø was converted to a metro line. Calculations showed that if the Lilleaker Line or the Skøyen Line and the Ekeberg Line were connected, between them one tram less would be needed, and the Ekeberg Line would have a service through the city center. After trial runs, the new service to Skøyen was taken into use on 4 May 1969.|$|E
