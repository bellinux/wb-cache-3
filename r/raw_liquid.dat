50|$|Latex moulded {{clothing}} {{is produced by}} dipping a mould into a vat of liquid rubber. Dealing with <b>raw</b> <b>liquid</b> latex is more difficult because of the extra effort that must be put in to keep {{the thickness of the}} latex itself consistent. Because of this, improper molding techniques can lead to inconsistent thickness in the latex, causing it to fail at the weak points faster than items made from sheet latex. This has led to a major stigma against molded latex garments, in favor of sheet latex versions. Unfortunately, this stigma has been detrimental to those few latex providers who have proper mold-making techniques. When done properly, a molded latex garment is just as durable as sheet latex, and it is a preferred method for skilled individuals making items with heavy contours like hoods or gloves. Despite any attempt to use sheet latex to make hoods and gloves, it is impossible to get solid sheets to fit complex contours as well as a molded latex item can. The belief that all sheet latex is superior to all molded latex is completely false, and ultimately it depends on the abilities of the creator, as even poorly made sheet latex can fall apart easily. Sheet latex is the preferred method for items like catsuits, that do not need such perfect form fitting, and are easier to create with sheets compared to the large molds required for body suits.|$|E

Liquid smoke derived from palm oil shell is potential due to the abundance of its byproduct sources in the palm oil industry. This study thus aims to prepare the best fraction of liquid smoke that can extend the shelf life of beef meatballs at room temperature. The <b>raw</b> <b>liquid</b> smoke was redistilled at 80, 90, and 100 °C and was used as an ingredient in the beef meatballs production. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identification showed that there were no harmful compounds such as derivatives of tar and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Liquid smoke produced from redistillation at 80 °C had the best result for providing higher acid value and lower pH, i. e. 5. 14 % and 2. 26, respectively. The LC 50 value of the redistilled liquid smoke in brine shrimp lethality assay was 0. 16 %. Inhibition zones of 0. 1 and 0. 8 % redistilled liquid smoke on the antibacterial test against Staphylococcus aureus were both 6. 10 mm, while the zones of inhibition for Escherichia coli were 0 and 7. 0 mm, respectively. These resulting inhibition zones were less effective than that of 100 ppm chloramphenicol, i. e. 14. 2 mm on S. aureus and 12. 6 mm on E. coli. The usage of redistilled liquid smoke at concentration of 0. 8 % in meatballs was found to inhibit total microbial growth greater than that of the addition at 0. 1 %.

Among the different species of the genus Listeria, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is known to cause listeriosis in humans and animals with low incidence but high case fatality rate. Information on the occurrence and distribution of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria species is very limited both in the veterinary and public health sectors in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize L. monocytogenes and other Listeria species from foods of animal origin (cottage cheese, raw beef, <b>raw</b> milk and <b>liquid</b> whole egg) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 391 food samples of animal origin were collected randomly, using a cross-sectional study design from November 2008 to March 2009. L. monocytogenes isolation and characterization were performed according to mainly the United States Food and Drug Administration procedures. Of the samples examined, 102 (26. 1 %) were found to be positive for Listeria. Listeria species were isolated in 39 (51. 3 %), 37 (32. 2 %), 22 (22 %) and 4 (4 %) of the <b>raw</b> beef, <b>liquid</b> whole egg, <b>raw</b> milk and cottage cheese samples respectively.

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the spread of human AE and CE diseases among the tribes and livestock breeders and farmers in the Moghan plain. The prevalence of infection (CE and AE) significantly increases with a rise in age. Methods: In this study, using ELISA and HCF-Ag (<b>raw</b> <b>liquid</b> antigen of hydatid cyst) was used {{for the first time to}} perform screening, and then the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis was evaluated by specific anti-genes Ag- 5 and EM 2 +, respectively. A total of 2003 serum samples were collected randomly from normal populations of five different areas of Moghan plain. In the first stage, serum screening was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and HCF-Ag. After that, the serology of all sera was evaluated by ELISA and specific antigens for alveolar and cystic Echinococcus. Results: From 2003 samples, 24 serum samples were (1. 19 %) AE-positive. Infection was higher in men than women (2. 1 % vs. 0. 6 %). The age group of 5 - 19 years had the lowest infection rate and the age group 40 - 59 years had the highest infection rate (2 %). In the case of cystic ecinococcosis, 164 serum samples were positive for Ag- 5 specific antigen, i. e. 7. 6 % infection, and 156 serum samples were positive for Ag-B-specific antigen. Conclusion: The findings showed that the highest infection rate was found in the Boran and Eivazlou (Palanglou) regions of Moghan plain and the lowest level of human infection was reported in Parsabad region (Nadar-kandi and Agh-ghabagh). In areas with higher contamination, the risk factor associated with CE and AE were the type of water used, the method of washing edible and wild vegetables, occupation and having or not having knowledge of hydatid disease.

40|$|This report {{contains}} the {{summary of the}} 'Magnetophoretic Bead Trapping in a High-Flowrate Biological Detection System' LDRD project 74795. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} novel biodetection system for high-throughput sample analysis. The chief application of this system is in detection of very low concentrations of target molecules from a complex liquid solution containing many different constituents [...] some of which may interfere with identification of the target molecule. The system is also designed to handle air sampling by using an aerosol system (for instance a WESP - Wet Electro-Static Precipitator, or an impact spray system) to get air sample constituents into the liquid volume. The system described herein automatically takes the <b>raw</b> <b>liquid</b> sample, whether air converted or initially liquid matrix, and mixes in magnetic detector beads that capture the targets of interest and then performs the sample cleanup function, allowing increased sensitivity and eliminating most false positives and false negatives at a downstream detector. The surfaces of the beads can be functionalized {{in a variety of ways}} in order to maximize the number of targets to be captured and concentrated. Bacteria and viruses are captured using antibodies to surface proteins on bacterial cell walls or viral particle coats. In combination with a cell lysis or PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), the beads can be used as a DNA or RNA probe to capture nucleic acid patterns of interest. The sample cleanup capability of this system would allow different raw biological samples, such as blood or saliva to be analyzed for the presence of different infectious agents (e. g. smallpox or SARS). For future studies, we envision functionalizing bead surfaces to bind to chemical weapons agents, radio-isotopes, and explosives. The two main objectives of this project were to explore methods for enhancing the mixing of the capture microspheres in the sample, and to develop a novel high-throughput magnetic microsphere trap. We have developed a novel technique using the magnetic capture microspheres as 'stirrer bars' in a fluid sample to enhance target binding to the microsphere surfaces. We have also made progress in developing a polymer-MEMS electromagnet for trapping magnetic spheres in a high-flowrate fluid format...|$|E

Water quality was monitored at three sites: (i) the treatment plant as the <b>raw</b> manure <b>liquid</b> was depurated in the various processes, (ii) the converted lagoon as it was being cleaned up with the treated effl uent, and (iii) an adjacent traditional anaerobic lagoon. Th e treatment plant removed 98 % of total suspended solids (TSS), 76 % of total solids (TS), 100 % of 5 -d biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), 98 % of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and NH 4 –N, 95 % of total phosphorus (TP), 99 % of Zn, and 99 % of Cu. Th e quality of the liquid in the converted lagoon improved rapidly as cleaner effl uent from the plant replaced anaerobic lagoon liquid. Th e converted lagoon liquid became aerobic (dissolved oxygen, 6. 95 mg L− 1; Eh, 342 mv) with the following mean reductions in the second year of the conversion: 73 % of TSS, 40 % of TS...|$|R
40|$|Native starch {{containing}} 12 % {{water was}} melt processed in presence of 23 % of various plasticizers at 120 °C, either by simple compression molding or by extrusion using a laboratory scale microcompounder. Glycerol, a typical starch plasticizer, {{was used as}} a reference and compared to three choline salts: raw choline chloride (which is a solid in dry state with a melting point above 300 °C), and two ionic liquids synthesized from this precursor (choline acetate and choline lactate, liquids below 100 °C). These ionic plasticizers were shown to allow a more efficient melting of native starch in both processes. The investigation of macromolecular structure changes during processing shows that this efficiency can be ascribed to a starch chain scission mechanism, resulting in lower specific mechanical energy input need for starch thermoplasticization compared to glycerol plasticized starch. Compared to the synthesized ionic <b>liquids,</b> <b>raw</b> commercial choline chloride leads to a good compromise between limited chain scission, and final water uptake and thermomechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Ovos moles ” is {{a renowned}} {{traditional}} Portuguese sweet that is confectioned with egg yolk, sugar and water. In this work a safer {{and easier to}} manipulate <b>raw</b> material- pasteurised <b>liquid</b> egg yolk-is proposed to substitute the intact shell eggs used in traditional “ovos moles” production. Due to previous heat treatment, pasteurised liquid egg yolk presents different sensorial, nutritional and physical properties. These changes may alter the final product’s characteristics. In order to develop a safer formulation, using pasteurised raw products, with minimised differences from the traditional product, a study on adding pasteurised egg white (as bulking agent) to the pasteurised liquid yolk was carried out. Samples made with normal shell eggs and with pasteurised liquid eggs were compared in terms of rheological parameters. Results allow characterising the physical properties of traditional ovos moles and of alternative formulations, using pasteurised egg yolk and white. A new formula, with rheological properties identical to the traditional one, was developed...|$|R
40|$|Aliphatic {{hydrocarbons}} with 4 – 5 {{carbon chain}} are very valuable starting {{materials for the}} steam cracking process. In terms of volume, the C 4 and C 5 fractions {{are the most important}} by-product streams from the pyrolysis of naphtha and other <b>liquid</b> <b>raw</b> materials. Total hydrogenation of C 4 and C 5 fraction is a way how to produce a high-quality raw material for pyrolysis, which in comparison with a simple recycle olefin (non-hydrogenated) fractions provides higher yields of ethylene and propylene and does not shorten the operating period of the pyrolysis furnaces by excessive coking 1, 2. For better understanding of the C 4 fraction hydrogenating process, reaction kinetic study was performed in laboratory conditions. The hydrogenation of 2 -methylpropene (isobutene) on platinum catalyst was investigated experimentally as a model reaction. The effort was focused on development of the methodology of kinetic data collection under the kinetic regime. To have a representative kinetic data, results reproducibility and process stability within several days on-stream was investigated...|$|R
