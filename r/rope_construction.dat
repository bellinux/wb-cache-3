40|$|Synopsis: Aramid fibres {{have been}} used in <b>rope</b> <b>construction</b> and for {{prestressing}} tendons, but when subjected to a constant static load the fibres creep with time and may rupture, leading to a catastrophic failure of the rope. To understand this behaviour many life-time models have been suggested but they suffer from the lack of long term creep rupture data to make firm conclusions on rupture times and load levels. Such data is expensive to obtain using conventional creep testing as {{it takes a long time}} before failure of a specimen. To overcome this problem, and to obtain the creep-rupture data at low stress levels within a reasonably short time scale (hours), accelerated testing methods, the Stepped Isothermal Method (SIM) and Time Temperature Superposition (TTSP), have been investigated. In SIM testing a single yarn specimen is tested at a specific stress level under a series of increasing temperature steps from which a single response curve, known as the master curve, is obtained which predicts the long-term behaviour. Some manipulation of the data is required, but the technique has many advantages over the TTSP and conventional creep testing and it can be automated to obtain the long-term creep-rupture data points relatively easily...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} wire rope {{technology}} used in mine hoisting applications {{has a significant}} effect on the overall efficiency of the hoisting system. This paper discusses the effect that a reduction in rope mass per unit length and an increase in rope breaking strength can have on rock skip capacity and hence mine shaft output. A 20 per cent reduction in rope mass per metre for a typical 48 mm hoisting rope, while maintaining the breaking strength, increases the skip’s capacity by circa 30 per cent at a suspended rope length of 3000 m. Such gains in shaft output, without any significant changes to the shaft or winder design, can have major implications for the feasibility of future deep mine projects. The technical challenge for rope manufacturers is how to get rid of 20 to 30 per cent of the rope mass while keeping the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity of the whole rope constant.

Fibre structures are also replacing steel wire structures in some other traditional uses and have the potential for important advances in tyre cords, medical ligaments, bridges, textile architectural buildings, towed arrays, space structures and other engineering applications. Polymeric fibres have complex mechanical properties and fibre structures can be geometrically complex involving interactions between millions of fine fibres.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IEEE via the DOI in this record. This paper discusses several new technologies for mooring floating marine energy converter (MEC) devices, such as wave energy generators, tidal current turbines and floating wind turbines. The principal mooring component is a special nylon fiber rope which provides cyclic tension fatigue endurance much superior to that of conventional nylon ropes. The nylon fiber is treated with a new proprietary coating which has excellent wet yarn abrasion properties. The parallel-subrope type <b>rope</b> <b>construction</b> further reduces internal abrasion. Extensive laboratory testing was carried out on this new nylon rope design. Cyclic tension fatigue tests were conducted at mean loads and load amplitudes typical of actual service conditions and at higher mean loads and amplitudes. These tests demonstrate that the special nylon rope has essentially the same, desirable stretch characteristics as conventional nylon rope and has much better endurance performance. The mooring connection to the floating MEC device consists of a high-modulus fiber rope pendant which passes through a low-friction bell-mouth nylon fairlead on the MEC device. This eliminates the use of heavy, unreliable chain in this critical connection. A unique bag anchor system would be used on sand, clay, rock and other sea beds in which conventional drag embedment anchors and driven piles are impractical. The bag anchor consists of a large abrasion resistant carcass with lifting straps and top closure. The bag is transported to site in a collapsed form and is filled with local sand or aggregate to provide ballast weight. Several or many such bags are enclosed within a fiber rope net for deployment and are grouped together for connection to the mooring line. The paper will be {{of particular interest to}} designers of moorings for MEC systems in shallow water and severe wave environments. It will also be of interest for other mooring applications.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Traditional {{rationale}} for design factors is briefly reviewed. Methodologies for determining these traditional design factors are lacking {{and are usually}} based upon subjective reasons which result in applying a design factor of 3. 0 in all cases (western United States). Factors which affect wire rope life are discussed. These factors include steel properties (i. e. elastic limit), <b>rope</b> <b>construction,</b> types of loading (static and impact), bending stress, fatigue, wire rope maintenance, line length, line use, and expected life. Historically, the logging industry has not explicitly considered the economics of harvesting in selecting a design factor for harvest planning. Maximizing the service life of the wire rope may not maximize profit or minimize yarding costs. When cable yarding is considered, log production {{is a very important}} factor. The net payload which can be transported to the landing and the speed of the transport determine, to a large extent, the hourly production rate. In order to maximize production it is often necessary to operate at high line tensions. Although wire rope used in such a manner must be replaced more often (shorter life), work is accomplished which cannot be performed by any other means for the same cost. This paper presents a procedure for applying a design factor based on yarding costs. Since the planning of most skyline harvest systems starts with some design factor for the determining maximum tensions which can be used on a particular profile, the economic approach for determining a design factor seems like a reasonable strategy. To the operator of a cable yarding system, this strategy may be more appropriate than applying a design factor of 3. 0 in all cases. Finding the optimum payload (or range of payloads) which minimizes overall yarding costs is a sound strategy for planning skyline harvest systems. The procedure in this report uses a yarding simulation model to determine yarding production, wire rope tensions, wire rope lives, and yarding cost per unit volume. The simulation was done on a hypothetical tintber stand with a running skyline system. Line lives were determined by accumulating the proportion of line life used as each turn was yarded. The nuntber of bends until failure was used as a yardstick for determining line life. Yarding cost per unit volume was then compared as logloads were increased until a minimum cost was identified. Design factors for both the mainline and skyline for each average logload were calculated and compared. The results of the simulation indicated that applying a design factor of 3. 0 may not be appropriate when considering the effects of the design factor on yarding costs. Crew safety was not considered implicitly in the procedure. However, modifications of the procedure to include crew safety are discussed...|$|E

Installation has been estimated to account for 27 % of lifetime cost for a tidal turbine [1]. This {{is an area where}} the other marine industries, notably offshore oil and gas, have extensive experience, but the high energy regions in which MRE devices are deployed pose particular installation difficulties and operating conditions.

The main arguments are the possibility to adapt the mooring to the large movements of floating devices, using rope compliance to reduce peak loads while minimizing energy loss, and reduced cost.

40|$|In der Fördertechnik werden in den unterschiedlichsten Anwendungsbereichen Seiltriebe mit Seilscheiben eingesetzt. Große Seilscheiben mit einem Durchmesser von mehr als 2 m werden beispielsweise in Schachtförder- und Seilbahnanlagen, Schiffshebewerken, Großgeräten im Tagebau und im Offshore-Bereich verwendet. Bisherige Berechnungsverfahren zur Ermittlung der Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe gehen von einer konstanten längenbezogenen Anpresskraft auf den Seilscheibenkranz aus und vernachlässigen weitere Einflüsse (bspw. Querkräfte aus dem Schrägzug und dynamische Kräfte). Die Biegesteifigkeit des Seils verursacht jedoch beim Auf- und Ablauf des Seils auf die Seilscheibe eine Erhöhung der längenbezogenen Anpresskraft um das bis zu 4 -fache der mittleren Anpresskraft [Häb- 95]. Diese Kraftüberhöhungen am Seilauf- und –ablauf bewirken bei Seilscheiben mit Speichenkonstruktion eine Erhöhung der inneren Beanspruchung (Vergleichsspannung) der Seilscheibe von über 20 % (siehe Kap. 6. 5 dort wird der Zahlenwert berechnet) und müssen deshalb bei der Dimensionierung von Seilscheiben berücksichtigt werden. Bei kleinen Seilablenkwinkeln (< 60 °) tritt eine deutliche Reduzierung der Seillebensdauer auf [Mül- 66]. Dies ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass bei kleinen Ablenkwinkeln die Kraftüberhöhungen am Seilauf- und –ablauf teilweise oder auch vollständig zusammenfallen und nochmals deutlich größere Anpresskräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe entstehen. Da diese Kräfte bisher unbekannt waren, konnten sie bei der Dimensionierung nicht berücksichtigt werden. In der vorliegenden Forschungsarbeit wird ein analytisches Modell dargestellt, in das die bisher nicht berücksichtigten Effekte und Beeinflussungsfaktoren (z. B. Seilmasse und Seilgeschwindigkeit) integriert sind, so dass die Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe nun vollständiger beschrieben werden können. Ferner wird ein numerisches Mehrkörpersimulationsmodell beschrieben, mit dem die bis dahin unbekannten Kräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe aufgrund kleiner Ablenkwinkel (die Pressungsspitzen bei Auf- und Ablauf des Seils fallen zusammen), des Schrägzugs und der Dynamik ermittelt werden können. Zur Ermittlung der inneren Beanspruchung von Seilscheiben wird eine Methode auf Basis der Finiten-Elemente-Berechnung entwickelt und die Spannungsverläufe beispielsweise in den Speichen der Seilscheibe während der Rotation dargestellt. Zur Validierung des entwickelten Berechnungsverfahrens und der numerischen Modelle werden an einer in der Praxis eingesetzten Seilscheibe einer Seilbahnanlage umfangreiche Messreihen zur Bestimmung der Verformungen und Spannungen in der Seilscheibe durchgeführt. Abschließend wird eine Methode zur sicheren festigkeitstechnischen Dimensionierung großer Seilscheiben entwickelt. Diese Methode basiert auf den gewonnenen Erkenntnissen der Anpresskräfte zwischen Seil und Seilscheibe, aus denen allgemeingültige Belastungsannahmen abgeleitet werden. Since {{many decades}} big sheaves (with diameters bigger than 2 meters) {{are used in}} lots of {{different}} applications in mechanical handling, for example in hoisting plants, ropeways, ship lifts, giant equipment in strip mining and the offshore area. However {{there is a lack}} of knowledge of the load situation (pressure between rope and sheave) of these sheaves. So the stress situation (deformations and the mechanical stresses) of the sheaves are also unknown. Therefore the sheaves are either highly overdesigned or in the worst case not enough dimensioned and this results in breakdown of the sheave. Until now for strength calculation and dimensioning of sheaves it was assumed that the line contact pressure (normal force) between rope and sheave is constant [Ose- 82]. But when the rope enters onto or runs off the sheave the line contact pressure increases because of the bending stiffness of the rope [Häb- 95]. These peaks can reach up to 4 times of the average line contact pressure which depends on <b>rope</b> <b>construction,</b> rope force and ratio of diameters between rope and sheave. Furthermore there are more influencing factors unconsidered as for example lateral forces because of diagonal pull or dynamic forces because of start-up processes and rundowns of conveyor systems. To come to new elementary conclusions for dimensioning of big sheaves, both an analytic model for calculation of contact forces between rope and sheave was developed and extensive theoretical and experimental series were realized to get the load and stress situation of big sheaves in this research study. Consequently the results of this research study are a general basic for a safety dimensioning of big sheaves. Because of essential enormous processing power it is currently not possible to dynamically simulate a completely detailed steal wire rope with all wires and strands by the finite-element-method when the rope runs over the sheave. So a practical numerical analogous model based on a parameter assisted multi-body simulation model for the simulation of the dynamic run of a rope over a sheave was developed. This multi-body simulation model enables to calculate the contact forces between rope and sheave. By small fleet angles (smaller then 60 °) the peaks of the line contact pressure go partially or completely together when the rope enters onto and runs of the sheave and this results in a noticeable higher contact force, which was unknown so far. With the developed numerical model for the first time it is possible to calculate these forces qualitatively and quantitatively. Within the analysed rope constructions there are maximum forces of 6 times of the constant (so far considered for the dimensioning of sheaves) part of the line contact pressure by small fleet angles. Therefore a calculation of the line contact pressure at small fleet angles by the given calculation method is no more acceptable. At the start-up process or rundown of conveyor systems the rope force changes due to acceleration forces. This means that the contact forces between rope and sheave are variable and even higher during acceleration. For the first time these contact forces can be calculated by the help of the developed numerical model for a complete dynamic drive of the conveyor system with acceleration phase, phase with constant velocity and deceleration phase. The results show that the forces between rope and sheave are principally straight proportional to the acceleration. Furthermore it is possible to analyse the effects of vibrations in longitudinal direction of the rope on the contact forces, because of the lurch at the acceleration. Further-more this results in temporary higher contact forces. If there is diagonal pull between rope and sheave, which often cannot be avoided in wire rope drive systems, there are the same effects as if the rope entered onto or ran off the sheave. So because of the bending resistance of the rope there are higher contact forces between rope and sheave especially cross to the internal groove sidewall of the sheave, than up to now it could be calculated with an extremely simplified analytic model. With the developed numerical model it is possible to calculate the amplitude and the run of the contact force for the first time. The amplitude of the contact force is mainly influenced by the diagonal pull angle and the rope force. Furthermore the geometry especially the angle of the internal groove sidewall has also an effect on the contact forces because of the diagonal pull. On the basic of the analytic calculation method and the numerical model of the run of a rope over a sheave, there were general loads assumed for the safety dimensioning of big rope sheaves developed...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. Synthetic fibre ropes are in widespread use in maritime applications ranging from lifting to temporary and permanent mooring systems for vessels, offshore equipment and platforms. The selection of synthetic ropes over conventional steel components is motivated by several key advantages including selectable axial stiffness, energy absorption (and hence load mitigation), fatigue resistance and low unit cost. The long-term use of ropes as safety critical components in potentially high dynamic loading environments necessitates that new designs are verified using stringent qualification procedures. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is one certification body that has produced several guidelines for the testing of synthetic ropes encompassing quasi-static and dynamic loading as well as fatigue cycling. This paper {{presents the results of}} tension-tension tests carried out to ISO 2307 : 2010, ISO 18692 : 2007 (E) and ISO/TS 19336 : 2015 (E) on three different 12 -strand <b>rope</b> <b>constructions</b> manufactured by Ashimori Industry Co.

Most are stamped with a “Not For Climbing” or similar warning due to a common lack of load-testing and safety standards in manufacturing. While from an etymological perspective any metal attaching link with a spring gate is technically a carabiner, the strict usage among the climbing community specifically refers only to those devices manufactured and tested for load-bearing in safety-critical systems like rock and mountain climbing.|$|R
50|$|The {{early eighties}} were tough times for {{education}} of all sorts. The Reagan revolution was causing increasing cutbacks in school funding. The back-to-basics movement {{in public schools}} was increasing and giving {{people who wanted to}} get students to learn in new and creative ways a few more hurdles to jump. Yet in spite of the mood, the flow of people to PA training workshops and subsequent adoptions continued. The PA budget, as part of the Hamilton-Wenham schools in 1981-82, was $345,000, of which only $55,000 was federal money from the National Diffusion Network. The remainder was revenue from workshop fees, <b>ropes</b> course <b>construction,</b> and the sale of supplies and books. There were five full-time staff members in the Hamilton offices. In addition, Alan Sentkowski, who had been a biology teacher at Hamilton-Wenham and a key early staff member, started a satellite office in Savannah, Georgia.|$|R

50|$|The War on Drugs has {{resulted}} in the outlawing of the entire hemp industry in the United States. Hemp, which is a special cultivar of Cannabis Sativa, does not have significant amounts of psychoactive (THC) substances in it, less than 1%. Without even realizing the plant had been outlawed several months prior, Popular Mechanics magazine published an article in 1938 entitled The New Billion-Dollar Crop anticipating the explosion of the hemp industry with the invention of machines to help process it. Recently, governmental refusal to take advantage of taxing hemp has been a point of criticism. Hemp has a large list of potential industrial uses including textiles, paper, <b>rope,</b> fuel, <b>construction</b> materials, and biocomposites (for use in cars for example). Hemp has some drawbacks, however, one being that the long fibers in hemp are only a part of the outer bast, and this has contributed to hemp having only modest commercial success in countries (for example in Canada) where it is legal to harvest hemp.|$|R
40|$|Deliverable 3. 5. 2 {{from the}} MERiFIC Project A report {{prepared}} {{as part of}} the MERiFIC Project "Marine Energy in Far Peripheral and Island Communities"his report is a deliverable of MERiFIC Work Package 3 : ‘Dynamic Behaviour of Marine Energy Devices’ involving the collaboration of IFREMER (Institut français de recherche pour l'exploitation de la mer) in France and the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. Although synthetic ropes have been used for the station-keeping of offshore structures for the past two decades predominantly by the oil, gas and shipping industries, there is considerable interest in their utilisation for the station-keeping of marine renewable energy (MRE) devices. Differences in application between typically small, highly responsive devices (e. g. Wave Energy Converters or WECs) and large slow-moving platforms necessitate a unique approach to mooring system design and dedicated mooring component test programs, both guided by relevant certification standards. It is the intention of this report to provide an introduction to synthetic mooring ropes in the context of previous usage in the offshore industry and also to highlight factors which should be considered for their use in MRE mooring systems. The document begins by setting the scene to give background on the fundamental differences between previous applications of synthetic mooring ropes and MRE devices. In Section 2 a brief overview of commercially available ropes is then given. The distinct properties of synthetic materials and <b>rope</b> <b>constructions</b> are summarised with emphasis placed on issues which are likely to be relevant for MRE devices. In the absence of specific advice for this emerging industry, conventional approaches to applying safety factors to synthetic ropes are then introduced. Section 3 highlights in-service considerations relevant for the different lifecycle stages of ropes, from installation and operational procedures (such as maintenance and inspection) to decommissioning. Specific modelling approaches for synthetic ropes are then summarised in Section 4, followed by a summary in Section 5. This document is not intended to be an exhaustive account of all aspects of synthetic mooring ropes and in light of this further references are provided for the interested reader. MERiFIC was selected under the European Cross-Border Cooperation Programme INTERREG IV A France (Channel) – England, co-funded by the ERD...|$|R
