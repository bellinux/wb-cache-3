5|$|The {{replication}} of damaged DNA before cell division {{can lead to}} the incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones. Daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which the original DNA sequence is unrecoverable (except in the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of a back mutation, for example, through gene conversion).|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in Basque include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the Basque prosthetic vowel, added because no Basque word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rare</b> <b>cases</b> {{are often}} the most {{interesting}} cases. For example, in medical diagnosis one is typically interested in identifying relatively rare diseases, such as cancer, rather than more frequently occurring ones, such as the common cold. In this chapter we discuss the role of <b>rare</b> <b>cases</b> in data mining.

5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of {{interference}} or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense {{wildfires}} are called fire whirls. They {{are not considered}} tornadoes, except in the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. Fire whirls usually are {{not as strong as}} tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E

25|$|A thymoma is a tumor {{originating}} from the epithelial {{cells of the}} thymus that may be benign or malignant. Thymomas are frequently associated with the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.|$|E
25|$|Nicolas Grenon (c. 1375 – October 17, 1456) was a French {{composer}} of {{the early}} Renaissance.

25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{that would be}} {{considered}} by a court in establishing {{the amount of the}} salvor’s award. Some of these include the difficulty of the operation, the risk involved to the salvor, the value of the property saved, the degree of danger to which the property was exposed, and the potential environmental impacts. It would be a <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> in which the salvage award would be greater than 50 percent {{of the value of the}} property salvaged. More commonly, salvage awards amount to 10 percent to 25 percent of the value of the property.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in lymphocyte concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some <b>rare</b> <b>case,</b> leukemias are found through an abnormally raised lymphocyte count in an otherwise normal person). A high lymphocyte count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of Bordetella pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete lymphocyte count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E
25|$|Constantine settled Franks on {{the lower}} left bank of the Rhine; their {{settlements}} required a line of fortifications {{to keep them in}} check, indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control. Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire. The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening. In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360. Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians. Except in the <b>rare</b> <b>case</b> of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians. Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy. However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well. The average nutritional state of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century; the population of North-Western Europe did not recover, though the Mediterranean regions did.|$|E
