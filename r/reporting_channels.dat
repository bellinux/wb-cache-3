40|$|Inefficient use {{of radio}} {{spectrum}} {{is becoming a}} serious problem {{as more and more}} wireless systems are being developed to operate in crowded spectrum bands. Cognitive radio offers a novel solution to overcome the underutilization problem by allowing secondary usage of the spectrum resources along with high reliable communication. Spectrum sensing is a key enabler for cognitive radios. It identifies idle spectrum and provides awareness regarding the radio environment which are essential for the efficient secondary use of the spectrum and coexistence of different wireless systems. The focus of this thesis is on the local and cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms. Local sensing algorithms are proposed for detecting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based primary user (PU) transmissions using their autocorrelation property. The proposed autocorrelation detectors are simple and computationally efficient. Later, the algorithms are extended to the case of cooperative sensing where multiple secondary users (SUs) collaborate to detect a PU transmission. For cooperation, each SU sends a local decision statistic such as log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to the fusion center (FC) which makes a final decision. Cooperative sensing algorithms are also proposed using sequential and censoring methods. Sequential detection minimizes the average detection time while censoring scheme improves the energy efficiency. The performances of the proposed algorithms are studied through rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive simulations. The distributions of the decision statistics at the SU and the test statistic at the FC are established conditioned on either hypothesis. Later, the effects of quantization and <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> errors are considered. Main aim in studying the effects of quantization and channel errors on the cooperative sensing is to provide a framework for the designers to choose the operating values of the number of quantization bits and the target bit error probability (BEP) for the <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> such that the performance loss caused by these non-idealities is negligible. Later a performance limitation in the form of BEP wall is established for the cooperative sensing schemes in the presence of <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> errors.

40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing (CSS) scheme is employed {{to detect the}} primary user (PU) more quickly and accurately in cognitive radio (CR) systems. The performance of CSS scheme is usually significantly degraded when the inter-user and <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> experience path loss or deep fading. Meanwhile, the <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> are usually bandwidth limited. When {{the number of the}} secondary users (SUs) is very large, the sensing results need enormous bandwidth in the transmission. To solve this problem, a dynamical clustering CSS scheme with bandwidth constraints is proposed, where the SUs with better <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> are chosen as the cluster heads and the other SUs are dynamically grouped according to the inter-user channel conditions. In each cluster, the proposed scheme adopts the double thresholds scheme to make sure that only the SUs with high quality can send their sensing results. Simulation results demonstrate that the average number of sensing bits of the proposed scheme decreases greatly with a little loss in the sensing performance. This advantage is more obvious compared with the STBC based cooperative {{spectrum sensing}} scheme...|$|E
