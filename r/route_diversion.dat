40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of real-time <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> policies, with or without off-ramp closure, to address recurrent motorway traffic congestion created due to a saturated off-ramp. In particular, the proposed <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> policies attempt to avoid the off-ramp queue spill-over onto the motorway mainstream and the resulting motorway congestion by re- routing the motorway vehicles through nearby off-ramps towards the same destination. This paper addresses the case where real-time route guidance strategies, based on user-optimum considerations, are not sufficient to resolve the spill-over and motorway congestion problem, which may call for harsh measures (off-ramp closure) to force route diversion; while other cases are treated in a companion paper. The proposed <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> concepts are tested for a hypothetical, but quite typical network infrastructure and traffic scenario by use of macroscopic simulation. The obtained simulation results are compared to the case where no <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> is employed, and reveal interesting features {{and the potential for}} significant improvements...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> as a strategy for reducing crash risk on freeways using Microsimulation. Traffic simulation environment provides the 2 ̆ 7 loop detector data 2 ̆ 7 which in turn are the inputs to the models used for real-time crash risk estimation. It has been found that rear-end crashes are more accurately described as occurring within one of two distinct traffic regimes. Hence, the crash risk estimates for rear-end crashes belonging to Regime 1 and Regime 2 are output posterior probabilities from two different models which are not directly comparable. A method was proposed to transform the output from the two models into a single measure of rear-end crash risk, which can be used to assess the crash risk during simulation environment even when traffic conditions change from Regime 1 to 2 or vice versa. Using the information obtained from simulation package the crash risk estimates for the base case (No <b>route</b> <b>diversion)</b> and cases with route diversion(s) were compared. <b>Route</b> <b>diversion</b> was found to decrease the overall rear-end and lane-change crash risk on the freeway sections with free-flow conditions to low levels of congestion.

40|$|An {{integrated}} freeway {{traffic management}} system requires a dynamic traffic control model that operates {{in real-time and}} efficiently allocates freeway traffic diversion onto less congested arterials. The distribution of congested freeway traffic onto neighboring arterials is often a cost-effective and practical way {{to mitigate the effect}} of non-recurrent congestion on urban freeways. However, the key tasks associated with the redistribution of traffic in the network involve reliable information provision, realistic modeling of driver behavior, and projecting future traffic conditions in the network. All three of these tasks are interdependent, and the accuracy of the driver behavior model contributes to the efficiency and precision of the other two tasks. Hence, it is essential to construct a reliable, realistic, and real-time driver behavior modeling framework that can efficiently represent drivers 2 ̆ 7 dynamic route switching behavior. While it is difficult to capture individual travel behavior characteristics in the field using currently available technology, it is relatively easy to obtain aggregate level responses in real-time. This research proposes an aggregate level dynamic <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> model framework that can adapt to rapidly varying traffic characteristics as well as to short term and long term changes in drivers 2 ̆ 7 route choice behaviors. A Bayesian updating framework was developed to update the time varying parameters of the aggregate diversion model. ^ The proposed <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> model updating strategy was integrated with an adaptive freeway origin-destination (O-D) flow estimation framework. The framework was applied to estimate time-dependent O-D flow matrices in a test freeway network in northern Indiana under incident induced congested situations. Data required for the models were generated using INTEGRATION, a traffic simulation software developed at Queen 2 ̆ 7 s University, Kingston, Canada. Experimental results showed significant improvement in O-D estimates when the <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> propensity of drivers was properly accounted for. The adaptive characteristics of the <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> model were captured using a Dynamic Linear Model which proved to be a computationally efficient approach yielding satisfactory predictions. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methodology and}} case studies for a system-wide evaluation {{of an integrated}} traffic control and <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> strategy. Experiments are performed for the Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) network in Boston and use a microscopic traffic simulator to test and evaluate the traffic control design. The advantage of this microscopic simulation laboratory is that it simulates the interaction of individual vehicles with other vehicles, network geometry, and traffic control devices, thus providing {{a detailed analysis of}} the impact of traffic control. Two case studies are presented. One places an incident in a weaving section and uses control designs comprised of lane control signs (LCS), variable speed limit signs (VSLS), ramp meters, and <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> for incident management. The other case places an incident in a tunnel, and uses controls comprised of LCS, VSLS, and <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> to a parallel tunnel. The experiments demonstrate that the simulation laboratory can serve as an effective tool for evaluation of integrated Dynamic Traffic Management Systems (DTMS). The results show marginal or no improvement due to an integrated design. Thus, it is found that a naive integration approach for DTMS may not provide expected benefit. Another significant finding of this study indicates the disadvantage of a simple route guidance information system which is based on existing traffic patterns, implying the need for a prediction-based information system.

40|$|Throughout the United States {{metropolitan}} area freeways are operating {{at or near}} capacity. Any disturbance in the traffic flow on these freeways, planned or unplanned, can result in varying degrees of congestion. Incident management programs have been established in urban areas nationwide to help reduce the magnitude of incident induced congestion. These programs focus mainly on the incident identification and response stage, and have only recently begun to develop the tools and techniques needed to manage the recovery stage. One technique that has been becoming more widely employed, with the increased focus incident management and overall traffic systems management, is alternate route traffic diversion. However, even when diversion strategies are employed, often only the main line freeway is evaluated and insufficient consideration {{is given to the}} effect of the diversion on the alternate route. Also, traffic diversion strategies are typically deployed only during extreme incidents and are seldom deployed or even analyzed for how they would help mitigate congestion related to minor traffic incidents. If delay on the freeway network as a whole is to be minimized, incident management programs need to incorporate comprehensive traffic management strategies and decision aids for the defining of traffic diversion strategies. This study utilized Federal Highway Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (FHWA) traffic microsimulation software, CORSIM, to evaluate a freeway <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> strategy that would increase traveler safety and alleviate congestion caused by minor incidents. The goal of the project was to reduce the impacts of minor incidents on a freeway system {{through the use of a}} methodically analyzed diversion strategy. The four specific objectives of the research were (1) to determine the impact of varying degrees of traffic diversion will have on the network evaluators for varying levels of traffic volumes encountering different incident situations; (2) to evaluate CORSIM and companion software as tools for performing this analysis; (3) to determine and document the procedure of the use of CORSIM in this facility; and (4) to recommend a diversion practice. The research analysis used typical measures of effectiveness to evaluate the effects of minor incidents and traffic diversion on a mainline and alternate route. The results of the research show that CORSIM is a valuable tool for researchers, planners, or transportation engineers performing diversion strategy analysis. By utilizing CORSIM to simulate specific <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> strategies valuable insights were gained into the effects that minor unplanned traffic incidents and deployed <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> strategies will have on average network measures of effectiveness. It was found that the traffic condition the network is experiencing at the time of a minor incident and <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> has distinct impacts on the network evaluators. CORSIM simulations demonstrated that the four levels of traffic condition tested produce distinct <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> strategy recommendations. It was shown that the diversion modeled had a negative impact under AM peak traffic conditions, a slightly positive impact under 3 / 4 AM peak traffic conditions, significantly positive impact under 2 / 3 AM peak traffic conditions, and no impact under 1 / 2 AM peak traffic conditions. The significance of these results is that they indicate that it is only beneficial to the entire network to divert traffic for certain incident situations when the network is operating at 3 / 4 AM peak or 2 / 3 AM peak traffic. At AM peak and 1 / 2 AM peak traffic condition, diversion was not found to be warranted for any of the minor incident situations modeled...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a driving {{simulator}} has been integrated with a traffic simulator {{at the network}} level to allow subjects to drive in a fairly realistic environment with a realistic traffic flow and density. A 10  mi 2 (25  km 2) network was developed in a driving simulator and then exported to a traffic simulator. About 30 subjects drove the simulator under different traffic and driving conditions and variable message sign (VMS) information, both with and without integration. Route guidance was available for the subjects. The challenges of the integration process are explained and its advantages investigated.

This paper describes modeling of an urban highway network's traffic conditions to investigate potential <b>route</b> <b>diversion</b> through congestion pricing strategies on toll facilities in Orlando, Florida using Paramics. The experimental design included a multi-level factorial design with three qualitative variables and four response quantitative variables. The experiment's objective was to investigate different scenarios for reducing tolls on less congested roads (SR 528 and SR 417) and increasing tolls on more congested roads (SR 408) to determine the impact on travelers' route choices and overall congestion in the network. The simulation results demonstrate that the Dynamic Feedback Assignment (DFB) led {{to a reduction in}} the average queuing delay and average travel time when compared to results from the Stochastic Assignment (SA).
