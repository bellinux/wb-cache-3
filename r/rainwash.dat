50|$|Colluvium is {{a general}} name for loose, unconsolidated sediments that have been {{deposited}} {{at the base of}} hillslopes by either <b>rainwash,</b> sheetwash, slow continuous downslope creep, or a variable combination of these processes. Colluvium is typically composed of a heterogeneous range of rock types and sediments ranging from silt to rock fragments of various sizes. This term is also used to specifically refer to sediment deposited {{at the base of a}} hillslope by unconcentrated surface runoff or sheet erosion.|$|E

The slopes are occupied by important "karren", whereas the bottom is flat, regardless little hillocks showing the shaly nature of {{a great part of}} the bottom. Karstic and non-karstic processes co-operated {{in the formation of the}} daia. Most important processes, at the present time are: karstic processes (subterrranean drainage and subterranean runoff of great amounts of sediments; karren) and non-karstic processes (talus on the slopes; <b>rainwash</b> and colluvium on the bottom). An attempt of chronology is given. From a practical point of view, the authors consider that simple and non-expensive actions could protect the soil and give it a higher value: little clay dams, stone rims, preservation of the existing vegetation on the rocky slopes...|$|E

Among the systems currently in operation are several industrial process heat projects and the Modular Industrial Solar Retrofit qualification test systems, all of which use parabolic troughs, and the Shenandoah Total Energy Project, which uses parabolic dishes. Operational experience has provided insight to both desirable and undesirable features of the designs of these systems. Features of these systems which are also relevant to the design of parabolic concentrator thermal electric systems are discussed. Other design features discussed are system control functions which were found to be especially convenient or effective, such as local concentrator controls, <b>rainwash</b> controls, and system response to changing isolation.

40|$|Alterations in {{topography}} due to weathering, if {{they can}} be satisfactorily demonstrated, are enormously useful to teachers seeking to connect the passage of time with geologic change. Even the more imaginative students in geology experience some difficulty in adjusting time-consciousness to the extended periods required to account for gross changes in topography. Students display new comprehension on seeing weathered limestone monuments and spectacular water-falls like those at Niagara. But prominent features, including waterfalls, erosion along lake fronts with unprotected headlands, and even <b>rainwashed</b> gullies, often fail to convey the significance of {{the other side of the}} coin, the infinitely slower land-leveling process which occurs over a greater percentage of the terrain. The author, while teaching general geology in northeastern Ohio, had occasion to witness the effects of his own overenthusiasm to emphasize rapid erosional forces.

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that agricultural systems with perennial crops are more sustainable than systems with annual crops. Soil erosion is negligible and perennial crops have more closed nutrient cycling. Moreover, inorganic fertilizers are used more commonly in cash {{crops such as}} perennial crops so that soil fertility decline and nutrient mining {{are less likely to}} occur. In the past decades, considerable research has been devoted to the quantification of nutrient stocks and nutrient cycling in agro-ecosystems. This article reviews the main stocks and flows of nutrients in cocoa ecosystems for several cocoa-growing regions in the tropics. Most of the nitrogen is found in the topsoils, and less than 10 % of the total N stock is in the cocoa and shade trees. Nitrogen in the annual litter fall is about 20 to 45 % of the total N in the vegetation and 2 to 3 % of the total N in the soil. The accumulation of potassium is low in cocoa ecosystems, and in most systems the total amount in the biomass is equivalent to the available P content in the topsoil. Phosphorus in the annual litter fall is about 10 to 30 % of the total P in the vegetation and 10 to 40 % of the available P in the soil. Potassium is a major nutrient in mature cocoa. Stocks of exchangeable K in the topsoil vary from 100 to 550 kg ha- 1, and high K levels in the soil correspond to high K levels in the vegetation and litter. Partial nutrient balances were calculated that compares the losses, addition, and transfer of N, P, and K. The nutrient balance is negative in the absence of inorganic fertilizers, especially for K. <b>Rainwash</b> and litter fall are key components in the cycling of nutrients of cocoa ecosystems. The amount of nutrients transferred by <b>rainwash</b> is less than 8 kg ha- 1 for N and P but varies from 38 to more than 100 kg ha- 1 year- 1 for K. Most soils under cocoa had a lower fertility when compared to primary forest, although soil chemical properties seem to settle at equilibrium levels. This review shows that large amounts of nutrients in cocoa ecosystems are transferred each year and that such nutrient cycling is essential for maintaining cocoa productio...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} environmental {{controls on the}} soiling formation and decay of building stones a set of mapping and physical and chemical analyses were carried out on granite from a historical church in the polluted centre of Rio de Janeiro. These techniques highlight the increasing of threatening damage on generally perceived as a durable building material, caused by granular disaggregation and contour scaling in areas close to ground level. Mapping also indicated the formation of black crusts over entire building façades, concentrated on areas sheltered from rain-wash. Analyses demonstrated the influence of marine aerosols, rock and mortar composition and mostly of the atmospheric pollutants on the decay and soiling of the granite. Much of the decay is associated specifically {{with the presence of}} halite (NaCl) and gypsum (CaS 04. 2 H 2 O). The fact that black, gypsum crusts are able to develop over entire façades in a humid subtropical environment is testimony to the high levels of local pollution, especially particulate deposition. Reduced <b>rainwash,</b> in sheltered micro-environments of narrow, canyon-like streets, overcomes the gypsum tendency to bewashed away from buildings façades. These observations further highlight that decay processes are primarily controlled by microclimatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|A legacy from mid- 19 th Century mining near Newtownards is lead-rich {{tailings}} and derived soils containing typically 10 % Pb. Lead occurs dominantly as very fine-grained cerussite (PbCO 3) and the tailings {{are also}} rich in calcite and dolomite. <b>Rainwash</b> and overland flow has transferred tailings {{material from the}} original impoundments into a meadow, forming a depositional 'plume' characterised by contrasting soil colour, vegetation species and vigour of growth. Cerussite is dispersed farther than calcite and dolomite. In areas of the plume proximal to the tailings source, the Pb content (dry weight) of dock and plantain is up to 6540 ?g/g in roots and 1140 ?g/g Pb in leaves. Plume soils and plants are also enriched in Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd and Sb. Bracken foliage contains up to 1500 ?g/g Pb in non-tailings soil and 2800 ?g/g Pb in tailings-contaminated soil. For most elements analysed, there is a low contrast between bracken plants growing on tailings-contaminated and normal soil. This reflects the low bioavailability of these elements within the carbonate-rich tailings together with absorption thresholds imposed by plant metabolism. Plants growing on tailings-dominated substrates appear to be stressed by low bio-availability of trace elements (e. g. Mn) and nutrients (e. g. P, K), rather than metal toxicity. Metal uptake is higher in healthy, vigorously growing plants that are not rooted in tailings-dominated soil. The bio-availability of lead and other metals increases when: (i) tailings material is mechanically transported and mixed with soil; and (ii) relatively acidic groundwater dissolves tailings and transfers metals in solution into adjacent soil. Remedial action is required to limit further tailings erosion and acidification...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a multidisciplinary {{approach to the}} evaluation of a seismically triggered landslide {{that occurred in the}} Cerda area (Italy) on September 6, 2002, about 1 h after an earthquake took place in the south Tyrrhenian Sea. The study was focused on an analysis {{of the role of the}} seismic input in triggering the landslide, in view of the evidence that no other mass movement was recorded in the adjacent areas despite geological and geomorphological spatial homogeneity. The studied area is located on a slope of the western flank of the Fiume Imera Settentrionale (Northern Sicily), which is made up of clayey–arenitic rocks. The slope inclines gently but is not uniform due to fluvial, gravitative, and <b>rainwash</b> processes. Field data dealing with global positioning system (GPS), geology, geomorphology, geophysics (vertical electrical sounding, or VES), and geochemistry (soil gas fluxes and composition) were acquired and analysed in order to investigate the cause–effect relationships between the earthquake and the mass movement. The GPS survey allowed us to map the ground failures that have also been classified on the basis of their kinematical meaning (i. e., compressive, distensive, or transcurrent structures). The geological analysis revealed outcropping rocks and tectonic structures. The geomorphologic survey highlighted the presence of preexisting landslide bodies. The geophysical survey detected a buried surface located at a depth of about 100 m. Finally, the geochemical survey showed that the gas released from the displaced mass came from a shallow depth and was not related to any active fault system. The abovementioned information allowed us to interpret the landslide event as a partial reactivation of a preexisting landslide body that was triggered by the earthquake...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{characteristics of}} fluorescence components in CDOM for lakes in the semi-arid region of Northeast China were examined by excitation-emission matrices fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Two humic-like peaks C 1 (Ex/Em = 230, 300 / 425 nm) and C 2 (Ex/Em = 255, 350 / 460 nm) and two protein-like B (Ex/Em = 220, 275 / 320 nm) and T (Ex/Em = 225, 290 / 360 nm) peaks were identified using PARAFAC. The average fluorescence {{intensity of the}} four components differed with seasonal variation from June and August 2013 to February and April 2014. The total fluorescence intensity significantly varied from 2. 54 ± 0. 68 nm − 1 in June to the mean value 1. 93 ± 0. 70 nm − 1 in August 2013, and then increased to 2. 34 ± 0. 92 nm − 1 in February and reduced to the lowest 1. 57 ± 0. 55 nm − 1 in April 2014. In general, the fluorescence intensity was dominated by peak C 1, indicating that most part of CDOM for inland waters being investigated {{in this study was}} originated from phytoplankton degradation. The lowest C 2 represents {{only a small portion of}} CDOM from terrestrial imported organic matter to water bodies through <b>rainwash</b> and soil leaching. The two protein-like intensities (B and T) formed in situ through microbial activity have almost the same intensity. Especially, in August 2013 and February 2014, the two protein-like peaks showed obviously difference from other seasons and the highest C 1 (1. 02 nm − 1) was present in February 2014. Components 1 and 2 exhibited strong linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 633). There were significantly positive linear relationships between CDOM absorption coefficients a(254) (R 2 = 0. 72, 0. 46, p < 0. 01), a(280) (R 2 = 0. 77, 0. 47, p R 2 = 0. 76, 0. 78, p F max for two humic-like components (C 1 and C 2), respectively. A close relationship (R 2 = 0. 931) was found between salinity and DOC. However, almost no obvious correlation was found between salinity and EEM-PARAFAC extracted components except for C 3 (R 2 = 0. 469). Results from this investigation demonstrate that the EEM-PARAFAC technique can be used to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of CDOM fluorescence components for inland waters in semi-arid regions of Northeast China...|$|E
40|$|Nous présentons ici une méthode simple qui {{permet de}} mesurer simultanément l'eau et les sédiments en transit à la surface du sol en milieu agricole. Des hydrogrammes de ruissellement superficiel sont comparés pour évaluer la variabilité saisonnière et spatiale du ruissellement et de l'érosion lors de trois précipitations naturelles (1, 16, 1, 76, 1, 78 mm h- 1). Les mesures ponctuelles sur le terrain sont utilisées pour caler une équation de {{transport}} des sédiments compatible avec les modèles hydrologiques distribués. Le débit solide (Qs) est exprimé par:Qs = k Qm lpoù Q est le débit liquide et l l'intensité des précipitations. Les hydrogrammes montrent que les débits varient dans l'espace selon la distance entre deux points d'échantillonnage et, dans le temps selon l'état de la surface. Pendant la saison, la concentration moyenne des sédiments dans l'eau et le taux de transport demeurent constants. Le transport par le ruissellement sur la parcelle est faible et semble limité par la capacité du processus à maintenir les sédiments en mouvement. Ce comportement affecte le paramètre m associé au débit liquide dans l'équation de transport, qui est en dessous des valeurs théoriques proposées dans la littérature. Le transport de sédiments est également fonction de l, qui par le biais de l'impact des gouttes de pluie sur la surface détache et facilite le transport des particules. Data are needed to validate a storm by storm model of sheetwash erosion, to assess spatial and temporal variations of runoff and erosion and to calibrate a sediment transport equation on agricultural fields. This remains {{a major problem in}} the development of distributed hydrological models. This paper presents a simple method to measure simultaneously water and sediment discharges on hillslopes. Hillslope hydrographs and sediment transport rates are used to investigate spatial and seasonal variations in runoff and erosion. Measurements are also used to calibrate a sheetwash sediment transport equation compatible with distributed hydrological models. Sediment discharge (Qs) is expressed by :Qs = k Qm lpwhere Q is water discharge, S is hillslope gradient and l rainfall intensity. Parameters k, m, n and p are constants for a given context. The experimental site is located in the Eastern Townships (Québec, Canada). It is a corn field (1 000 m 2) where sheetwash erosion is active. Simultaneous measurements of water and sediment discharges are collected using hydraulically efficient samplers specially designed to minimize direct rainsplash input and to prevent sediment accumulation within the receptacle. Data were collected during three natural rainfalls with low average intensities monitored in June (l - 1, 76 mm h- 1), September (l = 1, 78 mm h- 1) and October (l = 1, 16 mm h- 1) 1987. Because rainfall intensity varies within a precipitation, each rainfall event was subdivided into distinct measurement periods of short duration (5 to 60 min) with intensities ranging from 0, 12 to 8, 9 mm h- 1. For each precipitation two samplers were operated simultaneously over the field. One of the sampler occupied a fixed spatial location, which allows comparison between event according to variations in vegetation cover and soil compaction. The second sampler is located at a different location for each event in order to sample different spatial contexts. Overall 80 samples with a measurable amount of water and sediments were obtained. Firstly, our results show that peaks in sediment transport rates are in most cases associated with peaks of water discharges, which occur simultaneously or just after the maxima in rainfall intensities. For the first and second rainfall events similar hydrological and erosional responses of the field were observed at the two spatial locations. For there events, the distance between the two samplers on the field M short (respectively 7 and 4 meters). For a given event, the two hydrographs have the same shape, although the downslope hydrograph is target and there is a lag (5 min) between peak discharges. These characteristics suggest a kinematic response of runoff on the field. For the third precipitation, the two samplers are located 13 meters apart. There is an important diminution of runoff and erosion downslope. The inversion of the size (volume of water) of the hydrographs is attributed to the divergence of runoff caused by the microtopography and the presence of obstacles on the surface. Over the season there is a difference in the hydrological response of the field. In September, the vegetation cover is dense and the mean infiltration and interception rates are high. Mean water and sediment discharges are low in comparison with those measured in June and October where the vegetation is sparse or absent (no interception). In October, the compaction of the soil surface is high and the infiltration capacity is low. Despite the tact that the mean rainfall intensity is slightly lower for this event, the highest amount of water and sediment discharges are observed. Average sediment concentration in water is constant for the three precipitation events. This suggests that the amount of loose sediments on the surface ready to be transported is always sufficient. The comparison of hill slope hydrographs on the field and at different times showed that water and sediment vary : i) in space according to slope length between sampling locations, and; ii) over the season according to vegetation cover and soil surface properties. Secondly, parameters of the sediment transport equation are estimated for the three events. The results show that water discharge and rainfall intensity are positively related with sediment discharge, but also that the effect of hillslope gradient is negligible. This is {{explained by the fact that}} only four low gradient values are used in this study and that a wide range of discharges are measured on each gradient. The overall measurements yields the empirical equationQs = 0, 02 Q 0, 97 l 0, 6 There is a good agreement between water discharge, rainfall intensity and sediment transport (R 2 = 0, 91). Over the season, variation in mean discharges are not followed by fluctuations in the rate of sediment discharge which remained constant for the three events. Sediment transport appears to be low and under the limit of transport for <b>rainwash</b> erosion. As a result, the rate of increase in sediment transport (m = 0, 97) is under the lower limit of the theoretical range of values (from 1, 4 to 2, 4) proposed in literature. Sediment discharge is also influenced by the contribution of rainsplash to particle detachment and transport. This process is evaluated by the incorporation of rainfall intensity into the sediment transport equation. The value obtained from the empirical estimation of p (0, 6) is not significantly different from the theoretical value (p = 0, 5) proposed in the literature. The contribution of rainfall intensity to the prediction of sediment transport is low but significant. In conclusion, results of this experiment show that spatially and temporally distributed data can be used to increase our knowledge on runoff and erosion at the scale of an agricultural field. The rote of low rainfall intensities on runoff and erosion is also important despite the presence of vegetation. These events contribute to the transfer of particles downslope and they increase the amount of loose sediments ready to be transported on the surface. Notwithstanding the fact that the net erosion on the field is negligible, sediment transport is active and predictable using a simple sediment transport equation...|$|E
40|$|Mounds {{built in}} {{pastures}} by the subterranean ant Lasius flavus {{often have a}} vegetation which differs markedly from their surroundings. I set out to compare the relative abundances of plant species on and off ant-hills in some grasslands in southern Britain, and to define those characteristics of species which mainly determine their success or failure on the mounds. Large ant-hills and the surrounding grassland ware sampled in detail at five acid grassland sites in the Gower peninsula, Glamorgan, and thirteen chalk grassland and chalk heath sites in southern Britain. Mounds were often dominated by perennials which could grow up through heaped soil, like Polytrichum piliferum, P. juniperinum on the Gower and Thymus drucei and Helianthemum chamaeciatus on the chalk. Annuals such as Aira praecox and Arenaria serpyllifolia were frequently confined to ant-hills. However, many species, especially rosette or semi-rosette hemicryptophytes, were consistently uncommon on ant-hills, including Luzula campestris, Cirsium acaule, Poterium sanguisorba and Felipendula vulgaris. The pleurocarpous mosses Pleurozium schreberi and Pseudo-scleropodium purum were more abundant on north-facing than south-facing aspects of the mounds. Two main factors influenced plant patterns. Firstly, the heaping of soil over the plants by the ants often caused considerable seedling mortality. Secondly, species differed {{in their ability to}} disperse 'seed' onto the mounds. When I compared the viable 'seed' 'banks' present in equal weights and surface areas of ant-hill and pasture soils, by keeping the samples moist and counting the emergent seedlings, the 'seeds' of those species uncommon on ant-hills were much less frequent in ant-hill than pasture soil. Most seedlings on the mounds probably result from 'seed' dispersal onto the mound surfaces. Soil analyses show no large and consistent differences in nutrient concentrations between ant-hill and pasture soils and thus it seems unlikely that nutrient levels greatly influence the striking distributions of many species. The vegetation on and off two hundred and six wounds {{of a wide range of}} size and activity was recorded in detail on a 1. 2 ha plot at Aston Rowant N. N. R., Oxon. Mapping showed that species rarely occurred on ant-hills when they were absent from the sward nearby. From scatter diagrams of the abundance of each species in relation to ant-hill volume and ant activity on a mound, it was possible to deduce how succession of some species on ant-hills might occur, if ant-hill volume were proportional to ant-hill age. The following hypothesis is consistent with the evidence. 'Young' mounds are heaps of soil which smother existing vegetation. They are invaded in particular by Festuca rubra, Lotus corniculatus, Carex flacca, Leontodon hispidus and Helianthemum chamaecistus (if in the sward nearby). Thymus drucei invades the mounds vegetatively as they expand in basal area, and gradually becomes a more important component of the vegetation. Carex flacca and Hieracium pilosella rosettes become restricted to the edges of ant-hills because the continual heaping of soil onto the tops of the mounds causes their burial and death there. However, Leontodon hispidus and Plantago lanceolata, often present inside the margins of medium and large mounds, set abundant seed there and their seedlings sometimes become established on the bare soil on top. By this time, the summits of ant-hills tend to be occupied by Helianthemum chamaecistus and Thymus drucei, which can grow up through the heaped soil. Small mounds are often deserted by the ant colony. Their vegetation becomes closed and the relative abundances of species approach those of the surrounding sward more closely than on active ant-hills of the same volume. In the absence of burial, Carex flacca, Leontodon hispidus, Plantago lanceolata, Hieracium pilosella become established over the whole surface; H. pilosella rosettes are far more dense on abandoned mounds than active ones of the same size. When mounds are abandoned the chambers and channels disappear, organic natter accumulates, an A 0 horizon is formed and the previously structureless soil becomes aggregated into peds. The life cycles of the species with the most marked patterns la relation to ant-hills were studied more fully in field and laboratory experiments. The species characteristic of ant-hills usually have either vigorous vegetative growth when smothered, the ability to flower on the mounds in too year after germination or both. For instance, established plants of Helianthemum chamaecistus and Thymus drucei, woody chamaephytes which often dominate ant-hills, can grow up through 3 - 4 cm of suddenly-heaped soil. Yet they rarely establish themselves from seed on the mounds. In Arenaria serpyllifolia, Veronica arvensis and other winter annuals, the flowers are predominantly self-pollinated, seed-set is high, the seeds are light (60 - 270 ug) and inhibited from germinating under only 5 mm of soil, a high proportion (40) of those released onto the mounds germinate each year, and the seedlings rapidly decline in number. For instance, a cohort of 2078 seedlings of Arenaria serpyllifolia followed from August 1971 to July 1972 had a half-life of 0. 14 years, the seedlings dying from rabbit-scraping, soil heaping, self-thinning, fungal infection, <b>rainwash</b> and so on. Nevertheless, almost every surviving seedling flowered in the late spring of the first year. The minute seed weights of these species are insufficient to allow them to become established in closed vegetation. Their seeds may be inhibited from germinating under swards by the higher ratio of far red to red light there; Arenaria serpyllifolia, Veronica arvensis and Myosotis ramosissima seeds did not germinate under two layers of Tilia leaves in a laboratory experiment. Cerastium holosteoides resembles Thymus and Helianthemum in being a perennial chamaephyte able to grow up through newly-heaped soil to some extent, and resembles the winter annuals in flowering the year after germination and producing abundant small (180 ug) seeds which hardly germinate under two layers of Tilia leaves. The species with roughly equal abundances on and off ant-hills are frequently stoloniferous and able to grow up through heaped soil to some degree (e. g. Agrostis stolonifera, Festuca rubra, Campanula rotundifolia, Galium verum) or short-lived and able to flower on the mounds (e. g. Euphrasia officinalis agg, Gentianella amarella, Linum catharicum and Medicago lupulina). All the species which are considerably more abundant in the sward than on the mounds are perennials, with very slow vegetative reproduction. Thus they depend on invasion by seed to become established on ant-hills. Only a small proportion of the rosettes in the sward flower each year, the flowers are cross-pollinated, the fruits are comparatively heavy (600 - 4000 ug), the seedlings are susceptible to burial, their development on the mounds is slow and they do not flower within the first two years. Their seedlings are robust enough to establish themselves in swards. Nevertheless, within this framework, the factors affecting their abundances on the mounds differ from species to species. For instance, in Cirsium acaule the number of fruits produced is reduced to 10 - 14 per capitulum per year by the weather, predation and parasitism. Their dispersal is hindered by the high frequency of pappi lost before dispersal, the heavy achenes and the weather. The production of vigorous seedlings on the mounds may be affected by fungal parasitism, and their survival is probably poor because they are susceptible to burial. Seedling development is slow on ant-hills and no flowering plants were seen there. In Leontodon hispidus, however, dispersal of achenes onto the mounds is efficient, and 5 - 9 of achenes germinate on ant-hills, so that seedlings are frequent on the mounds in autumn. Seedlings develop slowly, remain avail, and are susceptible to burial, but mature rosettes inside the perimeter of active ant-hills often flower profusely and reproduce vegetatively. Thus Leontodon maintains larger populations on ant-hills than Poterium sanguisorba, and Cirsium acaule. On the other hand, Carex flacca maintains high densities of rosettes around the edges of 'active' ant-hills because of vigorous vegetative reproduction; reproduction from seed is negligible. Poterium sanguisorba and Plantago lanceolata were also investigated. Thus the ant-hill environment acts as a sieve, letting through those species which can flower early on or grow up through heaped soil, and excluding those which cannot flower on the mounds, with poor dispersal and low seedling development. The flora of 'active' ant-hills is maintained at a lower stage of succession than the surrounding vegetation by the constant addition of soil to the surface. The vegetation resembles that of fixed calcareous dunes and of Breckland grass-heath before myxomatosis, two cowaunities in which sand movements also provide an element of environmental 'unpredictability'. Those species which invest a high proportion of their total net assimilation in reproduction ere pre-adapted to colonise and maintain themselves on ant-hills. Those species selected for efficiency in maintaining themselves in a closed community, with heavy fruits and an inability to flower early in life, cannot maintain themselves at a high density in a community of an earlier successional stage. </p...|$|E
