The subscriber then inspects {{the contents of the}} response, and if it references a hub, the subscriber can subscribe to that resource's URL (it's called a 'topic' by the spec) on that hub. The subscriber needs to run a web accessible server so that hubs can directly notify it when any of its subscribed topics have updated, using a webhook mechanism.|$|R

A webpage is a document or resource of information that is suitable for the World Wide Web and can be accessed through a web browser and displayed on {{a computer}} screen. This information is usually in HTML format, and may provide navigation to other webpage’s via hypertext links. WebPages may be <b>retrieved</b> <b>from</b> a local computer or <b>from</b> a remote <b>HTTP</b> Server. WebPages are requested and served <b>from</b> <b>HTTP</b> Servers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). WebPages may consist of files of static or dynamic text stored within the HTTP Server's file system. Client-side scripting can make WebPages more responsive to user input once in the client browser.

We analyzed a 1 -h sample of peak network traffic from our campus network and selected the hosts which initiated both HTTP and HTTPS connections. User-Agents <b>from</b> <b>HTTP</b> connections and cipher suite lists (from HTTPS connections) from the same client created a new pair. We observed 10, 890 clients communicating on both protocols {{in a short period of}} time, 305 unique cipher suite lists, and 5043 unique User-Agents. In total, we derived 12, 832 unique pairs during the measurement.|$|R
