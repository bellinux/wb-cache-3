This was evident 3 to 4 hr. after raunescine administration. There was no general increase in the noradrenaline content of the brains. In the intestine, raunescine depleted the 5 -hydroxytryptamine content by about 50 % within 3 to 4 hr. if the animals had been pre-treated with iproniazid. Iproniazid did not increase the content of noradrenaline in the intestine...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{increase}} use of alkaloids in general medical practice in recent years, it is of interest to determine genotoxic, mutagenic and recombinogenic response to different groups of alkaloids in prokaryotic and eucaryotic organisms. Reserpine, boldine and chelerythrine did not show genotoxicity response in the SOS-Chromotest whereas skimmianine showed genotixicity {{in the presence of}} a metabolic activation mixture. Voacristine isolated fromthe leaves of Ervatamia coronaria shows in vivo cytostatic and mutagenic effects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae hapioids cells. The <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloid</b> (reserpine) was not able to induce reverse mutation and recombinational mitotic events (crossing-over and gene conversion) in yeast diploid strain XS 2316...|$|E
40|$|The didemnins are a {{class of}} macrocyclic depsipeptides that were {{isolated}} from a Caribbean tunicate of the family Didemnidae. Recently, the isolation and characterization of tamandarin A from an unclassified didemnid was reported. While the chemical structure and cellular activity of tamandarin A is {{comparable to that of}} didemnin B, the two metabolites have not yet been shown to exhibit a common biochemical and ecological function. The research described herein makes use of fluorescent probes to gain insight into the biological activity of these depsipeptides. Fluorescent didemnin and tamandarin analogs were prepared and were employed in an ecological study to determine the effect of these metabolite analogs on established predator-prey relationships. ^ Pondaplin is a novel cyclic prenylated phenylpropanoid isolated from Annona glabra, which is commonly referred to as pond apple. Research described herein is aimed at developing efficient approaches to structures of this type, which garner interest due to the strain inherent in these molecular architectures. The results of a variety of synthetic strategies are discussed. Additionally, the properties of the pondaplin dimer and trimer are investigated. ^ The yohimbines, members of the <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloid</b> family, have attracted a great deal of synthetic interest over the years due to the interesting structures and diverse biological activities of these alkaloids. For some time, it has been known that tryptophan and ninhydrin can be condensed to provide a pentacyclic indole heterocycle bearing a carbon skeleton reminiscent of yohimbane. However, the details of this transformation, including the mechanism, have remained unclear. A simple structural modification has allowed the isolation of a reaction intermediate. This intermediate may be independently converted to the yohimbanone product. We propose a mechanism for this novel rearrangement that is in accord with the known reactivity of ninhydrin. The yohimbanone skeleton has been converted via an oxidative ring opening to a 1 -aroyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate. Compounds of this type {{have been shown to be}} antagonists of benzodiazepines in vivo. ...|$|E

40|$|TRANQUILIZING drugs, {{like most}} others, may act as allergens. Three classes of tranquilizing drugs {{have been widely}} used and {{allergic}} reactions reported from their use. These classes of drugs are: (a) the phenothiazine derivatives, notably chlorpromazine, (b) the <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> notably reserpine, and (c) the substituted propanediols or butanediols, notably meprobamate. In the case of the first and third classes of drugs, allergic reactions account for the major complications encountered...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} six <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids</b> {{on the growth}} {{inhibitory}} effect of vinblastine (VBL) in rat ascites hepatoma AH 66 cells was investigated. When cells were treated with VBL and each alkaloid for 30 min, reserpine, rescinnamine, syrosingopine, and ajmaline markedly potentiated the effect of VBL, but dimethylaminoethylreserplinate hydrochloride (DMAR) and yohimbine did not influence. On the other hand, in the continuous treatment for 2 d, DMAR and yohimbine also potentiated the effect of VBL. All of alkaloids increased the intracellular VBL content. Among these alkaloids, reserpine markedly suppressed the activities of Mg^ ATPase and Ca^ ATPase in the plasma membrane and DMAR suppressed the activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) except (Na^+-K^+) ATPase. Reserpine and DMAR {{did not affect the}} VBL binding to microtubules. Reserpine inhibited the microtubule polymerization by itself and synergistically acted with VBL on microtubules but DMAR did not affect the polymerization and the effect of VBL. From the results, it was indicated that all of <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids</b> suppressed the active extrusion of VBL, increased the intracellular VBL content, and potentiated the effect of VBL on AH 66 cells. Moreover, it was suggested that some of alkaloids including reserppine could enhance the effect of VBL even by a short term treatment because of their synergistical interaction with VBL on microtubules...|$|R
40|$|The root of Rauwolfia serpentina Benth {{has been}} used in India from century. The genus name was {{selected}} in honor of Dr. Leonhard Rauwolf, a 16 thcentury German botanist, Physician & explorer. Rauwolfia serpentina is a large climbing/twining herb or shrub, belonging to family Apocynaceae and found in the Assam, Pegu, Himalayas, Java, Tennasserim, Deccan, Peninsula, Bihar and the Malay Peninsula. Reserpine is the principle <b>alkaloid</b> of <b>Rauwolfia</b> serpentina and has its clinical application with success to the treatment of high blood pressure. Much smaller dose of Reserpine is required to obtain the antihypertensive action. The root was believed to stimulate uterine contraction and recommended for use in child-birth in difficult cases. The juice of the leaves {{has been used}} as a remedy for opacity of the cornea. The present review focuses mainly on chemistry and antihypertensive effect of <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The iridium-catalyzed {{isomerization}} Claisen rearrangement (ICR) methodology {{developed in}} theNelson group has provided {{access to a}} broad range of diastereomerically enricheddisubstituted unsaturated aldehydes. Allylsilyl aldehydes produced by the ICR reaction havebeen further elaborated into substrates for highly diastereoselective intramolecular Hosomi-Sakurai annulation reactions. The Sakurai annulation has proven to be particularly powerfulwhen carried out in tandem with intramolecular aldol or Mannich reactions to form complexfused ring systems. An attempted strategic application of this methodology to the synthesis ofthe <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids</b> reserpine and yohimbine is detailed. Vinyl boronic esters have been demonstrated to be effective precursors for the ICRreaction providing diastereomerically enriched boronic aldehydes. The potential forintramolecular chelation between the newly formed aldehyde and proximal boronic ester hasbeen investigated. The boron functionality has proven to be useful for accessing alkoxy- andaryl-substituted compounds that are typically unavailable from the ICR reaction. A synthesis ofthe plant growth inhibitor penieone has been explored in order to demonstrate the practicalapplication of this methodology to complex molecule construction...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{reserpine}} releases bound serotonin and norepinephrine throughout the body, and thereby lowers the content of these amines in brain and peripheral tissues. The ques-tion arises whether the central actions of reser-pine {{are associated with the}} change in brain sero-tonin or with the change in brain norepinephrine, for the drug decreases the levels of these amines in rabbit brain at the same rate, to the same ex-tent, and for the same period of time (Brodie et a!., 1957). Proof of which amine determines the central actions of reserpine might be provided by investigation of a drug that releases only one of the brain amines. K#{ 228 }rkiand Paasonen (1959) concluded that depletion of brain norepinephrine is responsible for the central actions of the <b>Rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> Their experiments indicate that reserpine and raunescine decrease the level of norepinephrine more than the level of serotonin, and that the sedative action of raunescine is linked with the reduction in norepinephrine content. Pletscher et at. (1959) drew a similar conclusion from studies of the benzoquinolizine derivatives, Ro 4 - 1284 (compound I) and Ro 4 - 1398 (compound II). Our results show that reserpine, raunescine, and compounds I and II do not selectively release norepinephrine or serotonin in brain; hence {{it is not possible to}} associate the sedation produced ‘Some of the findiigs have been presented in...|$|R
40|$|During 1979 the National Drugs Advisory Board {{received}} 474 {{reports from}} which 873 side-effects were recorded. These figures {{are less than}} previously, but considering the problems accompanying the postal strike the National Drugs Advisory Board was pleased' that so many practitioners continued to maintain contact. Eight of the reports concerned interactions between drugs. The complicated interaction between amitriptyline and <b>rauwolfia</b> <b>alkaloids</b> emphasises the difficulty that can arise with multiple therapy, in this case each drug nullified the desired effect of the other. The use of additional therapy with the anticoagulant warfarin always requires great caution {{as shown by the}} interaction with carbimazole resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time. Eighteen deaths were reported in association with the use of drugs. Two cases of hepatic failure occurred, one with an antidepressant and one with perhexiline. There was another case of cardiac asystole following the use of salbutamol by inhalation and 2 cases of myocardial infarction, one of these secondary to coma induced by a relative overdose of antidepressant. Four of the deaths were related to infants with congenital abnormalities. In view of the difficulty in obtaining information on the precise timing of the medications it is impossible to assign a relationship to the drug ingestion with any great certainty. The National Drugs Advisory Board can only reiterate its firm recommendation that no medication should be used in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy unless it is absolutely essential. There was one death in an older woman who was sensitive to. sulphonamides and developed an erythroderma with indapamide, this progressed to an exfoliative dermatitis and was complicated by a myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation and consequent brain damage. Lithium Carbonate has been known to have as one of its pharmacological actions, a capacity to inhibit antidiuretic hormone. However recent reports suggest that the drug may also have a more direct effect on renal tubules even at acceptable plasma levels of drug. The National Drugs Advisory Board has received one report of renal insufficiency {{associated with the use of}} lithium carbonate. It is recommended that in addition to frequent and regular assays of serum lithium, creatinine clearance and serum creatinine should also be checked. One study has suggested that a reasonably simple screening procedure is the assessment of renal concentrating ability or osmolality regularly to detect progressive change. The case of fatal aplastic anaemia reported in association with long term use of a product containing propyphenazone has stimulated the reformulation of the product to exclude this ingredient. Products available without prescription should not contain ingredients capable of producing such serious side-effects. Ibuprofen which has been on the market for about 10 years was claimed for a long time to be free of any capacity to affect peptic ulceration or induce haematemesis. The present reports suggest that these side effects can occur especially with long term use. In addition the National Drugs Advisory Board has had reports of 4 cases of thrombocytoperia, one of which was fatal. Until now relatively few cases have been reported in the literature and it is uncertain whether this is a direct toxic effect or an allergic reaction...|$|R
