5000|$|The {{preliminary}} Danish investigation determined {{this latest}} Q400 incident is {{unrelated to the}} airline's earlier corrosion problems, {{in this particular case}} caused by a misplaced o-ring found blocking the orifice in the <b>restrictor</b> <b>valve.</b> [...] Accordingly, EASA announced that [...] "...the Scandinavian airworthiness authorities will reissue the Certificates of Airworthiness relevant to this aircraft type in the coming days".|$|E
5000|$|On October 27, 2007, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2867 {{en route}} from Bergen to Copenhagen had severe {{problems}} with the landing gear during landing in Kastrup Airport. The right wing gear did not deploy properly (or partially), and the aircraft skidded off the runway in a controlled emergency landing. The Q400 was carrying 38 passengers, two infants and four crew members on board. No injuries were reported. The next day, SAS permanently removed its entire Dash 8 Q400 fleet from service. In a press release on October 28, 2007, the company's president said: [...] "Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying {{in this type of}} aircraft. Accordingly, with the Board of Directors' approval, I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service." [...] The preliminary Danish investigation determined the latest Q400 incident was unrelated to the airline's earlier corrosion problems, in this particular case caused by a misplaced O-ring found blocking the orifice in the <b>restrictor</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{device for}} {{enhancing}} {{the detection of}} malignant tissue in the breasts of a woman was described. A brassiere-like garment which is fitted {{with a pair of}} liquid-perfused cooling panels which completely and compliantly cover the breasts and upper torso was studied. The garment is connected by plastic tubing to a liquid cooling system comprising a fluid pump, a solenoid control valve for controlling the flow of fluid to either the cooling unit or the heating unit, a fluid reservoir, a temperature sensor in the reservoir, and a <b>restrictor</b> <b>valve</b> to control the pressure in the garment inlet cooling line...|$|E
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate as}} one-way <b>restrictor</b> <b>valves</b> that limit {{the volume of}} fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm {{engagement}} without being too fast for the drive train to handle since clutches can quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. The clutch delay valve slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock {{in the event that}} an inexperienced driver quickly engaged the clutch at higher revs.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} in the system must be maintained from the pump right through the pressure vessel. In smaller systems (up to about 10 mL / min) a simple restrictor can be used. This can be either a capillary tube cut to length, or a needle valve which can be adjusted to maintain pressure at different flow rates. In larger systems a back pressure regulator will be used, which maintains pressure upstream of the regulator {{by means of a}} spring, compressed air, or electronically driven valve. Whichever is used, heating must be supplied, as the adiabatic expansion of the CO2 results in significant cooling. This is problematic if water or other extracted material is present in the sample, as this may freeze in the <b>restrictor</b> or <b>valve</b> and cause blockages.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on a commercial Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube. Ranque-Hilsch vortex tubes have many applications in industry and production as they can generate a very cold flow just from pressurized air. e. g. machine tool cooling. Main objective {{of this study is}} the energy separation in the flow field which results in a temperature drop on the cold exit of the tube. This was investigated experimentally by measuring the outlet temperature on the cold exit and the pressure drop on the flow <b>restrictor</b> <b>valve</b> on the hot exit. At a pressure drop of 0. 5 bar the vortex tube showed the best performance by reaching a cold exit temperature of – 16. 7 °C. The Inlet flow was pressurised air at 20 °C and 6 bar. The numerical analysis was carried out by full 3 D steady state CFD-simulation using the commercial software ANSYS CFX 11. 0. The three dimensional model represented a 120 ° sector of the tube using periodic boundary conditions. A comparison between different turbulence models (k – å, RNG k – å, k – ù, SST) was carried out. The classic k – å two layer turbulence model showed the best results compared to the experiment. The energy separation and the drop in cold exit temperature are highest when the viscous work term is included into the energy equation. These effects of including the viscous work term into the energy separation have also been investigated...|$|E
40|$|Impedance {{characteristics}} of hydraulic components have a signifcant efect on pressure ripple levels in hydraulic circuits. These pressure ripples lead to vibration of pipework and associatedfittings {{and are a}} source of unreliability and noise. This paper describes an experimental investigation of restrictor and flow control valves using a specially designed circuit. For a <b>restrictor</b> <b>valve,</b> {{it was found that the}} impedance characteristics were influenced by fluid compressibility, fluid inertia, valve vibration and downstream impedance effects. When these effects were taken into account, the valve could be modelled as a simple orijice. The impedance {{characteristics of}} a flow control valve were found to be more complex and wave propagation within the valve fluid passageway had a dominant effect on behaviour.
