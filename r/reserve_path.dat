40|$|Communication network constructions {{based on}} the {{synchronous}} digital hierarchy (SDH) are widely used in design and operation of telephone networks and data transfer ones {{on the basis of}} dedicated links. The providing the link for data transmission from one node to another one is a nontrivial objective. The network equipment vendors, as a rule, may provide also a network system control. However, these systems can be used only with the manufacturer's equipment, but are not intended for finding the optimal paths for the current network operation. They serve for examination to choose a network structure at the stage of its development or modernization for the known in advance matrix of connections. From the practice it is seen that the real networks structures use diverse equipment. Therefore to develop a complex to find the paths in SDH-based network is a challenge. Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to find the shortest network path routings in the complex. The use of the classical algorithm is impossible because of the restrictions in providing main and reserve links. There are multiplex sections with no routes to be expected. Such restriction is due to real arrangement of some multiplex sections in the same cables, but in different fibres. When providing the main link, the appropriate structuring sections should be preferable. For example, the link E 3 (34 Mbit/s) can pass only across the section of relevant configuration. The reserve link cannot pass across those multiplex sections where the main link has passed. This rule is not 'extra' considering the first restriction since the main and reserve link sections cannot crisscross the node. At the dead ends reserving has no sense, and the reserve link has to coincide with the main one to save a multiplex section resource of terminal switching. In implementation all these restrictions have been taken into consideration. In addition to the path routings, complex enables saving information on the network nodes, sections, and links in database (DB) i. e., actually, it represents a DB with graphic interface, thereby allowing an operator to have rapid information on its state. Thus, the developed software complex enables finding the main and <b>reserve</b> <b>path</b> routes for the links in structurally complicated SDH network, taking into account the restrictions due to real network features, and an operator of Moscow Fiber Optic Network, Joint-Stock Company "KOMKOR" actively uses it. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Forging IP source {{addresses}} (spoofing) is {{a common}} technique to conceal the origin of a network level attack in today’s best effort IP networks. In the future, IP spoofing may also directly interfere with service agreements used in quality of service (QoS) enabled IP networks because policing mechanisms located in the core cannot distinguish between malicious and benevolent packets. This reduces the reliability of real-time data delivery services offered by future multiservice networks. However, without true origin authentication at the network layer, usually access networks only can detect IP spoofing reliably, by using additional trust-by-wire information. We extend this concept to the core network by proposing a mechanism that prevents packets that have been spoofed from entering <b>reserved</b> <b>paths.</b> This reduces the probability of successful DoS attacks on guaranteed QoS in IP networks, and is a good protective measure applicable for critical IP network infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|Stable node-disjoint {{multipath}} {{route for}} quality communication {{is needed for}} {{the present state of}} mobile ad hoc networks. In on-demand routing protocol, data transmission was between source and destination through a single path. When node moves with high mobility and low signal strength, the single path broke and results in loss of data. To address the above problems, a Boundary level based Stable Node-disjoint Multipath QoS routing protocol (BLBMQR) is proposed for Mobile ad hoc networks. In this protocol the source node establishes multiple routes in a single route discovery process based on received signal strength. The proposed protocol considers only two node-disjoint routes. One was the active path (primary path) another one is the <b>reserve</b> active <b>path</b> (secondary path). These stability routes meet the QoS (Quality of Service) requirements such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and route life time. When the active path fails due to instability, a <b>reserve</b> active <b>path</b> will be utilized. A threshold limit for boundary level based on signal strength is fixed for stability purpose. When active path crosses the boundary level, the route automatically switch over to <b>reserve</b> active <b>path.</b> Simulation studies were carried out with different parameters such as node mobility speed and number of nodes and then compared with Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector Routing (AOMDV) routing protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and route life time.

40|$|Resource {{isolation}} of the computation and storage in the cloud is relatively mature, but the network resource is still shared among tenants leading to variable and unpredictable network performance when bandwidth guarantees are not enforced. Currently most of the bandwidth guarantee approaches {{are based on the}} idea of single-path reservation without fully exploiting the multipath resource, which leads to poor network utilization. In this paper, we propose a multi-path bandwidth guarantee approach called MultiBand, which provides bandwidth guarantees by allocating bandwidth across multiple paths. We utilize label-based routing technique to explicitly control the packets' transmission paths, and design a MHTB rate limiter model to split and schedule the traffic over the multiple <b>reserved</b> <b>paths.</b> Besides, Our Multiband solution has the work-conserving property. We evaluated our approach through simulations with realistic topologies and typical traffic patterns.

This paper examines {{the potential impact}} of U.

The "policy normalization shock" is defined as a shock that increases both the yield spread of U. S. long-term bonds and monetary policy expectations while leaving the policy rate per se unchanged. Results indicate that the impact of this shock on portfolio flows as a share of GDP is expected to be economically small. The estimated impact is closely in line with that seen during the end-May to August 2013 episode in response to a comparable rise in the yield spread of U. S. long-term bonds. However, as the events during the summer of 2013 have shown, relatively small changes in portfolio flows can be associated with significant financial turmoil in EMEs. Further, there is also a strong association between the countries that are identified by our model as being the most affected and the ones that saw greater outflows of portfolio capital over May to September 2013...|$|R

We use a con ict resolution approach according to which banyans make concurrent reservation oers of con ict-free paths to {{head of the line}} cells waiting in input buers.
