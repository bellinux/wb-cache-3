5|$|Once drained, stabilised and fertilised, Chat Moss became prime {{agricultural}} land, supplying Manchester with {{salad and}} other vegetables. The drainage channels, still required today, give the area its distinctive flat landscape broken up by ditches instead of hedges or walls.

5|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{reclaiming}} Chat Moss {{took place at the}} start of the 19th century. In 1793 William Roscoe began work on reclaiming the smaller Trafford Moss, now part of Trafford Park. By 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for Roscoe to enter into a lease of part of Chat Moss from the de Trafford family, but no <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> was carried out until 1805.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E

In 1954, the island was put up for auction just 3 years after the resort was opened and in 1972, the Singapore government bought Coney Island from a Thai businessman and planned to carry out land <b>reclamation</b> <b>works</b> with tentative plans to develop the island into a recreational venue with chalets, a beach and a marina. The land <b>reclamation</b> <b>works</b> begun in 1975, increasing {{the area of the}} island from 32 hectare km2 to 62 hectare km2.

25|$|In 1880, the Wellington Harbour Board was {{established}} to manage and develop the harbour and its facilities. From then <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> was divided between the Harbour Board, the Government and the City Council. Among major developments from 1880 to {{the turn of the}} century was the reclamation north of Pipitea Point for railways land and south of Queens Wharf to Te Aro by the City Council. This removed the last vestiges of private ownership of the foreshore, putting the waterfront under the control of the Harbour Board.|$|E
25|$|Whereas the {{original}} {{mouth of the}} Singapore River emptied into Singapore Straits and its southern islands before major land reclamation took place, the Singapore River now empties into Marina Bay - an area of water partially enclosed by the <b>reclamation</b> <b>work.</b> The Port of Singapore is now located {{to the west of}} the island, using most of the south-west coast, and passenger ships to Singapore now typically berth at the Singapore Cruise Centre at Harbourfront. Thus the Singapore River's economic role has shifted away from one that of trade, towards more a role accommodated for tourism and aesthetics for the commercial zone which encloses it.|$|E
25|$|A {{major step}} in the {{modernisation}} of Cairns was the construction of four modern high-rise apartment and hotel complex buildings between 1981 and 1983. Although regarded by some builders as not desirable or possible for the Cairns environment, such architecture heralded {{the start of the}} local high rise era. During this period the Queensland Government decided to issue two casino licences, one for the north of the state and one for the south. There were three major applications from developers in Cairns; the biggest involved <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> to create an artificial peninsula from the Esplanade for a marina, which was costed at $300 million. The majority in Cairns opposed these proposals, and demonstrated on the mudflats of Cairns Esplanade, led by the Mayor of Cairns, Keith Goodwin.

500|$|In the settlement's early days, Bell Hill {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to travel {{south of the city}} centre, and major excavation work was carried out to provide access to the south. A cutting was made in the hill in 1858, and during the 1860s the hill was lowered by some [...] The cutting allowed for the passage of transport between the two parts of the town. The southern flank of the hill was also completely removed (that area now being occupied by Queen's Gardens). The stone removed from the hill was used as construction material for many of the city's first permanent buildings, and also as fill to reclaim the northern end of the Southern Endowment {{along the edge of the}} harbour. This <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> added a considerable area to the central city; the original docks, close to the Exchange area of Princes Street, are now several hundred metres inland.|$|E
500|$|Refuse {{was carried}} on barges down the Manchester Ship Canal {{as far as}} Boysnope Wharf, where it was loaded onto a light railway system {{to be taken into}} the moss for dumping. Farmers on Chat Moss were legally {{required}} by their tenancy agreements to accept a specified amount of refuse on their land, and were even obliged to pay for it. Farmers could themselves undertake <b>reclamation</b> <b>work,</b> with the land reclaimed being incorporated into their tenancies. An agreement dated 1905, between Manchester Corporation and Plant Cottage Farm, shows that the corporation agreed to [...] of refuse per acre free of charge for the first year, with the tenant being obliged to accept [...] of refuse per acre each year thereafter.

500|$|Continuing land {{reclamation}} {{and control of}} the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by improvement. Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the Middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey. Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed [...] of meadow recovered around the [...] "island" [...] of Sowy; from the accounts in the Abbey's rent books, this had increased to [...] by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came {{under the control of the}} Crown, particularly King's Sedgemoor, which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey, with Henry VI's Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for land improvements. Further <b>reclamation</b> <b>work</b> was carried out over the next 500years. In 1597, [...] of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later [...] near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; three further reclamations, totalling , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660.

40|$|Abstract. The {{specific}} {{land reclamation}} {{system is a}} technical and economical subsystem of evidence and systematic inventory of all real estate in the land reclamation in Romania. The evidence and inventory of land reclamation {{have an important role}} in the implementation of sectoral and local strategies. This paper aims at achieving such an evidence system, appropriate land <b>reclamation</b> <b>works</b> (control of soil erosion and control of excessive moisture) of perimeter Cojocna of USAMV Cluj-Napoca by building an informational system specific for this field. This system has to be compatible with regulations of the General Cadastre from Romania and with the current methodological rules. Spatial and tabular database will be built using any information obtained from earlier land reclamation projects for this area, with help of old and new maps and with topographic measurements. This specific informational system of land reclamation will be using ArcGIS software to represent the obtained spatial and tabular data. The objective to pursue is to obtain a complex digital plan for the studied area, which will help in studying the behavior of land <b>reclamation</b> <b>works</b> and for planning new land <b>reclamation</b> <b>works...</b>|$|R
