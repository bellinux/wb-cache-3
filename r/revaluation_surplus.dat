40|$|There {{are some}} {{different}} opinions among Commercial Law, Tax Law and Acoounting Principles concering the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> of assets and Capital Surplus. Tax Law agrees with Accounting Principles on {{a view that}} the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> of current assets is essentially a profit. The question is on the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> of fixed assets. Tax Law has a opinion that the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> of fixed assets is a profit and charges 6 % tax on it. On the contrary, Acoounting Principles regard it as Capital Surplus. It seems that the difference of both opinions is due to each view of Capital, and this writer dare to try a proposition to settle the question...|$|E

Opinion 23, as amended, relates specifically to differences between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary (referred to as an "outside basis difference"). This Issue relates to inside basis differences of an Italian subsidiary of a U. S. parent where the local currency is the functional currency. In Italy, fixed assets are occasionally restated for tax purposes {{to compensate for the}} effects of inflation. The amount that offsets the increase in the tax basis of fixed assets is described as a credit to "revaluation surplus, " which some view as a component of equity for tax purposes. That amount becomes taxable in certain situations, such as {{in the event of a}} liquidation of the Italian subsidiary or if the earnings associated with the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> are distributed. For purposes of this Issue, it is assumed that no mechanisms are available under the tax law to avoid eventual treatment of the <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> as taxable income.

In this paper we aim to capture the accounting treatment established under the laws in force in 2017. We will present ways of determining the reassessment differences and their implications on determining the tax on buildings (only tangible assets as buildings). We will also present the way to register the added value (<b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus)</b> or minus value (amortization on reassessment) and {{the treatment of the}} revaluation reserve (surplus from reassessment recorded in account the 105 “Reserve from reassessment”) in accounting. Comparing the laws in force and those of IAS 16, we conclude that the accounting treatment related to the revaluation of tangible assets is similar. There remain unusable for the entities that do not apply IFRS in Romania: permanent reassessment of the duration of use and amortization method. Throughout the paper we will present the tax treatment of reassessment through corporate tax implications. Therefore, we will consider that the entities to which we refer are in the category of corporate tax payers and not in that of microenterprises. They no longer feel the influence of corporate tax because are taxed on income and not at the fiscal result (1...|$|E

Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (estimate of future cash flows the entity expects to derive from the asset). An impairment cost under the revaluation model is treated as a revaluation decrease (decrease of other comprehensive income) {{to the extent of}} previous <b>revaluation</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Any loss that takes the asset below historical depreciated cost is recognised in the income statement.|$|R

40|$|Given {{the rapidly}} growing {{reserves}} in Asia (China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) and the pressures from trading partners to revalue, {{there is a need}} to examine commercial policy in more than a pure barter model. Here we evaluate the joint impacts of exchange rate appreciation on trade flows and country surpluses using a general equilibrium trade model with a simple monetary structure in which the trade surplus is endogenously determined in the exchange rate setting country and the exchange rate is exogenous. We illustrate its application to the Chinese case using calibration to 2005 data. Our results, while elasticity dependent, suggest that the impacts of Renminbi (RMB) <b>revaluation</b> on the <b>surplus</b> are proportionally larger than on trade flows, and that changes in trade flows can be substantial. Different treatments of China's processing trade have small impact on changes in China's trade flow under RMB appreciation, but significant impacts on the change in the surplus. Results are elasticity dependent; larger substitution elasticities in preferences yield larger effects on trade flows and the surplus.

40|$|Prior {{studies in}} Malaysia {{indicate}} that fair value of investment properties are not value relevant in various industries. Unlike those industries, Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts (MREITs) is a capital-intensive industry where the investment properties {{made up the}} majority of the MREITs total assets. Furthermore this industry is subjected to stringent monitoring by the Securities Commission (SC) which requires MREITs to adopt the fair value model and revalue their investment properties for at least once in every three years. Therefore, results from previous studies cannot be generalized to this industry. Hence, this study investigates whether fair value on investment properties is value relevant in the MREIT industry. It also examines the effect of board characteristics on the share prices of MREITs. Secondary data was obtained from annual reports of twelve listed MREITs on Bursa Malaysia from 2006 to 2011 and analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that the information on the fair value of investment properties (as presented in balance sheet) is significantly related to share price of MREITs. However, the changes in fair value (<b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus),</b> as presented in income statement is not significantly related to the share price. The findings suggest that only fair value of investment properties (FVIP) is useful for investors to make their investment decisions. This study also found a positive and significant association between board independence and share prices of MREITs. It indicates that independence of directors in MREIT firms is also important to investors that it is reflected in the share price. This study adds to the limited literature on MREITs. The results indicate that investors do value the fair value information provided by MREITs and support the fair value accounting in REITs. The findings of this study could be used by regulators in improving the future revaluation guidelines for the REIT industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is a study}} case of PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk using descriptive method entitled "Analysis of Fixed Assets Revaluation Implementation at PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk according PSAK 16 ". The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the implementation of fixed assets revaluation in PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk according to PSAK 16 and to evaluate PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk if the company implement fixed asset revaluation according to PSAK 16. The analysis tool used is PSAK 16 analysis unit on revaluation of fixed assets. Application of fixed asset revaluation in PT Abdi Bangsa requires data in the form of notes to financial statements, accounting policies on fixed assets, financial statements and annual report. Notes to Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statement of the company will be identified for various fixed assets in accordance with their useful lives, evaluating the implementation of fixed assets revaluation according to PSAK 16 and evaluating its impact on the company and the investors and creditors. Results of analysis concluded that the implementation of fixed asset revaluation conducted in 2001 was for taxation purposes. Then there is the application of revaluation of fixed assets in 2001 in accordance with PSAK 16 (2007) paragraphs 32, 39. The results of the implementation of fixed assets revaluation resulted in the fair value in accordance with PSAK 16 paragraphs 79 points c, d. From the results of the analysis conducted can be concluded that the PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk in conducting a revaluation in 2001 had applied PSAK 16 on the determination of the fair value of fixed assets and credit the increase in asset value due to <b>revaluation</b> <b>surplus</b> on revaluation of equity. Then determination of fair value on the company is determined by the appraisal institution. While the implementation of fixed assets revaluation in accordance with PSAK 16 produce clearer information on how to determine the fair value of fixed assets. Where there are other alternatives in determining the fair value which based on the price index. There is an increase of enterprise?s value in fixed assets to Rp 62, 590, 341, 072. 00, and depreciation costs after the revaluation is Rp 9, 345, 861, 067. 00 which changed general and administrative expenses to Rp 41, 474, 576, 900. 00. It also increases the company's capital from revaluation increment amounting Rp 15, 812, 368, 334. 00. Thus fairness of financial statements be retrieved, and will impact on users of financial information,primarily investors and creditors. Researcher suggested that PT Abdi Bangsa Tbk to adjust their fixed assets to market prices more often, so the company will know whether they should conduct a revaluation, if it is too difficult to determine the market value,the price index method can be used. Then, as we will fully adopt IFRS, the company must prepare what is needed to implement IFRS in 2012...|$|E
