5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths,</b> resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones have been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of about 1.9million people worldwide. It is estimated that 10,000people per year perish due to tropical cyclones.

5|$|Devil May Cry {{begins with}} Dante being {{attacked}} {{in his office}} by a mysterious woman named Trish. He impresses her by easily brushing off her assault, and tells her that he hunts demons in pursuit of those who killed his mother and brother. She says the attack was a test, and that the demon emperor Mundus, whom Dante holds <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of his family, is planning a return. The scene jumps to their arrival at an immense castle, whereupon Trish abruptly leaps and vanishes over a high wall.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Đujić {{was tried}} and sentenced in {{absentia}} {{for war crimes}} by Yugoslavia.

5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead {{have been identified in}} African elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian elephants in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones have been <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of standing water caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters {{increase the risk of}} disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} of Supernatural, an American fantasy horror {{television}} series created by Eric Kripke, premiered on September 28, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007, airing 22episodes. The season focuses on protagonists Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) as they track down Azazel, the demon <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> {{of their mother}} Mary and father John. They attempt to discover the demon's plan for Sam and other psychic children—young adults who were visited by Azazel as infants and given abilities, and whose mothers often then died in a fire. During their travels, they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family business—saving people and hunting supernatural creatures.|$|E
5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August {{of the same}} year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After {{he made his way to}} Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, {{after the}} Invasion of Poland, Fegelein {{commanded}} the SS Totenkopf Reiterstandarte (Death's-Head Horse Regiment). They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December.

For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR. As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer in 1943, he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army, for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze.|$|E

5|$|Krovanh first {{struck the}} Philippines, {{resulting}} in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000families. The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. Krovanh's effects {{were much more}} severe in China. In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred {{as a result of}} the typhoon's outer rainbands. However, Guangdong Province, Hainan Province, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. In those three regions combined, 13,000homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged. Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at ¥2.1 billion (US$253 million). Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000homes were flattened. One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. Overall, the typhoon was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of four persons.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 545 Allied airmen who were {{captured in the}} Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who were killed when they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26May raid on the city. Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5May were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University; Professor Fukujirō Ishiyama and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.|$|E

He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths,</b> and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E

5|$|Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), {{assisted}} by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> {{of at least}} eleven million people, including 5.5 to 6 million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce {{the population of the}} conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3million civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season, Nikita gains some allies {{to aid in}} her fight against Division, {{including}} Owen Elliot (Devon Sawa), a guardian to one of Division's several black boxes; hard drives contain files of Division's missions, until Percy tried to have him killed, CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher (Noah Bean) who was investigating black operations invisible to the United States government, and eventually her trainer Michael, after he learns Percy was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> {{of his wife and}} daughter. The two would be in a relationship {{for the rest of the}} series' run. By the first-season finale, Alex learns that Nikita killed her father and leaves her to become a free agent for Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who overthrew Percy to lead Division with the help of Oversight, a group of American politicians who ensure that Division's existence remains secret from the public (Alex would later return to fight alongside with Nikita again midway through season two). Michael is discovered to be working with Nikita and the two end up on the run together with a black box.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E
