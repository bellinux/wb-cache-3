25|$|The aircraft, Lockheed L-749A Constellation, (F-BAZS c/n 2628), {{which first}} flew in 1950, had flown {{for a total}} of 10,058 hours and was powered by four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone <b>radial</b> <b>engines,</b> (<b>type</b> № 749C18BD1).|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, General Motors Company {{directed}} its GM R&D and Pontiac divisions to develop concept mini-cars for urban drivers. Pontiac developed the Pontiac X-4 with a radical two stroke aircraft <b>type</b> <b>radial</b> <b>engine,</b> and GM developed the XP-883 an experimental plug-in hybrid car demonstrated by General Motors in 1969. Primarily {{intended as a}} commuter vehicle, the very small car had a fiberglass body with a design resembling the future Chevrolet Vega or Ford Pinto. The two-door hatchback had seating for two adults and two children, though the children sat in rear-facing seats and would enter and exit through the tailgate. It was powered by {{the combination of a}} two-cylinder engine and a DC electric motor. Electricity was stored in six 12-volt batteries placed between the rear wheels.|$|R

50|$|In September, 1966, {{production}} of the <b>Type</b> II <b>engine</b> and gearbox began. It was not until 1972 that the <b>Type</b> II <b>engine</b> replaced the <b>Type</b> I in general use. Continued use of the <b>Type</b> I <b>engine</b> in 1966-72 {{was the result of}} a surplus of Type I components. With so many <b>Type</b> I <b>engines</b> in use, parts remained in production until the early seventies. When the military serviced Type I bikes, they would replace the engines and/or gearboxes with Type II components. This was done for ease of maintenance, parts availability, and improved engine characteristics. Bikes with <b>Type</b> I <b>engines</b> often had their original gearboxes replaced with a <b>Type</b> II. <b>Engines</b> manufactured with a serial number of 661802 and higher are Type II.|$|R

2500|$|The Bristol Badger had {{its roots}} in the Type 22 F.2C, a {{proposed}} upgrade of the Bristol F.2B using a 200hp (150kW) Salmson <b>radial</b> (<b>Type</b> 22), a 300hp (220kW) ABC Dragonfly <b>radial</b> (<b>Type</b> 22A), or a 230hp (170kW) Bentley B.R.2 rotary (Type 22B). [...] The Type 23 Badger was a new design using the Dragonfly engine, drawn {{up at the end of}} 1917 to meet a two-seat fighter-reconnaissance role and owing a good deal to the Bristol Scout F. It was a single-bay biplane with strongly staggered, unswept and unequal-span wings. The pilot and observed sat in tandem, the pilot in front under the upper-wing trailing edge and the observer behind with a ring-mounted 0.303in (7.7mm) Lewis Gun. At first, the Badger carried almost no fixed fin. Construction was the traditional wood-and-fabric of the time and the undercarriage was a single axle plus tailskid arrangement.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{boundedness}} of the maximal operator in the weighted spaces Lp(⋅) (ρ) over a bounded open set Ω in the Euclidean space ℝn or a Carleson curve Γ {{in a complex}} plane. The weight function may belong to a certain version of a general Muckenhoupt-type condition, which is narrower than the expected Muckenhoupt condition for variable exponent, but coincides with the usual Muckenhoupt class Ap {{in the case of}} constant p. In the case of Carleson curves there is also considered another class of weights of <b>radial</b> <b>type</b> of the form ρ(t) =∏k= 1 mwk(|t-tk|), tk∈Γ, where wk has the property that r 1 p(tk) wk(r) ∈Φ 10, where Φ 10 is a certain Zygmund-Bari-Stechkin-type class. It is assumed that the exponent p(t) satisfies the Dini–Lipschitz condition.
