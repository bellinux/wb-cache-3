25|$|Once the {{requirements}} are understood, {{it is now}} the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A decision matrix, or Pugh method, is one way (QFD is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing {{the requirements}}). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, <b>reliability</b> <b>analysis,</b> system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{failure is}} the typical failure mode of {{mechanical}} components subjected to random load-time history. It {{is important to}} ensure that the mechanical components have an expected life with a high reliability. However, it is difficult to reduce the influence of factors that affect the fatigue reliability and thus a <b>reliability</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> is necessary. An approach of fatigue <b>reliability</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> of complex mechanical components under random excitation is presented. Firstly, load spectra are derived using a theoretical method. A design of experiment (DOE) is performed to study the stresses of dangerous points according to the change of design parameters of the mechanical component. By utilizing a Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm, the explicit function relation between stresses and design parameters is formulated and thus solves the problem of implicit limit state function. Based on the damage accumulation (DA) approach, the probability perturbation method, the fourth-moment method, the Edgeworth expansion is adopted to calculate the fatigue reliability and reliability-based sensitivity. The fatigue <b>reliability</b> sensitivity <b>analysis</b> of a train wheel is performed as an example. The results of reliability are compared with that obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. The reliability sensitivity of design parameters in the train wheel is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Design ruggedization is a {{necessary}} step {{in the development of}} new products to ensure high reliability and high levels of customer satisfaction. It makes good business sense to have a rich understanding {{of whether or not the}} project team is on track towards achieving the project’s reliability goals. Should a project fall behind in attaining these goals, it behooves the business to implement mitigation strategies as early as possible. Most design ruggedization and Design for Reliability tools do not provide system-level predictions of elded reliability. What is needed is a tool for predicting expected customer-experienced reliability during the product development phase, and this is where <b>reliability</b> growth <b>analysis</b> can help. <b>Reliability</b> growth <b>analysis</b> is a set of mathematical tools that provides the capability to predict elded reliability. But effec-tive reliability growth modeling is more than just mathemati-cal and statistical procedures; it also encompasses processes for data collection, failure counting, effectiveness factor assignment and transformation of reliability growth results into expected customer experiences. This article explores the practical aspects of customer-facing <b>reliability</b> growth <b>analysis.</b> Through a combination of theory and application, practical solutions for overcoming reliability growth obstacles are presented. In Part 1 of the article, limitations of design ruggedization and Design for Reliability are discussed. <b>Reliability</b> growth <b>analysis</b> is introduced as a solution for the early prediction of elded reliability. Processes for collecting on-time data, de ning what failures should count, and rigorously calculating BD mode effec-tiveness factors are discussed. In Part 2 of the article, Agilent’s customer-facing reliability growth process is applied to three new product introduc-tions. Results of the reliability growth models are discussed and methods for transforming Projected MTBF’s into accurate customer-experienced reliability metrics are presented...|$|R
