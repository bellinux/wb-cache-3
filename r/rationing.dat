5|$|At the {{expiration}} of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary. As {{a result of}} his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People worked against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including having a swimming pool installed at his home in violation of the federal <b>rationing</b> provisions implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the Truman Committee to investigate the installation of the pool; the committee found no violations of the federal <b>rationing</b> provisions. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.|$|E
5|$|Because Israel's {{victory was}} {{largely due to}} U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., {{resulting}} in the 1973 oil crisis. The embargo caused gasoline shortages and <b>rationing</b> in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{included}} Kitty Kelley, who falsely {{alleged that}} during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the <b>rationing</b> regulations.

5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by opening their own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol <b>rationing</b> during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until <b>rationing</b> was discontinued in 1951.|$|E

Today, military chocolate is issued to troops as part of basic field <b>rations</b> and sundry packs. Chocolate <b>rations</b> served two purposes: as a morale boost, and as a high-energy, pocket-sized emergency <b>ration.</b> Military chocolate <b>rations</b> are often made in special lots to military specifications for weight, size, and endurance.

5|$|The camp dietitian, {{with the}} help of men {{assigned}} as cooks, prepared all of the meals. Camps with large gardens provided their own fresh vegetables.

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even <b>rationing,</b> in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris <b>rationing</b> system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they did not know whether 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{experiment}} was {{conducted during the}} period November 1967 to November 1968 at Oregon State University (OSU) and the Umatilla Branch Experiment Station (BES) at Hermiston, two trials at each location, to answer several questions: (1) could comparable <b>rations</b> for swine be formulated by a computer on a least-cost basis; (2) would the <b>rations</b> produce equal results when fed; and (3) what effect would the switching of these <b>rations</b> during the feeding period have on the rate of gain, feed efficiency, and carcass characteristics of the pigs. At OSU there were 45 pigs in each trial divided into 15 groups. Each of these groups received all <b>rations</b> in different sequences. At BES there were 168 pigs in each trial divided into 14 groups. Eight of the groups, in replicates of two groups per <b>ration,</b> were fed a given <b>ration</b> for the entire trial; the other six groups received all <b>rations</b> in different sequences. A total of seven different <b>rations</b> were fed in the two trials. Six <b>rations</b> were formulated by the computer on a least-cost basis; {{the other was a}} standard experiment station <b>ration.</b> Three different <b>rations</b> were used in each trial and the standard <b>ration</b> was used in both trials. Analysis of the data from the experiment showed that: (1) <b>rations</b> for swine can be formulated by computer on a least-cost basis if care is taken to insure that the input data given the computer to formulate the <b>rations</b> is correct; (2) these <b>rations</b> will produce nearly equal results when fed if both the economic and physical aspects are considered and not either alone; (3) switching the <b>rations</b> during the feeding period will produce little effect on the pigs for rate of gain, feed efficiency, or carcass characteristics. The significant differences between sequences, direct <b>ration</b> effects, residual <b>ration</b> effects, and constant <b>ration</b> vs. switched <b>ration</b> were not consistent and could not be interpreted to indicate that any of the above conclusions were invalid...|$|R

In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire.

5|$|Because of {{the tight}} <b>rationing,</b> a black market {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of <b>rationing,</b> which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The amount of food permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E

5000|$|Primarily {{implemented}} due to cost concerns, {{the selection}} of a heavy canned wet <b>ration</b> resulted in a severe weight penalty for troops marching on foot and forced to carry a multi-day supply of <b>rations.</b> [...] The overuse of the canned wet <b>ration</b> reached an extreme during the Vietnam War, where American troops resorted to placing stacked <b>ration</b> cans in socks to save bulk and reduce noise on patrol, while their enemy increased their mobility by carrying lightweight <b>rations</b> of dry rice. [...] The Quartermaster Branch's insistence on canned wet <b>rations</b> for all postwar field issue, and the failure to develop a suitable lightweight dehydrated or other dry <b>ration</b> for jungle and other extreme environments led directly to the hurried development of the LRP <b>ration</b> or Long Range Patrol <b>ration</b> in 1966.|$|R
