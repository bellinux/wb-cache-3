5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat <b>regressive</b> <b>tax,</b> with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{majority}} voting over non-linear {{income taxes}} when individuals respond to taxation by substituting untaxable leisure to taxable labor (incentive effects). We first show that voting cycle over progressive and <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes</b> is inevitable. This {{is because the}} middle-class can always lower its tax burden {{at the expense of}} the rich by imposing progressive taxes (convex tax function) while the rich and the poor can reduce their tax burden by imposing <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes</b> (concave tax function). We then investigate three solutions to this cycling problem: (i) reducing the policy space to the policies that are ideal for some voter; (ii) weakening the voting equilibrium concept; (iii) assuming parties also care about the size of their majority. The main results is that progressivity emerges as a voting equilibrium if there is a lack of polarization at the extremes of the income distribution. Interestingly the poor would prefer <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes.</b> Majority voting, Income taxation, Tax progressivity...|$|R

25|$|The {{constitution}} {{mandates that}} taxation must be general and equal in nature, {{and it must}} be proportionate to one's ability to pay. The Federal Supreme Court has interpreted this as prohibiting a <b>regressive</b> <b>tax,</b> although flat rate taxes (as instituted in several cantons) are held to be constitutional by tax law scholars. Moreover, double taxation by several cantons is constitutionally prohibited, as is a confiscatory rate of taxation.|$|E
25|$|A capped {{flat tax}} {{is one in}} which income is taxed at a flat rate until a {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a <b>regressive</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
25|$|Necker {{realised}} {{that the}} country's extremely <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> system subjected {{the lower classes}} to a heavy burden, while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money would solve the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36million livres, and proposed restricting {{the power of the}} parlements.|$|E

Unlike earlier studies, we ﬁnd that the optimal long-run tax policy is moderately <b>regressive.</b> <b>Regressive</b> <b>taxes</b> {{lead to higher}} output and consumption, {{at the expense of}} larger after-tax income inequality. Nevertheless, equilibrium effects and the availability of self-insurance via bequests mitigate the impact of <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes</b> on consumption inequality, resulting in improved average welfare overall. We also consider the optimal once-and-for-all change in the tax system, taking into account the transition dynamics. Starting at the U.

25|$|There {{were several}} {{negative}} reactions, concerns and criticisms {{as a result}} of the December 2008 public meetings and online hearing where the preliminary findings of the MAPS (Mobility, Access and Pricing Study) were discussed. One participant questioned the rationale for having to pay to drive on a public street. Others considered that congestion pricing is a <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> imposing a greater burden on those without a good option to ride public transit and on low-income commuters. Other considered too expensive to pay USD 6.00 for a short duration trips. Zone residents with children and inflexible schedules complained they would be unfairly affected. Another major concern is the lack of reliability and capacity of San Francisco's existing network of transit services, limiting commuters to switch to public transport once the congestion pricing is implemented.|$|E
25|$|Despite its <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> formula, Social Security {{benefits}} are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor {{benefits are}} denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence. Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2007, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded {{from the}} Urban Partnership program $354 million to New York City. It {{was the largest}} of the five grants awarded to cities, which {{included}} San Francisco, King County, Washington (Seattle), the Minneapolis area, and Miami. Only $10.4 million is allocated for launching the congestion pricing program and $2 million for research. The rest of the grant will fund transportation infrastructure and services: $213.6 million to improve and build new bus depots, $112.7 million to develop bus rapid transit routes, and $15.8 million for expanded ferry services. The idea of congestion pricing was endorsed by Spitzer, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, and other New York City politicians, such as City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens and the Bronx, as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and other politicians expressed skepticism about the plan, raising several questions about its viability, its environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone, the lack of state control in Bloomberg's proposal, and the imposition of a <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> on some commuters.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{questions}} {{the argument that}} strong and early reliance on ‘regressive’ taxes(consumption and payroll taxes) made it politically easier to build and maintain a large welfare state. It develops an alternative perspective which differs in two respects. First, a crucial ‘advantage’ of <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes</b> is that they imply moderate capital taxation, but this can also be achieved within income tax. Second, the direction of causality moves largely from high revenue needs to strong reliance {{on at least one}} of the two major <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes,</b> rather than the other way round. The paper aims to show that this alternative argument provides a better explanation of quantitative data patterns as well as the cases of Denmark, New Zealand, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Policy implications are also discussed: policymakers have good reason to defend the progressivity and revenue-raising potential of the income tax, and in so doing may require greater European tax coordination...|$|R

500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{has been raised}} concerning the environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone, with critics claiming that congestion pricing would create [...] "parking lots" [...] and add more traffic and pollution to those neighborhoods, and {{the imposition of a}} <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> on some commuters. Stockholm's trial of congestion pricing, however, showed a reduction in traffic in areas outside the congestion zone. Other opponents argue that the pricing could become a tax on middle- and lower-class residents, since those citizens would be affected the most financially. The installation of cameras for tracking purposes may also raise civil liberties concerns.|$|E
500|$|SP {{candidate}}s, such as New Jersey gubernatorial {{and senate}} candidate Greg Pason, have also emphasized immediate public service demands; these reforms include socializing the U.S. health care system, a steeply graduated income tax, universal rent control, and {{the elimination of}} all educational debts and tuition fees. In 1997, Pason called auto insurance [...] "a <b>regressive</b> <b>tax</b> against working people". Moore was also vocal of his support for public healthcare and socialized medicine. Moore believes that capitalism is a system based on both exploitation and selfishness, which operates to serve the interests of corporations and the ruling class, at the expense of workers and the poor. During his presidential campaign he claimed that the lack of available remedy to collapsing economic conditions stems from the capitalist system's foundation upon [...] "greed", and advocated its replacement with a new system founded upon economic democracy through social ownership and workers' control of our reigning industrial and financial institutions.|$|E

There are also deduction phaseouts starting at $112,500 for single filers. The net effect is increased progressivity that completely limits deductions {{for state and local}} taxes and certain other credits for individuals earning more than $306,300.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} different corporate tax systems on the location of industry within an economic geography model with regional size asymmetries. Both the North and the South gain industry by adopting a tax regime that produces the lowest tax level. As the share of expenditures in the North increases, the Nash equilibrium has this region setting <b>regressive</b> <b>taxes,</b> while the South introduces progressive taxation. The unilateral welfare-maximizing tax structure in the North (South) is the regressive (progressive) system when expenditures in the North increase. Welfare in the North (South) is however maximized if both regions set <b>regressive</b> (progressive) <b>taxes,</b> while <b>regressive</b> (progressive) taxation in both regions represents a joint welfare maximizing outcome if the economic size of the North is higher (lower) than a certain threshold value. As trade is liberalized, the equilibrium tax regime adopted depends on how pro ts respond to lower trade costs. Proportional taxation is never an equilibrium, neither as regional spending changes, nor as trade is liberalized. Economic Geography; Tax Systems; Corporate Taxation...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "value-added tax" [...] {{has been}} criticized as the burden of it falls on {{personal}} end-consumers of products. Some critics consider {{it to be a}} <b>regressive</b> <b>tax,</b> meaning that the poor pay more, as a percentage of their income, than the rich. Defenders argue that relating taxation levels to income is an arbitrary standard, and that the value-added tax is in fact a proportional tax in that people with higher income pay more in that they consume more. The effective progressiveness or regressiveness of a VAT system can also be affected when different classes of goods are taxed at different rates. To maintain the progressive nature of total taxes on individuals, countries implementing VAT have reduced income tax on lower income-earners as well as instituted direct transfer payments to lower-income groups, resulting in lower tax burdens on the poor.|$|E
