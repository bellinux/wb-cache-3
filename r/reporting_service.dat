25|$|Although some of {{the files}} from the Constand case had been unsealed, the {{transcript}} of Cosby's several depositions was not among them. Instead, The New York Times {{had been able to}} obtain the complete deposition from a court <b>reporting</b> <b>service</b> that had been hired by Constand's attorney, and released the document to the general public. After it was discovered that the transcript of the deposition had been released, Cosby's lawyers filed a new motion in the case on July 21, 2015, asserting that Constand and Troiani may have orchestrated the release.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the technology of}} <b>reporting</b> <b>services</b> which helps you process the data and present {{it to the end}} user as information. The end user using the reports turns that information into knowledge. We have chosen a <b>reporting</b> <b>services</b> solution from Microsoft, called Microsoft SQL Server <b>Reporting</b> <b>Services,</b> which is a part of Microsoft SQL Server, as a pilot technology in this thesis. At the beginning of this thesis we explained what <b>reporting</b> <b>services</b> are, we explored a brief history of the product Microsoft SQL Server <b>Reporting</b> <b>Services</b> and how the product is installed and configured. Also described are tools with which we produce graphical <b>reports.</b> Since the <b>services</b> are part of a system called Business Intelligence, we also explain what Business Intelligence is. In Chapter 4 we provided a practical example that shows the usefulness of <b>reporting</b> <b>services</b> in everyday life. We have prepared a simple online application to monitor exchange rates of different banks. A user, who is logged in the web application, can subscribe to receive daily reports of foreign exchange rates via e-mail. At the end of the work we compared <b>reporting</b> <b>services</b> technologies from different vendors, ie Microsoft, IBM, SAP, Oracle and Jaspersoft...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the alleged}} acts fall outside the {{statutes}} of limitations for criminal legal proceedings, but criminal {{charges have been filed}} against Cosby in one case and numerous civil lawsuits have been brought against him. As of November 2015, eight related civil lawsuits are active against Cosby. Gloria Allred is representing 33 {{of the alleged}} victims. In July 2015, some of the court records from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby were unsealed and released to the public. The full transcript of his deposition was also released to the media by a court <b>reporting</b> <b>service.</b> In his testimony, Cosby admitted to casual sex, involving recreational use of the sedative-hypnotic methaqualone (Quaaludes), with a series of young women, and acknowledged that his dispensing the prescription drug was illegal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the court}} filing condemning {{the release of}} the deposition, Cosby's {{attorneys}} stressed that none of the testimony that was actually unsealed by a judge stated that he engaged in non-consensual sex or gave anyone Quaaludes without their knowledge or consent. [...] "Reading the media accounts, one would conclude that the Defendant has admitted to rape," [...] the document said. [...] "And yet the Defendant admitted to nothing more than being one of the many people who introduced Quaaludes into their consensual sex life in the 1970s." [...] Cosby's lawyers further contended that a court <b>reporting</b> <b>service</b> hired by Constand had released the 2005 court transcript to The New York Times, days earlier, in a [...] "massive breach of protocol". The court reporters' code of ethics prohibits the release of testimony without all parties first being contacted.|$|E
