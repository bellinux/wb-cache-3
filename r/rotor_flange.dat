40|$|Plane {{externally}} pressurized thrust gas bearings {{for high}} speed spindles are considered. The {{behavior of the}} rotor-bearing system is studied both numerically and experimentally. A numerical model based on Reynolds equation is used to simulate the static and dynamic behavior of the system. Flow rate equation through inlet orifices is coupled with Reynolds equation. The flow rate is calculated by considering an experimentally determined discharge coefficient, that is function of holes diameter and local clearance. To increase stiffness are studied thrust bearings presenting a circumferential groove situated at the same radius of the supply holes. The influence of the groove on stiffness and stability is discussed. Simulations are made to evaluate the influence of supply holes diameter and of axial clearance on bearing characteristics. Two thrust bearings are studied experimentally. They are composed by a symmetric couple of disks facing the <b>rotor</b> <b>flange.</b> The internal and external diameters of the disks are 52 mm and 110 mm and equipped with 8 holes of diameter 0. 35 mm on a circumference of diameter 65 mm. A thrust bearing present a rectangular section circumferential groove, located at the same radius of the orifices, of width 0. 7 mm and thickness 10 Pm. Comparisons between simulated and experimental stiffness are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{shell element}} {{that is well}} suited for the {{analysis}} of folded plate and shell structures is presented. In contrast to unfolded plates, the walls of folded plates can undergo substantial amount of transverse as well as membrane bending. For instance, in a <b>rotor</b> blade, the <b>flange</b> and web of a spar undergo transverse and membrane bending under flap bending, respectively, and the reverse occurs under lag bending. Therefore, a suitable shell-element technology should accurately model the transverse-bending and membrane-bending deformations, while maintaining kinematic compatibility along the element edges. The new shell element incorporates the Assumed Natural DEviatoric Strain (ANDES) and anisoparametric element formulations. The element robustness is established by comparisons with experimental measurements and other numerical predictions. I...|$|R
