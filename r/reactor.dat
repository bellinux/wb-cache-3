5|$|Chicago Pile-1 {{was soon}} {{moved by the}} lab to a more remote site in the Argonne Forest, where its {{original}} materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2. Another <b>reactor,</b> Chicago Pile-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first <b>reactor</b> to use heavy water as a neutron moderator. It went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power in July 1944. The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the X-10 Graphite <b>Reactor</b> at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the B <b>Reactor</b> at the Hanford Engineer Works {{in the state of}} Washington.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Hanford B <b>Reactor,</b> {{the first}} industrial-sized nuclear <b>reactor</b> for the {{purposes}} of material production, was completed in March 1945. B <b>Reactor</b> produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during World War II. B, D and F were the initial reactors built at Hanford, and six additional plutonium-producing reactors were built later at the site.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the <b>reactor</b> itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who {{inserted the}} first slug, the <b>reactor</b> was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the <b>reactor</b> went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the <b>reactor</b> had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the <b>reactor</b> started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reactors</b> can {{be divided}} into two broad categories, batch <b>reactors</b> and {{continuous}} <b>reactors.</b> Batch <b>reactors</b> are stirred tanks sufficiently large to handle the full inventory of a complete batch cycle. In some cases, batch <b>reactors</b> may be operated in semi batch mode where one chemical is charged to the vessel and a second chemical is added slowly. Continuous <b>reactors</b> are generally smaller than batch <b>reactors</b> and handle the product as a flowing stream. Continuous <b>reactors</b> may be designed as pipes with or without baffles or a series of interconnected stages. The advantages of the two options are considered below.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{technical}} plasmas can be simulated; including plasma etch <b>reactors,</b> plug-flow <b>reactors</b> and well-mixed <b>reactors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Research <b>reactors</b> are nuclear <b>reactors</b> {{that serve}} {{primarily}} as a neutron source. They are also called non-power <b>reactors,</b> in contrast to power <b>reactors</b> that are used for electricity production, heat generation, or maritime propulsion.|$|R
5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} {{the cause of}} the problem as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, which has a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to be}} 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the <b>reactor</b> had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the <b>reactor</b> could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. <b>Reactor</b> D was started on 17 December 1944 and <b>Reactor</b> F on 25 February 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 <b>reactor,</b> {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated <b>reactor</b> only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled <b>reactor</b> designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled <b>reactor</b> to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the <b>reactor</b> at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite <b>Reactor</b> lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a Magnox power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled <b>Reactor</b> (AGR) {{which was designed to}} generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurized <b>Reactor</b> (EPR) <b>reactor</b> known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B <b>Reactor</b> at the Hanford Site, the production <b>reactor</b> designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the <b>reactor</b> went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the <b>reactor</b> had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the <b>reactor</b> suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the <b>reactor</b> had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners.

5|$|In addition, the {{university}} also operates the McMaster Nuclear <b>Reactor,</b> used for nuclear {{science and engineering}} research since 1959. The University regularly acquires an operating license for the <b>reactor</b> from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, with the latest 10-year license issued on 1 July 2014. The strength of nuclear science at McMaster was augmented in 1968 under the presidency of Dr. H.G. Thode by {{the construction of a}} 10MV Model FN Tandem particle accelerator. The 3MV Model KN single-ended accelerator was added the same year. The academic direction of the laboratory fell to the Physics Department in the early days, as it was primarily a nuclear structure laboratory. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was extensive, with hundreds of graduate students trained and many publications generated. The SLOWPOKE <b>reactor</b> is used for research, educational, and commercial applications such as neutron radiography, and medical radioisotope production; Iodine-125 is used in cancer therapy. The <b>reactor</b> at McMaster produces 25 percent of the world's supply of iodine-125, an isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat prostate cancer.

5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years.

N <b>Reactor</b> operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours.
