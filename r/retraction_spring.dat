40|$|Abstract. <b>Retraction</b> <b>spring</b> {{is a type}} of {{orthodontic}} {{apparatus that}} is used to move a tooth with respect to another by utilizing its spring back effect. It is made of metallic wire formed to individual orthodontic cases. A specific geometry results in a set of force system, consisting of forces and moments, that provides specific movement effect when it is pre-activated to the adjacent teeth. Currently, orthodontists select its geometry depending on their knowledge and experience. It is based on separate and less-than-comprehensive literatures that not all orthodontists have access to. It may result in inaccuracies in treating individual tooth retraction case. Engineering approach to estimating <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> structural behavior is proposed through analytical, numerical and empirical methods. Castigliano method is used as the analytical approach, whilst finite element method is used as the numerical approach. The two simulation approaches were compared to the experiments to obtain the best simulation model. The behavior of the simulation models agree well with those of experiments. Hence, the simulation models were used to simulate a large number of geometries to form database of structural behavior of <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> {{that could be used in}} the geometry selection by orthodontists...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{characteristics}} of the Ricketts maxillary canine <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> (Ricketts, 1974) have been derived using the complementary (strain) energy method. The theoretical predictions of the analysis have been confirmed by experiments on large planar models in a jig fitted with strain gauges capable of measuring the forces and couples developed when the springs were activated in a way simulating clinical use. The verified {{analysis was used to}} compare the horizontal stiffness and anti-tilt couple to retraction force ratios of the Ricketts with other simpler retraction components.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects and interactions of first- andsecond- order preactivation bends on three dimensional force system of steel and beta titaniumcanine <b>retraction</b> <b>springs.</b> Method and materials: In a non- linear finite element analysis, three <b>retraction</b> <b>springs</b> including,vertical loop, vertical helical loop and T- loop were studied. All combinations of first-order bend(0, 20, 40 and 60 degrees), second-order bend (0, 20 and 40 degrees) and wire material (stainlesssteel, beta titanium) were applied to each design. All appliances activated incrementaly to reachelastic limit in 0. 05 mm steps. Moment/ force ratios (in occlusal and sagital plan) and load/deflection rate of appliances were measured using ABAQUS, V 6. 8 and CATIA, V 5. 13 softwares. Results: It was found that the second-order bend can somewhat reduce moment/ force ratio inocclusal plan but first order bend have no effect on moment/ force ratio in sagital plan. Theaddition of helix into the vertical loop reduces load deflection rate of spring but did little to alterthe moment/ force ratios of spring. Conclusion: First and second-order preactivation of <b>retraction</b> <b>springs</b> produce the desired effects,without significant interfering with each other. Helices added to the vertical loop may improvesome mechanical characteristics of <b>retraction</b> <b>springs.</b> Key words: Orthodontic Appliance Design, Orthodontic Wires, Finite Element Analysis, StainlessSteel, Beta Titanium, Tooth Movemen...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{movement}} of the maxillary canines into the healed or recent extraction alveolus of the first premolar was measured in 22 patients aged 10 - 27 years. On {{one side of the}} dental arch, the first premolar was extracted. After a median time of 86 days, the contralateral first premolar was extracted and the distalization of both canines started using Gjessing canine <b>retraction</b> <b>springs.</b> The experiment was ended when one of the two canines had been sufficiently distalized. Recordings of the positions of the canines {{at the beginning of the}} study, at the start of the distalization and at the end were made from dental casts and standardized intraoral radiographs.

40|$|Orthodontic {{management}} of a buccally blocked-out canine requires {{a substantial amount}} of bodily movement, which is difficult to perform because of its long and bulbous root. Even when orthodontic forces are applied in a desired direction, large hyalinized areas are created which impede the root movement. Palatal root torque is needed for the canine to increase the buccal bone thickness, decrease the risk of bone dehiscence and gingival recession. Closing loops generate a distal force along with an extrusive component which retracts the canine into the extraction space but lacks control on the torque of the canine. To overcome this limitation, this simultaneous torquing, aligning, and <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> was designed. It can be easily fabricated, activated at chairside for either simultaneous or sequential controlled three-dimensional tooth movements...|$|E

40|$|Lipid {{adhesion}} {{forces can}} be measured using several experimental techniques {{but none of these}} techniques provide insight on the atomic level. Therefore, we performed extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a phospholipid membrane in the liquid-crystalline phase out of which individual lipid molecules were pulled. In our method, as an idealization of the experimental setups, we have simply attached a harmonic spring to one of the lipid headgroup atoms. Upon <b>retraction</b> of the <b>spring,</b> the force needed to drag the lipid out of the membrane is recorded. By simulating different retraction rates, we were able to investigate the high pull rate part of the dynamical spectrum of lipid adhesion forces.

The maximum value of the adhesion force, the rupture force, decreases as the pull rate becomes slower, and eventually enters a friction dominated regime. The computed bond [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A 12 -yr old female {{presented}} with a Class II division 1 malocclusion, complicated by a complete transposition of the maxillary left canine, into the position normally occupied by the left lateral incisor. Dental and medical histories were noncontributory. Methods: Brackets were bonded on all maxillary teeth, from first molar to first molar, except for the left lateral incisor. Because the lateral incisor was not engaged on the archwire, the tooth was free to physiologically {{move out of the}} path of canine root movement. To prepare the site for canine <b>retraction,</b> a coil <b>spring</b> was used to open space between the left central incisor and first premolar. A 2 X 12 mm stainless steel miniscrew was placed in the infrazygomatic crest (IZC), labial to the mesiodistal cusp of the left maxillary first molar. Results: A 0. 019 X 0. 025 ” titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA) T-loop, anchored by the miniscrew, was used to retract the canine root over the labial surface of the root of the distally positioned lateral incisor. Conclusions: In 24 months, this difficult malocclusion with a Discrepancy Index (DI) of 18 was treated to a cast-radiograph evaluation (CRE) score of 26...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} Deployment and Retraction hinge Mechanism (DARM) in {{the frame}} of a technological program is examined. The mechanism includes two restraint/release devices, which enable it to be stable in its stowed or deployed position while sustaining all associated loads, and to carry its payload by remote command. The main characteristics of the DARM are as follows: deployment and <b>retraction</b> movements are <b>spring</b> actuated; the available amount of functional sequences is almost unlimited; and no use of electrical motors is made. These features were accomplished by: the application of a special kinematic scheme to the mechanical connection between the spring motor and the swivel head arm; and the use of shape memory alloys (SMA) actuators for both release and spring recharge functions. DARM is thus a mechanism which can find many applications in the general space scenario of in-orbit maintenance and servicing. In such a frame, the DARM typical concept, which has a design close to very simple one-shot deployment mechanisms, has a good chance to replace existing analog machines. Potential items that could be moved by DARM are: booms for satellite instruments; antenna reflector tips; entire antenna reflectors; and solar panels...|$|R
40|$|Context: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} magnitude of reactionary stresses and their pattern of distribution on implant, teeth, cortical bone, cancellous bone, and periodontal ligament (PDL) so as to determine the most favorable angle for the placement of mini implant and the most favorable force system for en masse retraction. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} is to obtain the ideal force system for en masse retraction using mini implant and to determine most favorable angle for implant insertion. Materials and Methods: DENTASCAN was used to fabricate a three-dimensional finite element model of the maxilla. Three models were constructed with different implant angulations, i. e., 45 °, 60 °, and 75 °. Each model was applied 150, 200, 250, and 300 g of load. The results were analyzed using ANSYS software. Results: Maximum stress was observed at the head of implant at the point of attachment with the <b>retraction</b> <b>spring.</b> In cortical bone and cancellous bone, stress was distal to bone-implant interface. In PDL, maximum stress developed at the apex of lateral incisor root. Conclusion: For en masse retraction, the most favorable angulations for implant placement are 60 °, and ideal force system is in the range of 200 – 250 g. Force levels above 300 g will possibly produce deleterious effects on PDL, cancellous bone, and teeth...|$|E
40|$|Heat-treatment {{procedure}} with precise temperature and technique on the stainless-steel segmental T-loop <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> can restore the mechanical properties that decreases after a wire-bending process. The {{goal of this}} study was to compare the force produced by a stainless-steel segmental T-loop spring without and with heat-treatment on 4500 C for 15 minutes, with various activation distance and gable. The design of the study was in-vitro laboratory experimental design. This study was performed at the Chemistry Laboratory of the Faculty of Science, ITB in 2006. Sample included 50 segmental T-loop springs with α and β angle of 0 °– 0 °, 7. 5 °– 7. 5 °, 15 °– 15 °, and 22. 5 °– 22. 5 °, and 30 °– 30 ° which consisted of 25 springs without heat-treatment and 25 springs with heat-treatment. Force was measured using autograph with a retraction distance of 1, 2, and 3 mm and the results were gained from ANOVA statistics analysis with a factorial design of 2 x 3 x 5 and 5 replications for each cell and posthoc Student Newman Keuls and Tukey test. The result of the statistic test showed that heat-treatment compared to no heat-treatment and interaction between heat-treatment and gable gives significant effect to the force created (p-value < 0. 05). In conclusion, the heat-treatment on the stainless steel T-loop produces an effect to decrease the created force...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to study the mechanical characteristics of canine retraction springs made of superelastic nickel titanium (NiTi) alloys. A modified Burstone T-loop was used to construct an experimental canine <b>retraction</b> <b>spring</b> 10 mm in height and 10 mm in length. Twenty-five NiTi T-segments were hand made from the superelastic orthodontic alloys Ormco NiTi and Soar Sentalloy (dimensions 0. 016 x 0. 022 ''). The T-segments were equipped with arms made of rectangular standard steel wire (0. 017 x 0. 025 ''). The following geometrical and mechanical parameters of the retraction springs were analysed: radius and bending angles of the T-segments, distalizing force and M/F ratio during activation and the force/deflection rate of the springs. The error in the geometric parameters was in the range of 5 - 10 per cent, irrespective of the alloy used to produce the T-segments. On the other hand, the force systems of the springs were strongly influenced by the alloy and the batch under investigation. There were differences in the distalizing force of up to 100 per cent, i. e. {{at the beginning of the}} unloading plateau the distalizing force varied from 0. 4 to 2. 5 N. The force/deflection rate varied between a value of 0. 06 and 0. 15 N/mm, whereas the moment/force ratio reached values of 6. 5 - 7. 0 mm. Within a single batch, a reproducibility of these mechanical properties of approximately 5 per cent could be obtained. These results confirm that each orthodontic device made of superelastic NiTi alloys has to be calibrated individually. The manufacturers should pay more attention to keeping the material properties of their NiTi alloys constant...|$|E

The computed bond lengths depend on the rate of rupture, and show some scatter due to the nonequilibrium nature of the experiment. On average, the bond length increases from ∼ 1. 7 nm to 2. 3 nm as the rates go down. Conformational analyses elucidate the detailed mechanism of lipid-membrane bond rupture. We present results of over 15 ns of membrane simulations. Implications for the interpretation and understanding of experimental rupture data are discussed...|$|R
