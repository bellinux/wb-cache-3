50|$|The red-billed {{hornbills}} are a {{group of}} hornbills found in savanna and woodland of sub-Saharan Africa. They are now usually split into five species, the northern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus erythrorhynchus), western <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (T. kempi), Tanzanian <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (T. ruahae), southern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (T. rufirostris) and Damara <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (T. damarensis), but some authorities considered them all to be subspecies of a single species.|$|E

5000|$|The call {{consists}} of an accelerating series notes, kuk kuk kuk ... which ends in a crescendo of double notes, kuk-we kuk-we. Unlike other <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbills</b> they do not raise their wings in display.|$|R
50|$|The sexes are similar, but {{males are}} larger and heavier. Males also have {{somewhat}} longer bills, {{with the lower}} mandible coloured black to a variable extent. It is distinguishable from other <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbills</b> by the combination of yellow iris and pale orbital skin (pink to greyish), and the ample blackish plumage streaking from the ear coverts {{to the side of}} the neck. The throat is white, and the wing coverts clearly spotted.|$|R

50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> dwarf <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Lophoceros camurus) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the family Bucerotidae.It is found in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Uganda.|$|R
5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbills,</b> <b>red-billed</b> buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|R
50|$|African rainforests {{also hold}} mixed-species flocks, the core species {{including}} bulbuls and sunbirds, and attendants being {{as diverse as}} the <b>red-billed</b> dwarf <b>hornbill</b> and the tit-hylia, the smallest bird of Africa. Drongos and paradise-flycatchers are sometimes described as the sentinels of the flock, but they are also known to steal prey from other flock members. Acanthizidae are typical core members in New Guinea and Australia; in Australia, fairy-wrens are also significant. The core species are joined by birds of other families such as minivets.|$|R
50|$|The Tanzanian <b>red-billed</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Tockus ruahae) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the family Bucerotidae. It is found in central Tanzania. All five red-billed hornbills were formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
50|$|The Damara <b>red-billed</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Tockus damarensis) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the family Bucerotidae. It is found in southwest Angola and northern Namibia. All five red-billed hornbills were formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> protects {{her young}} against intruders by {{building}} a wall across the opening of her nest. She then seals herself in and brings up her chicks in a 'prison'.|$|E
50|$|The first bird {{list for}} Mbam Djerem, a {{synthesis}} of the Fotso and Bobo/ Languy surveys, numbered 360 species, and, as for the mammal fauna, included both true savannah species such as Emberiza affinis, Lagonosticta rara, Lamprotornis chloropterus, Grafisia torquata, Nilaus afer, Anthoscopus parvulus and true forest species such {{as some of the}} hornbills Black and White Casqued Hornbill Ceratogymna subcylindricus, Black Casqued <b>Hornbill</b> Ceratogymna atrata, <b>Red-billed</b> Dwarf <b>Hornbill</b> Tockus camurus, and passerines such as Bleda syndactyla, Bleda eximia, Alethe diademata, Stiphrornis erythrothorax Criniger Calurus, Indicator maculatus (Fotso 2000). The Bamenda Apalis Apalis bamendae was discovered to be relatively widespread throughout the area (Bobo & Languy 2000 a,b; Fotso 2000) - this bird had previously thought to have been restricted to a small area in the Bamenda Highlands of Northwest Cameroon, two hundred kilometres to the west of Mbam Djerem.|$|R
50|$|Hornbill Hill was a {{steep and}} narrow pathway that {{featured}} enclosures for Waldrapp ibis, southern ground <b>hornbill,</b> black <b>hornbill,</b> <b>red-billed</b> blue magpie {{and at the}} top of the hill there is an enclosure that has previously held snow leopard, fossa, giant anteater and various New World monkeys and an African aviary that normally holds purple gallinule, hamerkop, Von der Decken's hornbill and curlew. There is also a small hidden enclosure for Geoffroy's cat. The Hornbill Hill aviaries, Geoffroy's cat enclosure and part of the Medellin Monkeys exhibit have all been demolished to make way for the new sun bear enclosure.|$|R

50|$|Among {{creatures that}} prey on C. jonesii are large centipedes {{of the genus}} Scolopendra, the ground {{foraging}} <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus erythrorhynchus) and eastern yellow-billed hornbill (T. flavirostris), bushveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus leucogaster), Cape porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis) and lesser red musk shrew (Crocidura hirta).|$|E
50|$|There {{are over}} 350 species of bird. These include grey-headed kingfisher, sunbirds, bee-eaters, Marabou stork, tawny eagle, Verreaux's eagle, bateleur, vulturine guineafowl, yellow-necked spurfowl, lilac-breasted roller, {{secretary}} bird, superb starling, northern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> yellow-billed hornbill, and various vultures including the palm-nut vulture.|$|E
50|$|The male has a black bill, {{whereas the}} female has red on the mandibles. The plumage {{of the male}} and female is similar. Immature birds are more uniformly grey. The flight is undulating. The {{similarly}} sized <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> has uniformly grey plumage.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} a small {{hornbill}} with blackish upperparts and mainly whitish underparts and head. It has a long tail and a long curved bill which lacks a casque. It {{is similar to the}} <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> except for the bill colour and the lack of spotting on the wing coverts in both male and female.|$|E
50|$|Over 133 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the Bijilo Forest Park including such interesting species as the black-necked weaver, <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> greater honeyguide, bearded barbet, oriole warbler, palm-nut vulture and long-tailed nightjar. These and the many other species make the area attractive to the many European birdwatchers who visit The Gambia. The birdwatching is most productive towards the coast where migrants such as Caspian tern and osprey can be seen.|$|E
50|$|HornbillsThe largest {{species is}} the {{southern}} ground hornbill. It occurs only in nature reserves. Other well-known species include the southern yellow-billed hornbill, the southern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill,</b> the African grey hornbill and the trumpeter hornbill. Hornbills are characterised {{by a large}} downcurved bill which is frequently brightly colored and sometimes has a casque on the upper mandible. They are omnivores, eating both fruit and small animals such as chameleons; the ground hornbill is an adept hunter and will forage in packs, flushing out prey such as locusts, lizards and even tortoises.|$|E
50|$|Atkinson gained further {{recognition}} {{with his}} turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and featured in Disney's The Lion King (also 1994) {{as the voice}} of Zazu the <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill.</b> He also sang the song I Just Can't Wait To Be King in The Lion King. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including Rat Race (2001), Scooby-Doo (2002), Love Actually (2003) and the crime comedy Keeping Mum (2005), which also starred Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Patrick Swayze.|$|E
50|$|Rowan Sebastian Atkinson, CBE, MSc (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, comedian, and screenwriter {{best known}} for his work on the sitcoms Blackadder and Mr. Bean. Atkinson first came to {{prominence}} in the BBC's sketch comedy show Not the Nine O'Clock News (1979-82), receiving the 1981 BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance, and via his participation in The Secret Policeman's Ball from 1979. His other work includes the 1983 James Bond film Never Say Never Again, playing a bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), voicing the <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> Zazu in The Lion King (1994), and featuring in the BBC sitcom The Thin Blue Line (1995-1996). His work in theatre includes the 2009 West End revival of the musical Oliver!.|$|E
50|$|The Bucerotidae include {{about 55}} living species, though {{a number of}} cryptic species may yet be split, as has been {{suggested}} for the <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill.</b> Their distribution includes Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian Subcontinent to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, but no genus is found in both Africa and Asia. Most are arboreal birds, but the large ground hornbills (Bucorvus), as their name implies, are terrestrial birds of open savanna. Of the 24 species found in Africa, 13 are birds of the more open woodlands and savanna, and some occur even in highly arid environments; the remaining species are found in dense forests. This contrasts with Asia, where a single species occurs in open savanna and the remainder are forest species. The Indian subcontinent has 10 species of hornbills, of which 9 are found in India and adjoining countries, while the Sri Lanka grey hornbill is restricted to the island. The most common widespread species in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian grey hornbill.According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Indonesia has 13 hornbill species: 9 of them exist in Sumatra, and the rest exist in Sumba, Sulawesi, Papua and Kalimantan. Kalimantan has the same hornbill species as Sumatra, except that the great hornbill is not found there.In the Neogene (at least in the late Miocene), hornbills inhabited North Africa and South Europe. Their remains {{have been found in}} Morocco and Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|Various upland birds {{recorded}} as prey include the 177 g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), the 350 g rock pigeon (Columba livia), the 84 g laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis), the 169 g Senegal coucal (Centropus senegalensis), the 49 g scaly-throated honeyguide (Indicator variegatus) and {{several species of}} hornbill, {{ranging in size from}} the 139 g northern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus erythrorhynchus) to the 1235 g silvery-cheeked hornbill (Bycanistes brevis). Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, the commonest foods were (in {{descending}} order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupertris), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), goats and sheep, scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), Cape francolin (Francolinus capensis), helmeted guineafowl(Numida meleagris), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and Angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. [...] From 1997 to 2005 {{in the same}} area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), domestic goat, vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Jameson's red rock hare (Pronolagus randensis), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (Pternistis swainsonii), Natal francolin (Pternistis natalensis), southern <b>red-billed</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Tockus rufirostris), rock pigeon (Columba livia), white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis), leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) and giant plated lizard (Gerrhosaurus validus). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (Rhynchotragus ssp.). Young baboons may also be hunted, even the large-bodied chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) which have issued a predator alarm call {{in response to the}} presence of Verreaux's eagles. Carrion either fairly frequent or none at all. [...] A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over 4.5 kg is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) lambs brought to the nest have weighed up to 12 kg. A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh 15 kg.|$|E
