50|$|The {{species has}} long been domesticated in areas of {{northern}} India and Pakistan where it is used for fighting. The domesticated birds can be large at around 500-600g, compared to 250g for wild birds. They are usually carefully <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> and become as tame and confiding as a pet dog.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the most}} {{time-consuming}} sequence involved red-breasted geese in flight — {{not in terms}} of actual filming, but in preparing for it. The birds had to be <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> from birth so that they would respond to the voice of their 'mother', and this eventually enabled them to be photographed as they flew alongside a moving open-top car.|$|R
60|$|I can now go out unnoticed, {{directing}} my {{steps up}} the ravine {{in which our}} hamlet is situated, towards the old grey stone church which stands solitary on the hill-top, surrounded by the lonesome moor. If any children happen to be playing among the scattered tombs, they do not start and run away, when they see me sitting on the coffin stone {{at the entrance of}} the churchyard, or wandering round the sturdy granite tower, <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hands</b> which have mouldered into dust centuries ago. My approach has ceased to be of evil omen for my little neighbours. They just look up at me, for a moment, with bright smiles, and then go on with their game.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{birds were}} often {{captured}} {{and kept in}} menageries both in India and in Europe in former times. They were also successfully bred in captivity early in the 17th century by Emperor Jehangir and in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s. ... The young birds are easily <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> and become very tame and attached {{to the person who}} feeds them, following him like a dog. They are very amusing birds, going through the most grotesque dances and antics, and are well worth keeping in captivity. One which I kept, when bread and milk was given to him, would take the bread out of the milk, and wash it in his pan of water before eating it. This bird, which was taken out of the King's palace at Lucknow, was very fierce towards strangers and dogs, especially if they were afraid of him. He was very noisy—the only bad habit he possessed Irby, 1861 ...|$|R
5000|$|Today {{the scarlet}} macaw is found {{worldwide}} in captivity, but is best represented in captivity in the Americas. Captive techniques {{developed from the}} pet trade have positively affected wild populations: in areas with low macaws populations, the [...] "extra" [...] babies that typically die in the nest may be <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> humans <b>hands</b> and released into the wild to bolster the population, as {{has been done by}} the Tambopata Macaw Project. Their captive diet, egg incubation, assisted hatching, hand rearing, co-parenting, parent-rearing, fledgling, maturation, and breeding are well understood within the avicultural community (AFA Watchbird magazine).|$|R
50|$|The PPV may be {{considered}} a forerunner of the modern velomobile. This tricycle was manufactured with a three-speed, floor shift, open type transmission with a single-wheel drive. Either the driver or the passenger could pedal independently or as a team. Reverse was accomplished by reaching outside and turning one of the <b>rear</b> wheels <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> At one time, a rear-hinged, surrey top was available. Most were manufactured with a dark blue bottom and a white hood. Red or yellow bottoms with white tops were also offered. Sometimes bicycle accessories were added, e.g. squeeze bulb horn and a rear view mirror.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the dawn}} Martina led {{me back to}} the colossal statues, and we waited there, hoping that we should hear them sing, as {{tradition}} said they did when the sun rose. Yet the sun came up as it had done {{from the beginning of the}} world, and struck upon those giant effigies as it had done for some two thousand years, or so I was told, and they remained quite silent. I do not think that ever I grieved more over my blindness than on this day, when I must depend upon Martina to tell me of the glory of that sunrise over the Egyptian desert and those mighty ruins <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> the <b>hands</b> of forgotten men.|$|R
6000|$|The blackbird, {{like the}} thrush, {{sometimes}} borrows a note or a phrase, and, like the thrush again, if <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> he {{may become a}} nuisance by mimicking some disagreeable sound, and using it by way of song. I {{heard of such a}} case a short time ago at Sidmouth. The ground floor of the house where I lodged was occupied by a gentleman who had a fondness for bird music, and being an invalid confined to his rooms, he kept a number of birds in cages. He had, besides canaries, the thrush, chaffinch, linnet, goldfinch and cirl bunting. I remarked {{that he did not have}} the best singer of all--the blackbird. He said that he had procured one, or that some friend had sent him one, a very beautiful ou?el cock in the blackest plumage and with the orange-tawniest bill, and he had anticipated great pleasure from hearing its fluting melody. But alas! no blackbird song did this unnatural blackbird sing. He had learnt to bark like a dog, and whenever the singing spirit took him he would bark once or twice or three times, and then, after an interval of silence of the proper length, about fifteen seconds, he would bark again, and so on until he had had his fill of music for the time. The barking got on the invalid's nerves, and he sent the bird away. [...] "It was either that," [...] he said, [...] "or losing my senses altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Times {{tested the}} fabric bodied {{version of the}} new car. The driver has been given an {{electrical}} petrol gauge. Standard fitments include: bumpers, a stoplight and dipping headlights pneumatically controlled from the steering wheel. The four-wheel brakes are Lockheed hydraulic. The <b>rear</b> brakes <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> {{were found to be}} [...] "useful" [...] and the pedal brakes [...] "admirable". Tools are supplied in a locker under the near side running board. The battery can be got at through a trap under the driver's seat. At the rear there is a fair-sized lockable luggage compartment. [...] "The minimum brake horsepower is stated to be 45 at 3,200 rpm." [...] Frame members are straight and at bumper height so that any shock is better withstood.|$|R
50|$|Board grabs are tricks {{performed}} while a rider is jumping or {{has gained}} air from popping by grabbing {{the board in}} a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand it is grabbed <b>by.</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>hand</b> grabs are known as Crail, Indy, Nuke, Tindy, Tail, Tailfish, and Stalefish; while front hand grabs are known as Slob, Mute, Seatbelt, Melan, Method, and Nose. Names generally originate from other board sports like skateboarding and snowboarding.|$|R
60|$|From Newbury and {{the green}} meadows of the Kennet the Hampshire hills may be seen, looking like the South Down range at its highest point viewed from the Sussex Weald. I made for Coombe Hill, the highest hill in Hampshire, and found it a {{considerable}} labour to push my machine up from the pretty tree-hidden village of East Woodhay at its foot. The top is a league-long tableland, with stretches of green elastic turf, thickets of furze and bramble, and clumps of ancient noble beeches--a beautiful lonely wilderness with rabbits and birds for only inhabitants. From the highest point where a famous gibbet stands for ever a thousand feet above the sea and {{where there is a}} dew-pond, the highest in England, which has never dried up although a large flock of sheep drink in it every summer day, one looks down into an immense hollow, a Devil's Punch Bowl very many times magnified,--and spies, far away and far below, a few lonely houses half hidden by trees at the bottom. This is the romantic village of Coombe, and hither I went and found the vicar busy in the garden of the small old picturesque parsonage. Here a very pretty little bird comedy was in progress: a pair of stock-doves which had been taken from a rabbit-hole in the hill and <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> had just escaped from the large cage where they had always lived, and all the family were excitedly engaged in trying to recapture them. They were delightful to see--those two pretty blue birds with red legs running busily about on the green lawn, eagerly searching for something to eat and finding nothing. They were quite tame and willing to be fed, so that anyone could approach them and put as much salt on their tails as he liked, but they refused to be touched or taken; they were too happy in their new freedom, running and flying about in that brilliant sunshine, and when I left towards the evening they were still at large.|$|R

40|$|Comparative growth {{observations}} (13 months) of European (Anguilla anguilla L.) and American (Anguilla rostrata Le Sueur) glass eels were undertaken. Plastic containers (60 x 30 x 35 cm, {{volume of}} 30 L) were {{combined with a}} sedimentation tank and submerged, gravel, biological filter to form a recirculation system. Feeding commenced {{on the second day}} after arrival of the fish and proceeded as follows : days 1 to 50, krill hydrolysate; days 51 to 58, krill hydrolysate mixed with a salmon starter feed; day 59 onwards, standard salmon feed. Feed was provided at 2 -hourly intervals via automatic feeders for the first 161 days of <b>rearing,</b> and thereafter <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> 5 times a day at a feeding rate of 5 % of the fish biomass. The average individual weight of the European eels on rrival (x = 0. 266 ± 0. 005 g), was significantly higher than that of the American eels (x = 0. 167 ± 0. 006 g). After 45 days of rearing, the weight differences between the species became insignificant. Except for the different transportation mortalities on arrival, the European and the American eels demonstrated similar mortality rates during the experiment (1 2. 5 %), food conversion rate (2. 3) and specific growth rate (0. 90 and 0. 99 respectively). No parasites or diseases were detected. No differences were observed in general behaviour and feeding between the two species...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} child <b>rearing</b> <b>by</b> grandparent {{on the development of}} children aged six to twelve years. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 320 children that were cared for by a parent and grandparent selected by cluster sampling. The data were collected between March 10 and April 8, 2006 by questionnaire about child and family factors. The TONI-III test was used to test the child development. Data were analyzed by frequency distribution, logistic regression, and multiple logistic regression. Results: Child caregiver had a significant influence on child development (p-value < 0. 05). Children <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> a grandparent had 2. 0 times higher chance of having delayed development compared with those who were <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> the parent. In addition, significant family factors that had impact on the child development were child rearing and family income. Conclusion: Child <b>rearing</b> <b>by</b> a grandparent had 2. 0 times higher chance of having delayed development than those <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> the parent. Therefore, family and health personnel should plan to ensure the development and learning process of children that are cared by the grandparent...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the health status of {{children}} aged between 6 and 12 years <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> grandparent and parent, including the factors affecting the develop-ment of both groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2 different caregiver groups, 160 children living with their grandparents and 160 children living with their parents in Phrae province. The samples were selected by cluster sampling and data were collected from March 10 to April 8, 2006 by questionnaire. The Test of Nonverbal Intelligence– 3 was used to test the child development. Data were analyzed by frequency distribution, percentage, χ 2 test, and mul-tiple logistic regression. The illness in the past 6 months and nutritional status of the children aged 6 to 12 years were not different between 2 groups, but the child development and appro-priateness of child rearing were different with statistical significance (P <. 05). Children who were <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> grandparents had a higher percentage (66. 7 %) of below normal development than those <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> parents (33. 3 %), and had inappropriate child <b>rearing</b> <b>by</b> a rate of 57. 7 % compared with 42. 3 %. In addition, the factors affecting the development of children <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> grandparents were both the level of the family income and the child rearing factor, whereas the child development in those who were <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> parents was affected only <b>by</b> the child <b>rearing</b> factor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} made to {{separate}} genetic from postnatal maternal influences on yawning in two strains of Sprague-Dawley rats selected for high- (HY) and low-yawning frequency (LY). Foster mothers of the two strains reared litters of pups in the four possible combinations and yawning was recorded in a novel environment when the adult offspring were 75 -day-old. Yawning frequency {{of males and females}} was affected by pup strain but not by the strain of the foster mothers, when litter size was made constant; HY adult offspring yawned more than LY adult offspring. Yawning frequency was higher in HY male offspring than in HY female offspring. An interaction term between pup sex and the strain of the foster mothers revealed that while males <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> LY mothers yawned more than males <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> HY mothers, females <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> HY mothers yawned more than females <b>reared</b> <b>by</b> LY mothers. Mean frequency of yawning increased with the sex ratio of HY litters. These findings indicate that genetic and genotype-correlated littermate effects influence yawning frequency of adult offspring in response to a novel environment...|$|R
