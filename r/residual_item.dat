Personality was assessed using the Mini-IPIP 6 -a short-form measure assessing Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Honesty-Humility. Standardized estimates calculated using Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) indicated that all six personality dimensions were extremely stable. An alternative model using Maximum Likelihood estimation, in which <b>residual</b> <b>item</b> variances were associated over repeated assessments, yielded similar findings.

40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{accuracy}} of conventional methods with image restoration, the paper supplied a nonlocal sparsity reconstruction algorithm with similarity measurement. To improve the performance of restoration results, we proposed two schemes to dictionary learning and sparse coding, respectively.

Besides, we classified the patches into different classes with similarity and trained the cluster dictionary for each class, by cascading which we could gain the universal dictionary. In the part of sparse coding, we proposed a novel optimal objective function with the coding <b>residual</b> <b>item,</b> which can suppress the residual between the estimate coding and true sparse coding. Additionally, we show the derivation of self-adaptive regularization parameter in optimization under the Bayesian framework, which can make the performance better.

40|$|Background: Tonic Immobility is a {{temporary}} state of motor inhibition in situations involving extreme fear. The first scale developed for its assessment was the 10 -item Tonic Immobility Scale (TIS). However, there are still few studies on its structural (dimensional) validity. The objective {{of this study was}} to reassess the factor structure of the TIS applied to representative samples exposed to general trauma of two Brazilian mega-cities. Methods: The sample comprised 3, 223 participants reporting at least one traumatic experience. In São Paulo (n = 2, 148), a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) first tested the originally proposed two-dimensional structure. This was followed by sequential Exploratory Structural Equation Models to identify the best fitting model, and subsequently tested in Rio de Janeiro (n = 1, 075) via CFA. Alternative reduced versions were further explored using the aggregate sample. Model-based Item Response Theory (IRT) location parameters were also investigated. Results: An absence of factor-based convergent and discriminant validity rejected the original proposition. However, the one-dimensional structure still held several residual correlations. Further exploration indicated the sustainability of reduced versions with seven (alternative A) and six (alternative B) items. Both presented excellent fit and no relevant <b>residual</b> <b>item</b> correlation. According to the IRT location parameters, items in alternative B covered a wider range of the latent trait.

40|$|A {{programme}} {{of archaeological}} investigation was undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology between March and May, 2015, {{at the request}} of Linden Homes Ltd, on land at Tithe Barn Green, Monkerton, Exeter, Devon in response to an planning condition (no. 12 / 0802 / 01). The investigation comprised five individual excavation areas, which targeted archaeological features which had previously been identified by geophysical survey, and trial trenching. Geophysical survey identified a number of possible ring ditches in the south-west part of the site, together with enclosures, a trackway, and a single, possibly prehistoric, boundary ditch {{to the north of the}} Pinn Brook. Excavation revealed evidence of a multi-phase site, dating from the Middle Bronze Age to the medieval periods. Archaeological features extended across all five excavation areas, but were primarily encountered within Areas 2, 3, and 5. The substantial ditch, 101, investigated in Area 1, contained no dating evidence, with the exception of an abraded Neolithic sherd, which is likely to be a <b>residual</b> <b>item.</b> Area 3 contained a Middle Bronze Age barrow ring ditch, together with truncated ditch sections representing a probable Middle Iron Age roundhouse. Further evidence of Middle Iron Age settlement was recorded in Area 5, in the form of an oval-plan ditched enclosure and associated features. An early-mid Roman phase included two rectilinear enclosures in Area 5, together with a number of related ditches which are likely to have comprised elements of surrounding drovewaysand field system. Later Roman activity in Area 5 was evident in the fills of a small number of cut features, but was otherwise impossible to characterise. The final phase on this site was of mid to late medieval date, and comprised several ditches and pits in Area 2. The ditched features were interpreted as elements of a drove-way running alongside the Pinn Brook. With the exception of a group of Middle Bronze Age sherds from the ring ditch in Area 2, this site produced a limited range and quantity of artefactual evidence, and most excavated features, particularly within Area 5, had been considerably truncated. Many features, including those in Area 5, produced no dateable material. Chronologically, the finds groups correspond discretely to excavated areas, thus Middle Bronze Age from Area 3, Middle Iron Age from Areas 3 and 5, Medieval from Area 2, and Middle/Late Iron Age and Roman from Area 5. The Tithe Barn Green site should be considered within the context of the available results of a number of recently investigated comparator sites of late prehistoric and Roman date within the environs of Exeter...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{comprehensive}} psychometric analysis of the Italian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile short-form (OHIP- 14) - a questionnaire analysing the oral health-related quality of life - using both classical test theory and Rasch analysis. Eighty-five subjects, residents in a long-term nursing home, were analysed using the OHIP- 14, Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Instrument (GOHAI) and a global clinical judgement. Two of the five rating categories (1 = almost never; 3 = quite often) did not comply with the Rasch criteria for category functioning. After collapsing rating categories into a three-level rating scale (0 = never; 1 = sometimes; 2 = often), the new model met the set criteria. Item 12 ('difficulty doing usual jobs') was slightly underfilling. At the principal component analysis on the standardized <b>residuals,</b> <b>item</b> 9 ('difficulty to relax') and 11 ('irritable with other people') showed a high correlation (r= 0. 66). This indicates that they may not be locally independent. Rasch analysis showed both the substantial unidimensionality of OHIP- 14, and the possibility of simplifying the structure of its rating scale. Further studies are needed to confirm the stability of these findings in different testing situations. © PI-ME, Pavia 2010...|$|R

The volume of wastes generated in major cities of Malaysia has also increased over the years due to increase in population, socioeconomic activities and physical development.

Johor Bahru which has the highest cost of living and is still rapidly expanding is no doubt producing an increasing volume of waste over the years due to the various development activities. The Johor Bahru Municipal Council collects more than 0. 5 kg of waste per person per day amounting to about 400 tonnes per day. This figure is expected to increase to more than 0. 8 kg/person/day by the year 1995 (Fan and Kheng, 1986). If improperly handled, these wastes will be a source of land, air, surface water and groundwater pollution. They must be collected, treated and/or disposed off properly.
