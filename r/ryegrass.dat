The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and <b>ryegrass,</b> which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland pasture.

Here the later sowing was much superior, as by then the original dense cover had disappeared, but on the north aspect time of grass introduction made little difference.

25|$|The Bay checkerspot went locally extinct {{during the}} early 2000s, last {{observed}} at Edgewood Park in 2002.

However, the Italian <b>ryegrass</b> was intentionally planted as an erosion control measure mandated by San Mateo County Planning Department after construction of PG high power lines that cross the park, and spread into the park from that location. Subsequently, attempts to restore the habitat by mowing at an appropriate time of year to reduce the Italian <b>ryegrass</b> and allow the native plants to regrow.

(2010). <b>Ryegrasses,</b> In: Handbook of Plant Breeding: Fodder Crops and Amenity Grasses, Volume 5, Springer New York, pp. 211 - 260, 2010 In the {{temperate}} {{regions of}} the world <b>ryegrasses</b> comprise the main sown forage grasses of which the outbreeding perennial, Italian and Westerwolths <b>ryegrasses</b> are the most economically important. This chapter presents information on the origin and systematics of these forage grasses which share a high degree of genome ancestry with the cereals originating in the eastern Mediterranean basin. It considers how plant breeding has enhanced natural genetic resources to produce valuable new varieties with improved production and livestock nutrition characteristics together with increased tolerance of environmental stresses caused by biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic (temperature, water and mineral extremes) pressures. The challenge of maintaining the optimum balance between vegetative growth and seed production is also addressed. Breeding methodologies based on traditional techniques are discussed and the integration of new biotechnologies into breeding programmes is reviewed. Breeding achievements are evaluated and future goals considered in relation to the increasingly diverse demands placed on grassland to provide ecosystem services, amenity value and systematic breeding as well as providing feed for ruminants...|$|R

25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial <b>ryegrass</b> lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Fungal {{resistance}} to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, coffee bean plant and tomato all show markedly {{lower rates of}} herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. Endophytic fungi show great promise {{as a means of}} indirect biocontrol in large-scale agricultural applications. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The endophyte, either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An endophyte of <b>ryegrass</b> has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores.|$|E

25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial <b>ryegrass</b> and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E
