5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to {{participate}} in the disinvestment from South Africa in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E

25|$|The intense {{guerrilla war}} in far Eastern Pakistan, {{followed}} by India's successful intervention {{led to the}} secession of Eastern contingent as Bangladesh.

25|$|The United States {{and other}} NATO states often ignore this {{sensitive}} issue, likely because of potential effects on their war strategy in Afghanistan. Their involvement could strain relations and jeopardise their own national {{interests in the}} area. This came after the November 2011 NATO bombing in which 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed. In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> incident, Pakistan decided to cut off all NATO supply lines as well as boost border security by installing anti-aircraft guns and radars to monitor air activity. Regarding the Durand Line, some rival maps are said to display discrepancies {{of as much as}} five kilometers.|$|E
25|$|During the 2017 G20 summit, {{which took}} place in Hamburg from 7–8 July that year, protestors clashed violently with the police in the Sternschanze area and {{particularly}} around the Rote Flora. On 7 July, several cars were set on fire and street barricades were erected to prevent the police from entering the area. In <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> the police made heavy use of water cannons and tear gas in order to scatter the protestors. However, this was met with strong resistance by protestors, resulting in a total of 160 injured police and 75 arrested participants in the protests.|$|E

After the war in 1897, the Ottoman Empire {{embarked}} on a program of naval expansion for its fleet and as a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> in 1909, the cruiser Georgios Averof was bought from Italy. In 1910, an English naval mission arrived, headed by Admiral Tuffnel, in order to recommend improvements in the organization and training of the navy. The mission led {{to the adoption of}} the English style of management, organization and training, especially in the area of strategy.|$|E
25|$|Occupy Wall Street (itself {{inspired}} by the Arab Spring began on September 17, 2011, sparking a wave of public encampments {{that came to be}} known as the Occupy Movement. Students at Harvard began organizing in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> movement, and began to collaborate with the Occupy Boston encampment established on September 30, 2011. Harvard workers, many of them members of Local 615 (SEIU) and Local 26 (UNITE HERE!), also joined with Occupy Boston and helped to plan Occupy Harvard. The Harvard Crimson generally opposed the Occupy actions, and defended police officers who arrested Harvard students at Occupy Boston.|$|E

It passed the House on a vote of 250 to 175 on December 15, 2010. On December 18, 2010, the Senate voted to end debate on its {{version of the bill}} by a cloture vote of 63–33. The final Senate vote was held later that same day, with the measure passing by a vote of 65–31.|$|E

25|$|Mother Mechtilde of the Blessed Sacrament pioneered {{perpetual}} {{adoration of}} the Eucharist on request of Père Picotte. Père Picotte was the confessor of Anne of Austria who {{asked him for}} a vow for the deliverance of France from war and the order was formed in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> vow. A small house was bought on Rue Feron in Paris and a Benedictine convent, founded for this purpose, began perpetual adoration there on 25 March 1654, one or more nuns kneeling {{in front of the}} altar in adoration each hour of the day and night. The simple Benedictine rules with which the nuns started were amended and formal approval for perpetual adoration was provided by the Camera Apostolica in Rome in 1705.|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-profile}} actors {{refused to}} join SAG initially. This changed when the producers {{made an agreement}} amongst themselves not to bid competitively for talent. A pivotal meeting, {{at the home of}} Frank Morgan (Ralph's brother, who played the title role in The Wizard of Oz), was what gave SAG its critical mass. Prompted by Eddie Cantor's insistence, at that meeting, that any <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> producer's agreement help all actors, not just the already established ones, it took only three weeks for SAG membership to go from around 80 members to more than 4,000. Cantor's participation was critical, particularly because of his friendship with the recently elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After several years and the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the producers agreed to negotiate with SAG in 1937.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the century, Jews from Eastern Europe arrived in the South End. While their synagogues and other {{cultural}} institutions were located in other neighborhoods to the north, many were tradesmen who established shops on South Pearl and other streets. Development that may have been a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> influx took place primarily to the south and west of the established blocks, in the blocks between Second and Third that had been laid out when they were still Groesbeckville, and the blocks west of Elizabeth Street. As had happened elsewhere in the city when similar areas along the bluff overlooking the river had been developed, the ravines were filled in and the streams that flowed through them diverted or buried in tunnels, a move which lessened the flooding closer to the river.|$|E

25|$|The Socialist Party of Great Britain {{was founded}} in 1904 as a split from the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). It was formed to oppose the SDF’s reformism {{and as part of}} a <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> organisation's {{domination}} by H. M. Hyndman (which also led to the SPGB's aversion to leadership). This split was also partly a reaction to the SDF's involvement in the Labour Representation Committee which went on to found the Labour Party. It mirrored the split that led to the foundation of the Socialist League, stemming from an ongoing dispute within the socialist movement over tactics and the question of reform or revolution. The founders of the SPGB considered themselves {{to be part of a}} wider impossibilist revolt within the Second International. When in 1903 most of SDF members in Scotland broke away to form the Socialist Labour Party, without contacting their fellow impossibilists in London those impossibilists, chiefly in Battersea branch, decided to break away and form their own organisation, which they did the following year. Unlike the Socialist League, however, the SPGB advocated the revolutionary use of the ballot box and parliament.|$|E
