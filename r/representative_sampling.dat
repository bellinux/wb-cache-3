40|$|An {{obstacle}} to conducting economic studies of marine sport anglers is the difficulty and expense in drawing a <b>representative</b> <b>sample.</b> Unlike inland fishing, where licenses are required in all states, only selected states require a marine sport fishing license and these licenses usually only cover selected marine fishing activities. Currently, {{there are no}} low cost methods of obtaining a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of marine anglers because they are generally not licensed, use multiple access points, and represent {{a small proportion of}} the general population. The difficulty and expense of drawing a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> may have stifled attempts to study marine anglers. We test alternative sampling strategies by comparing the characteristics of a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of experienced marine anglers with the characteristics of two other samples using multivariate and univariate analysis techniques. We conclude a sample of marine anglers drawn from the population of licensed inland anglers is not significantly different from the <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of experienced marine anglers.

40|$|Any computable {{function}} may {{be viewed}} as a “generalization” of a finite function. Specifically, there is a “sample” (finite subset) of such that every minimal program for the sample is a program for. Like the representation of a function by a program, its representation by a sample is machine dependent. However, relative to any finite number of machines on which is programmable, there is a sample of which represents for each of the machines. On the other hand, given a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of, the values of for arguments in its domain can only be found in the limit in general. If it is known that some program length b suffices for a function, then an upper bound can be effectively inferred from b on the cardinality of any <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of which does not contain redundant elements. Conversely, a bound on <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> “size” (interpreted not as cardinality, but as a finite-one function of finite functions) effectively supplies a bound on requisite program length. Apart from these general considerations, certain detailed relationships between <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> and minimal programs are also developed. For example, it is shown that any decision function with a <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> of l elements can be programmed with no more than (4 + [log 2 m]) (l − 1) + c bits, where the largest argument appearing in the <b>representative</b> <b>sample</b> is m bits long. Such bounds can be interpreted as bounds on the information-theoretic complexity of the <b>representative</b> <b>samples</b> (finite functions) concerned...|$|R

25|$|When {{census data}} cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by {{developing}} specific experiment designs and survey samples. <b>Representative</b> <b>sampling</b> assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend {{from the sample}} to {{the population as a}} whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.|$|E
25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. <b>Representative</b> <b>sampling</b> assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.|$|E

Mattea later noted that [...] "there were no budgets" [...] when she was {{recording}} the album, as {{she was unable to}} afford a $75 makeup session, and the front cover featured her wearing a jacket which she had purchased at Kmart.

2500|$|At 10:15 pm on July 2, {{a random}} {{sampling}} of 7,263 polling places (out of an original <b>representative</b> <b>sampling</b> of 7,636 polling places) was selected. Three statistical tests {{were performed on}} the sampling. A [...] "robust" [...] test, meant to provide conservative estimates as controls for the other two methods; a classic test; and a Bayesian test. The robust test predicted Calderón would get between 35.25% and 37.4% of the vote, versus 34.24% to 36.38% for López Obrador. The classic test predicted 35.68% to 36.53% for Calderón, versus 34.97% to 35.7% for López Obrador. The Bayesian test predicted Calderón with 35.77% to 36.40% versus López Obrador with 35.07% to 35.63% (see page 24 in the official report). Only the Bayesian test gave definitive results, but with a distance between intervals of less than 0.15%. Around 11 pm Luis Carlos Ugalde announced on live television that the technical committee had concluded the difference too small and that the race {{was too close to}} call. As per the original prior agreement between IFE and all political parties, Ugalde did not divulge the results of the Quick Count. Later that night, the representatives of the PAN and the Coalition For the Good of All requested that the results from the Quick Count be made public, while the representative of the Alliance for Mexico (the PRI and PVEM alliance whose candidate was Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who finished a distant third) requested that the prior agreement of confidentiality be respected. Contradictory rumors of whom the count had favored were beginning to surface, and the official report was released a few days later to the press and through the IFE's website to quash them.|$|E
2500|$|Statistical {{techniques}} such as sampling and weighting can reduce data gathering expenses while surveying, although it requires careful attention by statisticians. For example, census counts are rather straightforward in a statistical sense since it is a straight count of bodies, purchases, opinions, actions. But it is expensive to interview everybody. And there are many non-census topics requiring further study which the agency is asked to do. One way to reduce costs is by selecting smaller samples which hopefully represent the population being studied. This is a highly cost-effective way to get accurate information. Choosing a good sample sometimes requires complex statistical work {{to make sure the}} sample is, indeed, truly representative of the population under study. If conditions do not permit <b>representative</b> <b>sampling</b> but known benchmark statistics are known (possibly from earlier census data), it's still possible to generate accurate information by weighting the data to distort it back, so to speak, to compensate for the distortion caused by the unrepresentative sample. For example, suppose an area of Wellington has a known percentage of women—say 53% -- which is believed to be accurate from a previous census count; a study is done a few years later; a sample is chosen; questionnaires are processed; but of the returning questionnaires, 57% are women. It's possible statistically to give men slightly greater weight to account for the discrepancy, and the result is more accurate data. The agency discusses different methodologies on its website. A statement explains why weighting is sometimes necessary: [...] "Statistics New Zealand is improving the methodology used for the 2001 Household Economic Survey through the use of integrated weighting. This is a relatively recently developed method of adjusting the statistical output of a survey to match population benchmarks. In particular, it takes account of undercoverage in the survey of specified population groups. Integrated weighting improves the robustness and accuracy of survey estimates. It also reduces the effect of bias in estimates resulting from undercoverage, as well as reducing the level of sampling error for benchmark variables." ...|$|E

Work-sampling methods were used to select momentary time samples from the full time-of-interest, which produced <b>representative</b> <b>samples.</b> However, work sampling required impractically high numbers of time <b>samples</b> to obtain <b>representative</b> <b>samples.</b> More practical momentary time <b>samples</b> produced less <b>representative</b> <b>samples,</b> particularly for low-duration behaviors.
