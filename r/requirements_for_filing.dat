File organizations from representative computers in each class are examined in detail: the IBM System/ 370 (OS/ 370) and the Harris 1600 Distributed Processing System with the Extended Communications Operating System (ECOS). In order to establish the basic framework for comparison, an introduction to file organizations is presented. Additionally, the functional <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>file</b> organizations are described by their characteristics and user demands.

5000|$|File {{contiguity}} is a {{more practical}} <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>file</b> sequences than just their locality of reference, because it {{is related to the}} storage medium hosting the whole sequence than to the sequence itself (or its metadata).

At [...] "low level", each file in a contiguous sequence must be placed in contiguous blocks, in spite of reserved areas or special metadata required by the filesystem (like inodes or inter-sector headers) actually interleaving them.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFile {{transfer}} acts {{an increasing}} role in digital TV studios {{and especially for}} their interconnections. Using adequate file formats to exchange data presents several advantages: low transfer cost and efficient handling of both essence and metadata. Many new file formats have been introduced to cope with system and user requirements. Meanwhile new user <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>file</b> transfer have also evolved, requesting enhanced transfers capabilities, which takes full advantages of the recently defined exchange formats and architectures. The goal of this work is to specify an optimised transfer mechanism, this mechanism is integrated in a unified framework managing digital TV content. Our transfer mechanism provides an abstraction level for different network infrastructures and protocols in a seamless way, taking advantage {{of each of these}} technologies. For example, multicast and QoS features are supported and managed, as far as they are provided by the underlying network interfaces. Moreover, striped and partial Media Asset transfers are handled independently of the network infrastructures, at the Application layer...|$|R

30|$|A. How to get initial inputs? Most {{state-of-the-art}} coverage-based fuzzers {{employ a}} mutation based testcase generation strategy, which heavily {{depend on the}} quality of initial seed inputs. Good initial seed inputs can significantly improve the efficient and effectiveness of fuzzing. Specifically, (1) providing well format seed inputs could save lots of cpu times consumed by constructing one, (2) good initial inputs could meet the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> complicated <b>file</b> format, which are hard to guess in the mutation phase, (3) mutation based on well format seed input is more likely to generate testcases that could reach deeper and hard to reach paths, (4) good seed inputs could be reused during multiple test.|$|R

40|$|A {{multimedia}} {{file system}} supports diverse application classes that access data with heterogeneous characteristics. In this paper, we describe our {{experiences in the}} design and implementation of the Symphony multimedia file system. We first discuss various methodologies <b>for</b> designing multimedia <b>file</b> systems and examine their tradeoffs. We examine the design <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> such <b>file</b> systems and argue that, to efficiently manage the heterogeneity in application requirements and data characteristics, a multimedia file system should enable the coexistence of multiple data type-specific and application-specific techniques. We describe the architecture and novel features of Symphony and then demonstrate their efficacy through an experimental evaluation. Our results show that Symphony yields a factor of 1. 9 improvement in text response time over conventional disk scheduling algorithms, while continuing to meet the real-time requirements of video clients. Finally, we reflect upon the lessons learned from the Symphony project...|$|R
40|$|Most {{organizations}} process flat files regularly. There {{are different}} options <b>for</b> processing <b>files,</b> including SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), BizTalk, SQL import job, and other Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. All of these options have very strict <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>file</b> formats. If {{the format of}} the file changes, all of these options throw a catastrophic error, and implementing a fix to handle the new format is difficult. With each of the methods, the new format needs to be configured in the development environment, and the data flow must be modified to process all of the changes. Due to the inflexibility of options in processing flat files, there was a request by Dr. Corliss to build an alternative solution. The team of Ivan Paez, Niharika Jain, and Brandon Krugman created an alternative solution called FileParser. While the solution originally was built {{to meet the needs of}} Dr. Corliss and the GasDay team at Marquette University, the end result was a file parser that allows additional flexibility in processing of a variety of flat file formats. This thesis provides an alternative way to parse data, transform a flat file, and consume the data into a generic format; this process is called Provider Processing. Provider File Processing consists of the FileParser command line executable handling the file parsing and data transformation. After FileParser generates a provider output file, a health insurance domain-specific command line executable called DelegatedProviderProcessing performs data cleansing, address normalization, and imports the provider output file into an internal database. The difference between the strict format examples and Provider Processing is that if {{the format of the}} input files change, Provider Processing can adapt to the change with minimal work being completed...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of formally and incrementally specifying requirements is discussed. An approach based on LOTOS (Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification) is proposed that exploits desirable {{characteristics of the}} constraint-oriented style.

Small introductory examples lead to the incremental specification of a file access system using the approach in the paper.

40|$|File carving is an {{important}} technique for digital forensics investigation and for simple data recovery. By using a database of headers and footers (essentially, strings of bytes at predictable offsets) <b>for</b> specific <b>file</b> types, file carvers can retrieve files from raw disk images, regardless {{of the type of}} filesystem on the disk image. Perhaps more importantly, file carving is possible even if the filesystem metadata has been destroyed. This paper presents some <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> high performance <b>file</b> carving, derived during design and implementation of Scalpel, a new open source file carving application. Scalpel runs on machines with only modest resources and performs carving operations very rapidly, outperforming most, perhaps all, of the current generation of carving tools.
