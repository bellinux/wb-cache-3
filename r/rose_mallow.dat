5000|$|In the kakemono hanging scroll called [...] "Autumn Flowers in a Bamboo Basket", the Nanga artist Yosa Buson (1716-1783) painted an {{bouquet of}} autumn flowers {{standing}} in a tall Chinese-style bamboo basket with a rounded handle. The depicted flowers are chrysanthemums (kiku), Chinese bellflowers (kikyō), and <b>rose</b> <b>mallows</b> (fuyō) and are in full bloom in autumn. They are all therefore associated in traditional Japanese poetry with this season. The artist used a technique called sumi-nijimi, or [...] "ink blurring", for rendering the flowers. Here he applied brushstrokes {{to the surface of}} ink washes before they dried, creating a soft texturing effect. For the texture of the plaited bamboo basket he used short horizontal strokes in dark ink to contrast it with the evocative flowers.|$|R

50|$|Line Renaud {{does not}} develop hips {{and does not}} {{self-clean}} in cold or damp weather. Bauer and Grothe suggest planting the rose in small groups and near to seats because of its fragrance. Barlage suggests a combination with garden heliotrope, sweet alyssum, and trumpet lilies. Bauer and Grothe propose combining the rose with <b>rose</b> <b>mallow.</b> Cut flowers of Line Renaud last for a week. The cultivar can grow excessive shoots and gives a middling appearance in a container.|$|E
