Although the same considerations apply in stellarators, by convention the inverse value is used, the <b>rotational</b> <b>transform,</b> or i.|$|E
50|$|A {{fractional}} transform is {{one that}} rotates around a circle. For instance, the ordinary Fourier transform can be applied at most four times before it starts repeating. In some cases, it will start repeating after only two times. But the fractional transform repeats after a thousand times; it goes around in a circle. Unfortunately it is poorly named, and will be called a <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> {{for the remainder of}} this article.|$|E
50|$|These {{rotational}} transforms {{are connected}} to the theory of Riemann surfaces. For instance, eix is a circle, but the inverse function ln(z) is not one-to-one. This can be solved by allowing ln(z) to operate on a helical surface instead. Similarly, the rotational transforms are parameterized by a circle, but the inverse <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> is not one-to-one. This can be solved by interpreting the input as a helix as well.|$|E

50|$|One {{notices that}} the Fourier {{transform}} is not immediately {{apparent in the}} previous examples. It can be brought in by thinking in the very same way {{of a set of}} frequencies. The usual basis for the frequency domain isIf one constructs this basis insteadthen it is nested, and it can be turned into a lattice. The Fourier transform exchanges frequency/time, convolution/multiplication, gcd/lcm, mod q/mod p, and so forth. This is the same as turning the lattice upside down, or turning subset into superset. Making this into a rotational helix is analogous to making the circle into a helix for the inverse <b>rotational</b> <b>transforms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The H-1 {{flexible}} Heliac is a three field-period helical axis stellarator {{located in}} the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low current ripple allows precise control of the ratio of secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, toroidal) coil currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> profile, magnetic well). The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} limitation {{that the}} two straight sections cannot intersect means that the <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> within the loop is not a perfect 180 degrees, but typically closer to 135 degrees. This led to alternate designs {{in an effort to}} get the angle closer to 180. An early attempt was built into the Stellarator B-2, which had both curved sections lying flat in relation to the ground, but at different levels above it. The formerly straight sections had additional curves inserted, two sections of about 45 degrees, so they now formed extended S-shapes. This allowed them to route around each other while being perfectly symmetrical in terms of angles.|$|E

Magnetic {{surfaces}} are created using only 4 electromagnetic coils - two interlocking coils inside the chamber, and two poloidal field coils outside the chamber. The two interlocking coils have a radius of [...]405m, and the angle between them can be manually selected to be 64°, 78°, or 88°, allowing for different shear and <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> values, and magnetic surface configuration. The poloidal field coils have a radius of 1.08 m. The coils are powered by a 200 kW power supply and are capable of producing magnetic fields of 0.01-0.2T.

40|$|THE {{clinical}} {{skills of}} medical professionals rely strongly on {{the sense of}} touch, combined with anatomical and diagnostic knowledge. Haptic exploratory procedures allow the expert to detect anomalies via gross and fine palpation, squeezing, and contour following. Haptic feedback is also key to medical interventions, for example when an anaesthetist inserts an epidural needle, a surgeon makes an incision, a dental surgeon drills into a carious lesion, or a veterinarian sutures a wound. Yet, current trends in medical technology and training methods involve less haptic feedback to clinicians and trainees. For example, minimally invasive surgery removes the direct contact between the patient and clinician that gives rise to natural haptic feedback, and furthermore introduces scaling and <b>rotational</b> <b>transforms</b> that confuse the relationship between movements of the hand and the surgical site. Similarly, {{it is thought that}} computer-based medical simulation and training systems require high-resolution and realistic haptic feedback to the trainee for significant training transfer to occur. The science and technology of haptics thus has great potential to affect the performance of medical procedures and learning of clinical skills. This special section is about understandin...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{was a way}} to modify the torus layout so that it {{addressed}} Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the drift caused by the magnet windings being too close together {{on one side of the}} device would be counteracted by them being too far apart on the other. The particles would alternately drift one way and then the other. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross-sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ... A <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> may be generated either by a solenoidal field in a twisted, or figure-eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.|$|E

40|$|The global ideal {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) stability for {{a proposed}} compact quasi-axisymmetric stellarator CHS-qa {{has been investigated}} taking the effect of bootstrap current into account. Assuming experimentally achievable density and temperature profiles, the stability properties of global low-n modes have been studied by using three-dimensional numerical codes based on fixed boundary MHD equilibria including self-consistent bootstrap current for the CHS-qa reference configuration. Consequently {{it has been shown}} that values of edge <b>rotational</b> <b>transform</b> play a crucial role in triggering external kink instability. Concerning a lot of other possibilities in experimental practice to change the total parallel current, we have also studied equilibria with increased or decreased parallel current, but fixed profile.
