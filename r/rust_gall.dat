50|$|Pine-pine <b>gall</b> <b>rust</b> is {{especially}} important in areas containing large stands of pine species due to ability of the causal fungus to infect other pines without first infecting an alternate host. Pine-pine <b>gall</b> <b>rust</b> is economically significant because of its detrimental effects on lumber content, quality, and growth rate.

Severe outbreaks in natural stands and plantations of P. contorta, P. ponderosa, P. banksiana, and P. sylvestris have been observed in regions of Canada. In the US, the most significant damage occurs in commercial stands of P. contorta in the Rocky Mountains. The disease is also significant due to its negative impact on the aesthetic quality of specimen trees in public gardens, arboretums, and residential areas. Christmas tree farms growing Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, and P. ponderosa are also at high risk of infection.

50|$|Symptoms of pine-pine <b>gall</b> <b>rust</b> can {{be quite}} {{conspicuous}} and are useful for diagnostic identification. The most prominent symptoms are hip cankers and swollen, spherical to oblong growths (galls) on the branches, stems, or main trunk of the host. The galls on small twigs of 1-2 years of age are often pear-shaped. Gall formation results from the overproduction of xylem tissue stimulated by the fungus. Witches brooming occasionally occurs along with galling. The bark on large galls will slough off over time, exposing the smooth wood beneath. Signs of pine-pine <b>gall</b> <b>rust</b> include the pale yellow aecia (1-8mm in diameter) formed on galls in spring {{as well as the}} yellow-orange aeciospores contained within. Immature galls are spindle-shaped. Infections usually occur on more succulent (thick) branches. When mature, galls can grow as large as a softball (30.5 cm circumference), but most are the size of a golf ball (4.2 cm). Before the production of spores, the needles on highly infected branches become chlorotic or red, eventually turning brown when the branch dies. Western <b>gall</b> <b>rust</b> can cause dwarfing to occur if leader stem of younger pines are infected. Early identification of the disease is important for treatment, but is often hard to diagnose due to the inconspicuous initial symptoms and a lack of galls until the second year.
