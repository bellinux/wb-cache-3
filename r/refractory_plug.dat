50|$|The Kerr Jetstream {{incorporated}} several updates {{including the}} available belt-driven fan replacing the Electrolux vacuum cleaner motor originally used. A removable <b>refractory</b> <b>plug</b> allowing {{access to the}} tunnel was added {{in the back of}} the unit. An updated control panel was adopted and the option of an electronic panel was added.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operator}} of the cupola {{is known as}} the [...] "cupola tender" [...] or [...] "furnace master". During the operation of a tapped cupola (cupolas may vary in this regard) the tender observes the amount of iron rising in the well of the cupola. When the metal level is sufficiently high, the cupola tender opens the [...] "tap hole" [...] to let the metal flow into a ladle or other container to hold the molten metal. When enough metal is drawn off the [...] "tap hole" [...] is plugged with a <b>refractory</b> <b>plug</b> made of clay.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "casthouse" [...] at {{the bottom}} half of the furnace {{contains}} the bustle pipe, water cooled copper tuyeres and the equipment for casting the liquid iron and slag. Once a [...] "taphole" [...] is drilled through the <b>refractory</b> clay <b>plug,</b> liquid iron and slag flow down a trough through a [...] "skimmer" [...] opening, separating the iron and slag. Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two casthouses. Once the pig iron and slag has been tapped, the taphole is again <b>plugged</b> with <b>refractory</b> clay.|$|R
