40|$|Tubal {{catheterization}} {{procedures have}} become {{standard of care}} as a primary treatment of proximal tubal occlusions. They successfully utilize a variety of catheter techniques, though all usually include a <b>wire</b> <b>guide.</b> This raises the question whether <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> catheterizations alone {{can be used to}} treat proximal tubal occlusions. We therefore investigated consecutively 25 women with at least one proximally occluded oviduct by attempting <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulations bilaterally in 10 and unilaterally in 12 women with two tubes and in three women with a single tube. Among the 10 patients with bilateral occlusion, seven were recanalized bilaterally (70 %), one unilaterally (10 %) and two not at all (20 %). Among the 15 patients with unilateral tubal occlusion, 12 (80 %) were recanalized. In total, 27 out of 35 (77 %) obstructed oviducts were recanalized. In a follow-up period of 5 - 17 months only one pregnancy was, however, recorded and this was a tubal pregnancy. We conclude that <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulation of proximally obstructed tubes achieves tubal patency in a large percentage of cases, comparable to other catheter techniques reported in the literature. In contrast to those, however, <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulations alone result in much lower pregnancy rates. This observation strongly suggests that <b>wire</b> <b>guides,</b> used with co-axial and balloon catheter systems, are not responsible for the pregnancy success reported for these procedures. <b>Wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulation alone does not therefore represent adequate treatment for patients with proximally occluded Fallopian tubes.

50|$|Starting {{from the}} second layer, the {{relocation}} is facilitated, since the <b>wire</b> is <b>guided</b> through the inter-spaces of the preceding layer. In case of deflections that are not too excessive {{as far as the}} process is concerned, the wire leads itself and with a constant number of windings per layer. It means for the <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> movement that the smaller the distance of the <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> nozzle towards the coil, the more precise the tracking must be. In certain circumstances it can be completely performed without a relocating movement, if the distance from the nozzle to the coil is that long that the force component against the guiding behavior of the wire itself has no longer an effect. Due to the self-guiding behavior of the wire, it is therefore possible that also during orthocyclic winding the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> can run continually and does not need to follow gradually.|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} left main {{bronchus}} intubation was developed {{based on a}} wire guide-based microscopic endotrachael mouse intubation technique. The authors used a 22 G x 1 inch catheter elongated by a 38 -mm silicone tube, and a <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> with a tag to assign {{the length of the}} wire completely covered by the silicon tube. The isoflurane-anesthetized mouse was hung perpendicularly with its incisors on a thread and transorally intubated under strict vision with the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> tip advanced 3 mm out of the catheter. Then the catheter was advanced about 6 to 8 mm into the trachea. Afterwards the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> was redrawn {{to the level of the}} catheter tip (blue tag on the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> appeared at the upper end of catheter) to prevent injury. Then the neck was pushed into a right lateral flexion with one finger against a foam block fixed on the vertical plate, causing a straight distance between mouth and left main bronchus. This positioning allows to gently advance the catheter into the left main bronchus by another about 20 mm, using the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> with its tip just within the tube, to achieve there a wedge position with gentle pressure. The technique had a success rate of more than 80 % in 81 mice weighing 23 to 48 g. It may be of interest for unilateral lung intervention, e. g., with injurious substances or with drugs...|$|R

50|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are {{an example}} of an {{application}} for biomedical coatings. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are used in coronary angioplasty to correct the effects of coronary artery disease, a disease that allows plaque build up {{on the walls of the}} arteries. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> <b>guides</b> the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are commonly made from stainless steel or Nitinol and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the <b>guide</b> <b>wire's</b> movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{separation}} between <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> and rotation of the component to be wound, the configuration of product and <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> can be duplicated in the linear winding technology. Therefore, it is possible, e.g., to wind onto 20 spindles simultaneously.

The linear winding technology is often applied efficiently where low-mass coil bodies have to be wound.|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar a eficiência dos guias de orientação rotacional utilizados na realização da artroplastia total do joelho. Avaliar a possível correlação entre o eixo anatômico pré-operatório e a capacidade do guia em posicionar corretamente o componente. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliadas 64 artroplastias confrontando a orientação sugerida pelo guia com aquela mostrada pela linha de Whiteside. Os casos de divergência foram registrados e confrontados com o eixo anatômico pré-operatório. RESULTADO: Não houve divergências entre o alinhamento rotacional medido pelos dois métodos nos joelhos alinhados e naqueles com alinhamento em varo. Foram encontradas divergências entre o alinhamento rotacional sugerido pelo guia e aquele mostrado pela linha de Whiteside em sete dos 64 joelhos (10, 93 %). Em todos os pacientes com discrepância, o alinhamento pré-operatório era valgo. CONCLUSÃO: Os guias de orientação rotacional do componente femoral na artroplastia total do joelho mostraram-se coincidentes com a orientação obtida pela linha de Whiteside nos joelhos com eixo anatômico em varo e naqueles alinhados. Nos joelhos com eixo anatômico em valgo, a referência dos guias não se mostrou coincidente com aquela sugerida pela mesma linha.

A 0. 014 in. hydrophilic <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> (HI-TORQUE WHISPER MS Guide Wire™, Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was fractured during PCI trying to pass a microcatheter Corsair™ (ASAHI INTEC, Seto, Japan).
