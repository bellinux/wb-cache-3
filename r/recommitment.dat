In response, school administrators and faculty developed the [...] "City Forever" [...] strategic plan in 1965–66. The performance improvement plan also served as a call to action for the school community, resulting in formal recommendations from the Alumni Association, a series of student-led demonstrations, newspaper articles and television news segments produced by alumni working as media professionals, letters-to-the-editors of local newspapers submitted by parents and teachers, and routine public comments in support of City College at School Board meetings. The public outcry stunned city leadership, which resulted in the district announcing a <b>recommitment</b> to Baltimore City College and its unique role as the selective flagship high school of Baltimore.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1856, as {{the drought}} continued, {{the trials and}} {{difficulties}} {{of the previous year}} led to an explosion of intense soul searching. Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice in the extended community, preached three days of fiery sermons to the people of Kaysville, Utah territory. He called for repentance and a general <b>recommitment</b> to moral living and religious teachings. 500 people presented themselves for [...] "rebaptism" [...] a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism.|$|E

40|$|Incarceration impacts {{families}} {{in a number}} of different ways ranging from emotional distress, economic challenges, and social stigma. The purpose of this analysis was to explore how men‟s perceptions of support from their partners during incarceration and community reentry shape intimate partnerships. Using secondary data content analysis, a sample of 20 fathers from the Fathers and Families Resource and Research Center study dataset has been examined (Roy, 2002 - 2004). Using family stress theory and symbolic interactionism, qualitative methods were used to examine life history interviews. Interviews were coded for themes related to past incarceration, intimate partnerships, and social support. Overall, men reported feeling supported in their roles as partners across their relationship trajectories and support shifted occurred from their roles as romantic partners to their roles as co-parents. Community reentry was an especially significant time that support mattered due to the <b>recommitments</b> that many made to fatherhood during this process...|$|R

Jones, a visiting professor at Stanford University, said the Beck rally seemed to be tasteful and did not appear to distort King's message, which included a <b>recommitment</b> to religious values. James Freeman, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote positively about the rally, remarking that [...] "the day was largely devoted to expressions of gratitude for the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers, for great men of American history like the Rev.

After noting how the crowd refused to boo when Dave Roever gave the closing prayer thanking God for President Obama and members of Congress, Freeman theorized that [...] "between Saturday's crowd in Washington and the tea partiers agitating for limited government, we may be witnessing the rebuilding of the Reagan coalition, the fusion of religious and economic conservatives." [...] Fox News host Bill O'Reilly described it as an [...] "appeal for a return to Judeo-Christian values" [...] and called it [...] "a huge victory for Glenn Beck and Americans who believe that his message of honor and dignity is worthwhile."

50|$|A {{period of}} intense {{fighting}} followed {{resulting in the}} deaths of at least 263 guerrillas and 27 South Africans. Tense and rushed negotiations at Mount Etjo, a safari lodge in central Namibia, ended with a <b>recommitment</b> from both sides to the peace process and the leader of SWAPO, Sam Nujoma, calling for all SWAPO fighters to return to their bases in Angola. However, the SADF maintained positions very close to UNTAG collection points for SWAPO fighters and most therefore refused to approach and rejected UNTAG escorts. Clashes continued between SADF troops and SWAPO forces claiming to be returning to Angola. A new agreement was reached on 20 April 1989 when SADF forces withdrew to base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO forces to withdraw peacefully. The SADF then had two weeks to confirm that SWAPO had indeed left Namibia and also to capture any weapons caches discovered.|$|E
50|$|In legislatures, a quorum call {{is used to}} {{determine}} if a quorum is present. Since attendance at debates is not mandatory in most legislatures, it is often the case that a quorum of members is not present while debate is ongoing. In many bodies, motions such as amendments, introduction of new legislation, and <b>recommitment</b> may be approved {{in the absence of a}} quorum, provided no member then present objects. A member wishing to delay proceedings (for example, to allow other members time to get to the chamber in order to join debate) may request that the presiding officer determine whether a quorum is present. If a quorum does not appear to be present, debate is suspended, as the only business allowed without a quorum is to adjourn, recess, summon absent members, or compel their attendance if the body has the power to do so.|$|E
5000|$|Alabama {{currently}} holds two commitments for its 2016 recruiting class: JUCO swingman Ar'Mond Davis, {{who announced}} {{his commitment to}} Alabama on Twitter on September 23, 2015, after decommitting from Memphis earlier that month, and four-star forward Braxton Key (formerly Braxton Blackwell), who committed to the Tide over his hometown school, Vanderbilt, as well as Kansas and Texas, on October 21, 2015. On August 17, 2015, consensus five-star wing and McDonald's All-American Terrance Ferguson committed to Alabama. However, as Key and Davis signed their letters of commitment to the Capstone in November during the early signing period, Ferguson hesitated, causing numerous rumors to circulate questioning {{the strength of his}} commitment. Eventually, on March 1, Ferguson's high school basketball coach informed the media that the top-20 recruit had decided to decommit from Alabama and reopen his recruitment. He did not rule out a possible <b>recommitment</b> to Alabama, however, so now the Crimson Tide is competing with Kansas and others to land Ferguson.Additional sources: ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1925 the Liberals, {{although}} {{maintaining a}} separate identity, were attending Nationalist party meetings, where they advocated redistribution reform and a <b>recommitment</b> to [...] "liberal" [...] values. They supported a 1925 redistribution bill that continued rural malapportionment, but soon fell out {{again with the}} Nationalists and began to work more closely with Labor. In early 1926 they {{raised questions about the}} redistribution bill and the government was in danger of defeat, but divisions within their own ranks intervened. Angus, whose seat was no longer threatened, distanced himself; Snowball and Everard joined with Labor to oppose the redistribution; Farthing was offered Nationalist endorsement for the seat of Caulfield and accepted; and Billson's position was unclear due to his illness. At this time the Liberals ceased to operate as a distinct group. At the 1927 state election, Billson retired, Farthing was an endorsed Nationalist, and Snowball, Everard and Angus were re-elected as independent Nationalists. A new Australian Liberal Party filled the resulting gap.|$|E

50|$|The {{second set}} of protests in 1975 against the new {{administration}} headed by President Donald Frederick Hornig {{was in response to}} the proposed 1975-1976 budget.

Forty Black, Asian, and Latino students occupied University Hall for 38 and a half hours in an effort to again assert a <b>recommitment</b> to the 1968 demands. This led to the renaming of the Transitional Summer Program to the Third World Transition Program as well as the establishment of the Third World Center in the basement of Churchill House. The Third World Center was actually established because the Afro House at 227 Bowen was going to be destroyed to create a new dormitory complex, so Churchill basement was proposed as the new quarters. The decision was made, however, to have the Third World Center cater to all Third World students, Black, Latino, Asian, and Native.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} intervention on the order and timing of exit in an international industry with fixed costs and declining demand. A dynamic inconsistency problem arises when policymakers are unable to precommit: they always intervene to prolong {{the life of the}} local firm even when this is not socially optimal. The effect of tariff intervention is in all cases to terminate production prematurely and in many cases to reverse the order of exit. Intervention in the absence of <b>recommitment</b> is never first best and actually reduces welfare when the differential between firms' fixed costs is large.
