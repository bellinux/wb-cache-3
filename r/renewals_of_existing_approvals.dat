40|$|The {{infrastructure}} in the Netherlands {{is crucial for}} economic development on a national scale. Dramatic increases of transport and mobility accelerate ageing of infrastructure. The GNP of the Netherlands is strongly related to transport and to the two main ports (Port of Rotterdam and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol). The Netherlands is used to a high standard of infrastructure and expectations of the Dutch are that this will continue. But {{in the public mind}} new capital works are predominating and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> infrastructure is taken for granted. This paper focuses on the maintenance and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> infrastructure. The economic growth and finance conditions, that gave rise to its initial development, has changed and financing <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> and acquisition <b>of</b> new projects needs to be accomplished in a new and more complex economic climate. In order to provide a reliable, well-manufactured infrastructure, which satisfies public expectations, planning of the necessary activities should be carried out on tactical as well as strategical levels. The research is based on systems theory, and conditions for effective control are developed. The conceptual model is validated in real life cases in the Netherlands. The result of the research {{could be used as a}} framework for controlled, tactical asset management processes. It involves the application of detailed asset management processes, procedures and standards. This allows development of sub-plans for the allocation of natural, physical and financial resources, which may serve to achieve strategic goals by meeting defined levels of service.

40|$|Across Australia, city {{planners}} {{are focusing on}} urban renewal as a major driver for change both to provide additional housing for growing urban populations and to implement widely accepted principles of sustainability. The dominant model involves <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> urban areas along transport corridors and hubs, particularly in and around activity concentrations such as existing town centres. The compact city – ‘building up’ rather than ‘building out’ – has become the planning orthodoxy of the 21 st century {{in most of the}} world. Over a long period, efforts to implement urban consolidation and densification policies have focused on <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> former industrial land often located in central locations. As the availability of these sites slowly diminish, there is an emerging recognition that implementing these policies in areas identified for renewal will require a reworking <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> residential areas in Sydney. While there have always been complications in the implementation <b>of</b> major urban <b>renewal</b> plans related to the often fragmented ownership structure of urban land and competing claims over its use, <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> strata titled housing enters new, and largely untested, territory. Not only do renewal plans face the challenges of complex horizontal land subdivisions, strata title has effectively created a further vertical subdivision on each land parcel. Given the role multi-unit housing plays within the Sydney housing market, the potential social and economic impacts are significant. This report provides base line information identifying the location, scale, market value, and social profile of the strata sector across greater metropolitan Sydney. This information was used to inform later stages of the project, including a community survey of strata residents and owners across the greater Sydney metropolitan area, and stakeholder and community scenario testing workshops. The community workshops will be based in six different locations across Sydney. Each location is identified and profiled in this report. Results from the community survey and stakeholder and community workshops will be published in a subsequent report. • This report is based on research funded by an Australian Research Council Grant No. LP 130100400 and is being undertaken by the City Futures Research Centre at the UNSW Australia in partnership with UrbanGrowth NSW, Strata Community Australia (NSW), Australian College of Community Association Lawyers, The Owners Corporation Network of Australia and NSW Fair Trading...|$|R

40|$|In {{developed}} countries, localized {{learning in}} clusters {{of small and}} medium-sized firms is seen as beneficial for innovation in these firms. This paper questions whether such a situation is also true for small firms in developing countries. By examining 90 furniture manufacturers {{in the district of}} Jepara (Indonesia) we observe knowledge access mainly through one-sided local learning mechanisms, e. g. in-house learning-by-doing and informal contacts with buyers (contractors). This pattern tends to cause a dominance of product innovation (changes in design) and low levels of newness, and points to a lack of advantages from local learning. The major principle behind this {{is the way in which}} subcontracting relations are structured. However, the furniture manufacturers in Jepara are willing to connect with global knowledge, but financial obstacles prevent a change. This situation calls for the establishment <b>of</b> centres or <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>existing</b> centres where global knowledge can be accessed e. g. through the Internet, and support can be given in absorption of the new knowledge. ...|$|R
