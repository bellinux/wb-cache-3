5000|$|The <b>red</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus cucullatus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. This finch is {{a resident}} breeding bird in tropical South America in northern Colombia and northern Venezuela (where it's called [...] "cardenalito"). The introduced population on Trinidad {{is believed to be}} extinct, with no sightings since 1960.|$|E
50|$|First bred in the 1920s, it is {{the only}} colour canary that has an element of red as part of its plumage. It was {{developed}} as a cross between another type of finch, the now endangered Venezuelan <b>red</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus cucullata), and a yellow domestic canary (Serinus canaria).|$|E
50|$|In June 2016, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} from the <b>Red</b> <b>Siskin</b> Initiative, a conservation partnership between the Smithsonian Institution and several Venezuelan scientific organizations, relocated the Táchira antpitta, obtaining the first ever sound recordings ever made of the species, and the first photographs ever taken of a living bird.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} often kept as a pet, often {{known as the}} {{domestic}} canary. Selective breeding has produced many varieties, differing in colour and shape. Yellow birds are particularly common, while red birds have been produced by interbreeding with the <b>red</b> <b>siskins.</b> Canaries were formerly used by miners to warn of dangerous gases ("canary in a coal mine"). The bird is also widely used in scientific research. Canaries are often depicted in the media with Tweety Bird being a well-known example.|$|R

50|$|The {{endangered}} <b>red</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus cucullatus) {{is found}} in the ecoregion in the Lara-Falcón valleys.Although protected by law, as of 2016 the population of the species was declining quickly due to trapping for sale as a cage bird, and the population was severely fragmented.It is observed at elevations from 100-1500 m, moving seasonally and daily from moist evergreen forest to dry deciduous woodlands, and the surrounding shrubby grasslands and pastures. The yellow-shouldered amazon (Amazona barbadensis) is almost extinct in Paraguaná due to destruction of its arid habitat in Falcón.Other endangered birds include the plain-flanked rail (Rallus wetmorei).|$|E

40|$|We report new {{records from}} {{ornithology}} surveys conducted at Kusad Mountain and Parabara savanna in Guyana’s southern Rupununi region during October and November 2013. Both localities had existing species lists based on surveys conducted in 2000, {{but had not}} been formally surveyed since. We surveyed birds over 15 field days, adding 22 and 10 species to the existing lists for Kusad and Parabara, respectively. Our findings augment prior knowledge of the status and distribution of birds in this region of the Guiana Shield. The southern Rupununi harbors high avian diversity, including rare species such as Rio Branco Antbird (Cercomacra carbonaria), Hoary-throated Spinetail (Synallaxis kollari), Bearded Tachuri (Polystictus pectoralis), and <b>Red</b> <b>Siskin</b> (Spinus cucullatus), which {{are likely to continue}} to draw tourism revenue to local communities if their habitats remain intact...|$|E
