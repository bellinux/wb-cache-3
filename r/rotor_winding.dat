25|$|The {{brushless}} wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|E

25|$|In a WRIM, the <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> {{is made of}} many {{turns of}} {{insulated}} wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.|$|E
25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|E

The <b>wind</b> <b>rotors</b> were designed conveniently by the traditional procedure for the single <b>wind</b> <b>rotor,</b> where the diameters of the front and the rear <b>wind</b> <b>rotors</b> are 2 m and 1. 33 m. The tests were done on a pick-up type truck driven straightly at constant speed. The rotational torque of the unit is directly proportional to the induced electric current irrespective of the rotational speeds of the <b>wind</b> <b>rotors,</b> while the induced voltage {{is proportional to the}} relative rotational speed. The performance of the unit is significantly affected not only by the wind velocity, but also by the blade setting angles of both <b>wind</b> <b>rotors</b> and the applied load especially at lower wind velocity...|$|R

40|$|Recently a new {{technology}} of wind turbines has been introduced {{which is going to}} have a remarkable share in the market in the close future. This wind turbine has two set of blades. So it is more efficient for collecting energy from wind in comparison to a single <b>rotor</b> <b>wind</b> turbine. This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of the dual and single <b>rotor</b> <b>wind</b> turbines under unbalance transient conditions. To reach to this stage the models of mechanical and electrical components which exist in PSCAD/MTDC library have been used and combined together according to the configuration of the single and dual <b>rotor</b> systems. Both <b>wind</b> turbines are actuated and monitored from three aspects. Firstly, a step change in wind speed is applied which leads to a change in mechanical torque. Secondly, voltage sag is considered at the generator terminal which causes electromagnetic torque shock. Third, the amount of energies which is released by the mechanical systems after network frequency drop, are compared with each other to evaluate which one can support the frequency better. In all calculations the stream tube effect has been entered to the simulations. Different variables of wind turbines are evaluated and the operations of the rotors are compared...|$|R

50|$|As the {{component}} to be wound {{has to be}} presented only in the winding position and otherwise {{does not need to}} perform any movement during the winding process, also very bulky and massive products can be manufactured. One example is the rotors of electric motors (<b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> technology, special form of the successive winding method): The wire is held by a clip fixed to the machine during {{the component}} change. Since the rotors often consist of heavy, punch-packed metal sheets, the flyer winding technology is of particular advantage in this regard. Since the flyer cannot be directly guided in case of the <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> technology, the wire is guided across polished guiding blocks into the corresponding groove or slot.

40|$|A Smart <b>Rotor</b> <b>wind</b> turbine is able {{to reduce}} fatigue loads by {{deploying}} active aerodynamic devices along the span of the blades, {{which can lead to}} a reduced cost of energy. However, a major drawback is the complexity and potential for unreliability of the system. Faults can cause catastrophic damage and without compensation would require shutdown of the turbine, resulting in lost revenue. This is the first study to look at a fault ride-through solution to avoid shutdown of the turbine and lost revenue during a fault, while keeping additional damage to a minimum. A worst case scenario of a jammed flap with no direct knowledge of its occurrence is considered, while operating a DQ-axis Smart <b>Rotor</b> <b>wind</b> turbine. A method for detecting the fault using 1 P cyclic loadings is presented, as well as two fault ride-through options: setting the remaining active flap angles to zero and setting the remaining flap angles to that of the jammed flap if known. These are analysed using IEC standard load cases. It is found that rapid detection of faults is vital for Smart Rotor controllers to avoid highly damaging cyclic loads caused by rotor imbalance, but that fault ride-through is fairly simple to implement and this allows the load benefits of the Smart Rotor to be accessible even with long fault periods...|$|R

50|$|The {{two main}} types of AC motors are {{classified}} as induction and synchronous. The induction motor (or asynchronous motor) always relies on a small difference in speed between the stator rotating magnetic field and the rotor shaft speed called slip to induce rotor current in the rotor AC winding. As a result, the induction motor cannot produce torque near synchronous speed where induction (or slip) is irrelevant or ceases to exist. In contrast, the synchronous motor does not rely on slip-induction for operation and uses either permanent magnets, salient poles (having projecting magnetic poles), or an independently excited <b>rotor</b> <b>winding.</b> The synchronous motor produces its rated torque at exactly synchronous speed. The brushless wound-rotor doubly fed synchronous motor system has an independently excited <b>rotor</b> <b>winding</b> that does not rely {{on the principles of}} slip-induction of current. The brushless wound-rotor doubly fed motor is a synchronous motor that can function exactly at the supply frequency or sub to super multiple of the supply frequency.|$|E
