40|$|Energetic ion driven MHD modes were {{observed}} in NBI heated plasmas of LHD. The observed modes are classified into three kinds of modes, depending on the frequency range, degree of amplitude modulation (continuous or bursting) and temporal evolution of the mode frequency with or without <b>rapid</b> <b>frequency</b> chirping. It is important and of interest to study these phenomena related to non-linear wave-particle interactions. We have investigated the excitation conditions of continuous and bursting TAEs.

40|$|This paper reviews various global instabilities destabilized by {{tangential}} {{neutral beam}} injection (NBI) in the Large Helical Device (LHD) plasmas. These global modes are toroidal Alfv?n eigenmodes (TAEs), which are also observed in tokamak plasmas, and helicity-induced Alfv?n eigenmodes (HAEs) which are observed only in three-dimensional plasmas such as LHD plasmas. Moreover, reversed magnetic shear Alfv?n eigenmodes (RSAEs) are observed in a reversed magnetic shear (RS) plasma in the LHD, where {{the sign of the}} magnetic shear changes from positive in the plasma central region to negative in the plasma peripheral region. The RSAEs exhibit a characteristic frequency sweeping due to temporal evolution of the rotational transform profile. In the RS plasma, the energetic-ion-driven geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) is also excited. The GAM interacts nonlinearly with the RSAEs and generates a multitude of frequency sweeping modes through a three-wave-coupling process. The TAEs and GAM exhibit various types of nonlinear evolution, that is, pitchfork splitting and <b>rapid</b> <b>frequency</b> chirp-up and/or chirp-down.

40|$|SummaryAt {{the onset}} of each flight bout in flies, neural {{circuits}} in the CNS must rapidly integrate multimodal sensory stimuli and synchronously engage hinges of {{the left and right}} wings for coordinated wing movements. Whereas anatomical and physiological investigations of flight have been conducted on larger flies [1], molecular genetic studies in Drosophila have helped identify neurons that mediate various levels of flight control [2 – 7]. However, neurons that might mediate bilateral coordination of wing movements to precisely synchronize left and right wing engagement at flight onset and maintain their movement in perfect coordination at <b>rapid</b> <b>frequencies</b> during flight maneuvers remain largely unexplored. Wing coordination could be directly modulated via bilateral sensory inputs to motoneurons of steering muscles [6, 8] and/or through central interneurons. Using a Ca 2 +-activity-based GFP reporter, we identified three flight-activated central dopaminergic interneurons in the ventral ganglion, which connect to and activate motoneurons that innervate a pair of direct-steering flight muscles. The activation of these newly identified dopaminergic interneurons is context specific. Whereas bilateral wing engagement for flight requires these neurons, they do not control unilateral wing extension during courtship. Thus, independent central circuits function in the context of different natural behaviors to control the motor circuit for Drosophila wing movement...|$|R

40|$|Membrane current {{following}} prolonged {{periods of}} rapid stimulation was examined in short (less than 1. 5 mm) canine cardiac Purkinje fibers of radius less than 0. 15 mm. The Purkinje fibers were repetitively stimulated by delivering trains of depolarizing voltage clamp pulses at <b>rapid</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The slowly decaying outward current following repetitive stimulation ("post-drive" current) is eliminated {{by the addition}} of 10 (- 5) M dihydro-ouabain. The post-drive current is attributed to enhanced Na/K exchange caused by Na loading during the overdrive. Depolarizing voltage clamp pulses initiated from negative (- 80 mV) or depolarized (- 50 mV) holding potentials can give rise to post- drive current because of activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive or D 600 - sensitive channels. The magnitude of the post-drive current depends on the frequency of voltage clamp pulses, the duration of each pulse, and the duration of the repetitive stimulation. The time constant of decay of the post-drive current depends on extracellular [K] in accordance with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The Km is 1. 2 mM bulk [K], [K]B. The mean time constant in 4 mM [K]B is 83 s. Epinephrine (10 (- 5) M) decreases the time constant by 20 %. The time constant is increased by lowering [Ca]o between 4 and 1 mM. Lowering [Ca]o further, to 0. 1 mM, eliminates post-drive current following repetitive stimulation initiated from depolarized potentials.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{contributing}} to the development and application of new methods for lower earth crust structure modeling and reconstruction from seismograms. The 3 D Kirchhoff integral method was used for laterally weakly inhomogeneous media, a 2 D hybrid method was used for locally strongly heterogeneous media, and <b>rapid</b> <b>frequency</b> wave number migration was used for reconstruction of the subsoil. The Kirchhoff integral method was applied to investigate the effects of 2 D and 3 D structures on reconstructions along profile lines. The fact that geological structure reconstruction mostly fails causes problems as regards the interpretation of DEKORP data without transverse profiles or 3 D measurements for complexity estimation. The hybrid method served to calculate wave propagation through diffusers. Horizontal and vertical diffusers {{were found to be}} compatible with the data because they showed horizontal signatures in the seismogram and migration sections. Since the migration results and models were found to agree partially only in the case of horizontal diffusers, synthetic seismograms had to be calculated for the purpose of interpretation and verification. The application potential of <b>rapid</b> <b>frequency</b> wave number migration was tested successfully on a seismic-reflection data record, and the DEKORP data were processed applying the method. Prestack migration had a clear advantage over the conventional poststack methods. Since the DEKORP data quality varies considerably, useful energy is split when applying conventional methods. The interpretation of statistical parameters from such sections leads to wrong results. In the case of complex media, prestack methods must be used for quantitative interpretation. (orig.)

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} fast and slow inward channels to the electrocardiogram (ECG) of ventricular fibrillation. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced by endocardial electrical stimulation in pigs anaesthetised with pentobarbitone sodium (30 mg/kg intravenously). ECGs simultaneously recorded from the body surface (lead II) and from the endocardium were studied by power spectrum analysis (0 - 40 Hz). RESULTS: The mean (SEM) dominant frequency of fibrillation (9. 0 (1. 1) Hz in lead II at 0 - 40 s) did not change significantly with time in pigs given intravenous saline. However, the dominant frequency was significantly reduced by intravenous pretreatment with the class I antiarrhythmic drugs, lignocaine (3 mg/kg, 6. 5 (0. 5) Hz; 10 mg/kg, 4. 2 (0. 6) Hz), mexiletine (3 mg/kg, 6. 2 (0. 4) Hz; 10 mg/kg, 5. 5 (0. 4) Hz), and disopyramide (2. 5 mg/kg, 5. 4 (0. 6) Hz). After flecainide (3 mg/kg, 6. 9 (0. 5) Hz) the reduction in frequency was not significant. Similar data were obtained with endocardial recordings. In contrast pre-treatment with verapamil (0. 2 mg/kg, 11. 7 (0. 8) Hz; and 1. 0 mg/kg, 12. 9 (1. 6) Hz) produced a significantly higher dominant frequency of fibrillation than saline and widened the bandwidth of frequencies around the dominant frequency.

We assume supercritical Hopf bifurcation from x ≡ 0 in the well-understood single-delay case b = ∞. Normalizing f' (0) = 1, branches of constant minimal period p_k = 2 π/ω_k {{are known to}} bifurcate from eigenvalues iω_k = i(k+ 12) π at λ_k = (- 1) ^k+ 1 ω_k, for any nonnegative integer k. The unstable dimension of these rapidly oscillating periodic solutions is k, at the local branch k. We obtain stabilization of such branches, for arbitrarily large unstable dimension k, and for delicately narrow regions of control amplitudes b < 0. For p:= p_k the branch k of constant period p_k persists as a solution, for any b≠ 0. Indeed the delayed feedback term controlled by b vanishes on branch k: the feedback control is noninvasive there. Following an idea of Pyragas (1992), we seek parameter regions P = (b_k,b_k) of controls b ≠ 0 such that the branch k becomes stable, locally at Hopf bifurcation.
