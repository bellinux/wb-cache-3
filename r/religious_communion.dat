50|$|The Protestant princes and theologians {{prohibited}} the mass and certain other Roman practices wherever they held power.

Toleration was the fruit of a bitter contest, and was at last forced upon both parties as a modus vivendi. Protestantism had to conquer the right to exist, by terrible sacrifices. The right was conceded by the Peace of Augsburg, 1555, and finally established by the Peace of Westphalia, 1648, which first uses the term toleration in connection with religion, and remains valid to this day, in spite of the protest of the Pope. The same policy of toleration was adopted in England after the downfall of the Stuart dynasty in 1688, and included all orthodox Protestants, but excluded the Catholics, who were not emancipated till 1829. In Germany, toleration was first confined to three confessions—the Catholic, the Lutheran, and the German Reformed—but was gradually extended to other <b>religious</b> <b>communions</b> which are independent of state support and state control.|$|R
60|$|Hence {{the lot of}} Mixtus affects me pathetically, {{notwithstanding}} that {{he spends}} his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment. To most observers {{he appears to be}} simply one of the fortunate and also sharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become what they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but surprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and distinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness which prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way through his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with all this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly conscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social distinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without envying. Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that he aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine that his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the most unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his chosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a religious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady on whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious literature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys of a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given specially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational preacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then far beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect. At that time Mixtus thought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious principles and religious yearnings. It was within his prospects also to be rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for reforming and religious purposes. His opinions were of a strongly democratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of employers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would restrict the expansiveness of trade. He was the most democratic in relation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed interest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the poor. Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in ideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, <b>religious</b> <b>communion,</b> and good works. If you had known him then you would have expected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman, sharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage his studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished part {{in one of the most}} enlightened religious circles of a great provincial capital.|$|E

2500|$|In Aupers and Houtman (2010) Bovbjerg {{identifies}} NLP as a New Age [...] "psycho-religion" [...] {{and uses}} NLP as a case-study {{to demonstrate the}} thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea, namely concern with a transcendent [...] "other".

50|$|This theory makes a {{fundamental}} {{distinction between the}} supreme jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters (Kirchenhoheit or jus circa sacra), which it conceives as inherent {{in the power of}} the state in respect of every <b>religious</b> <b>communion,</b> and the ecclesiastical power (Kirchengewalt or jus in sacra) inherent in the church, but in some cases vested in the state by tacit or expressed consent of the ecclesiastical body. The theory was of importance because, by distinguishing church from state while preserving the essential supremacy of the latter, it prepared the way for the principle of toleration. It was put into practice to a certain extent in Prussia in the 18th century; but it was not till the political changes of the 19th century led to a great mixture of confessions under the various state governments that it found universal acceptance in Germany. The theory, of course, has found no acceptance in the Roman Catholic Church, but it nonetheless made it possible for the Protestant governments to make a working compromise with Rome in respect of the Roman Catholic Church established in their states.|$|E

40|$|This essay casts {{some light}} on the {{religious}} traditions of the Ingrian- Finnish seuralaiset-movement. This non-institutionalised mystical-ascetic religious movement, which emerged {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century, was widely known among the Finnish population of the presentday Leningrad Oblast. Both lay and religious authorities made continous endeavours to eliminate the movement and therefore the strategies of maintaining and transmitting their religious tradition in the circumstances of heavy pressure pose great challenges. The essay is based on recent field materials recorded on the Ingrian-Votian expeditions of the Estonian Literary Museum in 2001 – 2002. Sohvi K., the key informant who lived in Kolpino, was an earnest follower of the seuralaiset-movement and an active practitioner of their singing tradition. Materials of three recording sessions with Sohvi K. allow to discuss the position of the local prophet in the process of mediating the repertoire of the movement, the importance of sound recordings in sharing the <b>religious</b> <b>communion</b> with people who were not able to participate in prayer meetings, as well as the role of handwritten hymnals and photographs in maintaining and transmitting the tradition of the movement...|$|E
40|$|Since its inception, the Internet {{has served}} as a {{powerful}} medium for the dissemination of religious information and the creation of religious communities. Cyberspace now represents an important global paradigm shift in the way religion is conducted. This research provides a sociological account of the affordances the Internet contributes to religious life by examining the ways in which it has influenced the conduct or practices associated with Buddhism. In particular, it assesses {{the extent to which the}} rituals constitutive of the Buddhist practice of meditation have been achieved by the Cybersangha, the term Buddhists use for the online Buddhist community. The thesis argues that the Internet is not well suited to the facilitation of particular types of religious understanding and that there are clear limitations to its ability to provide the shared ritualistic experience necessitated by meditation. This is due to the fact that current technology can enable ritual only to a limited degree, and to the ways in which the textual nature of the Internet poses problems for religious experience of an intuitive, non-mediated nature. For these reasons, despite the fact that many websites advertise ‘online meditation’ and despite the strong attempts of some communities to use the Internet as a meditational medium, online meditation cannot be fully facilitated by the Internet. Since a key method by which a Buddhist attains understanding of reality is the use of the body in a meditative act, the inability to provide for embodiment means that the Internet can never offer an experiential equivalent to that of an offline environment. The lack of this experiential aspect means that it cannot in turn provide for holistic, <b>religious</b> <b>communion.</b> As such, there needs to be a further philosophical and practical appraisal of the capabilities of the Internet in general, and as a medium by which a religious experience can be engendered...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of History, Washington State UniversityAmerican Protestants adopted {{organizational}} efficiency as {{a spiritual}} virtue {{in the first three}} decades of the twentieth century. Driven by a devotional impulse to manage and systematize the practice of their faith, they hardened the boundaries of membership in their religious communities around formal administrative attachments. However, the resulting church organizations proved inhospitable to many Protestants who sought to express their spiritual identity through other ways than administration. Thus the organizational revolution precipitated religious friction and permanently realigned the Protestant landscape in the United States. Inspired by practices in the business world around them, Protestants began reorganizing their churches {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century. They consolidated their missionary, educational and benevolence agencies; they integrated local, regional and national expressions of church life; and they organized these diverse activities under centrally-administered systems of management and control. This organizational revolution produced important consequences. First, the expanding domain of church administration opened new opportunities for women to pursue valued religious work, for Protestants did not view administration as inherently masculine work. They eventually removed longstanding barriers against women's ordination. Yet the same administrative impulse downgraded the meaning of ordination, stripping it of the sacral significance it had previously held. Thus, traditional notions of women's subordination persisted even as women began occupying ecclesiastical positions that were previously open only to men. Second, many Protestants placed doctrine above formal organizational attachment as the basis for <b>religious</b> <b>communion.</b> They became disenchanted when efficiency-minded church leaders cast aside their theological concerns in the name of administration. Schism ensued, which marked the beginning of permanent realignments in American Protestantism. Historians typically frame the religious controversies of the 1920 s and ` 30 s within a narrative of two warring camps [...] the so-called fundamentalists and modernists. They also position women within a largely separate historical narrative. This dissertation resituates these developments within the broader story of the contentious organizational revolution, which shifted gendered understandings of religious work. Ardent Protestants driven by their differing theological views [...] men and women alike [...] were not the polar opposites they are often portrayed to be. They became casualties of the gospel of efficiency. Department of History, Washington State Universit...|$|E

Radom su obuhvaćene redovničke zajednice u Hrvatskoj i Bosni i Hercegovini i to od 1972. do 2016. godine. U teoretskom je dijelu korištena kritičko-analitička i induktivno-deduktivna metoda, dok je za praktičnu razinu provedeno i analizirano kvalitativno empirijsko istraživanje obavljeno pomoću metoda fokus grupe i osobnog intervjua. Rad je podijeljen u pet poglavlja. Redovničko je zajedništvo najprije smješteno unutar ekleziološkog zajedništva (1. „Redovničko zajedništvo“), a njegove su bitne dimenzije osvijetljene uz pomoć poslijesaborskih crkvenih dokumenata o posvećenom životu (2. „Redovničko zajedništvo i dimenzije njegova ostvarenja prema crkvenim dokumentima“). U trećem poglavlju („Bitni naglasci redovničkoga zajedništva: Zbornici redovničkih tjedana (1973. - 2002.), časopis Posvećeni život (1994. - 2016.), Vijećanja redovničkih odgojitelja i odgojiteljica (1972. 2016.) i Redovnički dani (1998. - 2016.)) “ temeljito je analizirana tema redovničkog zajedništva prema zapisima najvažnijih skupova redovnika i redovnica u Hrvatskoj i Bosni i Hercegovini u vremenskom razmaku od 44 godine. U četvrtom je poglavlju („Izazovi i poteškoće zajedništva u redovničkim zajednicama“) izdvojeno sedam izazova i poteškoća redovničkoga zajedništva kao rezultat teološko-teoretske analize proizašle iz prva tri poglavlja. Peto poglavlje („Redovničko zajedništvo pred suvremenim izazovima – Empirijsko istraživanje“) donosi i analizira rezultate kvalitativnog empirijskog istraživanja provedenog u siječnju i svibnju 2016. godine u kojemu je sudjelovalo 70 redovnika i redovnica iz hrvatskih i bosansko-hercegovačkih redovničkih zajednica. Rezultati su potvrdili važnost vrednote redovničkog zajedništva, osvijetlili njegove pomake kako u pozitivnom tako i u negativnom smjeru, otkrili važne teme za potreban rast redovničkog zajedništva te otvorili teme o kojima se do sada nije raspravljalo ni pisalo. U ovom se radu po prvi puta temeljito analizira vrednota redovničkoga zajedništva kako pod teološko-teoretskim (od 1972. – 2016.) tako i pod praktično-empirijskim vidom. Interdisciplinarni pristup u obradi tematike redovničkog zajedništva kao i dobiveni rezultati nude znanstveno utemeljeno polazište kako za daljnja istraživanja tako i za konkretnu primjenu u redovničkim zajednicama. The {{doctoral}} The Value of <b>Religious</b> <b>Communion</b> in Croatian and Bosnian and Herzegovinian Religious Communities {{from the}} Second Vatican Council until 2016 thesis focuses {{on how the}} value of communion has been lived by male and female monks in Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities in the period from the Second Vatican Council until 2016. The monastic communion is a natural and supernatural reality. Its ideal is the Trinitarian communion of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and its role model the first Christian community. The foundation of the monastic community is faith, characterised by two kinds of relationships: {{the first one is}} that of sonhood/daughterhood and the second one is that of brotherhood/sisterhood. While the first includes the relationship between the individual, the community, and God, the second presupposes mutual relations within a monastic community. The main goal of the doctoral thesis is to theoretically and practically analyse and provide an overview of the monastic communion in Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities in the period from the Second Vatican Council until 2016. The final goal is to show that the value of monastic communion always remains a value, no matter the changes, difficulties, and challenges it might be undergoing. In the theoretical part the author utilises the critical-analytical and the inductive-deductive method. The practical part consisted of a conducted qualitative empirical study that utilised the methods of focus group and individual interviews and whose results were then analysed. The study has been conducted during January and May, 2016. 36 female monks and 18 male monks, altogether 54 persons, participated in ten focus groups. 9 female monks and 7 male monks, altogether 16 persons, participated in individual interviews. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first three chapters analyse the value of monastic communion theoretically, while the fourth chapter presents and analyses, on the basis of results of the first three chapters, certain challenges of and difficulties with communion in monastic communities. The fifth chapter presents and analyses results of the conducted qualitative empirical study among monks of Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities. The first chapter entitled Monastic communion introduces the topic through the discussion of ecclesiology of communion and situates the monastic communion within the Church as communio. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the concept of Christian and monastic community and interprets main traits of the monastic communion. Confronted with various crises after the Second Vatican Council, monastic communities were struck by the crisis of communion. Among others Pope Francis also called for the renewal of monastic communion by announcing the Year of Sanctified Life that lasted from November 30, 2014 until February 2, 2016. The second chapter entitled Monastic Communion and Dimensions of Its Realisation according to the Church Documents treats essential dimensions of the monastic communion according to the Church documents in the period from the Second Vatican Council until 2016. The Church documents enlighten the way towards good monastic communion and present an ideal that ought to be realised, but they also analyse the problem of communion in an open and critical way while proposing ways and means of overcoming this problem. The following essential dimensions of the monastic communion have been analysed in the second chapter: the renewal of the monastic life after the Second Vatican Council with an emphasis on communion; contemplation; formation; brotherly and sisterly life in a communion; mission; the vow of chastity; the vow of poverty, authority, and obedience. The themes covered in the second chapter showed that the Church documents on sanctified life always followed circumstances and changes in monastic communities faithfully and have dealt with them in a successful and responsible way. The third chapter entitled Essential Emphases of the Monastic Communion: Collection of Papers of the Monastic Weeks (1973 - 2002), the Journal Posvećeni Život (1994 - 2016), Rulings of Male and Female Monastic Prefects (1972 - 2016), and the Monastic Days (1998 - 2016), presents an overview of reflections and essential emphases of the monastic communion by analysing and following collections of papers of the monastic weeks (I-XVII; 1973 - 2002), the journal Posvećeni život (1994 - 2016), which collected most of the lectures held during 32 monastic weeks in Croatia, counsels/rulings of male and female monastic prefects (1 st- 45 th; 1972 – 2016) and the Monastic Days (1998 – 2016). The chapter first generally presents three specific and most numerous gathering of male and female monks in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina: the Monastic Weeks (1973 – 2016), counselling/rulings of male and female monastic prefects (1972 – 2016) in Croatia, and, at the end, the Monastic Days (1998 – 2016) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This chapter analyses liturgical and prayer life of the community, ascetic practice, daily schedule, local council, the vow of chastity and affective maturity, the vow of poverty, authority and animation of a monastic community, dialogue and pluralism of thinking, and, at the end, spirituality of communion. All these topics have been analysed in the context of monastic communion. The analysis in the third chapter has confirmed the fact that the monastic communion was important for monastic communities in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is especially evident through these topics and a large number of participants at the aforementioned gatherings of male and female monks. On the other hand, {{it is much easier to}} discern the reality of monastic communities from the first twenty years of gatherings than from the last twenty years. However, when one takes into account that throughout the years the number of days and the number of lectures at the Monastic Days in Croatia have decreased, that collections of papers from the Monastic Weeks have ceased to be published, that some lectures from the Monastic Days in Bosnia and Herzegovina have not been preserved or published and that there were no records of papers delivered in individual sessions of the Monastic Weeks from the tenth Monastic Week onwards, one can only conclude that enthusiasm and openness for critical and clear reflection on monastic life in general and the monastic communion in particular has decreased over the years. The fourth chapter, entitled Challenges of and Difficulties with the Communion in Monastic Communities, specifies, on the basis of the first three chapters, seven challenges of and difficulties with the monastic communion that monastic communities in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina faced since the Second Vatican Council until 2016. The chapter begins with an analysis of the problem of individualism and the influence of electronic media on the monastic communion. This is followed by the topics of life in small and big monastic communities, inter-generational relations, and the relation between the community and an individual. The chapter analyses difficulties of the monastic communion of female monastic communities that live and work in parishes and problems of monks-priests who are also parish priests in parishes. This chapter has confirmed that male and female monks are not spared of the problem of individualism, the influence of electronic media, and intergenerational conflicts. A positive shift has been discerned in the relation between the community and an individual. Each difficulty presents a challenge and a chance to rethink and renew the monastic communion. The fifth chapter, entitled Contemporary Challenges to the Quality of the Monastic Communion – an Empirical Study gathers and analyses results of a quality empirical study and deepens the topic of monastic communion while showing how male and female monks in Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities see and experience the value of monastic communion and what kind of meaning they ascribe to it. This chapter starts with a description of basic methodological data. It introduces and interprets the organisation and conduction of focus groups and individual interviews, provides methodological notes, explains the research question, and poses hypotheses. Methodological notes are followed by an exhaustive analysis of five study areas. Firstly, the issue of leisure time, secondly, new media, thirdly, interpersonal relations, fourthly, loneliness and addiction, fifthly, ascetic practice. At the end the author presents proposals of male and female monks on how to increase the quality of monastic communion. The first area of study, focused on the theme of leisure time and related common recreational activities, has shown that male and female monks, taking into account smaller or bigger discrepancies and in relation to the quantity of leisure time and the manner of its usage, do have leisure time after all. The common recreational activities are quite important and needed, but in terms of its existence and the manner of its conduction there are significant discrepancies from one community to another. In some communities the common recreational activities are often and regular, in some occasional, and in some other it has been reduced to watching TV together or does not exist at all. The second area, focused on the topic of new media, the internet, and smart phones, has shown that each monastic community has its own web site and that participants in the study use new media extensively. The purpose of this usage is, however, manifold. New media are used for various forms of communication, but also as a means of various kinds of pastoral work. The need for culture of using new media and education for media is quite pronounced. The third area of study focused on dynamics of interpersonal relations in a monastic community and it revealed aspects of interpersonal relations that are important to participants, as well as those that could be improved within communities. Among important aspects, acceptance, respect, trust, sincerity, communication, and forgiveness stand out. The area of interpersonal relations has also shown five ways of resolving conflicts in monastic communities of the participants. The most common way of resolving conflicts is through talking. However, there were also participants who are trying to avoid every conflict in their monastic life. There is a strong and close link between interpersonal relations and the apostolate of a community. The fourth area of study focused on the topic of loneliness and the problem of addictions. Male and female monks also suffer from the feeling of loneliness. There are various reasons for, kinds, and frequency of this feeling among the participants. The topic of addictions is still more or less a taboo within monastic communities. It is much easier to talk about an addiction of a monastic brother/sister than about one´s own addiction. The study has shown that male and female monks are not immune to addictions and that there are various kinds of addictions in Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities. There is awareness that this problem is present as well as openness for finding solutions to it. he fifth area of study focused on the importance of ascetic practice in the life of participants and confirmed that it exists and that participants engage in it in their personal lives and as a community. There was an attempt to link ascetic practice to careerism in monastic communities, which led to the conclusion that participants have different views on what constitutes career and careerism. For some participants these have nothing in common with ascetic practices and monastic communities, while some participants honestly admitted that male and female monks are not immune to the negative syndrome of careerism. Nevertheless, the majority agreed that careerism is more present in male than female monastic communities. The results of the doctoral thesis, both those of the theoretical as well as the empirical part of the study, confirmed the importance of the value of monastic communion and demonstrated both positive and negative shifts. They also revealed important themes that need to be addressed in the interest of growth in quality of monastic communion and opened up issues that were not discussed until now in Croatian and Bosnian-Herzegovinian monastic communities. The shifts towards positive were manifested through the selection of topics for monastic weeks, days, and counselling of male and female monks. Especially in their first years, these gatherings emanated clarity, concreteness, and good theological background. Values such as dialogue, participation, and co-responsibility were ever more present in the everyday monastic life. Throughout the years the sensibility for initial and permanent formation also grew, especially when it comes to affective maturity of an individual. One can also discern a major positive shift towards respect for each individual person and his/her gifts within a community. Despite the increased tempo of life, male and female monks manage to find time for personal and communal leisure activities. They use media for communication and pastoral work, but they are well aware of dangers associated with these. One can also notice a positive shift in the continuous desire and struggle of male and female monks for building up good interpersonal relations, which also testifies in favour of the selection of good personal ways of conflict resolution. It is also encouraging to see that male and female monks are not afraid to admit that they feel lonely, that they are open to finding solutions for the problem of addictions within their communities, and that they largely engage in personal and communal ascetic practices. Shifts towards the negative are manifested through the phenomenon of ever more present individualism within communities, to which new media and the crisis of authority largely contribute. Although many monastic communities engage in common recreational activities, there are communities in which these have all but disappeared, while their place has been taken up by new media, especially the internet and smart phones. There are communities in which new media even disturb common meals. Negativity is also manifested through views on the problem of addictions that is still a taboo topic in most monastic communities, while finding a solution for individual cases of addictions is still expected from the head of a community and not from a community as a whole. The following topics have proved to be of extreme importance for the future of monastic communities in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and it would be advisable to discuss them during upcoming gatherings of monks: interpersonal and inter-generational relations, new media, the problem of addictions and finding solutions to it, the issue of monastic communion of monks-parish priests. A possible way of dealing with the aforementioned negative shifts, as well as a signpost for further reflections and work in communities, can be discerned from individual proposals of male and female monks that they shared at the end of the empirical study. In this sense, the return to the Word of God, as well as personal and communal prayer, is of utmost importance. The encounter with the Word of God can also lead to good and quality interpersonal relations. There is also a need to return to the original charisma of a given monastic community. The initial and permanent formation are extremely important, especially the formation for good interpersonal relations and communion. More regular common encounters on the level of a community could also contribute to the quality of monastic communion. In conclusion, this doctoral thesis is a contribution to the overall reflection of male and female monks during all gatherings that they organised. For the first time, the thesis has gathered and analysed everything that has to do with the value of monastic communion in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the time span of 44 years (1972 – 2016). In both its theoretical part as well as in its empirical part, this doctoral thesis is a positive and valuable result of the risk of entering into a large number of Croatian and BosnianHerzegovinian monastic communities. Through their openness and complaisance, these communities have showed that they are not perfect, but that they are, nevertheless, willing to face the great challenges of contemporary monastic life. This doctoral thesis is, therefore, also a sign of gratitude to these monastic communities for their efforts in building up the Kingdom of God within the ecclesial life and in their relation to society in which they live and work. The monastic communion is an incomplete reality. This reality consists of many threads and small details of everyday life. It is always an opportunity for personal growth and formation. For each male and female monk it is what the examination of conscience at the end of each day ought to consist of. This doctoral thesis shows that challenges and difficulties of monastic communion ought to be discussed even more, while its contents and results offer scientifically-based starting point for further research and concrete application within monastic communities...|$|E
