The forthcoming advent in the 2017 – 2020 timeframe of the <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> <b>emission</b> (RDE) standards affords little time for the identification of viable solutions. The present research work aims to contribute towards a much-needed improved understanding of the process of PM formation in theoretically-homogeneous stoichiometric spark-ignition combustion. Experimental measurements of engine-out PM have been taken from a wall-guided GDI engine operated at part-load; through parallel computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the test-engine, the process of mixture preparation was investigated. About 80 % of the total particle number is emitted on average in the 5 – 50 nm range, with the vast majority being below the regulated lower limit of 23 nm. The results suggest that both improved charge homogeneity and lower peak combustion temperature contribute to lower particle number density (PNDen) and larger particle size, as engine speed and load increase. The effect of engine load is stronger and results from greater injection pressure through better fuel droplet atomisation. Increases in pre-combustion homogeneity of 6 % are associated with one order of magnitude reductions of PNDen. A simplified two-equation functional model was developed, which returns satisfactory qualitative predictions of PNDen as a function of basic engine control variables...|$|R

By extending the well-known equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), the power split degree of freedom is used to control the NOx emissions and the battery state of charge (SOC) simultaneously. Through an appropriate formulation of the problem, the feedback control is shown to be separable into two dependent PI controllers.

40|$|Nitrogenoxides (NOx, {{including}} NO and NOx) are a {{group of}} hazardous, toxic and harmfulgasses, which have an adverse effect on both environment and human health,e. g., acid rain, photochemical smog, and affecting the human respiratorysystem. The NOx concentration {{in most of the}} EUcities exceeds the EU annual limit value (40 μg/m 3). Around 40 % of the emitted NOx is attributedto transport related emissions.

However, recent technological innovations now allow direct measurement of pollutant fluxes from cities, for comparison with emissions inventories, which are themselves commonly used for prediction of current and future air quality and to help guide abatement strategies. Fluxes of NOx were measured using the eddy-covariance technique from an aircraft flying at low altitude over London. The highest fluxes were observed over central London, with lower fluxes measured in suburban areas. A footprint model was used to estimate the spatial area from which the measured emissions occurred. This allowed comparison of the flux measurements to the UK’s National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) for NOx, with scaling factors used {{to account for the}} actual time of day, day of week and month of year of the measurement. The comparison suggests significant underestimation of NOx emissions in London by the NAEI, mainly due to its under-representation of real world road traffic emissions. A comparison was also carried out with the enhanced London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) which attempts to take into account <b>real</b> world <b>driving</b> <b>emission</b> factors and road measurement data. The measurement to inventory agreement was substantially improved using LAEI, showing the importance of fully accounting for road traffic, which is the dominant NOx emission source in London.

40|$|Regulated gaseous {{emissions}} from two Euro 3 motorcycles and three Euro 5 passenger cares were measured over different driving cycles. The {{purpose of this}} study was to get data on typical emission levels and patterns of motorcycles and passenger cars currently circulating on the road in Europe. In respect to this, three driving cycles were selected: the current type approval driving cycles used to certify the test vehicles for emissions (NEDC for passenger cars and the EDC for motorcycles) and the world-wide harmonized driving cycle for motorcycles (WMTC). The {{gaseous emissions}} (NOx, HC, CO and CO 2) were measured using the typical type approval test procedure for light duty vehicles. Since all the vehicles tested had been certified using the relevant current legislative cycle (i. e. NEDC or EDC), these vehicles were clearly not optimized for the WMTC cycle.

The knowledge of exhaust flow is one of the prerequisites for successful RDE measurement with PEMS. One of the simplest approaches for estimating the exhaust flow from virtually any engine is its computation from the intake air flow, which is calculated from measured engine rpm and intake manifold charge pressure and temperature using a generic speed-density algorithm, applicable to most contemporary four-cycle engines. In this work, a generic speed-density algorithm was compared against several reference methods on representative European production engines - a gasoline port-injected automobile engine, two turbocharged diesel automobile engines, and a heavy-duty turbocharged diesel engine. The overall results suggest that the uncertainty of the generic speed-density method is on the order of 10 % throughout most of the engine operating range, but increasing to tens of percent where high-volume exhaust gas recirculation is used. For non-EGR engines, such uncertainty is acceptable for many simpler and screening measurements, and may be, where desired, reduced by engine-specific calibration...|$|E

Although most of these technologies show promising results in official fuel economy tests, their benefits in real driving conditions and <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> <b>emissions</b> can vary significantly, since driving profiles of many drivers are different than the official driving cycles. Therefore, it is important to assess these technologies under different driving conditions and this paper aims to offer an overall perspective, with a numerical study in simulations. The simulations are carried out on a compact passenger car model with eight powertrain configurations including: a naturally aspirated spark ignition engine, a start-stop system, a downsized engine with a turbocharger, a Miller cycle engine, cylinder deactivation, turbocharged downsized Miller engine, a parallel hybrid electric vehicle powertrain and an electric vehicle powertrain. These are tested in seven driving cycles including the NYCC, FTP 75, NEDC, WLTC, US 06, HWFET and CADC. The impacts of different technologies on fuel economy and CO₂ emissions are analyzed, with respect to different operating conditions. Results reveal that a combination of certain driving cycles and vehicle configurations have a large influence on fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions. In general, Miller and downsized engines offer some improvements in all cycles while the start-stop system has benefits in city cycles with frequent stops.

For this purpose have been considered the driving style influence, the traffic level, the path slope and the comfort level requested inside the vehicle by the driver. In particular the influence of auxiliary systems consumption on the total consumption of the vehicle has been evaluated.

40|$|The {{emissions}} from vehicles {{in real world}} driving are of current concern, as they are often higher than on legislated test cycles and this may explain why air quality in cities has not improved {{in proportion to the}} reduction in automotive emissions. This has led to the <b>Real</b> <b>Driving</b> <b>Emissions</b> (RDE) legislation in Europe. RDE involves journeys of about 90 km with roughly equal proportion of urban, rural and motorway driving. However, air quality exceedances occur in cities with urban congested traffic driving as the main source of the emissions that deteriorate the air quality. Thus the emissions measured on RDE journeys may not be relevant to air quality in cities. A Temet FTIR and Horiba exhaust mass flow measurement system was used for the mass emissions measurements in a Euro 4 SI vehicle. A 5 km urban journey on a very congested road was undertaken 29 times at various times so that different traffic congestion was encountered. Each journey was split into ten sections in order that the location and traffic conditions of the highest emissions could be determined. It was found that low speed stop-start traffic has much higher emissions than for freely moving traffic and most of the higher emissions on the longer 5 km journeys occurred in relatively short sections of slow moving stop/start traffic. The journey used passed a roadside air quality monitor that exceeded the EU NO 2 and PM standards on an annual basis and it was located by the most congested part of the route, where the traffic emissions are shown in this work to be at their highest...|$|E

The effect of the official RDE exclusion of cold start and idling on the RDE test, {{and the effect of}} the use of the moving averaging window (MAW) analysis technique, were simultaneously investigated. Specific attention was paid to differences in drive characteristics of the three different driving modes and the effect this had on the distance-based CO 2, CO and NOx emission factors for each. The average velocity of the RDE tests was marginally greater than the WLTC tests, while the average acceleration was smaller. The CO 2 emission appeared on average 4 % lower under the RDE tests compared to the WLTC tests, while the CO was 60 % lower. The NOx values were 34 % lower under the RDE testing, and appeared to be linked to the average acceleration. No link was seen for the maximum acceleration or deceleration, indicating {{that this is not a}} good indicator for test cycle emissions. The exclusion of cold start and idling decreased all RDE emissions. RPA (Relative Positive Acceleration) had little correlation with CO 2, CO and NOx distance-based emissions, and was shown to be uncorrelated with any mass-rate emissions. The range of RPA values seen was much greater for RDE tests than WLTC tests, with individual RDE tests having variable values for each drive mode. The application of the MAW technique had minimal effect on the CO 2 distance-based emission, but it appeared to decrease CO and NOx emissions by 12 % and 21 % on average respectively. The MAW also decreased the variation in emissions across different modes...|$|E

The availability of remote sensing NO 2 measurements are not as widely available as would be desirable. The aim of this study is to improve the ability of investigators to estimate the NO 2 emissions and to improve the confidence of the total NOX results calculated from standard RSD measurements. The accuracy of the RSD speed and acceleration module was also tested validated using state-of-the-art onboard GPS tracking. Two RSDs used in roadside vehicle emissions surveys were tested side by side under off carriageway conditions away from transient pollution sources to ascertain the consistency of their measurements. The speed correlation was consistent across the range of measurements at 95 % confidence and the acceleration correlation was consistent at 95 % con dence intervals for all but the most extreme acceleration cases. VSP was consistent at 95 % confidence across all measurements except for VSP 15 kWt- 1 which show a small underestimate. The controlled distribution gas nitric oxide measurements follow a normal distribution with 2 sd equal to 18. 9 % of the mean compared to 15 % that was observed during factory calibration indicative of additional error introduced into the system. Systematic errors of + 84 ppm were observed but within the tolerance of the control gas. Inter-instrument correlation was performed with the relationship between the FEAT and the RSD 4600 being linear with a gradient of 0. 93 and an R 2 of 0. 85 indicating good correlation.

40|$|Driving {{simulators}} and microscopic traffic simulation {{are important}} tools for making evaluations of driving and traffic. A driving simulator is de-signed to imitate <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> {{and is used}} to conduct experiments on driver behavior. Traffic simulation is commonly {{used to evaluate the}} quality of service of different infrastructure designs. This thesis considers a different application of traffic simulation, namely the simulation of surrounding vehicles in driving simulators. The surrounding traffic is one of several factors that influence a driver's mental load and ability to drive a vehicle. The representation of the surrounding vehicles in a driving simulator {{plays an important role in}} the striving to create an illusion of <b>real</b> <b>driving.</b> If the illusion of <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> is not good enough, there is an risk that drivers will behave differently than in <b>real</b> world <b>driving,</b> implying that the results and conclusions reached from simulations may not be transferable to <b>real</b> <b>driving.</b> This thesis has two main objectives. The first objective is to develop a model for generating and simulating autonomous surrounding vehicles in a driving simulator. The approach used by the model developed is to only simulate the closest area of the driving simulator vehicle. This area is divided into one inner region and two outer regions. Vehicles in the inner region are simulated according to a microscopic model which includes sub-models for driving behavior, while vehicles in the outer regions are updated according to a less time-consuming mesoscopic model. The second objective is to develop an algorithm for combining autonomous vehicles and controlled events. Driving simulators are often used to study situations that rarely occur in the real traffic system. In order to create the same situations for each subject, the behavior of the surrounding vehicles has traditionally been strictly controlled. This often leads to less realistic surrounding traffic. The algorithm developed makes it possible to use autonomous traffic between the predefined controlled situations, and thereby get both realistic traffc and controlled events.

This is because compared to the legislated driving cycle, the real world driving uses different powers, different average speeds, different traffic congestion, different road gradients, different maximum acceleration rates, different cold start conditions, different numbers of stop/start events and occurs at different ambient temperatures and pressures and will inevitably have different emissions. In recognition of importance of <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> <b>emissions,</b> the EU plans to introduce RDE (Real driving emission) test procedure in 2017. This work investigated real world emissions on a congested road by a roadside air quality monitoring station that exceeds European air quality standards for NOx and PM using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) and a Euro 4 SI passenger car. The PEMS used was the Temet FTIR with Horiba OBS pitot tube exhaust mass flow sensor and gas sampler. Twenty nine hot start repeat journeys were conducted at different times of the day (morning and evening rush hours, lunch time, night) so that a range of traffic conditions were included and eight cold start tests for the same journeys were conducted and compared with the hot start results and shown to give significantly higher emissions. The vehicle was equipped with thermocouple, lambda sensor and GPS for travel parameter analysis. The GHG including CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O, nitrogen species in the exhaust gases including NO, NO 2, N 2 O, NH 3 and HCN and other emissions were analysed. The results were compared to the NEDC and WLTC. One of the suggestions from this work is that the proposal for the EU RDE test procedure do not include congested traffic driving and cold start which will compromise its expected purpose and effect. ...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of NOX by {{vehicles}} in real driving environments are only partially understood. This {{has been brought}} to the attention of the world with recent revelations of the cheating of the type approval tests exposed in the dieselgate scandal. Remote sensing devices offer investigators an opportunity to directly measure in-situ <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> <b>emissions</b> of tens of thousands of vehicles. The availability of remote sensing NO 2 measurements are not as widely available as would be desirable. The aim of this study is to improve the ability of investigators to estimate the NO 2 emissions and to improve the confidence of the total NOX results calculated from standard RSD measurements. The accuracy of the RSD speed and acceleration module was also validated using state-of-the-art onboard GPS tracking. Two RSDs used in roadside vehicle emissions surveys were tested side by side under off carriageway conditions away from transient pollution sources to ascertain the consistency of their measurements. The speed correlation was consistent across the range of measurements at 95 % confidence and the acceleration correlation was consistent at 95 % confidence intervals for all but the most extreme acceleration cases. VSP was consistent at 95 % confidence across all measurements except for VSP ≥ 15 kW t− 1 which show a small underestimate. The controlled distribution gas nitric oxide measurements follow a normal distribution with 2 σ equal to 18. 9 % of the mean compared to 15 % that was observed during factory calibration indicative of additional error introduced into the system. Systematic errors of + 84 ppm were observed but within the tolerance of the control gas. Inter-instrument correlation was performed with the relationship between the FEAT and the RSD 4600 being linear with a gradient of 0. 93 and an R 2 of 0. 85 indicating good correlation. A new method to calculate NOX emissions using fractional NO 2 combined with NO measurements made by the RSD 4600 was constructed, validated and shown to be more accurate than previous methods. Implications: Synchronised remote sensing measurements of NO were taken using two different remote sensing devices in an off-road study. It was found that the measurements taken by both instruments were well correlated. Fractional NO 2 measurements from a prior study, measurable on only one device, were used to create new NOx emission factors for the device that could not be measured by the second device. These estimates were validated against direct measurement of total NOx emission factors and shown to be an improvement on previous methodologies. Validation of Vehicle Specific Power was performed with good correlation observed...|$|E
40|$|In the European Union (EU), the {{upcoming}} Euro- 6 d regulation will include <b>Real</b> <b>Driving</b> <b>Emissions</b> (RDE), {{measured by a}} Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS). The regulation will comprise the on-road measurement of Diesel NO x and Particle Number (PN) emissions on an RDE compliant test route. Chassis dynamometer tests, such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), {{are not able to}} cover the entire spectrum of driving situations that occur during on-road driving. On-road exhaust measurements depend on numerous conditions, such as ambient temperature, driving style and road grade that can hardly be accounted for in the test cell. The present study addresses the impact of different driving conditions on onroad exhaust emissions. The focus is on the characterisation of different driving styles, the fraction of cold start emissions and the correlation with road grade along a route profile, which are all expected to have a high impact on exhaust emissions. Gaseous emission results for three Diesel vehicles (Euro- 4, Euro- 5 and Euro- 6. 1) and PN measurements with a prototype PN PEMS for two gasoline vehicles (Euro- 5, Euro- 6. 1) are presented. Correlation measurements of CO 2 and NO x emissions were conducted between the PEMS and the test cell which proved the PEMS results within a deviation of 4 to 15 % from the test cell. The PN PEMS showed a good agreement with an established Particle Measurement Program (PMP) set-up down to emissions of 1 · 10 10 km − 1. A PM PEMS was used in parallel for soot measurements as an independent technique. PN-to-soot ratios were determined for both test cell and on-road measurements, and appeared to be comparable at 1. 3 · 10 12 mg − 1 indicating a constant performance of the PN PEMS. Different driving styles (soft, normal, severe) were characterized by several driving parameters. Especially acceleration based driving parameters Relative Positive Acceleration (RPA), Mean Positive Acceleration (MPA) and v·a pos 95 were found to show a good separation of different driving styles. Most notably, elevated RPA and MPA could explain increases of CO 2, NO x and PN emissions during severe driving. The comparison to reference data obtained from the World harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC, version 5. 3) and from Field Operational Tests (FOT) proved that the normal PEMS trips can be attributed to normal driving. The cold start effect was investigated down to ambient temperatures below 0 °C. A large cold start peak was observed, especially for CO, HC and PN emissions, which constituted to a large fraction of the corresponding total emissions. Several methods were applied to quantify cold start emissions during on-road driving and define Cold Start Excess Emissions (CSEE). Based on different altitude data sources, the route characteristics of four routes were investigated applying the parameter Cumulated Altitude Gain (CAG). One route had more than 100 % as much CAG, leading to almost 100 % higher distance specific NO x emissions at similar driving dynamics. A filtering and a subsequent smoothing process, as implemented in the RDE regulation draft, lowered the cumulated altitude gain values by 40 to 50 %. Based on repetitive measurements, the road grades for two routes were calculated within 100 m segments with an average precision of 0. 29 % and 0. 12 %. CO 2 and NO x emissions showed a linear increase with road grade for all urban, rural and motorway parts. Larger emissions at higher road grades could be explained by more frequent high engine load points. </p...|$|E

In this paper, we present a <b>real</b> <b>driving</b> evaluation of two conditions of speed variations: 50 to 70 km/h and 90 to 110 km/h. The experimental evaluation shows that a reduction in fuel consumption, consequently in greenhouse gases emissions, is achievable with a conventional gasoline passenger car, with no adaptations for realizing speed variations. Numerical simulations based on a backward quasi-static powertrain modeling are {{used to evaluate the}} potential of speed variations for reducing fuel consumption in other speed variation conditions.
