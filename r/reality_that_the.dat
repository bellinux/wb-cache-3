5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E

According to the Copenhagen {{interpretation of}} quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quantum state describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There {{is no way to}} say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.|$|E

25|$|The Father is the eternal, {{infinite}} and uncreated <b>reality,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Christ and the Holy Spirit {{are also}} eternal, infinite and uncreated, in that their origin {{is not in}} the ousia of God, but that their origin is in the hypostasis of God called the Father. The double procession of the Holy Spirit bears some resemblance to the teachings of Macedonius I of Constantinople and his sect called the Pneumatomachians in that the Holy Spirit is created by the Son and a servant of the Father and the Son. It was Macedonius' position that caused the specific wording of the section on the Holy Spirit by St Gregory of Nyssa in the finalized Nicene creed.|$|E
25|$|The film then {{depicts the}} grandfather's {{struggle}} {{to accept the}} <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to save his grandson is {{at the cost of}} his eyesight. He tries {{to come to terms with}} the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him everything possible before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by a day. That afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states quite simply that he wanted to show Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.|$|E
25|$|The {{project has}} not been without problems, however. The SFO {{extension}} drew 35,107 daily riders by 2008, significantly less than its opening target of 50,000 average weekday riders. The most use the new line has gotten on any single day was 37,200; the SFO Station received an average of 6,781 daily passenger exits in 2015. Another significant problem of note had been the rocky relationship between BART and San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) which was {{not a part of}} the BART district, but by agreement was responsible for the extension's operating costs. Fueled by the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extension was not paying for itself, the acrimony between BART and SamTrans over changes and reductions in bus and train service reached a high.|$|E

25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. The polite fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney {{as one of}} the obstacles to ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, {{there is no way of}} knowing whether Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored. Shakespeare's plays seemed to have suffered the severest form of censorship under Tilney.|$|E
25|$|The South Wales Railway {{had been}} {{constructed}} {{on the broad}} gauge, and it was assumed at first that the line from Monmouth would join it at Chepstow, and also be constructed on that gauge. The Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway {{was built on the}} narrow gauge (as standard gauge was then known), but interchange with that line was not considered important. Nevertheless, national government had taken an interest in the gauge of new and existing railways, and a Gauge Commission had been appointed to recommend policy. This recommended that no new lines should be built on the broad gauge, except for certain designated extensions to the existing broad gauge network. This resulted in the Railway Regulation (Gauge) Act 1846, which mandated that recommendation. The intended gauge of the Wye Valley Railway was changed to narrow gauge, no doubt recognising the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> South Wales Railway itself would eventually be converted.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him as president. Lee {{continued}} to democratize the government and decrease the concentration of government authority {{in the hands of}} mainland Chinese. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative body defunct in 2005）, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted.|$|E

25|$|Sinha and Richards both {{argue that}} the south only used states' rights when they {{disagreed}} with a policy. Examples given are a states' right to engage in slavery or to suppress freedom of speech. They argue that it was instead {{the result of the}} increasing cognitive dissonance in the minds of Northerners and (some) Southern non-slaveowners between the ideals that the United States was founded upon and identified itself as standing for, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights, and the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> slave-power represented, as what they describe as an anti-democratic, counter-republican, oligarchic, despotic, authoritarian, if not totalitarian, movement for ownership of human beings as the personal chattels of the slaver. As this cognitive dissonance increased, the people of the Northern states, and the Northern states themselves, became increasingly inclined to resist the encroachments of the slave power upon their states' rights and encroachments of the slave power by and upon the federal government of the United States. The slave power, having failed to maintain its dominance of the federal government through democratic means, sought other means of maintaining its dominance of the federal government, by means of military aggression, by right of force and coercion, and thus, the Civil War occurred.|$|E
500|$|Besides directing, Leni was {{a painter}} and set designer. The sets of the film were {{designed}} by Leni and fabricated by Charles D. Hall, who later designed the sets of Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931). Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters. He wrote, [...] "It is not extreme <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> camera perceives, but {{the reality of the}} inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving than what we see through everyday eyes ...." [...] Leni went on to direct the Charlie Chan film The Chinese Parrot (1927), The Man Who Laughs (1928), and The Last Warning (1929) before his death in 1929 from blood poisoning.|$|E
500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of Iron Man, and takes place {{simultaneously}} with the events of The Incredible Hulk and Thor. The filmmakers continued to reference other Marvel films by again including Captain America's shield. Favreau explained, [...] "We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had {{to figure out how to}} deal with the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shield was in his workshop." [...] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther. A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask who Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by eventual Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and [...] director Jon Watts. The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.|$|E

500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that Wilfrid [...] "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that [...] "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that [...] "Wilfrid's character was such {{that he seems to}} have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the <b>reality</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.|$|E
