Beneficial use of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> can save landfill places, sparse natural resources, and energy consumed in milling and hauling virgin materials. Low price of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> is favorable to cost-saving in pavement projects. Considering the availability of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in the State of Maryland (MD), four abundant <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>recycled</b> concrete aggregate (RCA), recycled asphalt pavement (RAP), foundry sand (FS), and dredged materials (DM), were studied. A survey was conducted to collect the information of current usage of the four <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in States’ Department of Transportation (DOTs). Based on literature review, mechanical and environmental properties, recommendations, and suggested test standards were investigated separately for the four <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in different applications. Constrains in using these materials were further studied {{in order to provide}} recommendations for the development of related MD specifications. To measure social and environmental benefits from using <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> life-cycle assessment was carried out with life-cycle analysis (LCA) program, PaLATE, and green highway rating system, BEST-in-Highway. The survey results indicated the wide use of RAP and RCA in hot mix asphalt (HMA) and graded aggregate base (GAB) respectively, while FS and DM are less used in field. Environmental concerns are less, but the possibly low quality and some adverse mechanical characteristics may hinder the widely use of these <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> Technical documents and current specifications provided by State DOTs are good references to the usage of these materials in MD. Literature review showed consistent results with the survey. Studies from experimental research or site tests showed satisfactory performance of these materials in highway applications, when the substitution rate, gradation, temperature, moisture, or usage of additives, etc. meet some requirements. The results from LCA revealed significant cost savings in using <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> Energy and water consumption, gas emission, and hazardous waste generation generally showed reductions to some degree.

40|$|<b>Recycled</b> <b>materials</b> are {{increasingly}} being used or considered for mechanical stabilization of abutments and earth slopes associated with transportation facilities. Specifically, recycled plastic lumber, recycled railroad rails, recycled guardrail posts, used railroad ties, “w-beam ” guardrail sections, and even discarded snowplow blades {{have been used in}} a variety of applications. Most of these materials have “virgin ” counterparts of similar form and function that are in relatively common use. The primary task associated with implementing use of these <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> for stabilization of slopes therefore generally lies in adapting or modifying conventional design and construction procedures to account for the different, and sometimes unique and beneficial, properties of the <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> as compared to the virgin materials. Despite the similarities among applications where <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> are used for slope stabilization, the design of stabilization measures using these materials remains rather empirical and a comprehensive philosophy that is suitable for use with the different materials has yet to be established. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize current uses of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> for mechanical stabilization of earth slopes and to elucidate the similarities and differences in characteristics of both the <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> themselves and the applications in which they are used.

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the gas atomisation spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of overspray (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the overspray powder, and thus <b>recycle</b> <b>material</b> {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the overspray powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 96 - 100). Concern {{for environmental}} degradation {{has been a}} motivating factor in the efforts to reuse or recycle construction and demolition waste. The intention {{is not only to}} reduce environmental desecration, but also to recycle the construction and demolition waste into potential building materials to be reused elsewhere. This study investigated the supply and demand of <b>recycled</b> construction <b>materials</b> in the Western Cape, and aimed to determine the perception held by important stakeholders about these materials. A qualitative analysis of the case study results revealed that poor waste management plans implemented on construction and demolition sites have affected the quality, supply and price of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition to this it was also revealed that the negative perceptions regarding <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> were the major barriers to creating an established secondary market. Inadequate knowledge and experience were major contributors to resistance to change of perceptions. A case study was conducted on Malans Quarries Recyclers {{in order to determine the}} supply of raw materials (construction and demolition waste) reaching the recycling plant; the supply of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> to the end user (consumer); and the recycling process that takes place. A sample of fifteen respondents from a variety of large, medium and small construction contractors, as well as consultants and civil engineering companies, completed a questionnaire to determine the demand for and perceptions about these materials. The qualitative analysis of the results of the questionnaires showed that the majority of respondents still preferred to use primary <b>materials</b> over <b>recycled</b> <b>materials.</b> However, it appears that the gap between respondents who prefer to use primary materials, and those who utilize <b>recycled</b> <b>materials,</b> has narrowed in comparison to results obtained in previous studies. It seems that there may be more usage of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> in the future. The results also revealed that tax cuts, could be a good economic incentive to encourage the use of <b>recycled</b> <b>material.</b> The questionnaire results also revealed that the majority of the respondents believed that landfill taxes where not effective in discouraging the illegal dumping of waste, and that the lack advertisements, and difficulties in obtaining <b>recycled</b> <b>materials</b> played a crucial role in the under-use of <b>recycled</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

The plan outlines various targets for 2015 and 2020, where they are meant to address both industrial and social sectors. The goals that were meant to be fulfilled by 2015 are having a widely used resource recycling technology that is advanced, re-using 72% of industrial solid waste, a modern system for recovering at least 70% of waste products, and improving the recovery of important resources. Other goals include raising energy productivity by 18.5%, increasing water productivity by 43%, aiding the recycling industry to reach US $276 billion of output, and re-using 70% of some minerals that are heavy pollutants. The goals for 2020 outlined in the plan include having an innovative industrial technological system that can efficiently re-use and <b>recycle</b> <b>material,</b> as well as {{the creation of a new}} industry related to the manufacturing of innovative technical equipment that promotes competitive advantages.

40|$|Abstract. As {{part of the}} Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) and its follow-up, {{work was}} carried out to {{categorise}} the activated material from the PPCS plant models A, B, C, D and AB according to its radiological properties. This paper presents the methodology and results of this study. The categorisation {{is based on the}} calculated contact dose rate, heat production and clearance index, with four categories of materials defined. These are Non Active Waste (NAW), Simple <b>Recycle</b> <b>Material</b> (SRM), Complex <b>Recycle</b> <b>Material</b> (CRM) and Permanent Disposal Waste (PDW). Data from the FISPACT- 2003 activation calculations are presented at 50 and 100 years after shutdown, for all materials (including component replacements) generated during the operation of the various power plants. A series of conclusions can be drawn from these studies; the most important is that by 100 years after shutdown {{there is no need to}} permanently dispose of any material in a repository, it being feasible to recycle everything, according to the adopted radiological criteria. Whether or not such recycling is likely to be considered economically viable will be a subject of future studies; the conclusion that permanent disposal is not technically necessary gives a strong indication of the low radiological hazard. Comparisons of the radiotoxicity of material from the various PPCS power plants with that from other methods of power generation have been made and confirm the relatively low environmental impact of fusion. 1...|$|E
