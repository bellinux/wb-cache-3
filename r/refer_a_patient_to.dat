In addition, they believe that it would create a captive referral system, which limits competition by other providers.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{communication}} between an Oral Medicine Unit and general dental practitioners (GDP) in the West of Scotland is reported. This investigation was done {{by means of a}} postal questionnaire aimed at identifying the factors affecting the efficiency of communication and possible ways of improving the communication. The authors were concerned that in correspondence sent back to the referring GDP there may be some factor involved in the patient's care which was being omitted and which GDPs would like to see included in future correspondence. In addition the authors wished to ascertain the familiarity of the GDP, with the procedure for <b>referring</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> the Unit. The final part of the questionnaire invited constructive comments and criticisms from the GDP. Fifty percent of GDPs who responded to the questionnaire thought that the information received on the diagnosis, details of drug therapy and follow-up requirements of the patient was essential. Nearly all GDPs were familiar with the procedure for <b>referring</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> the clinic. However, only 57 % were satisfied with the time lapse between the initial referral and receiving a reply.

50|$|Before {{treating}} a patient, a psychologist must learn as many facts {{as possible about}} {{the patient and the}} situation. A history of physical symptoms and a psychosocial history help narrow down possible correlations and causes. Psychosocial history covers the family history of disorders and worries about illnesses, chronically ill parents, stress and negative life events, problems with family functioning, and school difficulties (academic and social).These indicators may reveal whether there is a connection between stress-inducing events and an onset or increase in pain, and the removal in one leading to the removal in the other. They also may show if the patient gains something from being ill and how their reported pain matches medical records.Physicians may <b>refer</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> a psychologist after conducting medical evaluations, learning about any psychosocial problems in the family, discussing possible connections of pain with stress, and assuring the patient that the treatment will be a combination between medical and psychological care. Psychologists must then do their best {{to find a way to}} measure the pain, perhaps by asking the patient to put it on a number scale. Pain questionnaires, screening instruments, interviews, and inventories may be conducted to discover the possibility of somatoform disorders. Projective tests may also be used.|$|E

The aims of the current study were to describe services available in general practices for the management of suicidal <b>patients</b> and <b>to</b> examine GPs views on these services. We carried out a questionnaire and interview study in the North West of England. We collected data on GPs views of suicide prevention generally as well as local mental health service provision. Findings: During the study period (2003 - 2005) we used the National Confidential Inquiry Suicide database to identify 286 general practitioners (GPs) who had registered patients who had died by suicide. Data were collected from GPs and practice managers in 167 practices. Responses suggested that there was greater availability of services and training for general mental health issues than for suicide prevention specifically. The three key themes which emerged from GP interviews were: barriers accessing primary or secondary mental health services; obstacles faced when <b>referring</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> <b>to</b> mental health services; managing change within mental health care services Conclusions: Health professionals have an important role to play in preventing suicide.
