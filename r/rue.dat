30|$|PC {{parameters}} of the <b>RUEs</b> are optimized. After RNs are deployed in the network the inter-cell interference increases. More concretely, <b>RUEs</b> experience very high TP levels while causing interference to MUEs. As we focus on achieving a homogeneous user performance over the whole cell area, being a requirement for LTE-Advanced, the performance of MUEs is prioritized. In particular, the interference imposed by <b>RUEs</b> is reduced by adequately adjusting their PC parameters such {{that the impact of}} the interference due to <b>RUEs</b> on the performance of MUEs becomes minimal.|$|R

In order to accomplish this revitalization and attract investment, public buildings were constructed as part of the Léon Suys project including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Halles Centrales/Centrale Hallen, a good example of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. The monumental fountain that was to break the monotony of the boulevards at Fontainas Square was abandoned for budgetary reasons.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his tenure at Richmond, De La <b>Rue</b> briefly took {{the role of}} senior air staff officer (SASO) at Central Area Command in October 1940. The following month, his name was put forward to establish an RAAF depot in London {{to look after the}} interests of the many thousands of Australian airmen disembarking there, but financial considerations led to the plan being scuppered temporarily. In fact, RAAF Overseas Headquarters would be formed on 1December 1941, with Air Marshal Williams appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC). Meanwhile, De La <b>Rue</b> also missed out on a potential posting to the Middle East that was suggested by the British but turned down by the Australian government. Promoted acting air commodore, he became the inaugural AOC Western Area, headquartered in Perth, on 9January 1941. Among the units he controlled in this position were No.14 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, No.25 (General Purpose) Squadron, No.35 (Transport) Squadron, and No.77 (Fighter) Squadron. De La <b>Rue</b> worked assiduously to prepare the latter for operations, as it was the only fighter squadron able to defend Perth and Fremantle. He also lobbied RAAF Headquarters for a force of long-range PBY Catalina flying boats to augment the Lockheed Hudsons of No.14 Squadron, but none were offered to him. De La <b>Rue</b> was made a temporary air commodore in July 1941. By February 1942, he was the eighth most senior officer in the RAAF. Handing over Western Area Command to Air Commodore Ray Brownell in January 1943, De La <b>Rue</b> became Inspector of Administration at RAAF Headquarters, in which post he saw {{out the rest of the}} war. On 8June 1944, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

In 1918, he was given command of No.223 Squadron in the newly formed Royal Air Force. The following year he took charge of No. 270 Squadron RAF in Egypt. Returning to Australia, De La <b>Rue</b> joined the short-lived Australian Air Corps in 1920, and became {{a founding member of}} the RAAF in March 1921. Specialising in maritime aviation, he led seaplane formations based at Point Cook, Victoria, during the 1920s and early 1930s.|$|E
