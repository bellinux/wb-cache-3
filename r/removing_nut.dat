40|$|ABSTRACT. Pistachio (Pistacia vera) nuts with {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop imaging algorithms to improve sorting of nuts with the following shell defects: oily stains, dark stains, adhering hull, and the following kernel defects: navel orangeworm (NOW) damage, fungal decay, and Aspergillus molds, all of which indicate risk of aflatoxin contamination. Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal nuts from those nuts with oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as nuts having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that nuts having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal nuts with an accuracy of 98 %. <b>Removing</b> <b>nuts</b> with oily stain, dark stain, and adhering hull will also remove 89. 7 % of nuts with kernel decay, 93. 8 % of nuts with Aspergillus molds present, and 98. 7 % of NOW positive nuts...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{at which}} fallen hickory <b>nuts</b> are <b>removed</b> from beneath the parent tree, and the effect on this rate of the seed {{predator}} Conotrachelus affinis, was studied in an oak-hickory forest in southeastern Michigan, USA, during {{a year in which}} few nuts were produced. The trees responded to Conotrachelus, which destroyed half the nut crop, by aborting inviable nuts during the summer. The seed dispersers, mostly gray squirrels, <b>removed</b> fallen <b>nuts</b> rapidly, showing the ability to distinguish viable <b>nuts</b> and <b>remove</b> them preferentially. The number of <b>nuts</b> <b>removed</b> in a week varies directly with the number available, and removal rate increases when many viable nuts are falling. The death of most seeds before dispersal, and the squirrels' efficiency at foraging on nuts and recovering them after burial, imply that successful hickory reproduction takes place only in years of heavy nut production. ...|$|R
40|$|This project {{includes}} the design, fabrication, testing, {{and analysis of}} a custom tool that will allow individuals who work on automobiles and machines to have more versatility {{in the process of}} <b>removing</b> <b>nuts</b> and bolts. The tool works as a normal socket wrench as well as a linear torque transmitter through a secondary drive {{on the bottom of the}} wrench which transmits the torque from the bottom of the wrench to the socket head through the internal gear system without having to move the wrench itself. This tool will allow mechanics and machine repair professionals to remove difficult to access bolts more efficiently and in turn save them time and money. The gear system is designed and tested to transmit up to 120 foot pounds of torque which accounts for the majority of bolt removal tasks. A survey done on both people who work on automobiles as well as people who occasionally use a wrench for simple repairs will give a diverse input as to the practicality and ease of use of this custom tool. The results indicate the tool is definitely useful in special cases and can save adequate time in certain situations...|$|R

This project was carried out to improve and {{optimize}} the tire nut removal for wheel with Pitch Cycle Diameter (PCD) 114. 4 mm such as Proton Waja, Proton Saga, Kia Careens, and Hyundai Sonata. In this academic project, the main objective was to improve the tire nuts removal in term of size, weight, efficiency and flexibility. The tire nut removal prototype had been involved design, design calculation, analysis, simulation approach and material selection.

50|$|Ideally, {{the nuts}} (or bolts) should be {{tightened}} with a torque wrench. Lug wrenches {{are much less}} expensive because they lack the ability to measure or limit the force used. Installing a wheel with a lug wrench thus requires a bit of rough guessing about proper tightness. Excessive force can strip threads or make the nuts very difficult to remove. Also, uneven torque between the various lug nuts, or excessive torque, can lead to warping of the brake rotor if the car is equipped with disc brakes. For this reason, impact wrenches should properly be used only for <b>removing</b> lug <b>nuts,</b> not for tightening them, although in practice this rule is often ignored for convenience's sake, even by professional mechanics.|$|R

50|$|The two tire changers <b>remove</b> the lug <b>nuts</b> and (if {{not done}} by the jackman) the old tire and tighten the lug nuts on the new tire. One tire changer is solely {{responsible}} for the front tires, while the other {{is responsible for the}} rears. NASCAR requires a wheel to have five traditional lug nuts, as opposed to the single locking lug nut seen in Formula One. Many jackmen watch the tire changers to make sure the lug nuts are tight.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} is the [...] "locking wheel nut", {{which is almost}} universally used for alloy wheels in the United Kingdom. One standard lug nut on each wheel is replaced with a nut which requires a special and unique key (typically a computer-designed, rounded star shape) to fit and <b>remove</b> the <b>nut.</b> This helps to discourage theft of wheels. However, universal removal tools are available which grip {{the head of the}} locking nut using a hardened left-hand thread. The success of these depends on whether there is room to use it in the lug hole, and whether the manufacturer has incorporated a free-spinning outer casing to the lock. Keeping an appropriate tool to lock and unlock aftermarket nuts, and a spare set of nuts, with the spare tire in the boot of the car is recommended by manufacturers.|$|R

40|$|A dense algal {{population}} is of primary importance in sewage maturation ponds {{for the removal}} of plant nutrients, especially ammonia and orthophosphate. In the Republic of South Africa and in South West Africa sudden {{algal population}} declines have occurred at times in maturation ponds. These declines cause serious problems in the reclamation of purified sewage effluents for re-use. The possible causes of these declines are considered here from the physical, biological and chemical observations of an experimental maturation pond system. The algal populations of the system fluctuated from very high to very low cell concentrations. High algal cell concentrations were only maintained for short periods of time. Zooplankton grazing was responsible for removing algae from the system at times but this was not the primary cause of all the algal population declines. It is very likely that sudden increases in ammonia nitrogen concentration when the pH was high, caused the algal population declines. Carbon deficiencies could (ââhave occurred during peak algal cell concentrations which would have resulted in population declines. A possible means of preventing the algal population declines could be by increasing the retention period of the pond system.

This eVect may indicate a diVerence in how easily animals are able to associate diVerent outcomes with the conspeciWc or could simply {{be the result of}} having food present in only some of the demonstrations. To investigate we tested a scat-ter-hoarding mammal, the eastern grey squirrel, on its ability to learn to choose between two pots of food after watching a conspeciWc <b>remove</b> a <b>nut</b> from one of them on every trial. Squirrels that were rewarded for choosing the opposite pot to the conspeciWc chose correctly more frequently than squirrels rewarded for choosing the same pot (a feature-neg-ative eVect). Another group of squirrels was tested on their ability to choose between the two pots when the rewarded option was indicated by a piece of card. This time, squirrels showed no signiWcant diVerence in their ability to learn to choose the same or the opposite pot. The results add to anec-dotal reports that grey squirrels can learn by observing a conspeciWc and suggest that even when all subjects are pro-vided with demonstrations with the same content, not all learning occurs equally. Prior experience or expectations of the association between a cue (a conspeciWc) and food inXu-ences what can be learned through observation whilst previ-ously unfamiliar cues (the card) can be associated more readily with any outcome...|$|R
40|$|Animals provide {{benefits}} to agriculture through {{the provision of}} ecosystem services, but also inflict costs such as damaging crops. These benefits and costs are mostly examined independently, rather than comparing the trade-offs of animal activity in the same system and quantifying the net return from beneficial minus detrimental activities. Here, I examine the net return associated with the activity of seed-eating birds in almond orchards by quantifying the economic {{costs and benefits of}} bird consumption of almonds. Pre-harvest, the consumption of harvestable almonds by birds cost growers AUD$ 57. 50 ha- 1 when averaged across the entire plantation. Post-harvest, the same bird species provide an ecosystem service by <b>removing</b> mummified <b>nuts</b> from trees that growers otherwise need to remove to reduce threats from fungal infection or insect pest infestations. The value of this ecosystem service ranged from AUD$ 82. 50 ha- 1 â$ 332. 50 ha- 1 based on the replacement costs of mechanical or manual removal of mummified nuts, respectively. Hence, bird consumption of almonds yielded a positive net return of AUD$ 25 â$ 275 ha- 1 averaged across the entire plantation. However, bird activity varied spatially resulting in positive net returns occurring primarily at the edges of crops where activity was higher, compared to negative net returns in crop interiors. Moreover, partial mummy nut removal by birds meant that bird activity may only reduce costs to growers rather than replace these costs completely. Similar cost-benefit trade-offs exist across nature, and quantifying net returns can better inform land management decisions such as when to control pests or promote ecosystem service provision...|$|R

In some early recordings, Malmsteen instead used the HS3 model in the neck and bridge positions and a disconnected stock Fender single-coil pickup in the middle. In even earlier recordings, Malmsteen was using DiMarzio FS-1 pickups.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} and investigate a compactified {{version of the}} four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT solution, generalizing the compactified Schwarzschild black hole that has been previously studied by several workers. Our approach to compactification is based on dimensional reduction {{with respect to the}} stationary Killing vector, resulting in three-dimensional gravity coupled to a nonlinear sigma model. Using that the original non-compactified solution corresponds to a target space geodesic, the problem can be linearized much {{in the same way as}} in the case of no electric nor NUT charge. An interesting feature of the solution family is that for nonzero electric charge but vanishing NUT charge, the solution has a curvature singularity on a torus that surrounds the event horizon, but this singularity is <b>removed</b> when the <b>NUT</b> charge is switched on. We also treat the Schwarzschild case in a more complete way than has been done previously.

5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to <b>remove</b> the <b>nut,</b> it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
40|$|A 4 x 4 {{factorial}} experiment with a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted separately on two major pistachio varieties, Ohady and Kaleghoochy, {{to investigate the}} effects of shaking amplitude and frequency on pistachio nut and cluster detachment. Four levels of shaking frequencies used for Ohady were 5, 7. 5, 10 and 12. 5 Hz, while those of Kaleghoochy were 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 and 15 Hz. Four levels of shaking amplitude for Ohady were 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm, while those of the Kaleghoochy were 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm. Analysis of variance and mean comparison showed {{that the effects of}} shaking amplitude and frequency on pistachio nut and cluster detachment were significant on both varieties. It was found that in Ohady, at frequency of 12. 5 Hz and amplitude of 80 mm, the maximum effective nut detachment occurred. But considering the need to limit both yield loss and limb damage to 5 % and minimizing the power requirement of the limb shaker, applying shaking amplitude of 60 mm and frequency of 10 Hz, which detaches 95 % of the nuts, is considered as the most suitable combination of shaking amplitude and frequency. Also, at amplitude of 80 mm and frequency of 12. 5 Hz, the highest percentage of cluster detachment occurred. Here again, by considering limb damage and power requirement, applying shaking frequency of 12. 5 Hz at 60 mm amplitude with 69 % cluster detachment was selected as the most suitable combination. In Kaleghoochi, at amplitude of 100 mm and frequency of 15 Hz, nut detachment was 100 %, while the need to limit limb damage and power consumption, the combination of 60 mm amplitude and 15 Hz frequency with 97. 2 % nut detachment was selected as the most suitable one. For cluster harvesting of Kaleghoochy, shaking amplitudes of 60 and 40 mm and frequency of 12. 5 Hz with cluster detachment of 75 and 69 percent, respectively were selected as the most suitable ones. The average ratio of tensile force required for <b>removing</b> pistachio <b>nut</b> to its weight (F/W), and the ratio of tensile force required for removing pistachio cluster to its weight (V/W), which could be considered as an index of ease of detachment, were measured 6. 2 and 37 for Ohady and 9 and 37. 8 for Kaleghoochy, respectively. Finally, we may conclude that by applying the suitable combination of shaking amplitude and frequency, shake harvesting of pistachio could be practiced successfully...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 97 - 105) Animals {{dependent upon}} cached resources must allocate foraging effort to both consuming and hoarding prey items. To {{examine the relationship}} between the number of prey items consumed and the number hoarded by individuals over daily and seasonal time, I conducted artificial patch-feeding experiments on a population of free-ranging, individually marked fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). California walnuts were provided at a constant patch density in day-long feeding trials replicated weekly over nine months in a northern Illinois park. The proportion of all <b>nuts</b> <b>removed</b> that were consumed tended to decrease throughout the day, while the proportion of nuts hoarded increased. Foraging rates, handling times, and the proportion of nuts consumed showed significant quadratic seasonal time trends with winter minima or maxima. In addition, individuals displayed consistent consuming and hoarding patterns unrelated to age or gender. I defined two foraging types: (1) Consumers, animals that consumed proportionately more prey than they hoarded and had high prey intake rates and total daily consumption; and (2) Hoarders, animals that hoarded proportionately more prey than they consumed, had high hoarding rates and lower total daily consumption. The differences between the types remained distinct over time. Hoarding was relatively static in Consumers but was highly plastic in Hoarders. Both types had similar prey-handling times and locations, and oriented caches toward den trees. To determine whether these individuals' foraging patterns were fixed or a response to specific nut species, I conducted a similar series of experiments using three prey types: California walnuts (CWN), shagbark hickory nuts (SH), and red oak acorns (RO). Both Consumers and Hoarders consumed proportionately more of the nuts containing higher energy per gram when presented monospecifically (CWN=SH>RO), and more of the prey with higher total energy when presented simultaneously (CWN>SH). Handling times were similar for CWN and SH consumed (CWN=SH>RO), but not for those hoarded (CWN>SH=RO), suggesting that the quantity of prey consumed or hoarded was influenced by prey quality, while handling location decisions were influenced by prey size. Although Consumers and Hoarders spent comparable amounts of time foraging on each prey type, they continued to significantly differ in proportion consumption of all species. M. S.
