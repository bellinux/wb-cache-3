40|$|Background: Challenges and {{uncertainties}} with test <b>result</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{can lead to}} diagnostic errors. Primary care doctors are at a higher risk than specialists of making these errors, due to the range in complexity and severity of conditions that they encounter. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the challenges that primary care doctors face with test <b>result</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and to identify potential countermeasures to address these. Methods: A survey was sent out to 7800 primary care doctors in South Africa. Questionnaire themes included doctors’ uncertainty with interpreting test results, mechanisms used to overcome this uncertainty, challenges with appropriate <b>result</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and perceived solutions for interpreting results. Results: Of the 552 responses received, the prevalence of challenges with <b>result</b> <b>interpretation</b> was estimated in an average of 17 % of diagnostic encounters. The most commonly-reported challenges were not receiving test results {{in a timely manner}} (51 % of respondents) and previous results not being easily available (37 %). When faced with diagnostic uncertainty, 84 % of respondents would either follow-up and reassess the patient or discuss the case with a specialist, and 67 % would contact a laboratory professional. The most useful test utilisation enablers were found to be: interpretive comments (78 % of respondents), published guidelines (74 %), and a dedicated laboratory phone line (72 %). Conclusion: Primary care doctors acknowledge uncertainty with test <b>result</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Potential countermeasures include the addition of patient-specific interpretive comments, the availability of guidelines or algorithms, and a dedicated laboratory phone line. The benefit of enhanced test <b>result</b> <b>interpretation</b> would reduce diagnostic error rates.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the past}} decade federal {{education}} policy has drastically shifted the role of student achievement tests in directing educational decision-making. Despite public policy directives for increased use of test results to improve educational outcomes, there is little understanding in the research literature of practitioners 2 ̆ 7 knowledge and skills in interpreting and using educational data, such as test results, to enhance classroom instruction and student learning. This study surveyed over two hundred educational practitioners (N= 220) {{to learn more about}} their abilities to locate, interpret and use assessment results, as well as how self-confident they indicated they were in their knowledge and skills regarding assessment practices. Respondents represented a diverse cross-section of practitioners and included practitioners that worked within an AEA, practitioners that worked within a large public school district, and practitioners that worked within a private school setting. The survey that was developed and administered to the practitioners, the Assessment Results Survey, was composed of two separate surveys administered at the same time: The Assessment <b>Results</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Use Survey and the Assessment Self-Confidence Survey. The first survey assessed practitioners 2 ̆ 7 ability to locate, use and interpret assessment results. The second survey assessed practitioners 2 ̆ 7 self-confidence with respect to assessment practices. Results indicated that practitioners performed well on all sub-scores (Locate Data, Interpret Data, and Use Data) of the Assessment <b>Results</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Use Survey. Practitioners also indicated high levels of confidence with respect to assessment practices. Background variables such as years of teaching experience, completion of college-level coursework in assessment, and participation in professional development focused on assessment were used to compare practitioners 2 ̆ 7 overall performance and responses on the surveys. Practitioners that received college-level training in assessment demonstrated higher performance on the Assessment <b>Results</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Use Survey than practitioners that indicated no college-level training. Practitioners that participated in professional development indicated a higher level of self-confidence regarding their assessment knowledge and skills, but did not demonstrate significantly higher performance on the Assessment <b>Results</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Use Survey than those that had not received professional development...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{accounts}} of referential adjectives have examined their {{status in the}} structure of action nominalizations in correlation with the event vs. <b>result</b> <b>interpretation</b> of nominals. They have been argued to behave like noun phrases (Grimshaw 1990), to introduce new entities into the discourse (Giorgi and Longobardi 1991) or to simply modify deverbal nominals (Oersnes and Markantonatou 2002). This paper attempts a comparative study of referential adjectives in psychological nominalizations in English and Romanian. We argue that the restrictions on the occurrence of referential adjectives in psych nominalizations are imposed by the language specific functional structure of the DP. The paper is organized as follows. In section one we briefly overview the literature on referential adjectives in action nominalizations. In section two we look at the distribution of referential adjectives in psychological nominalizations and in section three we correlate modification by referential adjectives with the process vs. <b>result</b> <b>interpretation</b> of psych nominals...|$|R
