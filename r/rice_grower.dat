40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this research}} was {{to examine the effects of}} social and economic factors on credit demand of <b>rice</b> <b>growers</b> from arties and banks in Gujranwala district, Pakistan. The Crosssectional data from 313 randomly selected loan beneficiaries (<b>rice</b> <b>growers),</b> were obtained. The data were analyzed by using multiple regression, t-test, percentages and frequency distributions. It was concluded that factors which showed significant results in both sources banks and arties were farm size, income level, time requirement, payback period and no. of dependent schooling children. Apart from the mentioned factors which other studies have also established, more interesting factors have been identified by this study including the question of trust between Arties and borrowers built on information of borrowers on reputation obtained by Arties and also follow up by arties on borrowers’ use of credit. Here information seems to play a crucial role in building trust and therefore easing conditions for borrowing since most borrowers received their loans without any collateral conditions. Based on these results, it is suggested that banks must improve the amount of loans to agriculture sector in general and to <b>rice</b> <b>growers</b> in particular taking into account information and follow up of their clients. The lenient polices must be formulated by banks regarding collateral securities so that small scale <b>rice</b> <b>growers</b> can avail the loan facilities at lesser collateral conditions.

In 1911, Frank D. and Fred Fowler began selling 12,000 acres, {{promoting}} the area's rich soil. The same year a post office was opened. According to one story, the town was named Magnet because the good soil would draw potential farmers. Another account claimed it was because saloons there would attract drinkers from Bay City, which was dry. In 1912 the new town boasted a few grocery stores plus a drugstore, gristmill, hotel, lumberyard and school. Within two years, there were forty persons living in Magnet alongside a blacksmith shop, canning factory, cotton gin, garage, two general stores, <b>rice</b> <b>grower,</b> and the Truck Growers Association.

40|$|Rice forage {{systems can}} {{increase}} the land use efficiency in paddy fields, improve the self-sufficient feed ratio, and provide environmental benefits for agro-ecosystems. This system often decreased economic benefits compared with those through imported commercial forage feed, particularly in Japan. We observed the productivities of winter forage after rice harvest between conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) in a field experiment. An on-farm evaluation was performed to determine the self-sufficient ratio of feed and forage production costs based on farm evaluation of the dairy farmer and the <b>rice</b> <b>grower,</b> who adopted a rice forage system. The field experiment detected {{no significant difference in}} forage production and quality between CT and NT after rice harvest.

Therefore, this study demonstrated the positive benefits for dairy farmers and rice growers in Japan when adopting a rice forage system with NT, which could improve the self-sufficient feed ratio and reduce production costs...|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} assess the effects of different periodical water stress combined with potassium fertilization regimes on growth, yield, leaf gas exchanges and biochemical changes in rice grown in pots and compare them with standard local <b>rice</b> <b>grower</b> practices. Five treatments including (1) standard local grower’s practice (control, 80 CF = 80 kg K 2 O/ha + control flooding); (2) 120 PW 15 = 120 kg K 2 O/ha + periodical water stress for 15 days; (3) 120 DS 15 V = 120 kg K 2 O/ha + drought stress for 15 days during the vegetative stage; (4) 120 DS 25 V = 120 kg K 2 O/ha + drought stress for 25 days and (5) 120 DS 15 R = 120 kg K 2 O/ha + drought stress for 15 days during the reproductive stage, were evaluated in this experiment. Control and 120 PW 15 treatments were stopped at 100 DAS, and continuously saturated conditions were applied until harvest. It was found that rice under 120 PW 15 treatment showed tolerance to drought stress evidenced by increased water use efficiency, peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT) and proline levels, maximum efficiency of photosystem II (fv/fm) and lower minimal fluorescence (fo), compared to other treatments. Path coefficient analysis revealed that most of parameters contribute directly rather than indirectly to rice yield. In this experiment, there were four factors that are directly involved with rice yield: grain soluble sugar, photosynthesis, water use efficiency and total chlorophyll content. The residual factors affecting rice yield are observed to be quite low in the experiment (0. 350), confirming that rice yield was mostly influenced by the parameters measured during the study...|$|E
40|$|As the world's {{second largest}} <b>rice</b> <b>grower,</b> India can {{generate}} up to 5 million MT of ash from burning rice husk for fuel. The material that remains after combustion, known as Rice Husk Ash (RHA), {{is high in}} silica content, provides good insulation, and has a large surface areas for chemical reactions. These characteristics of RHA {{allow it to be}} used in a variety of applications such as insulation in steelmaking, substitute for raw material in the cement and brickmaking industry, water filtration, pest control, and the production of precipitated silica. While RHA is currently used in the steel industry in India, and to a smaller degree, in the cement industry, there are many waste-to-wealth opportunities to use RHA which are currently not being leveraged. This results in a loss of land for RHA disposal and more importantly, wasted opportunities to extract value from RHA. There has been a large amount of research conducted on using RHA. The publications around this research have typically been broad and qualitative, describing the potential applications of RHA on a high level, or focused on technical details pertaining to a specific set up using RHA. While the information currently available is extremely important, it is not easily leveraged by entrepreneurs who would be interested in increasing their use of RHA. There seems to be a lack of studies which compare the various applications for RHA qualitatively. The purpose of this thesis is to help current and potential RHA entrepreneurs to apply available research in making decisions about how to make use of RHA, by creating a framework to assess the applications of RHA economically. While this paper is focused on RHA, it is intended that the framework can be used in assessing opportunities to use other biomass ash material. by Lesley Yu. Thesis: S.

FPM fields were managed by each <b>rice</b> <b>grower</b> using current cultivation methods, but in each VRF field fertilizer application was prescribed using soil test results {{and the amount of}} N fertilizer for top-dressing at panicle initiation stage was calculated using rice growth value at that stage. In VRF fields, the total amount of N fertilizer application was less (72 kg ha- 1) than that in FPM fields (103 kg ha- 1). However, the amount of K 2 O ertilizer application was more in VRF fields (60 kg ha- 1) than that in FPM fields (52 kg ha- 1). The amount of P 2 O 5 fertilizer application was similar between the VRF and FPM fields. Plant height was significantly shorter and the number of tillers was significantly more at VRF fields than at the FPM fields. Coefficient of variation (CV) of each growth characteristic measured in VRF was lower than that of FPM fields at panicle initiation stage. There was no difference in culm and panicle length and panicle number between them at the grain filling stage, but CV of panicle numbers per m 2 decreased in VRF compared with that of the FPM fields. Rice yield was not different between VRF and FPM fields despite higher brown rice recovery and 1, 000 -grain weight in VRF fields. Under VRF management, head rice yield increased due to an increase in head rice ratio accompanied by a reduction in brown rice protein content and variation of quality characteristics. These results suggest that VRF application based on soil tests and measurement of rice growth value at panicle initiation stage has the potential for quality control and production of high quality rice through increasing uniformity of growth and reducing the variability in quality among individual fields...|$|E
