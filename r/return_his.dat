5|$|Meanwhile, {{support for}} Louis' {{campaign}} was diminishing in France, and {{he concluded that}} the war in England was lost. He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in <b>return,</b> <b>his</b> followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year.

5|$|The first {{dispute over}} Springbok colours {{came from the}} rise of rugby league in South Africa in the 1950s. SARB felt it was their duty {{as members of the}} International Rugby Football Board to defend amateur rugby union against {{professional}} rugby league after several Springboks had defected to rugby league. In 1959, the SARB declared that all players that represented South Africa in rugby union had to sign a declaration they would not turn professional for two years. Any player who refused this was obliged to <b>return</b> <b>his</b> Springbok colours and was not permitted to purchase a replacement.|$|E

Despite not winning the Maxwell Award, he won two other Player of the Year awards.

5|$|Gaveston's {{exclusive}} {{access to the}} King provoked {{several members of the}} nobility, and in 1307 the King was again forced to send him into exile. During this absence he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal with the opposition, however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his <b>return</b> <b>his</b> behaviour became even more offensive, and by the Ordinances of 1311 it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. When he did return in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas of Lancaster and Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Lincoln, the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners.

5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his <b>return.</b> <b>His</b> inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
