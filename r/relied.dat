This production was seasonal, as only large planters had the funds and the technology necessary to produce alcohol year round.|$|E

25|$|If the {{end-user}} {{accepts the}} OpenID provider's request {{to trust the}} <b>relying</b> party, then the user-agent is redirected back to the <b>relying</b> party along with the end-user's credentials. That <b>relying</b> party must then confirm that the credentials really came from the OpenID provider. If the <b>relying</b> party and OpenID provider had previously established a shared secret, then the <b>relying</b> party can validate {{the identity of the}} OpenID provider by comparing its copy of the shared secret against the one received along with the end-user's credentials; such a <b>relying</b> party is called stateful because it stores the shared secret between sessions. In contrast, a stateless or dumb <b>relying</b> party must make one more background request (check_authentication) to ensure that the data indeed came from the OpenID provider.|$|R

The song was later released to iTunes on August 7, 2009, and on August 25, 2009, in the United States. Barry Weiss of RCA/Jive Label Group <b>relied</b> on a similar marketing scheme to that of Britney Spears' in 1999 when choosing to give the song away for free. The song's marketing <b>relied</b> heavily on radio once she had achieved a strong online interest, but its radio release was delayed until October in order to capitalize on social media's interest in her. After spreading the song quickly topped iTunes charts.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} <b>relied</b> on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method <b>relied</b> on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans <b>relied</b> on a {{logistical}} {{system which}} was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front-line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network <b>relied</b> primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front while troops transported those items to the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E
