5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

500|$|When Bart <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cupcakes and collapses, it is {{a parody}} of a scene in A Clockwork Orange, where the main {{character}} Alex reaches for a woman's breasts. The Duff clock is {{a parody of}} the [...] "It's a Small World" [...] clock. In the Duff TV advertisement, {{a group of women}} were leading an anti-sexism protest in front of the McMahon and Tate building, a reference to the advertising agency from Bewitched. The scene toward the end where Moe points toward individual customers declaring they will [...] "be back" [...] before pointing toward and addressing the viewer (later revealed to be Barney via a cutaway) is a parody {{of the end of the}} film Reefer Madness. The final scene, where Homer and Marge cycle into the distance while [...] "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" [...] plays is a reference to the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Homer's song [...] "It was a Very Good Beer" [...] is sung to the tune of the 1961 song [...] "It Was a Very Good Year"; one of its lyrics is Homer stating he stayed up and listened to the music of the British band Queen. Bart sitting in the chair, stroking the hamster is a reference to James Bond character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who strokes a cat in his chair.|$|E

2500|$|The Watcher in the Water {{appears in}} both film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings: Ralph Bakshi's {{animated}} The Lord of the Rings (1978) and Peter Jackson's [...] (2001). Bakshi's work follows the book faithfully for this sequence, {{with only the}} Watcher's tentacles seen. After Sam frees Frodo from its clutches, Boromir hacks at its tentacles. [...] In Jackson's adaptation, the Watcher is portrayed as a colossal, octopus-like monster with a gaping mouth and rows of sharp teeth. Here, too, it grabs Frodo with its tentacles {{as described in the}} book, and <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Fellowship following Frodo's rescue. Peter Jackson revealed in the commentaries that the original idea was to have Bill the Pony dragged under water by the Watcher; but this was changed. [...] In the DVD commentaries and production diaries, Jackson and his team explain that in their conception, the [...] "Nameless Things" [...] which gnaw tunnels beneath Moria (mentioned in the book by Gandalf) are more creatures like the Watcher. Originally, they planned to have an even longer version of the flashback in which Gandalf recounts his fight with the Balrog in Moria; this flashback would reveal that the underground lake {{at the bottom of the}} abyss cushioned the fall of Gandalf and the Balrog, who then (as in the book) continue to fight. [...] In the process, this would scare away multiple Watchers/Nameless Things. The entire sequence was ultimately cut for time and budgetary constraints, though concept art still exists on the DVD. [...] Moreover, in the concept art gallery feature on the DVD, John Howe and Alan Lee explain that the Watcher was one of the most difficult creatures to design, because it lacked virtually any description.|$|E
