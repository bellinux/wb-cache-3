If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis.</b> Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery.

However, the drug that blocks caveola-mediated endocytosis had a negligible effect on such infection. Infection was also inhibited when cells had been pretreated with bafilomycin A 1, which interferes with acidification of endosomes. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining indicated that the virus is internalized into early endosomes.

Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis.</b> Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis.

5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis</b> or {{membrane}} fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E

The higher order multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) also acts as a transferrin receptor. Transferrin-bound ferric iron is recognized by these transferrin receptors, triggering a conformational change that causes endocytosis.

The major target cell of JCV infection and lytic replication in the CNS is the oligodendrocyte. The mechanisms by which JCV initiates and establishes infection of these glial cells are not understood. The initial interaction between JCV and glial cells involves virus binding to N-linked glycoproteins containing terminal α(2 - 6) -linked sialic acids.

We analyzed the localization and GDP/GTP cycle of GFP-tagged ARF 6 by {{total internal reflection}} fluorescent microscopy. We found that ARF 6 -GFP associates with clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at the plasma membrane in a GTP-dependent manner in a mechanism requiring the adaptor protein complex AP- 2. In CCP, GTP-ARF 6 mediates the recruitment of the ARF-binding domain of downstream effectors including JNK-interacting proteins 3 and 4 (JIP 3 and JIP 4) after the burst recruitment of the clathrin uncoating component auxilin. ARF 6 does not contribute to <b>receptor-mediated</b> clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis.</b> In contrast, we found that interaction of ARF 6 and JIPs on endocytic vesicles is required for trafficking of the transferrin receptor in the fast, microtubule-dependent endocytic recycling pathway.

25|$|The {{cholera toxin}} (CTX or CT) is an {{oligomeric}} complex {{made up of}} six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides {{on the surface of}} the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis.</b> Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTXφ.|$|E

While IL- 17 A is critically {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of psoriasis, the contribution of IL- 17 E remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that IL- 17 E+ cells are more abundant than IL- 17 A+ cells in lesional psoriatic skin. IL- 17 E synthesis is increased in keratinocytes within psoriatic plaques, and macrophages having a mixed M 1 /M 2 phenotype represent an important proportion of the IL- 17 E+ cells infiltrating the dermis. Mechanistically, macrophages do not synthetize but rather uptake IL- 17 E via <b>receptor-mediated</b> clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis.</b> Furthermore, monocyte-derived macrophages in-vitro polarized in M 2, but not M 1, express the IL- 17 E receptor and respond to IL- 17 E by preferentially producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in neutrophils recruitment. Remarkably, IL- 17 E expression in lesional psoriatic skin correlates {{with the number of}} neutrophils while being inversely proportional to the number of infiltrating T cells. These data provide strong evidence for a pro-inflammatory role of keratinocyte-derived IL- 17 E in psoriasis, possibly via macrophage activation...|$|R

The heterogeneous USH proteins are organized into protein networks. Here, we identified Magi 2 (membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted- 2) as a new component of the USH protein interactome, binding to the multifunctional scaffold protein SANS (USH 1 G). We showed that the SANS-Magi 2 complex assembly is regulated by the phosphorylation of an internal PDZ-binding motif in the sterile alpha motif domain of SANS by the protein kinase CK 2. We affirmed Magi 2 's role in <b>receptor-mediated,</b> clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis</b> and showed that phosphorylated SANS tightly regulates Magi 2 -mediated endocytosis. Specific depletions by RNAi revealed that SANS and Magi 2 -mediated endocytosis regulates aspects of ciliogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the localization of the SANS-Magi 2 complex in the periciliary membrane complex facing the ciliary pocket of retinal photoreceptor cells in situ. Our data suggest that endocytotic processes may not only contribute to photoreceptor cell homeostasis but also counterbalance the periciliary membrane delivery accompanying the exocytosis processes for the cargo vesicle delivery. In USH 1 G patients, mutations in SANS eliminate Magi 2 binding and thereby deregulate endocytosis, lead to defective ciliary transport modules and ultimately disrupt photoreceptor cell function inducing retinal degeneration...|$|R

[...] The low pH within the endosome then triggers BTV's membrane penetration protein VP5 to undergo a conformational change that disrupts the endosomal membrane. [...] Uncoating yields a transcriptionally active 470S core particle which is composed of two major proteins VP7 and VP3, and the three minor proteins VP1, VP4 and VP6 {{in addition to the}} dsRNA genome. There is no evidence that any trace of the outer capsid remains associated with these cores, as has been described for reovirus. The cores may be further uncoated to form 390S subcore particles that lack VP7, also in contrast to reovirus. Subviral particles are probably akin to cores derived in vitro from virions by physical or proteolytic treatments that remove the outer capsid and causes activation of the BTV transcriptase. In addition to the seven structural proteins, three non-structural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2, NS3 (and a related NS3A) are synthesised in BTV-infected cells. Of these, NS3/NS3A is involved in the egress of the progeny virus.

Coat complexes that have been well characterized so far include coat protein-I (COP-I), COP-II, and clathrin.

In endocytosis, the clathrin coat is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, forming pits that invaginate to pinch off (scission) and become free CCVs. In cultured cells, the assembly of a CCV takes ~ 1min, and several hundred to a thousand or more can form every minute. The main scaffold component of clathrin coat is the 190-kD protein called clathrin heavy chain (CHC), which is associated with a 25- kD protein called clathrin light chain (CLC), forming three-legged trimers called triskelions.|$|R
40|$|We used a GAD 65 -specific human B–T {{cell line}} cognate system in vitro to {{investigate}} the modulation of GAD 65 presentation by autoantibody, assessed in a proliferation assay. Generally, if the T cell determinant overlaps or resides within the antibody epitope, effects of presentation are blunted while if they are distant can lead to potent presentation. For three different autoreactive B–T cell line cognate pairs, the modulation of GAD 65 presentation followed the mode of overlapping or distant epitopes with resultant potent or undetectable presentation. However, other cognate pairs elicited variability in this pattern of presentation. Notably, one B cell line, DPC, whose antibody epitope did not overlap with the T cell determinants, was consistently poor in presenting GAD 65. Using the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated to GAD 65 to study <b>receptor-mediated</b> antigen <b>endocytosis</b> showed that all the antigen-specific B cell clones were efficient in intracellular accumulation of the antigen. Additionally, multicolour immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the internalized GAD 65 /surface IgG complexes were rapidly targeted to a perinuclear compartment in all GAD-specific B cell clones. This analysis also demonstrated that HLA-DM expression was reduced strongly in DPC compared to the stimulatory B cell clones. Thus the capability of antigen-specific B cells to capture and present antigen to human T cell lines {{is dependent on the}} spatial relationship of B and T cell epitopes as well other factors which contribute to the efficiency of presentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of neurotensin receptors was studied in vitro in primary cultures of neuronal cells. High affinity receptors for [3 H]neurotensin {{were found in}} homogenates and at the cell surface of intact neurons cultured from the brain of rat embryos. When intact cells were incubated with 3 nM neurotensin (1 - 13), a rapid decrease in [3 H]neurotensin binding was observed; about 60 % of neurotensin receptors disappeared from the cell surface in less than 15 min. This corresponded to a reduction of the Bmax value without {{a change in the}} binding affinity. The decrease in neurotensin receptor number was also induced by the active fragment (8 - 13) of neurotensin but not by its inactive fragment (1 - 8). It was partially inhibited by bacitracin, at concentrations which are known to interact with receptor internalization, and was not detected when intact cells were incubated at 0 - 4 degrees with the unlabeled peptide. When intact neurons were incubated with [3 H]neurotensin, there was a rapid ligand uptake and the kinetics of endocytosis were {{similar to those of the}} cell surface receptor disappearance. Once endocytosed, [3 H]neurotensin could not be released (or displaced) from either intact neurons or homogenates, suggesting the sequestration of the labeled peptide in vesicles or other subcellular structures. Therefore, the present results suggest that the rapid agonist-induced decrease in the number of neurotensin receptors from the cell surface corresponds to an internalization process which involves a simultaneous <b>receptor-mediated</b> peptide <b>endocytosis...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Plant viruses {{need to be}} {{transmitted}} by a vector, most often insects such as leafhoppers. One class of viruses, the Rhabdoviridae, has been proposed to actually be insect viruses that have evolved to replicate in plants. The chosen insect vector of a plant virus will often be the determining factor in that virus's host range: it can only infect plants that the insect vector feeds upon. This was shown in part when the old world white fly {{made it to the}} United States, where it transferred many plant viruses into new hosts. Depending on the way they are transmitted, plant viruses are classified as non-persistent, semi-persistent and persistent. In non-persistent transmission, viruses become attached to the distal tip of the stylet of the insect and on the next plant it feeds on, it inoculates it with the virus. Semi-persistent viral transmission involves the virus entering the foregut of the insect. Those viruses that manage to pass through the gut into the haemolymph and then to the salivary glands are known as persistent. There are two sub-classes of persistent viruses: propagative and circulative. Propagative viruses are able to replicate in both the plant and the insect (and may have originally been insect viruses), whereas circulative can not. Circulative viruses are protected inside aphids by the chaperone protein symbionin, produced by bacterial symbionts. [...] Many plant viruses encode within their genome polypeptides with domains essential for transmission by insects. In non-persistent and semi-persistent viruses, these domains are in the coat protein and another protein known as the helper component. A bridging hypothesis has been proposed to explain how these proteins aid in insect-mediated viral transmission. The helper component will bind to the specific domain of the coat protein, and then the insect mouthparts — creating a bridge. In persistent propagative viruses, such as tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), there is often a lipid coat surrounding the proteins that is not seen in other classes of plant viruses. In the case of TSWV, 2 viral proteins are expressed in this lipid envelope. It has been proposed that the viruses bind via these proteins and are then taken into the insect cell by <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mammalian Orthoreovirus virions are non-enveloped with {{icosahedral}} symmetry {{created by}} a double-layered capsid reaching about 80nm wide.

One hundred and twenty copies of the λ1 protein arranged in 12 decameric units make up the shell of the inner capsid structure. This shell is stabilized by {{one hundred and fifty}} copies of the σ2 protein that 'clamp' [...] adjacent λ1 monomers together. At the 12 five-fold axes of symmetry, pentamers of the λ2 protein form turret-like structures that protrudes {{from the surface of the}} shell. In the center of the λ2 turret a channel allows viral mRNAs to be extruded during transcription. The channel is 70Å at its base and 15Å at its narrowest point. [...] The core also contains within it twelve copies of λ3, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. One λ3 protein is found slightly offset from each of the twelve pentameric λ2 turrets. Closely associated with λ3 are one or two copies of μ2, a transcriptase cofactor. μ2 has been found to have some enzymatic functions, such as NTPase activity. The λ3 protein is responsible for transcription of the double-stranded RNA genome segments. Each transcript is threaded through the λ2 pentameric turret as it is being extruded. Guanylyltransferase enzmatic activity in the λ2 turret adds a 5' guanosine cap to the extruded mRNA. In addition, two methyltransferase domains found in the λ2 structure act to methylate the 7N position of the added guanosine and the 2' O of the first templated nucleotide, which in all cases is also a guanosine. The outer capsid (T=13) is composed of μ1 and σ3 proteins with λ2, in compound with σ1, interspersed around the capsid. It has been proposed that λ2 is involved in replication due to its placement at the fivefold axes and its ability to interact with λ3 in solution. σ1, a filamentous trimer extruding from the outer capsid, [...] is responsible for cell attachment by interacting with sialic acid and other entry receptors. μ1 and σ3 are both involved in the attachment and thus entry of the virus via <b>receptor-mediated</b> <b>endocytosis</b> involving the formation of clathrin-coated pits.|$|E

The distinct expression of megalin and cubilin in the proximal tubule cells of lysozyme-injected frogs was revealed whereas kidney tissue of control animals showed no positive immunoreactivity. Lysozyme was detected in the apical endocytic compartment of the tubular cells and colocalized with clathrin 10 min after injection. After 20 min, lysozyme was located in the subapical compartment negative to clathrin (endosomes), and intracellular trafficking of lysozyme was coincided with the distribution of megalin and cubilin. However, internalized protein was retained in the endosomes and did not reach lysosomes within 30 min after treatment that may indicate the inhibition of intracellular trafficking in hibernating frogs. For the first time, we provided the evidence that lysozyme is filtered through the glomeruli and absorbed by <b>receptor-mediated</b> clathrin-dependent <b>endocytosis</b> in the frog proximal tubule cells.

Here, we show that the Sec 1 /Munc 18 gene vps- 45 is essential for not only viability and development but also <b>receptor-mediated</b> and fluid-phase <b>endocytosis</b> pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that VPS- 45 interacts with a Rab 5 effector, Rabenosyn- 5 (RABS- 5), and the mutants of both vps- 45 and rabs- 5 show similar endocytic phenotypes. In the macrophage-like cells of vps- 45 and rabs- 5 mutants, aberrantly small endosomes were accumulated, and the endosome fusion stimulated by the mutant RAB- 5 (Q 78 L) is suppressed by these mutations. Our results indicate that VPS- 45 is a key molecule that functions downstream from RAB- 5, cooperating with RABS- 5, to regulate {{the dynamics of the}} endocytic system in multicellular organisms...|$|R
40|$|Internalization of {{activated}} signaling receptors by endocytosis {{is one way}} cells downregulate extracellular signals. Like many signaling receptors, {{the yeast}} �-factor pheromone receptor is downregulated by hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent internalization and degradation in the lysosome-like vacuole. In a screen to detect proteins involved in ubiquitin-dependent receptor internalization, we identified the sphingoid base–regulated serine–threonine kinase Ypk 1. Ypk 1 is a homologue of the mammalian serum – and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, SGK, which can substitute for Ypk 1 function in yeast. The kinase activity of Ypk 1 is required for receptor endocytosis because mutations in two residues important for its catalytic activity cause a severe defect in �-factor internalization. Ypk 1 is required for both <b>receptor-mediated</b> and fluid-phase <b>endocytosis,</b> and is not necessary for receptor phosphorylation or ubiquitination. Ypk 1 itself is phosphorylated by Pkh kinases, homologues of mammalian PDK 1. The threonine in Ypk 1 that is phosphorylated by Pkh 1 is required for efficient endocytosis, and pkh mutant cells are defective in �-factor internalization and fluid-phase endocytosis. These observations demonstrate that Ypk 1 acts downstream of the Pkh kinases to control endocytosis by phosphorylating components of the endocytic machinery...|$|R
