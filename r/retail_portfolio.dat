Stress testing is carried out by applying exogenous stress scenarios for development of these indicators. The model implies that sensitivity of probability of default to the stress is mainly driven by Installment to Income Ratio and for mortgages also by loan maturity.

We assemble a mini-portfolio of revolving exposures and we compare the capital charges generated by the latest Basel’s formula with the capital charges generated by two possible earnings-at-risk internal capital allocation models. We find that in general, Basel’s capital ratios are closer to those generated by our models for the groups with lower credit risk. We attribute the discrepancies to the different ways Basel and our models account for future margin income, to Basel assumptions about asset correlations, and to one our models taking macroeconomic conditions explicitly into account...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{using three}} {{commercial}} banks’ <b>retail</b> mortgage loan <b>portfolios</b> (consisting of approximately 200, 000 clients with housing and home equity loans), we analyse the risk {{characteristics of the}} portfolio, identify customer-specific and product-specific factors, and market and macroeconomic factors that influence portfolio quality, and finally calculate the loan loss on the <b>retail</b> mortgage <b>portfolio</b> of the banking sector in an extreme macro-risk scenario (10 per cent decline in GDP; exchange rate of EUR/HUF 340).

40|$|AbstractThe Internal Ratings Based (IRB) {{approach}} {{introduced in}} the Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to estimate not just the probability of default, but also the Loss Given Default (LGD), i. e., {{the proportion of the}} outstanding loan that will be lost {{in the event of a}} default. However, modelling LGD poses substantial challenges. One of the key problems in building regression models for estimating the loan-level LGD in <b>retail</b> <b>portfolios</b> such as mortgage loans relates to the difficulty of modelling their distributions, as they typically contain extensive numbers of zeroes. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed where a mixed discrete-continuous model for the total loss amount incurred on a defaulted loan is developed. The model accommodates the probability of a zero loss and the loss amount given that a loss occurs simultaneously. The approach is applied to a large dataset of defaulted home mortgages from a UK bank and compared to two well-known industry approaches. Our zero-adjusted gamma model is shown to present an alternative and competitive approach to LGD modelling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Monte Carlo {{simulation}} is {{a common}} method for studying the volatility of market traded instruments. It is less employed in retail lending, because of the inherent nonlinearities in consumer behavior. In this paper, we leverage the approach of Dual-time Dynamics to separate loan performance dynamics into three components: a maturation function of months-on-books, an exogenous function of calendar date, and a quality function of vintage origination date. Of these three, the exogenous function captures the impacts from the macroeconomic environment. As such, we might naturally want to generate scenarios for the possible futures of these environmental impacts. To generate such scenarios, we must go beyond the random walk methods most commonly applied {{in the analysis of}} market-traded instruments. <b>Retail</b> <b>portfolios</b> exhibit autocorrelation structure and variance growth with time that requires more complex modeling than a random walk. This paper describes work using ARMA and ARIMA models for scenario generation, rules for selecting the correct model given the input data, and validation methods on the scenario generation. We find when the goal is capturing the future volatility via Monte Carlo scenario generation, that model selection does not follow the same rules as for forecasting. Instead, test more appropriate to reproducing volatility are proposed, which assure that distributions of scenarios have the proper statistical characteristics. These results are supported by studies of the variance growth properties of macroeconomic variables and theoretical calculations of the variance growth properties of various models. We also provide studies on historical data showing minimum training lengths and differences by macroeconomic epochs. Key words.
