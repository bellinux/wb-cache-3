6000|$|But he <b>read</b> <b>on.</b> <b>For</b> {{after all}} Plato {{continues}} imperturbably. And Hamlet utters his soliloquy. And there the Elgin Marbles lie, all night long, old Jones's lantern sometimes recalling Ulysses, or a horse's head; or sometimes {{a flash of}} gold, or a mummy's sunk yellow cheek. Plato and Shakespeare continue; and Jacob, who was reading the Phaedrus, heard people vociferating round the lamp-post, and the woman battering {{at the door and}} crying, [...] "Let me in!" [...] as if a coal had dropped from the fire, or a fly, falling from the ceiling, had lain on its back, too weak to turn over.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this place}} Mat once more {{suspended}} the perusal of the letter. He had now <b>read</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> an unusually long time with unflagging attention, {{and with the}} same stern sadness always in his face, except when the name of Arthur Carr occurred {{in the course of}} the narrative. Almost on every occasion, when the finger by which he guided himself along the close lines of the letter, came to those words, it trembled a little, and the dangerous look grew ever brighter and brighter in his eyes. It was in them now, as he dropped the letter on his knee, and, turning round, took from the wall behind him, against which it leaned, a certain leather bag, already alluded to, as part of the personal property that he brought with him on installing himself in Kirk Street. He opened it, took out a feather fan, and an Indian tobacco-pouch of scarlet cloth; and then began to search in the bottom of the bag, from which, at length, he drew forth a letter. It was torn in several places, the ink of the writing in it was faded, and the paper was disfigured by stains of grease, tobacco, and dirt generally. The direction was in such a condition, that the word [...] "Brazils," [...] at the end, was alone legible. Inside, it was not in a much better state. The date at the top, however, still remained tolerably easy to distinguish: it was [...] "December 20th, 1827." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was in {{love with}} Meenie: he knew that clearly now. And this love was after all not such a wicked and terrible feeling; on the contrary, he felt all the better and the purer for it already. But then that might merely be the horrible seductiveness of the thing. Was it not always typified by the cup of Circe, by the song of the Sirens, by all that was {{alluring}} and beautiful and hollow? He paced up and down for half an hour, and then (he had sported his oak long ago) he lit his little reading lamp and sat down in the big chair by the bay window. Running his eyes over his bookshelf, he took out, half by chance, Spencer's [...] "Sociology." [...] Then, from sheer weariness, he <b>read</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a while, hardly heeding what he read. At last he got interested, and finished a chapter. When he had finished it, he put the book down, and felt that the struggle was over. Strange that {{side by side in the}} same world, in the same London, there should exist two such utterly different types of man as Herbert Spencer and the Gideonite Apostle. The last seemed to belong to the sixteenth century, the first to some new and hitherto uncreated social world. In an age which produced thinkers like that, how could he ever have mistaken the poor, bigoted, narrow, half-instructed Apostle for a divinely inspired teacher! So far as Paul Owen was concerned, the Gideonite Church and all that belonged to it had melted utterly into thin air.|$|E

Now that the month of October has arrived, you’re {{probably}} spinning your wheels trying to decide whether to attend that upcoming Hal-loween party as a pirate, Elvis, or an I-O psychologist from New Zealand.

The summer {{vacation}} season has officially arrived and whether you’re heading for the mountains or traveling to the coast, chances are you’re won-dering how to fill those long hours on the road. Tired of license plate bingo? Has the Handbook of I-O Psychology on tape suddenly lost its luster? Are you desperately searching for a way to avoid singing “Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall ” with your family for the umpteenth time? If you answered “yes” to the preceding questions, this column is for you! The following pages pro-vide {{everything you need to know}} to engage your travel companions in a live-ly discussion about the evolution of I-O psychology in Romania. In fact, you won’t want to miss this thought-provoking glimpse of Romanian I-O, regardless of whether you find yourself in search of highway conversation. The following article describes the state of I-O psychology in a country that has undergone a great deal of change in the past 18 years. The challenges our Romanian colleagues have encountered along the way are described and discussed. Many of these challenges involve things we have the luxury of taking for granted, that is, obstacles that U. S.

40|$|Ed Miliband {{tells us}} {{he wants to}} reward good {{families}} and firms. Where there are details, they raise as many questions as answers. Allocating housing {{on the basis of}} criteria other than needs throws up big questions. It's not clear to me why we want people to do apprenticeships in firms that have government contracts, etc. Stepping back from the details, Ed Milliband says that what they will do is change the regulatory and tax framework to carefully reward good firms. Fine in principle, but in practice I worry that this sort of thing vastly overestimates the ability of government to intervene in a way that actually achieves it's objectives. Two analogies spring to mind - one concerns the role of the Basel regulations on capital requirements that sought to ensure good behaviour but ended up encouraging banks to hold mortgage backed assets (and derivatives of those assets). The second is a little more in line with my expertise and concerns what policy might do to 'reward innovative firms located in clusters'. For those of you that want the headline message - {{it turns out to be}} incredibly difficult to know what we should do (if anything) to reward innovative clusters of firms.
