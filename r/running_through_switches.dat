50|$|In a trailing-point {{movement}} (<b>running</b> <b>through</b> the <b>switch</b> in {{the wrong}} direction while they are set to turn off the track), the flanges on the wheels will force the points to the proper position. This is sometimes known as <b>running</b> <b>through</b> the <b>switch.</b> Some switches are designed to be forced to the proper position without damage. Examples include variable switches, spring switches, and weighted switches.|$|R
50|$|ABS system {{electronics}} {{are also}} able to detect breaks in the rail or improperly lined track switches (if the switch is established in the circuit), which result in an open circuit. These will also change the signal indication, preventing any trains from entering the block (if the signal system prevents it), and risking <b>running</b> <b>through</b> a <b>switch,</b> or a derailment.|$|R
40|$|In modern railway {{industry}} the simulation of the behaviour of railway vehicles {{has become an}} important design method during the last years. Modern simulation packages offer modelling elements that are highly adapted for standard and unusual simulation scenarios. A specific application case is the simulation of a railway vehicle travelling <b>through</b> a <b>switch.</b> It makes high demands on the simulation software due to the inconvenient modelling elements needed: the changing rail profiles on the blade rail and in the crossing vee area {{as well as the}} guard rail with its additional contact {{at the back of the}} wheel. The article gives an overview over the state of the art in railway vehicle simulation and presents a simulation of a passenger car <b>running</b> <b>through</b> a <b>switch</b> as an application example...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of advanced railway vehicles requires an efficient modelling and simulation of wheel [...] rail systems under complex conditions and maneuvers. For that reason, the multibody system simulation software SIMPACK was enhanced recently with a generally applicable wheel [...] rail contact module to be outlined in this paper. This module comprises {{the possibility of}} applying a constrained or an elastic contact model, single or multiple contact locations per wheel [...] rail element, analytic or measured track geometries including irregularities and rail profiles, varying in longitudinal direction (switches). A simulation study of a passenger car <b>running</b> <b>through</b> a <b>switch</b> demonstrates {{the efficiency of the}} constrained wheel [...] rail contact model extended for the simulation of multiple contacts. As a second example a freight train is investigated and its simulation results are compared to measurements in order to validate the simulation tool as well as the model. 1 INTRODUCTION The development [...] ...|$|R
40|$|During {{recent years}} the {{computational}} simulation of a railway vehicles running behaviour has grown {{to a kind of}} standard design task in railways industry. Well qualified for this kind of computational process are software tools for the simulation of general mechanics and mechatronics systems basing on a multibody system approach. Bur for their effective application on arbitrary wheel-rail systems a couple of specific modelling features have to be available additionally, of which an efficient modelling of a steel wheel being in contact with a steel rail is the most important one. The paper gives a short insight into the modelling of railways vehicles with the focus concentrating on a generally applicable wheel-rail contact module. The basic principles of this module are a so-called quasi-elastic contact model together with a description of the wheel-rail interface as a kinematic constraint. As specific application case, the demanding simulation of a railway vehicle <b>running</b> <b>through</b> a <b>switch</b> is presented...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} reliability, Cadillac issued thirteen updated PROM chips for the ECMs, {{but many of these}} engines simply had their Modulated Displacement function disabled by dealers, leaving them with permanent eight-cylinder operation. This was accomplished by merely disconnecting a single wire from the transmission's [...] "3rd-gear switch", or <b>running</b> it <b>through</b> a <b>switch</b> inside the car for manual override. The 368 was dropped from most Cadillac passenger cars after the 1981 model year, although the V8-6-4 remained the standard engine for Fleetwood Limousines and the carbureted 368 remained in the Commercial Chassis through 1984.|$|R

Although Movietone was a dedicated sound-on-film system, in 1929-30 Fox produced some soundtracks on disc to accompany features shown in theaters not yet equipped for optical sound.
