With the tire manufacturer's acquisition of the RKO film studio in 1955, its media businesses were brought together under the <b>rubric</b> of RKO Teleradio Pictures.

To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the <b>rubric</b> of the Dwifungsi ("Dual Function") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors {{and more than half}} of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorized Operasi Trisula which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organize a guerilla base in Blitar area in 1968, and ordered several military operations which ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in West Kalimantan (1967–1972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of Free Aceh Movement separatists under Hasan di Tiro in 1977 led to dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad. Notably, in March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight by Islamic extremists at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 47 - 50). Several {{researchers in}} the world of English Language Teaching have been engaged in examining the process of assessing students’ writing using <b>rubrics.</b> Literature indicates that there is a debate among educators concerning the effectiveness of using <b>rubrics</b> on the teaching-learning process. While some consider <b>rubrics</b> as assessment tools that standardize students’ writing and hinder the students’ creative self-expression of ideas, others argue that <b>rubrics</b> enhance the students’ learning and they positively affect the teacher’s performance. This research study examines the teachers’ and students’ viewpoints regarding the effectiveness of using <b>rubrics</b> in a third grade writing classroom in a private school in Lebanon. It also aims to examine the participants’ attitudes toward using <b>rubrics</b> in the writing classroom. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained. An in-depth interview with an English Language teacher highlighted the perceived advantages and challenges of using <b>rubrics.</b> A questionnaire addressed to the students portrayed their preference to use <b>rubrics</b> in the writing classroom. A classroom observation conducted by the researcher portrayed the impact of <b>rubrics</b> on the teacher’s and students’ classroom practices. Findings showed that teachers and students are in favor of using <b>rubrics</b> due to the positive impact that they have on the teaching-learning process. The pedagogical implications of the study’s findings were also discussed. 1 bound copy: ix, 61 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

5|$|The {{addition}} of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another {{restructuring of the}} major leagues, this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of home runs in particular—had surged that year, {{and again in the}} abbreviated 1994 season. After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single-season home run record, and two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the <b>rubric</b> of Major League Baseball (MLB).|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1550, Knox was {{appointed}} a preacher of St Nicholas' Church in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year he {{was appointed}} {{one of the six}} royal chaplains serving the King. On 16 October 1551, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the coup d'état in a sermon on All Saints Day. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the fire-brand preacher, but he saw Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the second edition of the Book of Common Prayer. The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during communion. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The end result was a compromise in which the famous Black <b>Rubric,</b> which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black <b>Rubric,</b> which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E
30|$|<b>Rubrics</b> {{were not}} used by the {{students}} in planning for their oral production assessments especially in their debates.

30|$|There is also {{a dearth}} of studies {{on the impact of}} <b>rubrics</b> in {{improving}} students’ oral performances.

These results are aligned with previous research findings (Brookhart, 2003; Zimmerman & Schunk, 2001; Moskal, 2003) asserting the role of <b>rubrics</b> in communicating learning goals and in aiding in the learning process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the views of primary school {{teachers}} with negative and positive attitudes towards <b>rubrics</b> comparatively in terms of various variables. 292 teachers from 17 primary schools in Ankara province of Turkey participated into the study.
