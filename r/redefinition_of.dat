5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the genus.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> the {{connection}} between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a <b>redefinition</b> <b>of</b> Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E
