5|$|According to Packer, {{another common}} theme in Gordimer's novels is the choices {{ordinary}} {{people who live}} in oppressive <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> forced to make. Literary critics Turgeon and Carli Coetzee explain that when she realises that whites are not always welcome in the anti-apartheid liberation movements, Rosa repudiates her father's struggle and leaves the country. Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. But, according to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E

The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State.

Although there is very little published information that describes how Aboriginal people utilised fire in this region historically, these fire <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> believed to have changed significantly in the last century. Recent evidence that utilises natural clues for past fire regimes (for example, the distribution and age of long-lived, fire-sensitive plants such as Calitris Pine) suggest that woodland habitats were disturbed by fire on average every 400 years, whereas shrubland habitats burnt as frequently as every 60 years.|$|E

25|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause {{temporary}} {{regression of}} fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because {{of the limitations}} and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink {{the size of the}} fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens.|$|E
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a reinforced plastic skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E

His polemics, articulated over five decades, on India's development as a nuclear nation, with civilian and weapons capabilities, have proven both influential and contentious with supporters and detractors alike—of nuclear development and nuclear disarmament. His strong views and trenchant criticism of the inherent inequalities of the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty <b>regimes</b> <b>are</b> widely known and referenced, {{as well as being}} heavily commented on. He often used the term 'nuclear apartheid' to decry this situation and routinely lambasted the five established nuclear states for forcing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on everyone else while refusing all proposals for nuclear disarmament, including one proposed by India in 1986.
