In 2005, three laboratories showed that ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G (EF-G) cause dissociation of <b>ribosomes</b> into <b>subunits,</b> solving the long-standing problem of how this essential step of translation occurs. However, there remains ongoing controversy regarding the other actions of RRF and EF-G during ribosome recycling.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{nucleolus}} is a subnuclear organelle {{in which}} rRNAs are transcribed, processed, and assembled with ribosomal proteins into <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits.</b> Mass spectrometry combined with pulsed incorporation of stable isotopes of arginine and lysine {{was used to}} perform a quantitative and unbiased global analysis of the rates at which newly synthesized, endogenous proteins appear within mammalian nucleoli. ResultsNewly synthesized ribosomal proteins accumulated in nucleoli more quickly than other nucleolar components. Studies involving time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of stable HeLa cell lines expressing fluorescent-protein-tagged nucleolar factors also showed that ribosomal proteins accumulate more quickly than other components. Photobleaching and mass-spectrometry experiments suggest that only a subset of newly synthesized ribosomal proteins are assembled into ribosomes and exported to the cytoplasm. Inhibition of the proteasome caused an accumulation of ribosomal proteins in the nucleus {{but not in the}} cytoplasm. Inhibition of rRNA transcription prior to proteasomal inhibition further increased the accumulation of ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm. ConclusionsRibosomal proteins are expressed at high levels beyond that required for the typical rate of ribosome-subunit production and accumulate in the nucleolus more quickly than all other nucleolar components. This is balanced by continual degradation of unassembled ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm, thereby providing a mechanism for mammalian cells to ensure that ribosomal protein levels are never rate limiting for the efficient assembly of <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits.</b> The dual time-lapse strategy used in this study, combining proteomics and imaging, provides a powerful approach for the quantitative analysis of the flux of newly synthesized proteins through a cell organelle...|$|R

This report describes the effect of homopolyribonucleotides on mRNA-protein complexes separated from <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits</b> by oligo(dT) -cellulose chromatography. It is shown that poly (U) and poly (A) can release mRNA-protein complexes adsorbed to oligo(dT) -cellulose, whereas poly (C) and poly(I) are much less effective in this process. Analysis of polyribonucleotide released material showed that poly(U) effectively dissociated the mRNA-protein complexes while poly(A) caused no or only partial derangement of these particles.

50|$|Red clover {{necrotic}} mosaic virus (RCNMV) contains several {{structural elements}} present within the 3' and 5' untranslated regions (UTR) {{of the genome}} that enhance translation. In eukaryotes transcription {{is a prerequisite for}} translation. During transcription the pre-mRNA transcript is processes where a 5' cap is attached onto mRNA and this 5' cap allows for ribosome assembly onto the mRNA as it acts as a binding site for the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F. Once eIF4F is bound to the mRNA this protein complex interacts with the poly(A) binding protein which is present within the 3' UTR and results in mRNA circularization. This multiprotein-mRNA complex then recruits the ribosome subunits and scans the mRNA until it reaches the start codon. Transcription of viral genomes differs from eukaryotes as viral genomes produce mRNA transcripts that lack a 5’ cap site. Despite lacking a cap site viral genes contain a structural element within the 5’ UTR known as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). IRES is a structural element that recruits the 40s <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunit</b> to the mRNA within close proximity of the start codon.|$|E
50|$|Because ribosomes are so complex, {{a certain}} number of ribosomes are {{assembled}} incorrectly and could potentially waste cellular energy and resources when synthesizing non-functional proteins. To prevent this, cells have an active surveillance system to recognize damaged or defective ribosomes and target them for degradation. The surveillance mechanism is in place to detect nonfunctional pre-ribosomes as well as nonfunctional mature ribosomes. In addition, the surveillance system brings the necessary degradation equipment and actually degrades the nonfunctional ribosomes. Pre-ribosomes that build up in the nucleus are destroyed by the exosome, which is a multisubunit complex with exonuclease activity. If perhaps defective ribosomal subunits do make it to the cytoplasm, there is an additional surveillance system in place to target their degradation in the cytoplasm. Certain mutations in residues of the large <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunit</b> will actually result in RNA decay and thus degradation of the unit. Because the amount of defects that are possible in ribosome assembly are so extensive, it is still unknown as to how the surveillance system detects all defects, but it has been postulated that instead of targeting specific defects, the surveillance system recognizes the consequences of those defects - such as assembly delays. Meaning, if there is a disruption in the assembly or maturation of a mature ribosome, the surveillance system will act as if the subunit is defective.|$|E

40|$|The {{ribosome}} is a two-subunit molecular machine, {{sporting a}} working cycle that involves coordinated {{movements of the}} subunits.

We set out to determine which intersubunit contacts are functionally indispensable for the association of <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits</b> by using a modification interference approach. Modification of the N- 1 position of A 715, A 1912, or A 1918 in Escherichia coli 50 S subunits is strongly detrimental to 70 S ribosome formation.

40|$|Ribosomes {{are known}} to be {{degraded}} under conditions of nutrient limitation. However, the mechanism by which a normally stable ribosome becomes a substrate for the degradation machinery has remained elusive. Here, we present in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that free <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits</b> are the actual targets of the degradative enzymes, whereas 70 S particles are protected from such degradation. Conditions that increase the formation of subunits both in vitro and in vivo lead to enhanced degradation, while conditions favoring the presence of intact 70 S ribosomes prevent or reduce breakdown. Thus, the simple formation of free 50 S and 30 S subunits is sufficient to serve as the initiation mechanism that allows endoribonuclease cleavage and subsequent ribosome breakdown...|$|R

40|$|Almost {{immediately}} after infection of Escherichia coli cells with [^(32) P]MS 2, parental RNA appears in cell lysates {{associated with the}} 30 s <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunit</b> and with polysomes; a small amount is found as unbound, free RNA. At early times after infection (zero to four minutes) no parental RNA {{is associated with the}} 70 s monosomes or with the 50 s ribosome subunits.

40|$|Overproduction of rRNA was artificially induced in Escherichia coli {{cells to}} test whether the {{synthesis}} of ribosomal protein (r-protein) is normally repressed by feedback regulation. When rRNA was overproduced more than twofold from a hybrid plasmid carrying the rrnB operon fused to the lambda pL promoter (pL-rrnB), synthesis of individual r-proteins increased {{by an average of}} about 60 %. This demonstrates that the synthesis of r-proteins is repressed under normal conditions. The increase of r-protein production, however, for unknown reasons, was not as great as the increase in rRNA synthesis and resulted in an imbalance between the amounts of rRNA and r-protein synthesis. Therefore, only a small (less than 20 %) increase in the synthesis of complete 30 S and 50 S <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits</b> was detected, and a considerable fraction of the excess rRNA was degraded. Lack of complete cooperativity in the assembly of <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunits</b> in vivo is discussed as a possible explanation for the absence of a large stimulation of ribosome synthesis observed under these conditions. In addition to the induction of intact rRNA overproduction from the pL-rrnB operon, the effects of unbalanced overproduction of each of the two large rRNAs, 16 S rRNA and 23 S rRNA, on r-protein synthesis were examined using pL-rrnB derivatives carrying a large deletion in either the 23 S rRNA gene or the 16 S rRNA gene. Operon-specific derepression after 23 S or 16 S rRNA overproduction correlated with the overproduction of rRNA containing the target site for the operon-specific repressor r-protein. These results are discussed to explain the apparent coupling of the assembly of one ribosomal subunit with that of the other which was observed in earlier studies on conditionally lethal mutants with defects in ribosome assembly...|$|R

40|$|The rising {{demand for}} {{powerful}} oncolytic virotherapy agents {{has led to}} the identification of Maraba virus, one of the most potent oncolytic viruses from Rhabdoviridae family which displays high selectivity for killing malignant cells and low cytotoxicity in normal cells. Although the virus is readied to be used for clinical trials, the interactions between the virus and the host cells is still unclear. Using a newly developed interferon-sensitive mutant Maraba virus (MG 1), we have identified two key regulators of global translation (4 E-BP 1 and eIF 2 α) responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis in the infected cells. Despite the translational arrest upon viral stress, we showed an up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein that provides a survival benefit for the host cell, yet facilitates effective viral propagation. Given the fact that eIF 5 B canonically regulates 60 S <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunit</b> end joining, and is able to replace the role of eIF 2 in delivering initiator tRNA to the 40 S <b>ribosome</b> <b>subunit</b> upon the phosphorylation of eIF 2 α, we have tested whether eIF 5 B mediates the translation of target mRNAs during MG 1 infection.
