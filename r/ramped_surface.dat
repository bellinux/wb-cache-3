50|$|An {{electric}} {{strike is}} an access control device used for doors. It replaces the fixed strike faceplate often {{used with a}} latchbar (also known as a keeper). Like a fixed strike, it normally presents a <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> to the locking latch allowing the door to close and latch just like a fixed strike would. However, an electric strike's <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> can, upon command, pivot {{out of the way}} when the lock on the door is in the locked position and the door is opened, allowing a user to open the door without operating the mechanical lock or using a mechanical key. After the door is opened past the keeper, the keeper returns to its standard position and re-locks when power is removed or applied, depending upon the strike's configuration.|$|E

It {{is assumed that}} the bounding plate has a ramped temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentration and isothermal temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentration. For finding the exact solution, we applied Laplace transform technique on the governing nondimensionalized equations. Analytic expression of Skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number is derived and represented through tabular form. The effects of Magnetic parameter M, second grade fluid α, Heat generation/absorption H, thermal radiation parameter R, chemical reaction Kr and thermo-diffusion Sr on velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are discussed through several figures. We found that velocity, temperature and concentration profiles in case of ramped temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentrations are less than those of isothermal temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentrations. It is also seen that Magnetic field M, second grade fluid α and chemical reaction Kr have retarding effects on velocity profile, whereas thermo-diffusion parameter Sr and thermal radiation parameter R have reverse effects on it...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{solution}} of thermal diffusion and heat generation effects on MHD Casson fluid flow past an oscillating vertical plate embedded through porous medium {{in the presence}} of thermal radiation and chemical reaction is obtained. Ramped wall temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentration, isothermal temperature with <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> concentration and isothermal temperature with constant surface concentration are taken into account. The governing non-dimensional equations are solved using Laplace transform technique and the solutions are presented in closed form. In order to get a perfect understanding of the physics of the problem we obtained numerical results using Matlab software and clarified with the help of graphical illustrations. With the help of velocity, temperature and concentration, Skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are obtained and represent through tabular form. Casson parameter is inversely proportional to the yield stress and it is observed that for the large value of Casson parameter, the fluid is close to the Newtonian fluid where the velocity is less than the non-Newtonian fluid.

40|$|Members of a {{hierarchy}} of integrable nonlinear evolution equations are applied problem in solidification and various problems in surface redistribution of crystalline materials. The members of the hierarchy {{are related to the}} well known linearizable diffusion equation which has the diffusivity form as the reciprocal of the square of concentration. We find that any linear combination of members of the hierarchy linearizable and the evolution equations formed represent a rotation of the diffusion potential modelled by the linear equation. The base member of the hierarchy is employed to obtain an analytic solution describing the temperature distribution and position of any number of phase boundaries as a material cools on an effectively semi-infinite base material. Each is initially homogeneous and at a uniform temperature. The solution method may incorporate any materials with temperature dependent thermal properties undergoing any number of phase changes. As an example, we incorporate transitions through five phases of iron with nonlinear heat conduction, as the iron cools copper base. We adapt various other members to derive a new integrable nonlinear equation which models the surface evolution of an arbitrarily oriented theoretical anisotropic material by the concomitant action of evaporation-condensation and surface diffusion. This theoretical anisotropic material behaves like a liquid crystal and the same constitutive relations as those of the constant coefficient linear equation used in the small slope approximation for isotropic materials. The integrable nonlinear equation may be used to advantage as test cases for numerical schemes. Its form has many attributes of the nonlinear governing equation for an isotropic material. Closed form solutions are constructed, where the theoretical anisotropic material may be arbitrarily oriented, for the evolution of a <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> by concomitant evaporation-condensation and surface diffusion, {{and the development of a}} single symmetric grain boundary groove by surface diffusion. The solution for the <b>ramped</b> <b>surface</b> showed, unlike the solution when the small slope approximation is assumed, that a vertical tangent may develop for the case where the initial inclination is large. In the development of a single symmetric grain boundary groove by surface diffusion, the theoretical anisotropic material has a well defined solution even the limiting case of a groove which has a root that is vertical and it is found case that the groove growth rate is finite. As an isotropic material is a special of a liquid crystal, then it is proposed that the groove growth rate for an isotropic material is finite also. Lastly, by a novel application of the new integrable nonlinear equation, we derive a solution for the development of a single symmetric grain boundary groove by surface diffusion for an isotropic material. A solution is achieved by partitioning the surface into subintervals delimited by lines of constant slope. Within subinterval, the advance of the surface is described by the new integrable evolution equation. The model is capable of incorporating the actual nonlinearity arbitrarily closely. The surface profile is determined for various values of the central groove slope including the limiting case of a groove which has a root that is vertical...|$|E

40|$|Background The bespoke {{interface}} between a lower limb residuum and a prosthetic socket {{is critical for}} an amputee’s comfort and overall rehabilitation outcomes. Analysis of interface kinematics and kinetics is important to gain full understanding of the interface biomechanics, which could aid clinical socket fit, rehabilitation and amputee care. This pilot study aims to investigate the dynamic correlation between kinematic movement and kinetic stresses at the interface during walking tests on different terrains. Methods One male, knee disarticulation amputee participated in the study. He was asked to walk on both a level surface and a 5 ° <b>ramped</b> <b>surface.</b> The movement between the residuum and the socket was evaluated by the angular and axial couplings, based on the outputs from a 3 D motion capture system. The corresponding kinetic stresses at anterior-proximal (AP), posterior-proximal (PP) and anterior-distal (AD) locations of the residuum were measured, using individual stress sensors. Findings Approximately 8 ° of angular coupling and up to 32 mm of axial coupling were measured when walking on different terrains. The direction of the angular coupling shows strong correlation with the pressure difference between the PP and AP sensors. Higher pressure was obtained at the PP location than the AP location during stance phase, associated with {{the direction of the}} angular coupling. A strong correlation between axial coupling length, L, and longitudinal shear was also evident at the PP and AD locations i. e. the shortening of L corresponds to the increase of shear in the proximal direction. Although different terrains did not affect these correlations in principle, interface kinematic and kinetic values suggested that gait changes can induce modifications to the interface biomechanics. Clinical relevance It is envisaged that the reported techniques could be potentially used to provide combined kinematics and kinetics for the understanding of biomechanics at the residuum/socket interface, which may {{play an important role in}} the clinical assessment of prosthetic component settings, including socket fit quality...|$|E

The flow contains several types of shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction for which large-eddy simulation has advantages over conventional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes approaches. Laminar-to-turbulent transition was triggered using localized blowing trips in the first external <b>ramp</b> <b>surface</b> close to the intake leading edge. The trips lead to turbulent spots that propagate within an otherwise laminar flow, with a lateral spreading angle consistent with previous studies. The transitional/turbulent shock interaction near the. first compression corner was found to enhance the transition to turbulence, leading to a fully turbulent boundary layer after the interaction. Further downstream, a large separation zone forms due to the cowl-lip shock wave impinging on the vehicle-side boundary layer. Perturbations from the vehicle-side turbulent boundary layer were found to enter the cowl-side boundary layer.

A canonical flatplate turbulent boundary layer at a momentum thickness Reynolds number 1100, and having a boundary layer thickness 	, is introduced four ramp lengths upstream of the onset of curvature.

CeO 2 is frequently used as a buffer layer, or template layer for biepitaxial grain boundary junctions, but can also be used as an insulating layer in ramp-type junctions and other multilayer structures. Epitaxial thin films of CeO 2 were deposited by pulsed laser ablation using SrTiO 3 substrates. We characterized the insulating performance of CeO 2 thin films in terms of breakdown field Ebd and the relative dielectric constant epsilon r.
