With the French ports captured or cut off, many German U-boats re-located to Norwegian port cities.|$|E

25|$|According to Chris Horwill (AREVA T) {{there are}} four main design ratings in the de-icer mode. The first one is the Standard de-icer mode. It works at 250MW and 7200A from ±17.4kV at 10°C. The second one is the Verification mode. It works at 200MW and 5760A from ±17.4kV at 30°C.The third one is the 1-hour overload. This one works at 300MW and 7200A from ±20.8kV at 10°C. The last one is the Low ambient overload. It works at 275MW and 7920A from ±17.4kV at -5°C. KV is the voltage and A is the currents. The <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of the current and voltage is large {{because all of the}} {{sections}} have different characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the installation, Fossum moved {{to the front of}} the Zarya module and freed a wire stuck in one latch door at a data grapple fixture. The fixture had been installed during STS-134, the previous shuttle mission. The grapple fixture serves as a base for Canadarm2, considerably extending its <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> on the Russian segment of the ISS. Garan also deployed a materials experiment (MISSE-8) that focuses on optical reflector materials, also installed during STS-134, on the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC-2) FRAM-3 site on the station's starboard truss. Back together again, Fossum and Garan moved on to the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-3) on the Tranquility node. They installed an insulating cover on the end of the adapter, an area exposed to considerable sunshine.|$|E

2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the controller output. This dramatically increased the linear <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{combination}} of these three primary hybrid advantages {{may be used in}} different vehicles to realize different fuel usage, power, emissions, weight and cost profiles. The ICE in an HEV can be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle, because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above average power demand rather than peak power demand. The drive system in a vehicle is required to operate over a range of speed and power, but an ICE's highest efficiency is in a narrow <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> making conventional vehicles inefficient. On the contrary, in most HEV designs, the ICE operates closer to its range of highest efficiency more frequently. The power curve of electric motors is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion engines. The greater fuel economy of HEVs has implication for reduced petroleum consumption and vehicle air pollution emissions worldwide ...|$|E
