40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>fills</b> {{that hit}} the seabed will remold the {{underlying}} material. If this material is a clay with sufficiently low shear strength, it will adopt rheological properties, causing flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill,</b> and contributing to the initial settlements of the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> in addition to conventional consolidation theory. The settlements of the rocks depend upon {{the height of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and how the rocks have been laid out. This is due to the viscosity of the clay, and the fact that clay is thixotropic. Thixotropy causes the viscosity to increase with decreased shear rate. The settlements finally come to a stop due to frictional forces from the surface area of the rocks. Clay is a non-newtonian Bingham fluid and will have a laminar flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill.</b> The Kozeny-Carman model is the most appropriate model for determining the permeability with laminar fluid flow through porous media.

60|$|So {{he stole}} into the valley, keeping himself {{carefully}} hidden in copse or hedgerow, and very soon met with an adventure; for, peeping through a screen of leaves, he saw before him a green lawn where stood a charming maiden, fresh as the spring, and beautiful to look upon. Around her upon the grass lay her young companions, {{as if they}} had thrown themselves down to rest after some merry game. Beyond them flowed a little brook, into which a waterfall leapt from a high <b>rock,</b> <b>filling</b> the air with its pleasant sound, and making a coolness even in the sultry noontide. The sight of the maiden so pleased the gnome that, for the first time, he wished himself a mortal; and, longing for a better view of the gay company, he changed himself into a raven and perched upon an oaktree which overhung the brook. But he soon found that this was not at all a good plan. He could only see with a raven's eyes, and feel as a raven feels; and a nest of field-mice {{at the foot of the}} tree interested him far more than the sport of the maidens. When he understood this he flew down again in a great hurry into the thicket, and took the form of a handsome young man--that was the best way--and he fell in love with the girl then and there. The fair maiden was the daughter of the king of the country, and she often wandered in the forest with her play fellows gathering the wild flowers and fruits, till the midday heat drove the merry band to the shady lawn by the brook to rest, or to bathe in the cool waters. On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood. This was Master Rubezahl's opportunity. Stepping out of his hiding-place he stood in the midst of the little lawn, weaving his magic spells, till slowly all about him changed, and when the maidens returned at noon to their favourite resting-place they stood lost in amazement, and almost fancied that they must be dreaming. The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed, flowed in silence now in its smooth channel, from which a clear fountain leapt, to fall again in showers of diamond drops, now on this side now on that, as the wandering breeze scattered it.|$|E

5000|$|Tsumeb {{is notable}} for the huge mineralized pipe {{that led to}} its foundation. The origin of the pipe has been hotly debated. The pipe penetrates more or less {{vertically}} through the Precambrian Otavi dolomite for at least 1300 m.

If the pipe is volcanic, as some have suggested, then the <b>rock</b> <b>filling</b> it (the [...] "pseudo-aplite") is peculiar in the extreme. The pipe was mined in prehistoric times but those ancient workers barely scratched the surface. Most of the ore was removed in the 20th century by cut-and-fill methods. The ore was polymetallic and from it copper, lead, silver, gold, arsenic and germanium were won. There was also {{a fair amount of}} zinc present but the recovery of this metal was always difficult for technical reasons. The pipe was famous for its richness. Many millions of tonnes of ore of spectacular grade were removed. A good percentage of the ore (called [...] "direct smelting ore") was so rich that it was sent straight to the smelter situated near the town without first having to be processed through the mineral enrichment plant. The Tsumeb mine is also renowned amongst mineral collectors. Between 1905 and 1996, the mine produced about 30 million tons of ore yielding 1.7 Mt copper, 2.8 Mt lead 0.9 Mt zinc, as well as 80 t germanium.
