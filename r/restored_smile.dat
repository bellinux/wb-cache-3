40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{emphasis}} and effort devoted to preventive dentistry, massive coronal destruction caused by dental caries or trauma is still seen in pediatric dentistry practice today. The technical difficulties related to dental treatment are compounded by {{problems related to}} the behavior of young patients in these circumstances, which brings {{the need for a}} broader understanding of behavior management techniques and certain skills in dealing with patients by dental practitioners, aimed at ensuring the well-being of both patient and dentist during treatment. This case report presents and discusses the scientific rationale for the treatment options adopted, considering the techniques and materials already established for aesthetic rehabilitation of adult patients (such as resins, glass-fiber posts, and glass ionomers), and now employed and adapted for pediatric dental care, that would best suit the clinical situation described. At the end of treatment, the patient achieved full rehabilitation and a <b>restored</b> <b>smile,</b> through the use of modern techniques and materials, while the dental practitioner gained {{a better understanding of the}} optimal treatment possibilities and strategies for similar cases...|$|E

Smile surgery or smile reconstruction is a surgical procedure that may <b>restore</b> the <b>smile</b> for people with facial nerve paralysis. It is unknown if early surgery is beneficial or harmful. Adverse effects include hearing loss which occurs in 3–15% of people. As of 2007 the American Academy of Neurology did not recommend surgical decompression.|$|R
40|$|With greater public aware-ness about smile enhance-ments, dentists {{are often}} {{challenged}} with greater demands from patients. Not only has this {{increased demand for}} esthetic restorative treat-ment challenged dentists, but also the laboratory technicians and dental man-ufacturers to develop techniques and materials to satisfy discerning patients. Using modern materials and following principles of smile design, the restora-tive team can succeed in <b>restoring</b> a <b>smile</b> to proper form, function, and health. The case presented demonstrates the significance of smile design and material selection in the esthetic zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{esthetic}} {{revolution is}} occurring in dental profession. The esthetic treatment enhances appearance, improve <b>smiles,</b> <b>restore</b> function and raise self esteem. This is now well known that both teeth and gums make good smile and good facial esthetic. Sometimes while doing treatment in esthetic zone, impression procedure can cause strangulation of interdental papilla, causing loss of papillae. This article therefore describes a new impression technique that involves the matrix impression system and “every other tooth” technique...|$|R

50|$|Smile {{surgery or}} smile {{reconstruction}} is a surgical procedure that <b>restores</b> the <b>smile</b> {{for people with}} facial nerve paralysis. Facial nerve paralysis is a relatively common condition with a yearly incidence of 0.25% leading to function loss of the mimic muscles. The facial nerve gives off several branches in the face. If one or more facial nerve branches are paralysed, the corresponding mimetic muscles lose their ability to contract. This may lead to several symptoms such as incomplete eye closure with or without exposure keratitis, oral incompetence, poor articulation, dental caries, drooling, and a low self-esteem. This is because the different branches innervate the frontalis muscle, orbicularis oculi and oris muscles, lip elevators and depressors, and the platysma. The elevators of the upper lip and corner of the mouth are innervated by the zygomatic and buccal branches. When these branches are paralysed, there is an inability to create a symmetric smile.|$|R
40|$|Hypopituitarism is a {{disorder}} {{caused by a}} reduced level of trophic hormones that may be consequent on different destructive processes. The clinical manifestations depend {{on the type of}} hormone involved. A deficiency of growth hormone (GH) in children causes the lack of growth known as pituitary dwarfism. The case is reported of a patient with pituitary dwarfism, multiple dental anomalies, functional prosthetic problems, and a revision of the literature. She was subjected to prosthetic rehabilitation without surgical intervention, using zirconium substructures, thus eliminating the potential complications that may require trauma surgery. The therapeutic approach adopted led to excellent results and <b>restored</b> an aesthetic <b>smile...</b>|$|R

A poor girl, whose {{profession}} scarcely earned her bread-and-butter before we engaged her. A girl whose eyes repel friendship; who has little to lose by kidnapping Jane {{in the attempt to}} secure a fortune. She was fond of baby; I could see that myself; so she won’t injure our darling but will take good care of her until we pay the money, when Toodlums will be <b>restored</b> to us, <b>smiling</b> and crowing as usual. Beth, if this reasoning is correct, we needn’t worry. By to-morrow morning Arthur will receive the demand for ransom, and he will lose no time in satisfying Mildred’s cupidity.” ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this case}} report we present the aesthetical {{correction}} of crowded anterior teeth {{in a patient}} who has refused the orthodontic treatment. We also discuss how this correction can be resolved {{from the point of}} view of dental prosthetic and what measurements can be helpful in order to collect the data used to <b>restore</b> a satisfying <b>smile</b> on the patient’s face using dental ceramic restoration. Case presentation: A 32 -year-old patient complained about his crowded incisors. We examined the incisal curvature, the proportion between the height and the width of the teeth, and the relation between the widths of the teeth and the golden proportion. The results of the measurements were compared to the characteristic values of the ideal denture. After the examination of the dental plaster cast, calculating the difference between the existing space and the necessary space, we were able to calculate the lack of space, which caused the crowded teeth. Conclusion: Along the prosthetic planning, these measurements may serve as a guideline to the dentist as an objective basis for the formation of an aesthetic denture and smile...|$|R
60|$|Of {{all this}} delay, the several {{movements}} on board, the subsequent signal of sailing, {{and of the}} impatience in the crowd, Wilder had been a grave and close observer. Posted with {{his back against the}} upright fluke of a condemned anchor, on a wharf a little apart from that occupied by most of the other spectators, he had remained an hour in the same position scarcely bending his look to his right hand or to his left. When the gun was fired he started, not with the nervous impulse which had made a hundred others do precisely the same thing, but to turn an anxious and rapid glance along the streets that came within the range of his eye. From this hasty and uneasy examination, he soon returned into his former reclining posture, though the wandering of his glances and the whole expression of his meaning countenance would have told an observer that some event, to which the young manner looked forward with excessive interest, was on the eve of its consummation As minute after minute, however, rolled by, his composure was gradually <b>restored,</b> and a <b>smile</b> of satisfaction lighted his features, while his lips moved like those of a man who expressed his pleasure in a soliloquy. It {{was in the midst of}} these agreeable meditations, that the sound of many voices met his ears; and, turning, he saw a large party within a few yards of where he stood. He was not slow to detect among them the forms of Mrs Wyllys and Gertrude, attired in such a manner as to leave no doubt that they were at length on the eve of embarking.|$|R

[...] 110 [...] Such is not Charles' too, too active age, [...] Which, govern'd by the wild distemper'd rage [...] Of some black star infecting all the skies, [...] Made {{him at his}} own cost, like Adam, wise. [...] Tremble, ye nations, which, secure before, [...] Laugh'd at those arms that 'gainst {{ourselves}} we bore; [...] Roused by the lash of his own stubborn tail, [...] Our lion now will foreign foes assail. [...] With alga[21] who the sacred altar strews? [...] To all the sea-gods Charles an offering owes: [...] 120 [...] A bull to thee, Portumnus,[22] shall be slain, [...] A lamb to you, ye Tempests of the main: [...] For those loud storms that did against him roar, [...] Have cast his shipwreck'd vessel on the shore. [...] Yet as wise artists mix their colours so, [...] That by degrees they from each other go; [...] Black steals unheeded from the neighbouring white, [...] Without offending the well-cozen'd sight: [...] So on us stole our blessed change; while we [...] The effect did feel, but scarce the manner see. [...] 130 [...] Frosts that constrain the ground, and birth deny [...] To flowers that in its womb expecting lie, [...] Do seldom their usurping power withdraw, [...] But raging floods pursue their hasty thaw. [...] Our thaw was mild, the cold not chased away, [...] But lost in kindly heat of lengthen'd day. [...] Heaven would no bargain for its blessings drive, [...] But what we could not pay for, freely give. [...] The Prince of peace would like himself confer [...] A gift unhoped, without the price of war: [...] 140 [...] Yet, as he knew his blessing's worth, took care, [...] That we should know it by repeated prayer; [...] Which storm'd the skies, and ravish'd Charles from thence, [...] As heaven itself is took by violence. [...] Booth's[23] forward valour only served to show [...] He durst that duty pay we all did owe. [...] The attempt was fair; but Heaven's prefixed hour [...] Not come: so like the watchful traveller, [...] That by the moon's mistaken light did rise, [...] Lay down again, and closed his weary eyes. [...] 150 [...] 'Twas Monk whom Providence design'd to loose [...] Those real bonds false freedom did impose. [...] The blessed saints that watch'd this turning scene, [...] Did from their stars with joyful wonder lean, [...] To see small clues draw vastest weights along, [...] Not in their bulk, but in their order, strong. [...] Thus pencils can by one slight touch <b>restore</b> [...] <b>Smiles</b> to that changed face that wept before. [...] With ease such fond chimeras we pursue, [...] As fancy frames for fancy to subdue: [...] 160 [...] But when ourselves to action we betake, [...] It shuns the mint like gold that chemists make. [...] How hard was then his task! at once to be, [...] What in the body natural we see! [...] Man's Architect distinctly did ordain [...] The charge of muscles, nerves, and of the brain, [...] Through viewless conduits spirits to dispense; [...] The springs of motion from the seat of sense. [...] 'Twas not the hasty product of a day, [...] But the well-ripen'd fruit of wise delay. [...] 170 [...] He, like a patient angler, ere he strook, [...] Would let him play a while upon the hook. [...] Our healthful food the stomach labours thus, [...] At first embracing what it straight doth crush. [...] Wise leeches will not vain receipts obtrude, [...] While growing pains pronounce the humours crude: [...] Deaf to complaints, they wait upon the ill, [...] Till some safe crisis authorise their skill. [...] Nor could his acts too close a vizard wear, [...] To 'scape their eyes whom guilt had taught to fear, [...] 180 [...] And guard with caution that polluted nest, [...] Whence Legion twice before was dispossess'd: [...] Once sacred house; which, when they enter'd in, [...] They thought the place could sanctify a sin; [...] Like those that vainly hoped kind Heaven would wink, [...] While to excess on martyrs' tombs they drink. [...] And as devouter Turks first warn their souls [...] To part, before they taste forbidden bowls: [...] So these, when their black crimes they went about, [...] First timely charm'd their useless conscience out. [...] 190 [...] Religion's name against itself was made; [...] The shadow served the substance to invade: [...] Like zealous missions, they did care pretend [...] Of souls in show, but made the gold their end. [...] The incensed powers beheld with scorn from high [...] An heaven so far distant from the sky, [...] Which durst, with horses' hoofs that beat the ground, [...] And martial brass, belie the thunder's sound. [...] 'Twas hence at length just vengeance thought it fit [...] To speed their ruin by their impious wit. [...] 200 [...] Thus Sforza, cursed with a too fertile brain, [...] Lost by his wiles the power his wit did gain. [...] Henceforth their fougue[24] must spend at lesser rate, [...] Than in its flames to wrap a nation's fate. [...] Suffer'd to live, they are like helots set, [...] A virtuous shame within us to beget. [...] For by example most we sinn'd before, [...] And glass-like clearness mix'd with frailty bore. [...] But, since reform'd by what we did amiss, [...] We by our sufferings learn to prize our bliss: [...] 210 [...] Like early lovers, whose unpractised hearts [...] Were long the May-game of malicious arts, [...] When once they find their jealousies were vain, [...] With double heat renew their fires again. [...] 'Twas this produced the joy that hurried o'er [...] Such swarms of English to the neighbouring shore, [...] To fetch that prize, by which Batavia made [...] So rich amends for our impoverish'd trade. [...] Oh! had you seen from Schevelin's[25] barren shore, [...] (Crowded with troops, and barren now no more,) [...] 220 [...] Afflicted Holland to his farewell bring [...] True sorrow, Holland to regret a king! [...] While waiting him his royal fleet did ride, [...] And willing winds to their lower'd sails denied. [...] The wavering streamers, flags, and standard out, [...] The merry seamen's rude but cheerful shout: [...] And last the cannon's voice, that shook the skies, [...] And as it fares in sudden ecstasies, [...] At once bereft us both of ears and eyes. [...] The Naseby,[26] now no longer England's shame, [...] 230 [...] But better to be lost in Charles' name, [...] (Like some unequal bride in nobler sheets) [...] Receives her lord: the joyful London meets [...] The princely York, himself alone a freight; [...] The Swiftsure groans beneath great Gloster's[27] weight: [...] Secure as when the halcyon breeds, with these, [...] He that was born to drown might cross the seas. [...] Heaven could not own a Providence, and take [...] The wealth three nations ventured at a stake. [...] The same indulgence Charles' voyage bless'd, [...] 240 [...] Which in his right had miracles confess'd. [...] The winds that never moderation knew, [...] Afraid to blow too much, too faintly blew; [...] Or, out of breath with joy, could not enlarge [...] Their straighten'd lungs, or conscious of their charge. [...] The British Amphitrite, smooth and clear, [...] In richer azure never did appear; [...] Proud her returning prince to entertain [...] With the submitted fasces of the main. [...] And welcome now, great monarch, to your own! [...] 250 [...] Behold the approaching cliffs of Albion: [...] It is no longer motion cheats your view, [...] As you meet it, the land approacheth you. [...] The land returns, and, in the white it wears, [...] The marks of penitence and sorrow bears. [...] But you, whose goodness your descent doth show, [...] Your heavenly parentage and earthly too; [...] By that same mildness, which your father's crown [...] Before did ravish, shall secure your own. [...] Not tied to rules of policy, you find [...] 260 [...] Revenge less sweet than a forgiving mind. [...] Thus, when the Almighty would to Moses give [...] A sight of all he could behold and live; [...] A voice before his entry did proclaim [...] Long-suffering, goodness, mercy, in his name. [...] Your power to justice doth submit your cause, [...] Your goodness only is above the laws; [...] Whose rigid letter, while pronounced by you, [...] Is softer made. So winds that tempests brew, [...] When through Arabian groves they take their flight, [...] 270 [...] Made wanton with rich odours, lose their spite. [...] And as those lees, that trouble it, refine [...] The agitated soul of generous wine; [...] So tears of joy, for your returning spilt, [...] Work out, and expiate our former guilt. [...] Methinks I see those crowds on Dover's strand, [...] Who, in their haste to welcome you to land, [...] Choked up the beach with their still growing store, [...] And made a wilder torrent on the shore: [...] While, spurr'd with eager thoughts of past delight, [...] 280 [...] Those, who had seen you, court a second sight; [...] Preventing still your steps, and making haste [...] To meet you often wheresoe'er you past. [...] How shall I speak of that triumphant day, [...] When you renew'd the expiring pomp of May![28] [...] (A month that owns an interest in your name: [...] You and the flowers are its peculiar claim.) [...] That star[29] that at your birth shone out so bright, [...] It stain'd the duller sun's meridian light, [...] Did once again its potent fires renew, [...] 290 [...] Guiding our eyes to find and worship you.|$|R
