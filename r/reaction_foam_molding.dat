With this project, the goal is to examine opportunities to employ lean principles and provide a solution that further eliminates non-value added procedures, while also producing the potential for a flexible, mixed model assembly line. To achieve the aforementioned purpose, the production of <b>foam</b> <b>molds,</b> located within industrial totes and sent to the assembly line, was found to be a major waste within the kitting process. <b>Foam</b> <b>molds</b> are crucial {{to the creation of a}} kit as they provide clear presentation of components to assemblers line side, allow components to be held securely and easily, and enable facilitated access and standardized organization when picking parts. A <b>foam</b> <b>mold</b> material substitute is a potential solution to this problem as it allows for the elimination of the separate production loop and a streamlined, in-house process intended to present assembly components for consumption line side. Of the material prototypes ranked using Analytic Hierarchy Process, Beaded <b>Foam</b> (an uncompressed <b>molding</b> <b>foam)</b> provides the best alternative as it does not dry, does not crumble, can be formed infinitely, abides by the three R’s, and holds its shape before and after pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{feasibility}} of applying the single-charge rotational <b>foam</b> <b>molding</b> processing principle to the fabrication of integral skin polypropylene (PP) foams comprising a PP solid {{skin and a}} PP foamed core is investigated in this study. A systematic process interruption and sample evaluation approach was used to quantify the experimental results and explore possibilities for improving the process control strategies to ultimately achieve a desired homogeneity and thickness uniformity of the solid PP skin layer that would be fully encapsulating the PP foamed core of a desired cell population density and average cell size. The experimental results revealed that {{this is quite a}} challenging task, {{not only because of the}} well-known intrinsically poor foaming nature of PP due to its low melt strength at elevated temperatures, but also because, in single-charge rotational molding, the processing parameters are often conflicting with each other and therefore, have to be optimized within a very narrow processing window.
