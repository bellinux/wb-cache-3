5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. <b>Rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5|$|Max-Hellmuth Ostermann (11December 1917 – 9August 1942) was a Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II. A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat. He is credited with 102 enemy aircraft shot down claimed in over 300 combat missions. The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front with eight claims over the Western Front and one over Belgrade. Ostermann was of such short height that wooden blocks had to be attached to his <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> for him to engage in tight turning aerial combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Bellcranks {{are often}} used in {{aircraft}} control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the rudder often has a bellcrank whose pivot point is the rudder hinge. A cable connects the pilot's <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> {{to one side of}} the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal,</b> the <b>rudder</b> rotates on its hinge. The opposite <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction.|$|R

40|$|A piloted, fixed-base {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} in 2006 to determine optimum <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> force/feel characteristics for transport aircraft. As part of this research, an evaluation of four metrics for assessing <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> characteristics previously presented in the literature was conducted. This evaluation was based upon the numerical handling qualities ratings assigned {{to a variety of}} pedal force/feel systems used in the simulation study. It is shown that, with the inclusion of a fifth metric, most of the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> force/feel system designs that were rated poorly by the evaluation pilots could be identified. It is suggested that these metrics form the basis of a certification requirement for transport aircraft...|$|R
25|$|The cockpit was on {{the leading}} edge of the wing. Conventional stick and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> {{controlled}} the ailerons, elevator and rudder.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} welded 4130 steel tube and the aircraft has conventional landing gear with tail wheel steering connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b> The main landing gear utilises sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads.|$|E
2500|$|... "The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer {{as a result of}} the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officer’s unnecessary and excessive <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> inputs. Contributing to these <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program (AAMP)." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{failure of}} the crew to detect the {{improper}} rudder trim setting by means of <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> displacement, information during taxiing and holding for takeoff.|$|R
25|$|Contributing {{factors include}} the following: first, the first officer's {{predisposition}} to overreact to wake turbulence; second, the training provided by American Airlines {{that could have}} encouraged pilots to make large flight control inputs; third, the first officer likely not understanding an airplane's response to large rudder inputs at high airspeeds or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; finally, light <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> system increased the airplane's susceptibility to a rudder misuse.|$|R
25|$|The name Airbike {{was chosen}} for the {{aircraft}} {{because it has a}} narrow fuselage and the pilot's feet rest on <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> that are {{on the outside of the}} aircraft, in a similar manner to a motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|The tail {{features}} a rudder mounted with a piano hinge {{on the right}} side only. The elevator is a full flying stabilator and incorporates anti-servo tabs inboard on both sides to increase pitch stick forces. The controls are actuated by dual control sticks and conventional <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early aircraft, a {{tailskid}} made {{of metal}} or wood {{was used to}} support the tail on the ground. In most modern aircraft with conventional landing gear, a small articulated wheel assembly {{is attached to the}} rearmost part of the airframe in place of the skid. This wheel may be steered by the pilot through a connection to the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> allowing the rudder and tailwheel to move together.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> toes.|$|R
50|$|The RV-6A version {{features}} steel rod {{landing gear}} with the nosewheel strut {{attached to the}} engine mount. The nosewheel is friction castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> toes.|$|R
50|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> toes.|$|R
25|$|The PT-22 {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of a single tank mounted forward of the front cockpit. Fuel is gravity fed to the carburetor. The oil system is a dry-sump type, with all oil stored in a tank located on the front side of the firewall in the upper section of the fuselage. The wing flaps are mechanically operated from a lever located {{on the left side}} of each cockpit. Adjustable elevator trim is provided via an elevator trim tab controllable from a handwheel mounted {{on the left side of}} each cockpit. In its original configuration, the aircraft was not equipped with an electrical system. Hydraulic brakes are provided for each wheel, controllable via the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> in each cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} of the SZD-6x was {{designed}} to allow the aircraft to be flown with several different control configurations. The trailing edges of the wings carried three surfaces each, all {{of which could be}} linked to form elevons or operated individually as ailerons, elevators or flaps. The metal-skinned split ailerons, (the outboard control surfaces), also formed the airbrakes, opening out to give increased drag. The ailerons/airbrakes could be connected to the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> to be used as drag rudders, similar to the drag rudders used on the Northrop flying wings. The inboard control surfaces on the swept ford section of trailing edge were typically used for trimming purposes deflecting 10° up or down.|$|E
25|$|The {{nose wheel}} of the DA20 is not linked to the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> and turns while taxiing are made with {{differential}} braking, with rudder steering becoming more effective as airspeed increases. The Katana possesses a higher glide ratio than many of its competitors; its glide ratio is 11:1 and the DA20-A1 is 14:1. The aircraft does not feature any instances of vortex generators, wing fences or many other aerodynamic devices, aside from the integral winglets, which positively contribute to roll stability, drag-reduction, and enhanced aileron effectiveness. The Katana's T-tail configuration has also been claimed to reduce {{the negative effects of}} propeller-generated slipstream on the aircraft's pitch control as well as increase low-speed pitch authority.|$|E
2500|$|Production variant with {{reinforced}} inclined deck {{to prevent}} [...]50in (12.7mm) machine gun tripod mounting cracking, bulkhead reinforcements to prevent <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> wall cracking, a reinforced reduction gearbox bulkhead to prevent cowling former cracking, and repositioning of the battery solenoid. Oxygen system reduced from four bottle to only two; 1,000 built.|$|R
5000|$|... 12 November 2001 - American Airlines Flight 587 {{encountered}} heavy turbulence and the co-pilot over-applied the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal,</b> {{turning the}} Airbus A300 side to side. Due to the excessive stress, the rudder failed. The A300 spun {{and hit a}} residential area, crushing 5 houses and killing 265. Contributing factors included wake turbulence and pilot training.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Pilot's {{view of a}} Schempp-Hirth Janus-C glider. The yaw string (red wool) on {{the canopy}} and the turn and bank {{indicator}} (top center of the instrument panel) both show the glider is not in coordinated flight. The glider is slipping slightly nose-left. Coordinated flight can be restored by the pilot applying pressure to the right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional collective pitch lever by his left side. The <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted {{and there were two}} sets of <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E
25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional cyclic stick, collective lever and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on rotor disc angle.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is constructed}} of aluminum with the cabin structure and gull-winged doors made from composite materials. The landing gear is tubular steel with the nosewheel mounting tube welded {{to the engine}} mount. As in all nose-wheel equipped RV aircraft, the nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> toes.|$|R
25|$|NTSB investigators' post-accident {{investigation}} {{showed that}} because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|R
50|$|Singer-songwriter John Denver {{died when}} his Long-EZ crashed on October 12, 1997. The NTSB {{believes}} that he inadvertently pushed on his right <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> while twisting to the left in his seat {{as he struggled to}} operate the fuel selector valve, which on his aircraft had been moved by a previous owner to a position where it could more easily be reached from the passenger seat.|$|R
25|$|As the Waterpump mission continued, it was {{attached}} to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of neophyte pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for Waterpump training. The Hmong were unlikely pilot candidates. They were unfamiliar with modern machinery, possessed little English, and were of small stature. However, wood blocks wired to the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> brought that control within reach of the short-legged cadets. Seat cushions in the T-28s boosted the Hmong high enough they could see out of the cockpit to fly.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{prototype}} were three Model A45T aircraft, {{the first two}} with the same engine as {{the prototype}} and the third with a Continental E-225, which {{would prove to be}} close to the production version. Production did not begin until 1953, when Beechcraft began delivering T-34As to the United States Air Force (USAF) and similar Model B45 aircraft for export. Production of the T-34B for the United States Navy (USN) began in 1955, this version featuring a number of changes reflecting the different requirements of the two services. The T-34B had only differential braking for steering control on the ground instead of nosewheel steering, additional wing dihedral and, to cater for the different heights of pilots, adjustable <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals</b> instead of the moveable seats of the T-34A. T-34A production was completed in 1956, with T-34Bs being built until October 1957 and licensed B45 versions built in Canada (125 manufactured by Canadian Car and Foundry), Japan (173 built by Fuji Heavy Industries), and Argentina (75 by FMA) until 1958. Beechcraft delivered the last Model B45s in 1959. Total production of the Continental-engined versions in the US and abroad was 1,904 aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedals,</b> and the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
50|$|Many {{airplanes}} {{also have}} rudder and/or aileron trim systems. On some of these, the rudder trim tab is rigid but adjustable {{on the ground}} by bending: it is angled slightly to the left (when viewed from behind) to lessen {{the need for the}} pilot to push the <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> constantly to overcome the left-turning tendencies of many prop-driven aircraft. Some aircraft have hinged rudder trim tabs that the pilot can adjust in flight.|$|R
40|$|Spin {{tests have}} been {{performed}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a 1 / 35 -scale model of the Douglas XB- 43 airplane. The spin and recovery characteristics were determined for several loading conditions of the airplane. The effects of installing a dorsal fin and of installing a ventral fin were investigated. Emergency escape of the crew was simulated and the stick and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> forces necessary to effect recoveries on the airplane were determined...|$|R
50|$|Direct law (DIR) {{introduces}} a direct stick-to-control surfaces relationship: control surface motion {{is directly related}} to the sidestick and <b>rudder</b> <b>pedal</b> motion. The trimmable horizontal stabilizer can only be controlled by the manual trim wheel. All protections are lost, and the maximum deflection of the elevators is limited for each configuration as a function of the current aircraft centre of gravity. This aims to create a compromise between adequate pitch control with a forward C.G. and not-too-sensitive control with an aft C.G.|$|R
