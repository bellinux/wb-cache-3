40|$|The fat {{of mixture}} of goat and cow milk, {{extracted}} by di-ethylic ether, was gas chromatographically analysed {{in order to}} propose an analytical procedure suitable to reveal small additions of cow milk to goat milk. The obtained results show evident differences in the percentages of some fatty acids. An attempt to apply the peak area ratios, corresponding to the methyl esters of fatty acids, suggested by the literature for cow milk did not yield good results. Other ratios suitable to reveal even the presence of low percentages (up to 5 %) of cow milk in goat milk were found and proposed in this paper. Such ratios are sensitive and can be defined markers towards cow or goat milk and also towards extraneous fat like lard <b>or</b> <b>colza</b> <b>seeds</b> oil...|$|R
6000|$|If we allow, with Pictet, that Darwins theory will {{very well}} serve {{for all that}} {{concerns}} the present epoch of the worlds history--an epoch in which this renowned paleontologist includes the diluvial or quaternary period--then Darwins first and foremost need in his onward course is a practicable road from this into and through the tertiary period, the intervening region between the comparatively near and the far remote past. Here Lyells doctrine paves the way, by showing that in the physical geology there is no general or absolute break between the two, probably no greater between the latest tertiary and the quaternary period than between the latter and the present time. So far, the Lyellian view is, we suppose, generally concurred in. It is largely admitted that numerous tertiary species have continued down into the quaternary, {{and many of them}} to the present time. A goodly percentage of the earlier and nearly half of the later tertiary mollusca, according to Des Hayes, Lye!!, and, if we mistake not, Bronn, still live. This identification, however, is now questioned by a naturalist of the very highest authority. But, in its bearings on the new theory, the point here turns not upon absolute identity so much as upon close resemblance. For those who, with Agassiz, doubt the specific identity in any of these cases, and those who say, with Pictet, that [...] "the later tertiary deposits contain in general the debris of species very nearly related to those which still exist, belonging to the same genera, but specifically different," [...] may also agree with Pictet, that the nearly-related species of successive faunas must or may have had [...] "a material connection." [...] But the only material connection that we have an idea of in such a case is a genealogical one. And the supposition of a genealogical connection is surely not unnatural in such cases--is demonstrably the natural one as respects all those tertiary species which experienced naturalists have pronounced to be identical with existing ones, but which others now deem distinct For to identify the two is the same thing as to conclude the one to be the ancestor of the other No doubt there are differences between the tertiary and the present individuals, differences equally noticed by both classes of naturalists, but differently estimated By the one these are deemed quite compatible, by the other incompatible, with community of origin But who can tell us what amount of difference is compatible with community of origin? This is the very question at issue, and one to be settled by observation alone Who would have thought that the peach and the nectarine came from one stock? But, this being proved is it now very improbable that both were derived from the almond, or from some common amygdaline progenitor? Who would have thought that the cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli kale, and kohlrabi are derivatives of one species, and <b>rape</b> <b>or</b> <b>colza,</b> turnip, and probably ruta-baga, of another species? And who that is convinced of this can long undoubtingly hold the original distinctness of turnips from cabbages as an article of faith? On scientific grounds may not a primordial cabbage <b>or</b> <b>rape</b> be assumed as the ancestor of all the cabbage races, on much the same ground that we assume a common ancestry for the diversified human races? If all Our breeds of cattle came from one stock why not this stock from the auroch, which has had all the time between the diluvial and the historic periods in which to set off a variation perhaps no greater than the difference between some sorts of domestic cattle? ...|$|R

For testing, an experimental setup was established. With combination of air and <b>Colza</b> <b>seeds</b> belonging to D groups of the Geldart classification (Geldart, 1986) fluidization regime was carried out. With five test series with maintaining the inlet gas temperature, solid particle temperature and outlet gas temperature during time were carefully measured. To analyze these data by using regression analysis to predict solid particle and outlet gas temperature, 2 correlations on initial pa-rameters were presented. The result has shown that temperature gradients {{in the beginning of}} fluidization, is very high and therefore the exponential functions in the regression model is used to predict the temperature changes...|$|R
