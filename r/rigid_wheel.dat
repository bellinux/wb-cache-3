The usual practice is to test the performances of rovers on soil simulants on earth, prior to their deployment to extraterrestrial bodies. It is noted that in the tests the soil simulant is subject to the earth gravity, while the terrain on the extraterrestrial surface is subject to a different gravity. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the rover/rover wheel would exhibit the same performance on the extraterrestrial surface as that obtained from tests conducted on earth. This paper describes a practical methodology that can be employed to predict the performances of rover wheels on extraterrestrial surfaces, based on test results obtained on earth.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive wheel model that can quantitatively evaluate traction performance of ﬂexible/rigid wheelsdriving on deformable terrain. The proposed model exploits a terramechanics-based approach with taking account of pressures generated by wheel elasticity {{as well as}} terrain stiffness. Deﬂection of a ﬂexible wheel typically depends on a relative pressure between thewheel and terrain: the wheel will be signiﬁcantly deformed on rigid terrain whereas it will be hardly deformed on soft terrain. Therefore, the wheel-terrain interaction in the proposed model {{is divided into three}} contact sections: wheel front section, wheel deﬂected(ﬂat) section, and wheel rear section. The traction force of the wheel is obtained as an integral of normal and shear stresses generatedat each section. Simulation studies with varied wheel pressures, such as ﬂexible, semi-ﬂexible, and <b>rigid</b> <b>wheels,</b> are conducted tovalidate the proposed model. Also, traction performances of ﬂexible/rigid wheels are compared based on a metric called tractiveefﬁciency.

30|$|The problem is, when a rover with <b>rigid</b> <b>wheels</b> {{traverses}} loose soil, {{there is}} a possibility of extremely bad traction conditions. This means that slipping and sinking behaviors can occur. The wheels of the MER was sinking into the soil and could not move; a situation that is not easily rectified. When the rovers are traversing loose soil, we have to consider the condition of the ground under the wheels. The relation between the wheel and loose soil can be described using Terramechanics [4]. Using terramechanics, the entrance angle, which can indicate the depth that the wheel is sinking into the soil, is used to lead the drawbar pull. Many researchers are studied about Terramechanics [5]–[8]. Ding et al. summarized the most recent work on Terramechanics [9]. It is necessary to understand the range of the contacting angle between the wheel and loose soil for the derivation of drawbar pull. The contacting angle is shown using the entrance angle and the leaving angle. If the entrance angle can be detected while the rovers are traversing, the drawbar pull and the sinkage can be derived “real time”. It is effective to detect sinkage to determine the rovers moving path.|$|R
40|$|Though much {{research}} has been conducted regarding traction of tires in soft granular terrain, little empirical data exist on the motion of soil particles beneath a tire. A novel experimentation and analysis technique has been developed to enable investigation of terramechanics fundamentals in great detail.

The method places a wheel (or other traction device) in granular soil up against a transparent sidewall. While driving or towing the tire, images are taken of the sub-surface soil, and are processed with optical flow software. Analysis of the resulting displacement field identifies clusters of soil motion and shear interfaces.

40|$|Abstract — Grousers, {{sometimes}} called lugs, {{are recognized as}} a way to improve wheel performance and traction, but there have been, to date, no comprehensive guidelines for choosing grouser patterns. This work presents a quantitative expression for determining appropriate grouser spacing for <b>rigid</b> <b>wheels.</b> Past empirical studies have shown that increasing grouser height and number can improve performance, to a point. The newly proposed grouser spacing equation is based on observations that wheels with an inadequate number of grousers induce forward soil flow ahead of the wheel, and thus rolling resistance. The equation relates geometric wheel parameters (wheel radius, grouser height and spacing) and operating parameters (slip and sinkage), and predicts a maximum allowable grouser spacing (or, equivalently, a minimum number of grousers). Experiments with various grouser heights and numbers demonstrate good correspondence to the proposed equation, as increases in number of grousers beyond the predicted minimum number stop improving performance. A grouser spacing equation is particularly useful for designing efficient wheels. The proposed relation includes slip and sinkage, parameters that cannot be assumed constant or known a priori, but this work shows that wheels designed using the proposed equation are robust to changing operating scenarios even if they degrade beyond estimated nominal conditions.
