40|$|Inventory {{management}} in reverse logistics has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One of the inventory problems {{that has been}} of interest to researchers is the production, remanufacture (<b>repair)</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal model, where used items are collected and remanufactured to "as-good-as new" state. The available models in the literature assume that customers' demand is satisfied from newly manufactured (produced) items and from remanufactured (repaired) items. This may be true in few industries, but not in other industries where customers do not consider "new" ("manufactured") and "remanufactured" ("repaired") items as being interchangeable. This paper extends along this line of research and assumes that demand for manufactured items {{is different from that}} for remanufactured (repaired) ones. This assumption results in lost sales situations where there are stock-out periods for manufactured and remanufactured items.

Introduction: In medical practice {{of recent years}} physicians are realizing more and more {{the truth of the}} statement that the health of the patient depends upon the food taken into the body. Let us consider for a moment what a food is. It is anything which when taken into the body is capable of <b>repairing</b> <b>wasted</b> tissue, or furnishing it with material from which to produce heat, nervous or muscular force. It is impossible to replace wasted tissue when nothing is given to the organism with which to replace the wornout body. Thus we see that feeding {{is one of the most}} important factors in the regaining of health to a sick person. In some cases it holds a more important place than drugs. The diet is very important in Uraemia, Aneamia, Albuminuria and Diabetes. Let us consider the last named. Diabetes is a disorder of nutrition in which sugar accumulates in and is excreted by the urine in the form of grape sugar or glucose. For a case to be considered diabetes mellitus, it is necessary that the form of sugar eliminated in the urine...|$|R

6000|$|Thus far we {{have been}} able by the aid of our {{hypothesis}} to throw some obscure light on the problems which have come before us; but it must be confessed that many points remain altogether doubtful. Thus it is useless to speculate at what period of development each unit of the body casts off its gemmules, as the whole subject of the development of the various tissues is as yet far from clear. We do not know whether the gemmules are merely collected by some unknown means at certain seasons within the reproductive organs, or whether after being thus collected they rapidly multiply there, as the flow of blood to these organs at each breeding season seems to render probable. Nor do we know why the gemmules collect to form buds in certain definite places, leading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals. We have no means of deciding whether the ordinary wear and tear of the tissues is made good by means of gemmules, or merely by the proliferation of pre-existing cells. If the gemmules are thus consumed, as seems probable from the intimate connection between the <b>repair</b> of <b>waste,</b> regrowth, and development, and more especially from the periodical changes which many male animals undergo in colour and structure, then some light would be thrown on the phenomena of old age, with its lessened power of reproduction and of the repair of injuries, and on the obscure subject of longevity. The fact of castrated animals, which do not cast off innumerable gemmules in the act of reproduction, not being longer-lived than perfect males, seems opposed to the belief that gemmules are consumed in the ordinary <b>repair</b> of <b>wasted</b> tissues; unless indeed the gemmules after being collected in small numbers within the reproductive organs are there largely multiplied.

During winter, trees can reduce heating needs by lowering wind speeds and thereby reducing infiltration of cold air.

40|$|The EOQ <b>repair</b> and <b>waste</b> {{disposal}} {{problem was}} studied first by Richter, 1997. A first shop is providing a homogeneous product {{used by a}} second shop at a constant demand rate. The first shop is manufacturing new products {{and it is also}} repairing products used by a second shop, which are then regarded as being as good as new. The products are employed by a second shop and collected there according to a repair rate. The other products are immediately disposed of as waste. At the end of some period of time, the collected products are brought back to the first shop and will be stored as long as necessary and then repaired. If the repaired products are finished, the manufacturing process starts to cover the remaining demand for the time interval. The model was extended by Saadany and Jaber, 2008 to the problem of minimizing the total cost of production, remanufacturing and inventory while incorporating additional switching costs. The switching cost is incurred when the process shifts from repair to production and from production to repair. However, in their paper the authors did not provide a complete solution to this complex problem. We provide the solution in this paper...|$|R

60|$|The nutritive Elements of Food.--Many chemists {{have applied}} {{themselves}} in recent years, {{to discover the}} exact percentage of nutriment contained in different substances, and to determine the minimum nutriment on which human life can be supported. The results are not very accordant, but nevertheless a considerable approximation to truth has been arrived at. It is now possible to tell whether a proposed diet has any great faults of excess or deficiency, and how to remedy those faults. But it also must be recollected that the stomach is an assimilating machine of limited performance, and must be fed with food that it can digest; {{it is not enough}} that the food should contain nutritious matter, if that matter should be in an indigestible form. Burke and Wills perished from sheer inability to digest the seeds upon which the Australian savages lived; and Gardiner's party died of starvation in Tierra del Fuego, because they could not digest the shell-fish which form a common article of diet of the natives of that country. The question of diet must then be limited to food that is perfectly digestible by the traveller. It remains to learn how much nourishment is contained in different kinds of digestible food. Dr. Smith has recently written an elaborate essay on this subject, applying his inquiries chiefly to the food of the poor in England; but for my more general purpose, as it is impossible to do justice to a large and imperfectly understood subject, in the small space I can give to it, it will be better that I should reprint the results given in my previous edition. These are principally extracted from a remarkable paper by Dr. Christison, inserted in the Bluebook Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Crimean matters, in which the then faulty dietary of our soldiers was discussed. It appears 1st, that a man of sedentary life can exist in health on seventeen ounces per day of real nutriment; that a man engaged in active life requires fully twenty-eight ounces per day; and, during severe labour, he requires thirty ounces, or even more. 2ndly, that this nutriment must consist of three-quarters, by weight, of one class of nutritive principles, (C), and one quarter of another class of nutritive principles, (N); 3rdly, that all the articles of common food admit of being placed, as below, in a Table, by which we see at a glance how much nutriment of class C, and how much of class N, is found in 100 parts, gross weight of any of them. Thus, by a simple computation, the effective value of a dietary may be ascertained. Class C, are the carboniferous principles, that maintain respiration; Class N, are the nitrogenous principles, that <b>repair</b> <b>waste</b> of tissue. N will partly replace C, but at a great waste: C will not replace N.|$|R

We present a highly efficient algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal distribution of FEC repair packets to a given (small constant) number of multicast groups.
