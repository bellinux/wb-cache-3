40|$|Abstract—Software {{licensing}} {{issues for}} a system design, instantiation, or configuration are often complex and difficult to evaluate, and mistakes can be costly. Automated assistance requires a formal representation of the significant features of the software licenses involved. We present results from an analysis directed toward a formal representation capable of covering an entire license. The key to such a representation is to identify the license’s actions, and relate them to the actions for exclusive <b>rights</b> <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> law and to the actions <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> other licenses. Parameterizing each action by the object(s) acted on, the instrumental entities through which the action is performed, and similar contextual variables enables a subsumption relation among the actions. The resulting formalism is lightweight, flexible enough to support the scope of legal interpretations, and extensible {{to a wide range}} of software licenses.
