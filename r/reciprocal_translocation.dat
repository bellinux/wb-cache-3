25|$|The {{chromosomal}} {{defect in}} the Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The result is that a fusion gene is created by juxtaposing the ABL1 gene on chromosome 9 (region q34) to {{a part of the}} BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22 (region q11). This is a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocation,</b> creating an elongated chromosome 9 (termed a derivative chromosome, or der 9), and a truncated chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome, 22q-). In agreement with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN), this chromosomal translocation is designated as t(9;22)(q34;q11). The symbol ABL is derived from Abelson, the name of a leukemia virus which carries a similar protein.|$|E

40|$|Chromosomal anomalies, like Robertsonian and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> {{represent}} {{a big problem}} in cattle breeding as their presence induces, in the carrier subjects, a well documented fertility reduction. In cattle <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> (RCPs, a chromosome abnormality caused by an exchange of material between nonhomologous chromosomes) are considered rare as to date only 19 <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> have been described. In cattle it is common knowledge that the Robertsonian translocations represent the most common cytogenetic anomalies, and this is {{probably due to the}} existence of the endemic 1; 29 Robertsonian translocation. However, these considerations are based on data obtained using techniques that are unable to identify all <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and thus their frequency is clearly underestimated. The purpose of this work is to provide a first realistic estimate of the impact of RCPs in the cattle population studied, trying to eliminate the factors which have caused an underestimation of their frequency so far. We performed this work using a mathematical as well as a simulation approach and, as biological data, we considered the cytogenetic results obtained in the last 15 years. The results obtained show that only 16 % of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> can be detected using simple Giemsa techniques and consequently they could be present in no less than 0, 14 % of cattle subjects, a frequency five times higher than that shown by de novo Robertsonian translocations.

40|$|Introduction and METHODS: We {{report the}} {{screening}} of 41 de novo <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and 18 de novo complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) using array-CGH. All cases had been interpreted as "balanced" by conventional cytogenetics. RESULTS: Twenty-seven cases of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> were detected {{in patients with}} an abnormal phenotype and after array-CGH analysis eleven resulted unbalanced. Thus we found that 40 % of patients with a "chromosomal phenotype" and an apparently balanced translocation were unbalanced (11 cases out of 27), and that 18 % of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> were instead complex rearrangements (5 cases out of 27) with more than three breakpoints. Fourteen fetuses with de novo apparently balanced translocations, all but two with normal ultrasound findings, were also analyzed and all resulted normal after array-CGH. Thirteen CCRs were detected in individuals with abnormal phenotypes, two in females with repeated abortions and three in fetuses. We found that sixteen were unbalanced with up to four deletions. DISCUSSION: Our investigations suggest that genome-wide array-CGH may be recommendable in all carriers of "balanced" CCRs. The parental origin of the deletions was investigated in five <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and eleven CCRs. All resulted to be paternal. Using customized platforms in seven cases of CCRs, we narrowed down the deletion breakpoints to few-hundreds base pairs and no susceptibility motifs {{were associated with the}} imbalances. Our findings demonstrate that the phenotypic abnormalities of apparently balanced de novo CCRs are mainly due to cryptic deletions and that spermatogenesis is more prone to generate multiple chaotic chromosome imbalances and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> than oogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Using array {{comparative}} genome hybridisation (CGH) 41 de novo <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and 18 de novo complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) were screened. All {{cases had}} been interpreted as "balanced" by conventional cytogenetics. In all, 27 cases of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> were detected {{in patients with}} an abnormal phenotype, and after array CGH analysis, 11 {{were found to be}} unbalanced.

Fourteen fetuses with de novo, apparently balanced translocations, all but two with normal ultrasound findings, were also analysed and all were found to be normal using array CGH. Thirteen CCRs were detected in patients with abnormal phenotypes, two in women who had experienced repeated spontaneous abortions and three in fetuses. Sixteen patients were found to have unbalanced mutations, with up to 4 deletions. These results suggest that genome-wide array CGH may be advisable in all carriers of "balanced" CCRs. The parental origin of the deletions was investigated in 5 <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and 11 CCRs; all were found to be paternal.

40|$|Background: {{congenital}} chromosome abnormalities {{are relatively}} common in our species and among structural abnormalities {{the most common}} class is balanced <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations.</b> Determining the parental origin of de novo balanced translocations may provide insights into how and when they arise. While {{there is a general}} paternal bias in the origin of non-recurrent unbalanced rearrangements, there are few data on parental origin of non-recurrent balanced rearrangements. Methods: the parental origin of a series of de novo balanced <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> was determined using DNA from flow sorted derivative chromosomes and linkage analysis. Results: of 27 translocations, we found 26 to be of paternal origin and only one of maternal origin. We also found the paternally derived translocations to be associated with a significantly increased paternal age (p< 0. 008). Conclusion: our results suggest there is a very marked paternal bias in the origin of all non-recurrent <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> and that they may arise during one of the numerous mitotic divisions that occur in the spermatogonial germ cells prior to meiosi...|$|R
40|$|In fungi, translocations can be {{identified}} and classified by the patterns of ascospore abortion in asci from crosses of rearrangement x normal sequence. Previous studies of UV-induced rearrangements in Sordaria macrospora revealed that a major class (called type III) appeared to be <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> that were anomalous in producing an unexpected class of asci with four aborted ascospores in bbbbaaaa linear sequence (b = black; a = abortive). The present study shows that the anomalous type III rearrangements are, in fact, <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> having both breakpoints within or adjacent to centromeres and that bbbbaaaa asci result from 3 : 1 disjunction from the translocation quadrivalent. —Electron microscopic observations of synaptonemal complexes enable centromeres to be visualized. Lengths of synaptonemal complexes lateral elements in translocation quadrivalents accurately reflect chromosome arm lengths, enabling breakpoints to be located reliably in centromere regions. All genetic data {{are consistent with the}} behavior expected of translocations with breakpoints at centromeres. —Two-thirds of the UV-induced <b>reciprocal</b> <b>translocations</b> are of this type. Certain centromere regions are involved preferentially.
