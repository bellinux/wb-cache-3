5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, <b>rock</b> <b>bass,</b> channel catfish and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and brown trout were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. Brown trout naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E

The commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board decided that a lighthouse should be erected on the <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock</b> in July 1897 along with another light at Barns Ness near Dunbar. The cost of constructing the <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock</b> light was £8,087, a light first being shone from the rock {{on the evening of}} 1 November 1902. It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board’s headquarters in Edinburgh. Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle. Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used.|$|R

All declined in concentration at Ailsa Craig but some (153, 170, 180) remained stable or increased slightly at <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock.</b> Egg congener concentrations at <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock</b> were typically 10 -fold higher than at Ailsa Craig by 2002, and Principal Component Analysis indicated that colony differences were driven by the dominant congeners. Egg mercury concentrations were significantly lower at <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock</b> than Ailsa Craig and temporal trends differed, there being a significant decline at Ailsa Craig but a marginal increase at <b>Bass</b> <b>Rock.</b> Our results suggest there may be differences in contamination between the eastern Atlantic and North Sea and/or there are colony differences in prey selection and associated contaminant loads...|$|R

The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker, haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae. It has also been known to eat ducklings.|$|E

500|$|Punk rock vocals {{sometimes}} sound nasal, {{and lyrics}} are often shouted instead of sung {{in a conventional}} sense, particularly in hardcore styles. Shifts in pitch, volume, or intonational style are relatively infrequent. Punk rock's [...] "hoarse, rasping" [...] vocals and chanting were a {{sharp contrast to the}} [...] "melodic and sleeker" [...] singing in mainstream rock. Early punk vocals had an [...] "arrogant snarl". Complicated guitar solos are considered self-indulgent and unnecessary, although basic guitar breaks are common. Guitar parts tend to include highly distorted power chords or barre chords, creating a characteristic sound described by Christgau as a [...] "buzzsaw drone". Some punk rock bands take a surf rock approach with a lighter, twangier guitar tone. Others, such as Robert Quine, lead guitarist of the Voidoids, have employed a wild, [...] "gonzo" [...] attack, a style that stretches back through the Velvet Underground to the 1950s' recordings of Ike Turner. Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive [...] "forced rhythm", although some punk <b>rock</b> <b>bass</b> players—such as Mike Watt of the Minutemen and Firehose—emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a pick due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes fingerpicking impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up. Compared to other forms of rock, syncopation is much less the rule. Hardcore drumming tends to be especially fast. Production tends to be minimalistic, with tracks sometimes laid down on home tape recorders or simple four-track portastudios. The typical objective is to have the recording sound unmanipulated and real, reflecting the commitment and authenticity of a live performance.|$|E
