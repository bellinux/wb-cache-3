Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel.

She, however, continued to use the kind of rhetoric that Wells alleged incited lynching.

25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative that terrorists maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment is not new. In the 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear of the refugee out-group. Populist rhetoric then too propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E
25|$|The {{pedagogy}} of post-structuralism {{is marked}} by an attempt to redefine rhetoric {{as it relates to}} composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing {{can be seen as a}} metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act. Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.|$|E

500|$|<b>Rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> {{discussed}} in chapter 4.17 of Manasollasa. The text dedicates over 450 verses in chapter 4.18 {{to dance and}} describes types of dance forms, musical instruments that go with dance performances, and the occasions when dances were celebrated. The text discusses six types of performers, their characteristics and their roles — Nata (actor), Nartaka (dancer), Nartaki (danseuse), Vaitalika (bard), Charana (wandering performer) and Kollatika (acrobat). Their body movements (6 Anga, [...] 8 Upanga and 6 Pratyanga) are explained with their significance. This discussion {{is similar to that}} found in Natya Shastra, a Sanskrit text composed around 1st-century BCE. The text thereafter presents the 21 Sthanas and 26 Charis of the dance tradition.|$|E
500|$|Daoist <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> a {{component}} {{incorporated in the}} Art of War. According to Steven C. Combs in [...] "Sun-zi and the Art of War: The Rhetoric of Parsimony", [...] warfare is [...] "used {{as a metaphor for}} rhetoric, and that both are philosophically based arts." [...] Combs writes [...] "Warfare is analogous to persuasion, as a battle for hearts and minds." [...] The application of The Art of War strategies throughout history is attributed to its philosophical rhetoric. Daoism is the central principle in the Art of War. Combs compares ancient Daoist Chinese to traditional Aristotelian rhetoric, notably for the differences in persuasion. Daoist rhetoric in the art of war warfare strategies is described as [...] "peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech". This form of communication is parsimonious. Parsimonious behavior, which is highly emphasized in The Art of War as avoiding confrontation and being spiritual in nature, shapes basic principles in Daoism.|$|E
500|$|Irrespective of when Nagavarma II lived, it is {{accepted}} that few {{scholars in the}} history of Kannada literature made important contributions in as many subjects as he did. His writings on grammar, poetry, prosody, and vocabulary are standard authorities and their importance {{to the study of the}} Kannada language is well-acknowledged. Among his available writings, the historically important Kavyavalokana ("Treatise on the art of poetry") on grammar, poetics and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> considered path-breaking and contains all the essentials of Kannada grammar. The first section of the book is called Sabdasmriti and contains five chapters dealing with euphonic combinations, nouns, compounds, nominal derivatives and verbs respectively. It is based on earlier works by the Sanskrit grammarians Dandin and Bhamaha. The Karnataka Bhashabhushana, a consolidated and exhaustive Kannada grammar written by Nagavarma II in the Sanskrit language, follows the fundamental framework of the Katantra school of Sanskrit grammar. For his contribution to Kannada grammar, Nagavarma II earned the honorific Sarvavarma [...] the name of the noted Sanskrit grammarian of the Satavahana era. His Abhidana Vastukosa ("Treasury of significations"), a lexicon, gives Kannada equivalents of nearly eight thousand Sanskrit words and is considered an achievement which gave Kannada language considerable footing in the world of Sanskrit literary dominance. Modern Kannada poet Govinda Pai proposed that the author of Karnataka Bhashabhushana [...] was a different Nagavarma who belonged to the mid-12th century.|$|E

In this paper we are concerned only with the second of these arts, namely, the rhetoric of preaching.

This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants. Anti-immigrant <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> {{the only thing in}} common between the politics of these parties. More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric. Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth, and populists have ready material with which to work." [...] It postulated that a solution could lie with a [...] "traditional approach", which the UK-based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate, though it only solved a part of the problem in [...] "exposing the extremes of the populist parties". It added that more mainstream parties {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed [...] "positive and optimistic economic and political solutions" [...] rather than what it said was populist rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> {{the art of}} discourse, wherein {{a writer}} or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate {{particular}} audiences in specific situations. As a subject of formal study and a productive civic practice, rhetoric has {{played a central role}} in the European tradition. Its best known definition comes from Aristotle, who considers it a counterpart of both logic and politics, and calls it [...] "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion." [...] Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle's three persuasive audience appeals, logos, pathos, and ethos. The five canons of rhetoric, which trace the traditional tasks in designing a persuasive speech, were first codified in classical Rome: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Along with grammar and logic (or dialectic—see Martianus Capella), <b>rhetoric</b> <b>is</b> one of the three ancient arts of discourse.|$|E
