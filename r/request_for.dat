40|$|AbstractPurposeTo prospectively {{assess how}} to address <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ultrasonographic {{examinations}} when setting up an on-call teleradiology service. Materials and methodsAn analytical prospective study was performed from January 2012 to December 2012 inclusively. All <b>requests</b> received <b>for</b> after-hours ultrasonographic examinations during this period were analyzed. Ultrasound requests were classified as being postponable until working hours, replaceable by an alternate cross-sectional imaging modality, or urgent and needing to be performed after hours. ResultsA total of 176 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ultrasonographic examinations were analyzed. They predominantly included <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> abdominal and pelvic ultrasonographic examinations (63 %). Thirty-nine requests (22. 2 %) were considered as postponable, 49 (27. 8 %) as replaceable and 64 (36. 4 %) as both postponable and replaceable. Twenty-four requests (13. 6 %) were considered as urgent; they consisted of 10 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> venous duplex Doppler ultrasonographic examinations of the lower limbs, eight <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> testicular ultrasonographic examinations, five for pelvic ultrasonographic examinations and one for soft-tissue ultrasonographic examination. In these urgent cases, realistic options were either to transfer the patient to another institution or to train emergency department physicians in ultrasonography for local handling. ConclusionAlthough the need <b>for</b> addressing <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> ultrasonographic examinations {{should be taken into}} account when setting up an on-call teleradiology service, it should not impede such plans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This study {{examined}} the relationship between speech recognition, working memory and conversational skills in a group of 13 children/adolescents with cochlear implants (CIs) between 11 and 19 years of age. Conversational skills were assessed in a referential communication task where the participants interacted with a hearing peer of the same age and gender. The measures were the number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification produced, time used to solve the task and the proportion of the different types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification made by the participants with CIs. The results revealed that speech recognition correlated significantly with the general measures of conversational skills (time to solve the task and the total number of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification used). General working memory was associated with certain types of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> clarification. The participants with better working memory capacity used more <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation of new information (i. e. made more suggestions of their own) and fewer <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> confirmation of already given information compared to the participants with poorer working memory. It thus seems as if both speech recognition and working memory contribute to conversational skills but in different ways. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables. ...|$|R
