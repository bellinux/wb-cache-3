50|$|A {{polarizing}} / {{polarising filter}} is often {{placed in front}} of the camera lens in photography in order to darken skies, manage reflections, or suppress glare from the surface of lakes or the sea. Since reflections (and sky-light) tend to be at least partially linearly-polarized, a linear polarizer can be used to change the balance of the light in the photograph. The <b>rotational</b> <b>orientation</b> of the filter is adjusted for the preferred artistic effect. For modern cameras, a circular polarizer is typically used; this comprises firstly a linear polarizer which performs the artistic function just described, followed by a quarter-wave plate which further transforms the now-linearly polarized light into circularly-polarised light before entering the camera. This additional step avoids problems with auto-focus and light-metering sensors within some cameras, which otherwise may not function reliably with a simple linear polariser.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major feature}} of the Sixaxis controller, and from where its name is derived, {{is the ability to}} sense both <b>rotational</b> <b>orientation</b> and {{translational}} acceleration along all three-dimensional axes, providing six degrees of freedom. This became a matter of controversy, as the circumstances of the announcement, made less than eight months after Nintendo revealed motion-sensing capabilities in its new game console controller (see Wii Remote), led to speculation that the addition of motion-sensing was a late-stage decision by Sony to follow Nintendo's move. Further fueling the speculation was the fact that Warhawk was the only game shown at E3 that year which demonstrated the motion-sensing feature. [...] Also, some comments from Incognito Entertainment, the developer behind Warhawk, said that it received development controllers with the motion-sensing feature only 10 days or so before E3. Developer Brian Upton from SCE Studios Santa Monica later clarified that Incognito had been secretly working on the motion-sensing technology [...] "for a while", but was also withheld a working controller until [...] "the last few weeks before E3".|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{detecting}} the <b>rotational</b> <b>orientation</b> and tracking {{the position of}} an inductively coupled radio frequency (ICRF) coil using a transmit array system is proposed. The method employs a conventional body birdcage coil, but the quadrature hybrid is eliminated so that the two excitation channels can be used separately. The transmit array system provides RF excitations such that the body birdcage coil creates linearly polarized and changing RF pulses instead of a conventional rotational forward-polarized excitation. The receive coils and their operations are not modified. Inductively coupled RF coils are constructed on catheters for detecting <b>rotational</b> <b>orientation</b> and for tracking purposes.

Configurations which have the cage located within the dimer trench bonded to four dimers (t 4) and upon the dimer row bonded to two dimers (r 2) have been investigated, as these were found to be most stable for the C 60 molecule. It is found that the interactions between the surface and the C 82 molecule are weaker than for the corresponding configurations for C 60. The C 82 cage has a far lower symmetry than the C 60 cage and this gives many more unique <b>rotational</b> <b>orientations</b> of C 82 compared with C 60.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{nucleation}} {{and growth of}} Dy islands on the basal plane of graphite at 300 K using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT) {{in a form that}} includes van der Waals interactions, and analytic theory. The interaction of atomic Dy with graphite is strong, while the diffusion barrier is small. Experiment shows that at 300 K, the density of nucleated islands is close to the value predicted for homogeneous nucleation, using critical size of 1 and the DFT-derived diffusion barrier. Homogeneous nucleation is also supported by the monomodal shape of the island size distributions. Comparison with the published island density of Dy on graphene shows that the value is about two orders of magnitude smaller on graphite, which can be attributed to more effective charge screening in graphite. The base of each island is 3 atoms high and atomically ordered, forming a coincidence lattice with the graphite. Islands resist coalescence, probably due to multiple <b>rotational</b> <b>orientations</b> associated with the coincidence lattice. Upper levels grow as discernible single-atom layers.
