5|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Morales had {{supported}} calls for <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> for Bolivia's departments. As president, {{he changed his}} position, viewing the calls for autonomy – which came from Bolivia's four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as {{an attempt by the}} wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to preserve their economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy,</b> held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of autonomy, but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, autonomy activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary Departmental Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognise the legitimacy of right-wing departmental head Manfred Reyes Villa.|$|E

The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the March 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament. The new Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake tried to get ITAK's support for his minority government but refused to give into ITAK's demands to end state-sponsored colonisation of Tamil-majority areas by Sinhalese, <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> and the rights of Indian Tamils. As a result, ITAK started negotiations with the opposition SLFP who agreed to introduce the provisions of the B-C pact as bills in parliament. During the negotiations on forming an alternate stable government Chelvanayakam informed the Governor-General that ITAK would support a SLFP government for a full term and as result the Governor-General dissolved parliament.|$|E

5|$|The most traditionalist {{sectors of}} the {{political}} sphere systematically tried to prevent liberal reforms and to sustain the patrilineal monarchy. The Carlists – supporters of Infante Carlos and his descendants – fought to promote Spanish tradition and Catholicism against the liberalism of successive Spanish governments. The Carlists attempted to restore the historic liberties and broad <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> granted to the Basque Country and Catalonia by their fueros (regional charters). At times they allied with nationalists (separate from the National Faction {{during the civil war}} itself), including during the Carlist Wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, {{the area}} of modern-day Belgium was divided into two independently-governed polities, both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Austrian Netherlands, which {{included}} most of the territory of modern-day Belgium, had been in existence {{since the end of}} the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house. The traditional principalities, duchies and counties surviving from the Middle Ages retained great <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little, as its neighboring states imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch. Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie, most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative. The Catholic church was particularly influential, despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power.|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} his caricature-like nature, Mitică survived in common {{reference}} beyond Caragiale's age. The character was portrayed by several actors, and most notably by Ştefan Iordache in the film De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?. In contemporary Romanian, his name {{was turned into a}} common noun, and often pluralized under the form mitici. During and after the 1990s, the terms surfaced in polemics surrounding Romania's centralism and the alternative projects for Transylvania's <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy.</b> In this context, it was used in reference to administrators from Bucharest or the Old Kingdom. In parallel, the term was adapted into a stereotype of modern Bucharesters and inhabitants of other regions over the Southern Carpathians, who are often portrayed as belonging to the Balkans, as opposed to the Central European traditions of Transylvania. Under these definitions, Mitică and mitici were notably present in essays authored by the Transylvanian activist Sabin Gherman.|$|E

3000|$|From the {{fundamental}} theory of a superstructure and an economic base, Xi elucidated {{the need to}} improve the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System. The superstructure and the expression of its superiority rely on the support of the economic base. Xi has pointed out that, “the key to implementing the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System lies in helping these autonomous regions develop their economy and improve their people’s livelihoods.” Otherwise, that autonomy would only be an empty promise. “If the disparities {{in the development of the}} autonomous regions continue to follow this general trend in the long term, without reaching a radical turning point, this will cause psychological instability, even leading to an imbalance in ethnic and regional relations.” Thus, improving people’s livelihoods (with an emphasis on employment and education), developing the resource advantage of ethnic regions (centered on benefiting local regions and securing ecological protection), alleviating poverty through development (in destitute areas) and reinforcing the development of border areas (focusing on infrastructure and the opening of those regions to the outside world) have become focal points for the implementation of the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System. This starts from the reality of accelerating national development through diversified policies in order to uphold and improve the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System and the necessary process of establishing solid social, welfare and economic bases. At the same time, from the strategic perspective of the comprehensive rule of law, Xi has highlighted the duty to “deepen research on the legislation and systems relevant to the regulation and improvement of Regional Ethnic Autonomy,” and “effectively implement the rules of the Constitution and of the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> Law.” [...]...|$|R

5|$|Parties in {{opposition}} to Alcalá-Zamora's government gained {{the support of the}} church and the military. The head of the church in Spain, Cardinal Pedro Segura, was particularly vocal in his disapproval. Until the 20th century, the Catholic Church had proved an essential part of Spain's character, although it had internal problems. Segura was expelled from Spain in June 1931. This prompted an outcry from the Catholic right, who cited oppression. A series of church-burning incidents occurred in major Spanish cities throughout May 1931. When the government refused to call out the Guardia Civil, Minister for War Manuel Azaña came under heavy criticism from the rightist press. The military were opposed to reorganisation, including an increase in <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> granted by the central government, and reforms to improve efficiency were seen as a direct attack. Officers were retired and a thousand had their promotions reviewed, including Francisco Franco, who served as director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, which was closed by Manuel Azaña.|$|E
5|$|Socio-economic {{problems}} of the region {{that had not been}} addressed during British Raj continued to linger and were reflected in a representation made to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1947, which highlighted the issues of <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> and Nepali nationality in Darjeeling and adjacent areas. After the independence of India in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with the state of West Bengal. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the Partition of India. A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the Nepali language; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{top five}} {{conglomerates}} in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased <b>regional</b> <b>autonomy</b> allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E

30|$|When {{discussing}} {{the issue of}} socialism with Chinese characteristics, Xi emphasized that, “a nation must know itself, it must know where it came from, where it must go, it must think clearly and correctly, and it must stride unwaveringly towards its ultimate goal.” 5 (Jinping 2014 a, 2014 b, 2014 c, 2014 d) ‘Thinking clearly and correctly’ is how the CPC intends to approach various ethnic affairs, while adhering to and perfecting the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System is the only option for ‘[striding] unwaveringly towards its ultimate goal.’ All our ethnic national policies stem from and rely on the <b>Regional</b> Ethnic <b>Autonomy</b> System.
