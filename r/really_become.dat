The U.S. embassy was officially opened on 11 December 2006. Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela also have embassies in Belmopan, while Ecuador, Chile, and the Dominican Republic are represented by consulates. However, with four embassies and 29 consulates the former capital of Belize City still has most of the country's foreign diplomatic community.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of 2002, Nina {{released}} her debut album under Warner Music, entitled Heaven, alongside her first single of the same title. The album is inspired by contemporary R and pop music, and it was well received by critics, with The Philippine Star stating [...] "Heaven is quite a package. Production is sleek and Nina’s delivery, smooth [...] it is never heavy nor frenetic. It is instead used as a stable base for Nina’s sweet but definitely multi-octave singing voice. This is surely her strongest point and it is really a blessing to know that she can skillfully wield her vocals to conform to the demands of every song." [...] The lead single, [...] "Heaven", did not <b>really</b> <b>become</b> a commercial hit despite peaking inside the top ten of Philippine charts.

60|$|Answer.--First. That Christ was not {{a sinner}} personally, by acts or doings of his own, is granted; and in this sense {{it is true that}} God did never suppose him to be a sinner, nor punished him as such a sinner, nor did he really, if by really you {{understand}} naturally, become our sin, nor did God ever repute him so. Second. But that Christ stood before God in our sins, and that God did not only suppose him so to stand, but set him in them, put them upon him, and counted them as his own, is so true that he cannot at present be a Christian that denies it--'The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all' (Isa 53:6; 1 Peter 2:22). Third. So, then, though God did not punish him for sin of his own committing, yet he punished him for sin of our committing--'The just suffered for the unjust' (1 Peter 3:18). Fourth. Therefore it is true, that though Christ did never <b>really</b> <b>become</b> sin of his own, he did <b>really</b> <b>become</b> our sin, did <b>really</b> <b>become</b> our curse for sin. If this be denied, it follows that he became our sin but feignedly, that he was made our curse, or a curse for us but in appearance, show, or in dissimulation; but no such action or work can proceed of the Lord. He did then really lay our sin and his curse upon him for our sin.|$|E
