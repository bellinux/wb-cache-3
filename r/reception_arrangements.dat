When George IV visited Edinburgh in August 1822, Stewart helped Sir Walter Scott in the <b>reception</b> <b>arrangements,</b> headed the Celtic club in the procession, adjusted the royal plaid for the levée, and pronounced the king ‘a vera pretty man’ (Lockhart). He was promoted to major-general on 27 May 1825, and in 1829 he went moved to Saint Lucia as governor. The island was then very unhealthy, and on 18 Dec. he died there, widely regretted.|$|E
50|$|Between August and November 2003, 1,738 unaccompanied {{children}} {{arrived from}} non-EU countries. Most {{of these were}} travelling legitimately for education or holidays but {{a small number of}} children gave 'grave cause for concern' and police were subsequently unable to locate 12 of the children.IS at Heathrow Airport led the way in the UK in setting up sensitive and sophisticated <b>reception</b> <b>arrangements</b> for children and developed facilities and training to identify children at risk. A programme of specialist training for immigration officers in dealing with children at risk resulted in 495 immigration officers being trained in interviewing children by 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Finn has {{not been}} in touch with Rachel or Kurt all summer and into the fall—the two friends are now rooming {{together}} in Brooklyn while Rachel is attending NYADA—but he reappears unexpectedly {{at the end of the}} third episode. He has been given an early discharge from the army after injuring himself. He finds out she kissed Brody (Dean Geyer), a NYADA junior, and feels that he doesn't belong in her world in New York, so he returns to Lima without telling her. She then breaks up with him. In Lima, Finn is working at Burt's tire shop again, and Artie enlists his help to co-direct the school musical, Grease, which had been Finn's suggestion. When Rachel comes to see the musical in the [...] "Glease" [...] episode, their reunion does not go well, and they agree to refrain from contact when Rachel visits Lima in the future. Will takes a leave of absence from McKinley to be a member of a blue-ribbon panel in Washington, DC, so starting in [...] "Dynamic Duets", Finn becomes the interim director of New Directions. While he has a rocky start in the position, they come to accept him as their leader. At Sectionals, the glee club loses to the Warblers after Marley (Melissa Benoist) passes out on stage, interrupting the performance. Afterward, Finn does what he can to keep the club together and finally succeeds despite Sue's opposition—she has deprived New Directions of rehearsal space at school. The Warblers are disqualified, and New Directions is again eligible to compete in Regionals; the choir room is returned to them. Finn enlists Emma, who is deep in wedding preparations in advance of Will's return, to help him judge a glee club competition for which member is the best diva. When he finds her panicking over the <b>reception</b> <b>arrangements,</b> he kisses her. In [...] "I Do", when Emma flees the church the day of the wedding, Finn blames himself, but Rachel sets him straight, and he and Rachel sleep with each other post-reception. In [...] "Girls (and Boys) On Film", Finn teams up with Artie to help find Emma for Will; he later confesses to Will that he kissed Emma, and Will is unable to forgive him. Since working with Will is untenable, Finn leaves New Directions though he enjoyed directing them; Marley tells him he's a good teacher, and he should get a teaching degree. He goes to college, where he shares a dorm room with Puck—who isn't actually attending the school. Will later asks Finn to return to co-lead New Directions, and he agrees. Meanwhile, Santana has discovered that Brody, who is now living with Rachel, is a gigolo, and tells Finn, who flies to New York and warns Brody away, ultimately beating him up and saying, [...] "Stay away from my future wife." [...] When Rachel finds out and breaks up with Brody, she admits that the relationship never would have worked because she was using it to try to get over her heartache about Finn. Rachel later thanks him for his intervention in [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] when she calls him to get advice for choosing an audition song for the upcoming Broadway revival of Funny Girl.|$|E

50|$|A Wedding , (Shaadi) is {{when the}} bride's {{reception}} formally takes place. The event {{takes place at the}} bride's house where large wedding tents may be set up in the garden or a nearby place. It has also become very common to hold the event in a marriage hall or hotel.

30|$|Nevertheless, the {{principles}} of temporary protection are such that Turkey will maintain an open border policy’ for all Syrians, and it will respect their non-refoulement on condition that they register with the Turkish authorities. The policy includes renewable but unlimited stay, protection against forcible returns, and access to <b>reception</b> <b>arrangements</b> where immediate needs are addressed. Yet, temporary protection precludes any right for permanent residence and, ultimately, citizenship. Therefore, while the state {{has been willing to}} extend some security and protection to Syrians, it is still reticent to guarantee their permanence in and integration with Turkish society. In practice, temporary protection means the provision of services to those in camps, but a lack of similar protection to those outside the camps. At the time of writing (early summer 2015), assistance to non-camp refugees has been ad hoc and delegated to local actors such as NGOS or local governments, with the notable exception of the state guaranteeing their continuous access to public medical healthcare. Outside the camps, Syrians of school age with residence permits can enrol in public schools or attend informal schools taught in Arabic and run by volunteer Syrian teachers and supported by local authorities or NGOs (UNHCR, n.d.). However, given their swelling numbers, finding teaching facilities has been problematic. Regarding access to employment, {{at the time of the}} interviews in winter 2014, the Turkish Ministry of Labour indicated that, with temporary protection, there also came renewable one-year work permits. 1 However, there is as yet no systematic analysis of the Syrians’ uptake of work permits.|$|E
