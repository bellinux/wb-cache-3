We say that an approximation algorithm has <b>recoverable</b> <b>value</b> ρ, if for every graph it recovers an independent set of size at least _I ∑_v∈ I[1,ρ/(d(v) + 1) ], where d(v) is the degree of vertex v, and I ranges over all independent sets in G. Hence, in a sense, from every vertex v in the maximum independent set the algorithm recovers a value of at least ρ/(d_v + 1) towards the solution. This quality measure is most effective in graphs in which the maximum independent set is composed of low degree vertices. It easily follows from known results that some simple algorithms for MIS ensure ρ> 1. We design a new randomized algorithm for MIS that ensures an expected <b>recoverable</b> <b>value</b> of at least ρ> 7 / 3.

Ceramic membranes with pore size between 4 and 50 nm were selected to purify the high-temperature {{condensed water}}. The effects of operating parameters and membrane structure on the separation performance were investigated. Continuous concentration experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of volume concentration factor (VCF) on membrane permeability. Results The membrane exhibited high rejection of iron ions and oil. With increase of iron ions concentration, the permeate flux gradually decreased but the oil rejection increased. Oil concentration had no {{significant effect on the}} rejections of iron ions and oil. However, the permeate flux decreased with oil concentration owing to the formation of a thick fouling layer on the membrane surface. In the continuous concentration process, removal efficiencies of iron ion and oil were more than 99 %, and the turbidity and oil concentration in permeate were less than 0. 5 NTU and 0. 5 mg L− 1, respectively. The iron ion concentration in permeate was less than 0. 3 mg L− 1. These results meet the standards for boiler feedwater.

40|$|The <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Value</b> cane {{payment system}} {{and length of}} milling season {{controls}} were introduced in SIA 2000 as an incentive to growers to improve cane quality. In addition to these controls, the effects of seasonal cane quality, scheduling of non-rateable deliveries and cane quality differences between different homogenous regions within mill areas {{need to be considered}} to maximise mill area productivity (i. e. maximise cane quality) and mill capacity utilisation (i. e. minimise no cane stops) in terms of cane delivery timing. This paper examines incentives within the current institutional framework surrounding cane supply and attempts to identify and correct existing delivery inefficiencies. The solution comprises a penalty allocation mechanism, which can be fully automated and incorporated into the Laboratory Information Management System, both of which are flexible and can accommodate specific circumstances at the different mill centres. The mechanism comprises delivery window periods such that the timing of deliveries can be traded, which encourages selective harvesting of the best quality cane available. This should enhance the profitability of mill areas and the South African sugar industry as a whole. It also creates an incentive for growers to collectively reduce the impacts of accidental fires by informally exchanging delivery timings. The increased accountability for deliveries enables Local Area Agreement penalties to be apportioned amongst those individuals responsible. Penalties raised could also be used by the Local Grower Council to create an ‘income stabilising fund ’ for its grower constituency.

40|$|The South African sugar {{industry}} has recently {{moved from a}} cane payment scheme based on the sucrose content of cane to one based upon the concept of <b>recoverable</b> <b>value</b> (RV), which is itself a modification of the estimated recoverable crystal (ERC) quantity as originally presented by van Hengel (1974). While the definitions of ERC and RV attempt to discount the effect of cane quality on factory performance, it has been acknowledged that some important factors, such as {{the quality of the}} non-sucrose fraction in the cane (as typically represented by the reducing sugar to ash ratio), are not effectively accounted for. An additional limitation of the new RV system lies in the lumping together of cane evaluation and payment terms into one concept, which can result in the measured value recovery (VR) of a sugar mill varying from month to month as a result of changes in the relative prices of raw sugar and molasses, even if the actual performance of the mill has remained constant. Thus, while value recovery properly represents the financial outcome of mill operations, it is not an effective tool for the evaluation of the process performance of mill operations. The concept of crystal recovery efficiency is proposed as a new factory performance yardstick which allows for the optimal evaluation of mill performance independent of cane quality factors. The use of the new measure is outlined and factory data for all South African mills is presented, highlighting the variation of the crystal recovery efficiency during the season and from year to year...|$|E

The effect on physical aging {{of the content of}} silica particles has been investigated in detail varying it over a wide range. Our results indicate accelerated physical aging in the nanocomposites in comparison to the corresponding pure polymer. Furthermore the acceleration is generally more pronounced in nanocomposites presenting a high silica content. This result cannot be attributed to a difference in molecular mobility of the polymers in the nanocomposites in comparison to pure PMMA and PS, since broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) indicates no effect of silica nanoparticles on the polymer segmental dynamics. Moreover, calorimetric measurements reveal a reduction of the heat capacity jump at T g for the nanocomposites, as well as lower experimentally <b>recoverable</b> enthalpy <b>values.</b> This may result from the faster non-isothermal evolution of the glass state when cooling down the samples from their liquid state. To account for these experimental results the acceleration of physical aging has been rationalized in the framework of the diffusion of free volume holes model as previously proposed.

40|$|Cane {{payment is}} a {{sensitive}} issue and is seldom debated and {{documented in the}} public domain. As a result, misunderstandings arise over time. In the South African sugar industry, much confusion has arising between relative cane payment and the <b>Recoverable</b> <b>Value</b> (RV) cane payment. The objective {{of this paper is}} to clarify these terms and to revisit the appropriateness of the current relative cane payment approach. Multiplicative relative payment is the preferred approach because it creates a clear incentive for each and every grower to deliver cane with the highest possible RV % relative to the mill weekly average RV % and thereby optimises the mill weekly average RV%. Consequently, the current additive relative payment approach should be replaced with the multiplicative relative payment approach. However, both millers and growers are ‘blinded ’ to the consequences of the rapid drop off in RV % at the beginning and ends of the season as a result of relative payment. This can be overcome if both millers and growers collectively agree to a defined season length in their mill area during which multiplicative relative payment shall apply. The penalty for poor delivery performance post the defined season length is payment on actual RV%. This system can be accommodated within the ambit of existing Mill Group Board policies and procedures. Essentially it sharpens the incentive for growers to collectively ensure that no-cane stops are minimised and milling capacity and harvesting equipment are optimised.

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to add to the literature by analysing how leasing provides a more attractive option than selling and extended producer responsibility (EPR) in helping to close product life-cycle loops, extend the useful life of products, and increase environmental benefits. Design/methodology/approach – This paper revisits the accounting concepts of asset depreciation, residual value and cost of leasing and proposes methods to incorporate these concepts into the “closed loop” lease and service mode for product life-cycle management. Findings – For business, the “closed loop” lease and service mode changes asset values through the extension of the asset's useful life and in particular, the increase of the residual value of the product (i. e. <b>recoverable</b> <b>value</b> to the producer/lessor). Such changes reduce the cost of leasing to the advantage of both lessor and lessee. However, the argument about a “win-win” monetary and environmental outcome being associated with leasing presents several challenges for current accounting standards in terms of recognition of lease and lease revenue, recognition of intangible assets and internalisation of environmental costs and impacts associated with the leasing process. Originality/value – To date, accounting and finance literature seems to focus exclusively on the economic aspects of leasing strategies. This paper uses a different lens to make a call for a rethink about leasing with environmental considerations. It is expected that the findings and suggestions in this study will facilitate the adoption and diffusion of the “closed loop” lease and service mode in the business world for the benefit of the environment in the future.

40|$|The growing {{market for}} {{lithium-ion}} batteries raises concerns about sustainable management of those batteries {{at end of}} life. Launching relevant policies requires a comprehensive understanding of potential economic values as well as environmental performance of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. However, both recyclers and policymakers are facing a number of unanswered questions, including 1) how battery technology trajectory would affect the incentives for recycling? 2) what strategies are available to improve material recovery efficiency? and 3) what {{is the potential for}} nanoparticle release during end-of-life processing, particularly for next-generation lithium-ion batteries who contain nano-scale cathode materials? This dissertation aims to fill these research gaps. Multi-criteria optimization modeling and fundamental material characterization methods were used to quantify environmental and economic trade-offs for end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. Results show that potential material recovery values decrease as battery cathode chemistry transitions to low-cost cathode materials, as a majority of potentially <b>recoverable</b> <b>value</b> resides in the base metals contained in the cathode. Cathode changes over time will result in a heavily co-mingled waste stream, further complicating waste management and recycling processes. An optimization model was developed to analyze the economic feasibility of recycling facilities under possible scenarios of waste stream volume and composition. Sensitivity analysis shows that the profitability is highly dependent on the expected mix of cathode chemistries in the waste stream and resultant variability in material mass and value. Estimated current collection rate of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries turned out to be extremely low, indicating more opportunities and higher profitability for local recycling facilities if this rate can be improved. Aiming to achieve segregation of high value metallic materials in lithium-ion batteries, a pre-recycling process, including mechanical shredding and size-based sorting steps, which can be easily scaled up to the industrial level, has been proposed. Sorting results show that contained metallic materials can be effectively segregated into size fractions at different levels. In addition, using this pre-recycling process as a case study, the nanoparticle exposure potential during mechanical processing has been proactively investigated by using both traditional and nano-enabled lithium-ion batteries. Results show that a substantial amount of nanoparticles released during the mechanical shredding but not the size-based sorting process. Additionally, shredding nano-scale LiFePO 4 cathode batteries may have a higher potential for nanoparticle exposure. Facing the rapidly growing volume of spent lithium-ion batteries, the results suggest policy or other incentives may be necessary to promote a robust collection and recycling infrastructure as the economic incentives will likely decrease as the chemistry transitions away from cobalt-based cathodes. This dissertation also demonstrates the importance of implementing a battery labeling system as recyclers will likely face a co-mingled waste stream. Specifying recycling-relevant information would increase the effectiveness of the pre-recycling system...|$|E
40|$|Assessment {{is one of}} {{the most}} debated areas in accountancy, since the choice of {{valuation}} procedures, methods directly influence an entity’s financial situation, alterations and performance. The applications of International Financial Reporting Standards are mandatory for quoted companies in the EU since 2005. In my study/paper I deal with a specifically treated area of accountancy, the regulation of goodwill’sevaluationin the IFRS system. Since this area is jointly regulated by several standards, my goal is to provide a comprehensive view of standards regarding the evaluation of goodwill, their consistency paying particular attention to the hypothetical approaches and evaluation philosophy of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets standard. Since goodwill acquired in a business combination does not represent independent cash flow from other asset and group of asset, therefore its valuation requires specific accounting treatment. Standards determine the concept, the criteria for recognizing, the rules applied in initial measurement of goodwill, and later the limits of the impairment to be recognised derived from the subsequent period’sprice reduction of the goodwill and the related tax effects. My thesis detailsa specific set of concepts, which is connected to the determination of thegoodwill’s value. Itincludesthe concepts of cash generating unit, <b>recoverable</b> amount, <b>value</b> in use and fair value less costs to sell. I give full details about impairment test, as a particular evaluation procedure, I introduce the internal and external source of information, which show evidence that the asset may be impaired, I also consider deferred tax effects resulted from the evaluation of goodwill and the identification of effects influencing the performance of the entity. Subsequently, I introduce the specific regulation of the goodwill’s evaluation with the help of corporate examples. Having analysed the IFRS reportsof three multinational companies, with different businessactivities, quoted in Budapest Stock Exchange I describe the corporate regulation in connection with the goodwill’sevaluation, the effects of the factors applied in the impairment test and the scenario analysis made by enterprises. Due to the characteristics of goodwill’sevaluation, it is a complex and complicated accounting procedure, which is considerably based on the estimations of the management, which comprises considerable uncertainty. Having used the financial data of the selected entities operating in different areas, I demonstrate what kind of specific indicators are used to determine the value of their cash generating units and which risks are being considered during the estimations...|$|R
