25|$|SulA/FtsZ {{mediated}} filamentation: This is {{a mechanism}} to halt cell division and repair DNA. In the presence of single-stranded DNA regions, due to the action of different external cues (that induce mutations), the major bacterial recombinase (RecA) binds to this DNA regions and is activated {{by the presence of}} free nucleotide triphosphates. This activated RecA stimulates the autoproteolysis of the SOS transcriptional repressor LexA. The LexA <b>regulon</b> includes a cell division inhibitor, SulA, that prevent the transmission of mutant DNA to the daughter cells. SulA is a dimer that binds FtsZ (a tubulin-like GTPase) in a 1:1 ratio and acts specifically on its polymerization which results in the formation of non-septated bacteria filaments. A similar mechanism may occur in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,which also elongates after being phagocytized.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: To {{study the}} {{regulation}} of transcription, {{it is important to}} identify coregulated genes (<b>regulons).</b> One {{way to do that is}} to cluster similar potential regulatory signals found by various experimental or computational techniques, for instance, phylogenetic footprinting. This strategy does not require a priori information about gene coregulation and reports new potential components for known <b>regulons.</b> In addition, clustering may reveal new, currently unknown potential <b>regulons.</b> Such data are of particular importance for poorly annotated genomes. Results: We have developed a computer tool for automatic detection of co-regulated genes. It implements the phylogenetic footprinting technique to find potential regulatory signals and uses the clustering procedure to identify potential <b>regulons.</b> The tool is intended for the analysis of sufficiently closely related bacterial genomes.

We applied the comparative genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict Web server combined with SEED subsystem analysis and available information on known regulatory interactions for regulatory network reconstruction for the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and six related species from the family Staphylococcaceae. The resulting reference set of 46 transcription factor <b>regulons</b> contains more than 1, 900 binding sites and 2, 800 target genes involved in the central metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids; respiration; the stress response; metal homeostasis; drug and metal resistance; and virulence. The inferred regulatory network in S. aureus includes ∼ 320 regulatory interactions between 46 transcription factors and ∼ 550 candidate target genes comprising 20 % of its genome. We predicted ∼ 170 novel interactions and 24 novel <b>regulons</b> for the control of the central metabolic pathways in S. aureus.

50|$|Cysteine {{is a very}} {{important}} molecule for a bacterium’s survival. This amino acid harbors a sulfur atom and can actively participate in disulfide bond formation. The genes required for the synthesis of cysteine are coded for on the cys <b>regulon.</b> The integration of sulfur into the molecule is positively regulated by CysB. CysB is the main focus of cysteine regulation. Effective inducers of this <b>regulon</b> are N-acetyl-serine (NAS) and very small amounts of reduced sulfur. CysB functions by binding to DNA half sites on the cys <b>regulon.</b> These half sites differ in quantity and arrangement depending on the promoter of interest. There is however one half site that is conserved. It lies just upstream of the -35 site of the promoter. There are also multiple accessory sites depending on the promoter. In the absence of the inducer, NAS, CysB will bind the DNA and cover many of the accessory half sites. Without the accessory half sites the <b>regulon</b> cannot be transcribed and cysteine will not be produced. It is believed that the presence of NAS causes CysB to undergo a conformational change. This conformational change allows CysB to bind properly to all the half sites and causes the recruitment of the RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase will then transcribe the cys <b>regulon</b> and cysteine will be produced.|$|E

We identified 36 overlapping <b>regulons</b> that were enriched for risk loci and formed a distinct cluster within the network, suggesting shared biology.

The influence of certain non-digestible carbohydrates (and their use as so-called prebiotics) on growth and metabolic activity of bifidobacteria is of increasing interest; however, mechanisms of transcriptional control of carbohydrate metabolism are poorly understood in these species. We used a comparative genomics approach to reconstruct carbohydrate utilization pathways and transcriptional <b>regulons</b> in 10 Bifidobacterium genomes. Analysis of regulatory gene regions revealed candidate DNA motifs and reconstructed <b>regulons</b> for 268 transcription factors from the LacI, ROK, DeoR, AraC, GntR and TetR families that form 64 orthologous groups of regulators. Most of the reconstructed <b>regulons</b> are local and control specific catabolic pathways for host- and diet-derived glycans and monosaccharides. Mosaic distributions of many of these local regulators across Bifidobacterium species correlate with distribution of corresponding catabolic pathways.

40|$|Abstract Background Cyclic AMP {{receptor}} protein (CRP), {{also known}} as {{catabolite gene activator protein}} (CAP), is an important transcriptional regulator widely distributed in many bacteria. The biological processes under the regulation of CRP are highly diverse among different groups of bacterial species. Elucidation of CRP <b>regulons</b> in cyanobacteria will further our understanding of the physiology and ecology of this important group of microorganisms. Previously, CRP has been experimentally studied in only two cyanobacterial strains: Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120; therefore, a systematic genome-scale study of the potential CRP target genes and binding sites in cyanobacterial genomes is urgently needed. Results We have predicted and analyzed the CRP binding sites and <b>regulons</b> in 12 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes using a highly effective cis -regulatory binding site scanning algorithm. Our results show that cyanobacterial CRP binding sites are very similar to those in E. coli; however, the <b>regulons</b> are very different from that of E. coli. Furthermore, CRP <b>regulons</b> in different cyanobacterial species/ecotypes are also highly diversified, ranging from photosynthesis, carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation, to chemotaxis and signal transduction. In addition, our prediction indicates that crp genes in modern cyanobacteria are likely inherited from a common ancestral gene in their last common ancestor, and have adapted various cellular functions in different environments, while some cyanobacteria lost their crp genes as well as CRP binding sites during the course of evolution. Conclusion The CRP <b>regulons</b> in cyanobacteria are highly diversified, probably as a result of divergent evolution to adapt to various ecological niches. Cyanobacterial CRPs may function as lineage-specific regulators participating in various cellular processes, and are important in some lineages. However, they are dispensable in some other lineages. The loss of CRPs in these species leads to the rapid loss of their binding sites in the genomes. </p...|$|R

Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing structures {{often found in}} bacterial mRNA leaders controlling gene expression on transcriptional or translational levels. An increasing number of riboswitches and other cis-regulatory RNAs have been recently classified into numerous RNA families in the Rfam database. High conservation of these RNA motifs provides a unique advantage for their genomic identification and comparative analysis. 				 				 					 						Results 					A {{comparative genomics}} approach implemented in the RegPredict tool was used for reconstruction and functional annotation of <b>regulons</b> controlled by RNAs from 43 Rfam families in diverse taxonomic groups of Bacteria. The inferred <b>regulons</b> include ~ 5200 cis-regulatory RNAs and more than 12000 target genes in 255 microbial genomes. All predicted RNA-regulated genes were classified into specific and overall functional categories. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of these categories allowed us to establish major functional preferences for each analyzed cis-regulatory RNA motif family. Overall, most RNA motif <b>regulons</b> showed predictable functional content {{in accordance with their}} experimentally established effector ligands. Our results suggest that some RNA motifs (including thiamin pyrophosphate and cobalamin riboswitches that control the cofactor metabolism) are widespread and likely originated from the last common ancestor of all bacteria. However, many more analyzed RNA motifs are restricted to a narrow taxonomic group of bacteria and likely represent more recent evolutionary innovations. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The reconstructed regulatory networks for major known RNA motifs substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in bacteria.

40|$|Background: Genome scale {{annotation}} {{of regulatory}} interactions and reconstruction of regulatory networks are the crucial problems in bacterial genomics.

The algorithm internally determines the number of clusters from the data and assigns significance to the resulting clusters. We place theoretical limits on the ability of any algorithm to correctly cluster sequences drawn from WMs when these WMs are unknown. Our analysis suggests that the set of all putative sites for a single genome (e. g., Escherichia coli) is largely inadequate for clustering.
