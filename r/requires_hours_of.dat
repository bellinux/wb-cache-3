It is composed of seven different cadences strung together (in series) in march tempo. Each cadence has a unique set of maneuvers specific to each section—the tubas, for example, will have horn flashes during one cadence, while the trumpets will perform different horn flashes during another. The Series is extremely intricate and <b>requires</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> practice (in addition to regular pre-season rehearsals) by new members to memorize their section's moves. It uses a full high step throughout (with the exception of the drumline and the color guard), and combined with the intricacy of the upper body movements and vocals, is one of the most physically demanding and uniquely recognizable trademarks of the SMB. This is the cadence used as the band marches to Spartan Stadium each game day. Thousands of fans line the Kalamazoo Street bridge to cheer on the band as they march to the stadium.|$|E

5000|$|Women's motocross is full {{of people}} who have a no quit mentality and are often heard saying things like [...] " [...] I won't quit until I am {{physically}} unable to ride". These mentalities are what keeps the sport alive and well, without them it would have died long ago. Women's motocross is a sport that requires dedication and constant work, so the people who are involved in it, both the riders and the teams, have to be mentally strong. In order to make this sport a success women had to put in hard work and be mentally strong, they heard the word no more times than most but kept going. Having a strong mentality is what allows women's sports at the professional level to be a success. Much like the male counterpart, professional women's racing <b>requires</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> training in order to be on top. This league {{is full of}} only the best riders and the most successful women, so without the mental aspect, these women {{would not be able to}} compete in the league. The biological level of mental toughness plays a large role in the success of this sport, women who have had parents who did not allow them to quit and who pushed them harder than they though they could be pushed often came out on top because they were trained not to quit. There are physiological reasons that some athletes possess the ability to be best, the way that their mind functions and the hormonal excretions in their body allow them to push themselves hard and longer than the regular person. It was in their mind and heart to be the best, much like every other athlete, how a competitor does their job says a lot about who they are as a person, and how far they are willing to go in order to win.|$|E

40|$|Whole brain {{segmentation}} from structural {{magnetic resonance}} imaging {{is a prerequisite for}} most morphological analyses, but <b>requires</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> processing time and therefore delays the availability of image markers after scan acquisition. We introduce QuickNAT, a fully convolution neural network that segments a brain scan in 20 seconds. To enable training of the complex network with limited annotated data, we propose to pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation software and to subsequently fine-tune on manual labels. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods, while being about 700 times faster. This drastic speed up greatly facilitates the processing of large data repositories and supports the translation of imaging biomarkers by making them almost instantaneously available.

40|$|Model misspecification has {{significant}} impacts on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates. This paper discusses the four most widely-used approaches to guide variable specification in DEA. We analyze Efficiency Contribution Measure (ECM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA-DEA), a regression-based test, and bootstrapping for variable selection via Monte Carlo simulations to determine each approach’s advantages and disadvantages. For a three input, one output production process, we find that: PCA-DEA performs well with highly correlated inputs (greater than 0. 8) {{and even for}} small data sets (less than 300 observations); both the regression and ECM approaches perform well under low correlation (less than 0. 2) and relatively larger data sets (at least 300 observations); and bootstrapping performs relatively poorly.

Another statistical algorithm, logistic regression, is second with respect to the two accuracy criteria. The most accurate decision tree algorithm is Quest with linear splits, which ranks fourth and fth, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the colour}} coded {{environment}} of the RoboCup 4 Legged League {{it is crucial to}} extract as much colour information as possible from an image without error. To do this <b>requires</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> manual YUV pixel mapping and testing to ensure robustness under all possible lighting conditions. The YUV colour space is a very convenient standard for transmission of video data, but for colour classification and segmentation it suffers from being non-intuitive and sensitive to changes in lighting. Alternatively, colour classification principles can be applied in an HSI colour space; one of the convenient characteristics of the HSI colour space is that the hue value, H, represents the colour wavelength information. From this concept it is easier to separate and label colour regions in an automated process as the theoretical hue and colour wavelength relationship is known. By fitting a Gaussian model using mixtures to HSI histograms we can generate boundaries of colour classes in HSI colour space. ...|$|E

To reduce the computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations, direct computer calculations can be replaced with inexpensive Response Surface (RS) models. This work investigates the use of RS models in Monte Carlo analysis of complex masonry buildings with random input parameters. The accuracy of the estimated RS models, as well as the good estimations of the collapse load cumulative distributions obtained via polynomial RS models, show how the proposed approach could be a useful tool in problems of technical interest...|$|E

40|$|A web-based {{software}} model ([URL] {{was developed}} {{as an example}} for classification of aphasia using neural networks. Two multilayer perceptrons were used to classify the type of aphasia (Broca, Wernicke, anomic, global) according to the results in some subtests of the Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT). First a coarse classification was achieved by using an assessment of spontaneous speech of the patient. This classifier produced correct results in 87 % of the test cases. For a second test, data analysis tools were used to select four features out of the 30 available test features to yield a more accurate diagnosis. This second classifier produced correct results in 92 % of the test cases. This test requires four AAT scores as input for the multilayer perceptron.
