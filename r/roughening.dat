40|$|The Drosophila rotund gene is {{required}} in the wings, antenna, haltere, proboscis and legs. A member of the Rac family of GTPases, denoted the rotund racGAP gene, was previously identified in the rotund region. However, previous studies indicated that rotund racGAP was {{not responsible for the}} rotund phenotypes and that the rotund gene had yet to be identified. We have isolated the rotund gene and show that it {{is a member of the}} Krppel family of zinc finger genes. The adjacent <b>roughened</b> eye locus specifically affects the eye and is genetically separable from rotund. However, <b>roughened</b> eye and rotund are tightly linked, and we have therefore also isolated the <b>roughened</b> eye transcript. Intriguingly, we show that <b>roughened</b> eye is part of the rotund gene but is represented by a different transcript. The rotund and <b>roughened</b> eye transcripts result from the utilization of two different promoters that direct expression in non-overlapping domains in the larval imaginal discs. The predicted Rotund and <b>Roughened</b> Eye proteins share the same C-terminal region, including the zinc finger domain, but differ in their N-terminal regions. Each cDNA can rescue only the corresponding mutation and show negative effects when expressed in each others domain of expression. These results indicate that in addition to the differential expression of rotund and <b>roughened</b> eye, their proteins have distinct activities. rotund and <b>roughened</b> eye act downstream of early patterning genes such as dachshund and appear to be involved in Notch signaling by regulating Delta, scabrous and Serrate...|$|R

It is indicated that the geometry and electron structures have changed greatly after benzene molecule was adsorbed on the <b>roughened</b> Rh electrode. Benzene molecule may be adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} <b>roughened</b> Rh electrode with a structure like 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene.

In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, <b>roughening</b> of the skin around the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples.

25|$|Already in his patent {{application}} of 1886 Pollak {{wrote that the}} capacitance of the capacitor increased if {{the surface of the}} anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for <b>roughening</b> the anode surface, mechanical methods like sand blasting or scratching, and chemical etching with acids and acid salts forced by high currents. Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Progress relating to the etching process is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from <b>roughening,</b> enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E

The light output pattern of the ELPEC-CS treated LED was five times greater than the conventional LED at 0 degrees which was caused by the <b>roughened</b> GaN surface that improved the light extraction efficiency of the LED...|$|R
40|$|Large bluntness cones {{with smooth}} nosetips and <b>roughened</b> frusta were flown in the NASA Ames {{hypersonic}} ballistic range at a Mach number of 10 through quiescent air environments. Global surface intensity (temperature) distributions were optically measured and analyzed to determine transition onset and progression over the <b>roughened</b> surface. Real-gas Navier-Stokes calculations of model flowfields, including {{laminar boundary layer}} development in these flowfields, were conducted to predict values of key dimensionless parameters used to correlate transition on such configurations in hypersonic flow. For these large bluntness cases, predicted axial distributions of the roughness Reynolds number showed (for each specified freestream pressure) that this parameter was a maximum at the physical beginning of the <b>roughened</b> zone and decreased with increasing run length along the <b>roughened</b> surface. Roughness-induced transition occurred downstream of this maximum roughness Reynolds number location, and progressed upstream towards {{the beginning of the}} <b>roughened</b> zone as freestream pressure was systematically increased. Roughness elements encountered at the upstream edge of the <b>roughened</b> frusta thus acted like a finite-extent trip array, consistent with published results concerning the tripping effectiveness of roughness bands placed on otherwise smooth surfaces...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Various {{fabrication}} {{methods are}} used to improve the stability and osseointegration of screws within the host bone. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>roughened</b> surface titanium screws fabricated by electron beam melting can provide better stability and osseointegration as compared with smooth titanium screws in sheep cervical vertebrae. METHODS: <b>Roughened</b> surface titanium screws, fabricated by electron beam melting, and conventional smooth surface titanium screws were implanted into sheep for 6 or 12 weeks (groups A and B, respectively). Bone ingrowth and implant stability were assessed with three-dimensional imaging and reconstruction, as well as histological and biomechanical tests. RESULTS: No screws in either group showed signs of loosening. Fibrous tissue formation could be seen around the screws at 6 weeks, which was replaced with bone at 12 weeks. Bone volume/total volume, bone surface area/bone volume, and the trabecular number were significantly higher for a define region of interest surrounding the <b>roughened</b> screws than that surrounding the smooth screws at 12 weeks. Indeed, for <b>roughened</b> screws, trabecular number was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks. On mechanical testing, the maximum pullout strength was significantly higher at 12 weeks than at 6 weeks, as expected; however, no significant differences were found between smooth and <b>roughened</b> screws at either time point. The maximum torque to extract the <b>roughened</b> screws was higher than that required for the smooth screws. CONCLUSIONS: Electron beam melting is a simple and effective method for producing a <b>roughened</b> surface on titanium screws. After 12 weeks, <b>roughened</b> titanium screws demonstrated a high degree of osseointegration and increased torsional resistance to extraction over smooth titanium screws...|$|R

500|$|A {{pamphlet}} titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick", produced c.1884 {{to accompany}} his exhibition, {{states that he}} started to display symptoms at approximately five years of age, with [...] "thick lumpy skin ... like that of an elephant, and almost the same colour". According to a 1930 article in the Illustrated Leicester Chronicle, he began to develop swellings on his lips {{at the age of}} 21months, followed by a bony lump on his forehead and a loosening and <b>roughening</b> of the skin. As he grew, a noticeable difference between the size of his left and right arms appeared and both his feet became significantly enlarged. The Merrick family explained his symptoms as the result of Mary's being knocked over and frightened by a fairground elephant while she was pregnant with Joseph. The concept of maternal impression—that the emotional experiences of pregnant women could have lasting physical effect on their unborn children—was still common in 19th century Britain. Merrick held this belief about the cause of his affliction for his entire life.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This paper represents the results on data collected under actual outdoor conditions for artificially <b>roughened</b> and smooth solar air heaters with and without booster mirrors. The {{results show that the}} effect of boosting of solar radiation is appreciable and consequently, the thermal efficiency of the <b>roughened</b> collectors with booster mirrors increases further over the <b>roughened</b> ones without any further increase in the pressure drop over that in the <b>roughened</b> ones. The values of the collector heat removal factor and collector efficiency factor of <b>roughened</b> solar air heaters with booster mirrors have been found to increase by 12. 6 % and 11. 9 % respectively over the <b>roughened</b> ones without booster mirrors and 45. 6 % and 46. 5 % respectively over the smooth ones with booster mirrors and 144. 1 % and 141 % respectively over the smooth ones. For a given value of relative roughness height of 0. 022 and relative roughness pitch of 15,the value of thermal performance of <b>roughened</b> collector with booster mirror and without booster mirror have been found out to be about 54 % and 46 % respectively.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the main channel and floodplains {{is one of the}} interesting challenge topics in hydraulics of open channels. This knowledge can be useful for flood control purposes, if altering the land-uses. The aims of this paper are: (1) to investigate the effects of floodplain <b>Roughened</b> Strips for reducing and delaying flood peaks, (2) to compare the results of models (one- and two-dimensional hydraulic models) to find the limitations of application of the 1 D model. First, we assessed the effect of <b>roughened</b> strips on the propagation of flood hydrographs without/with <b>roughened</b> strips installed in four configurations of compound channels differing by width and slope. The regime always stayed subcritical. To quantify the effects of the <b>roughened</b> strips, proper indicators, such as relative attenuation and relative delay of peak, are proposed. For simple symmetrical arrangement of <b>roughened</b> strips, results of 1 -D and 2 -D models are quite similar: the effects are proportional to the <b>roughened</b> surface and the relative indicator values are almost constant with the flood return period. But in the case of more complex arrangements, it appeared that a 2 D model should be used to obtain accurate results. Finally, a test on river Hogneau was carried out. A simple interpolation method was devised to estimate a priori effects on flood mitigation of <b>Roughened</b> Strips implementation, using the results of simulation on the compound channels. It yielded indicators of the same order of magnitude than results of complete modelling...|$|R
40|$|Background: In vitro {{measurements}} of sunscreen products {{are used to}} assess their reliability in terms of photoprotection and photo-stability. Objective: In this study, several substrates have been fully characterized for in vitro sunscreen testing. Methods: The following different substrates have been utilised in the study: <b>roughened</b> PMMA plates, Transpore, Vitro-Skin, <b>roughened</b> quartz plate and a laboratory prepared <b>roughened</b> PTFE plate. The suitability of these substrates for SPF evaluation has been investigated by performing total absorbance {{measurements of}} seven sunscreen products with different SPF values produced by the same manufacturer. Results and conclusions: Application of sunscreen products on Transpore, <b>roughened</b> quartz plate, PMMA, PTFE and Vitro-Skin was performed efficiently. With regard to photo-stability of the substrate materials, only PMMA plate, PTFE and <b>roughened</b> quartz plate showed to be photo-stable after UV irradiation. With regard to SPF tests, our results indicate that Transpore, <b>roughened</b> quartz plate and Vitro-Skin are preferable to assess SPF values because of a better correlation between in vitro and in vivomeasurements. Our study also confirms that an initial calibration must be performed for sunscreen products labelled with different SPF values.
