40|$|Synopsis Long-distance {{migration}} of adult corn earworm moths (Helicoverpa zea), {{and several other}} noctuid moth species, facilitates seasonal expansion of pest populations and consequent increased infestations of agricultural crops on a continental scale in North America. Long-term field studies of population dynamics and migratory flights of H. zea and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in the United States were evaluated using X-band radar observations and profiles of atmospheric conditions. These studies identified characteristic patterns of migratory flight that are largely associated with vertical profiles of temperature and wind speed. Collective patterns of moth migrations were generally highly correlated with wind headings, but often at a significant angular deviation. Preliminary analyses are presented between moth distributions in the aerosphere estimated from discrete moth counts using X-band radar and bulk reflectivity data from NEXRAD Doppler <b>radar.</b> <b>Identification</b> of associations between atmospheric factors and noctuid population dynamics and migratory flights will improve the ability to predict infestations by pest species throughout their broad seasonal range expansion...|$|E
40|$|More {{advanced}} recognition methods, {{which may}} recognize particular copies of radars {{of the same}} type, are called identification. The identification process of radar devices is a more specialized task which requires methods based on the analysis of distinctive features. These features are distinguished from the signals coming from the identified devices. Such a process is called Specific Emitter Identification (SEI). The identification of radar emission sources {{with the use of}} classic techniques based on the statistical analysis of basic measurable parameters of a signal such as Radio Frequency, Amplitude, Pulse Width, or Pulse Repetition Interval is not sufficient for SEI problems. This paper presents the method of hierarchical data clustering which is used in the process of <b>radar</b> <b>identification.</b> The Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm (HACA) based on Generalized Agglomerative Scheme (GAS) implemented and used in the research method is parameterized; therefore, it is possible to compare the results.

40|$|International audienceThe {{classification}} of radar emitters in a naval electronic-warfare (EW) context is a challenging problem. Furthermore, {{over the last}} few years, new technologies and the reduction of the fabrication costs have led to {{an increase in the number}} of radars. Thus, EW systems need to improve their capabilities of <b>radar</b> <b>identification.</b> The common operational methods, which consist of clustering pulses with similar parameters, are no longer able to solve the classification task efficiently. The main challenges of this data clustering of unknown radar emitters from passive measurements are the high dimension of the received radar pulse samples, the small sample group size, and closely located radar pulse clusters. In this paper, we propose modeling the instantaneous frequency law of the recorded pulses using Bézier curves. The spatial distribution of the control points of the Bézier curves is used as a new feature for the classification process based on the common density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithms. Real data recorded near Brest, France, are used to highlight the interest in using the proposed approach. We also show the potential of the approach for specific emitter identification...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to develop solutions for High-Performance Low-Cost Passives for <b>Radar,</b> <b>Identification,</b> and Communication Applications up to mm-Wave Frequencies. This research will {{bring to the table}} potential solutions that will meet three main requirements: small size (or low weight), high performance, and low cost. This research embarks on antenna design and development for passive RFID tags on LCP substrates, and then a transition towards lower cost modules investigates and explores the possibilities of using paper as RF substrates with inkjet printing as a low cost fabrication technology. Modules such as dual band antenna for Wifi frequencies (2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz) and UWB (up to 10 GHz) on paper substrate using inkjet printing are presented. This work then bridges into developing higher frequency modules. These include: highly selective filter design on LCP for X-band Radar application {{to be used as a}} benchmark for an easy adjustment for higher frequencies, and antenna modules LCP using inkjet printing for communication such as mm-Wave WLAN or WPAN. A transition into mm-Wave Modules then takes place for the general realization of low-cost high-performance mm-Wave modules and more specifically the low cost automotive radar. After proposing an architecture for integrated mm-Wave module, this work then investigates 2 D/ 3 D interconnections (and their integration with antennas) on LCP using conventional etching design guidelines up to 100 GHz. Antenna arrays that are implemented with phase shifters for beam steering are then designed using edge fed and multilayer technology. Furthermore, crosstalk reductions for highly dense transmission lines are analyzed via simulations for the optimum performance and space saving of such mm-Wave modules such as the IC interface where space restrictions are strictly enforced.

40|$|Precipitation {{estimates}} from radar systems are a crucial component of many hydrometeorological applications, from flash flood forecasting to regional water budget studies. For analyses on large spatial scales and long timescales, it is frequently necessary to use composite reflectivities from {{a network of}} radar systems. Such composite products are useful for regional or national studies, but introduce a set of difficulties not encountered when using single radars. For instance, each contributing radar has its own calibration and scanning characteristics, but <b>radar</b> <b>identification</b> may not be retained in the compositing procedure. As a result, range effects on signal return cannot be taken into account. This paper assesses the accuracy with which composite radar imagery {{can be used to}} estimate precipitation in the convective environment of Florida during the summer of 1991. Results using Z = 30 OR(sup 1. 4) (WSR- 88 D default Z-R relationship) are compared with those obtained using the probability matching method (PMM). Rainfall derived from the power law Z-R was found to he highly biased (+ 90 %-l 10 %) compared to rain gauge measurements for various temporal and spatial integrations. Application of a 36. 5 -dBZ reflectivity threshold (determined via the PMM) was found to improve the performance of the power law Z-R, reducing the biases substantially to 20 %- 33 %. Correlations between precipitation estimates obtained with either Z-R relationship and mean gauge values are much higher for areal averages than for point locations. Precipitation {{estimates from}} the PMM are an improvement over those obtained using the power law in that biases and root-mean-square errors are much lower. The minimum timescale for application of the PMM with the composite radar dataset was found to be several days for area-average precipitation. The minimum spatial scale is harder to quantify, although it is concluded that it is less than 350 sq km. Implications relevant to the WSR- 88 D system are discussed...|$|E
