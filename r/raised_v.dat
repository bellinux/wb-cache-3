The characteristics of this NHE phenotype in hypertension (<b>raised</b> <b>V.,</b> and a lowered Hill coefficient) are preserved in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from hypertensive patients. In this study, we have determined NHE kinetics in cultured lymphoblasts from diabetic patients {{with and without}} nephropathy, with nondiabetic controls, using fluorometry with the pH indicator 2, 7 ' bis-(carboxyethyl) - 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein and estimation ofNHE isoform 1 (NHE- 1) density with specific polyclonal antibodies. The V,. of NHE was elevated significantly, and the Hill coefficient for internal H ' binding was lowered in cells from patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with both normal controls and normoal-buminuric diabetic patients. NHE- 1 density as measured by Western blotting was similar in all groups. The turnover num-ber of NHE- 1 was thus elevated in cells from nephropathy patients. This phenotype in cells from diabetic nephropathy patients resembles that in essential hypertension and suggests that such patients may have a predisposition to hypertension. Moreover, as these changes persist in cultured lymphoblasts in vitro, these cells should provide a cell culture model to further define the basic mechanisms leading to NHE activation in dia-betic nephropathy.

Moreover, the frequency of this alpha-chain expression was greater than 1. 5 % of the total alpha chains found in laboratory strains, including B 10 congenic mice. This is about 10 (4) times higher than was expected. The V 14 J 281 alpha-chain expression was relatively low but was significant in CD 4 +/CD 8 + immature thymocytes and became quite high in mature single-positive T cells, implying that this alpha chain is selected during T-cell maturation. V 14 J 281 expression increased with time after birth and reached a maximum at around 5 weeks of age.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with two strigeid genera which utilise fish as their second intermediate host and piscivorous birds as a definitive host, i. e. Apatemon (Apatemon) Sudarikov, 1959 and Ichthyocotylurus Odening, 1969. Although the lifecycle has been ascertained for most Ichthyocotylurus spp., confusion and disagreement still exist as to the constituent species, while all of the life-stages have been described for only a single member of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon). In order to clarify species membership to these taxa and indeed the taxonomic position of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon) further information was required on the life-cycles and life-stages of these strigeids. Although, metacercariae from this family have been recorded {{from a variety of}} British fishes, confirmed records, i. e. those supported with life-cycle data, are limited to a single species. It was this lack of confidence in identifying metacercariae recovered from fishes and the lack of known good criteria for distinguishing the adults that prompted the present study. Collections of metacercariae from a variety of hosts and locations were made, from which all subsequent life-cycle stages were obtained. The project aims were to establish the identity of the forms occurring in British fishes, by applying discriminatory techniques to the experimentally reared life-stages. In addition to traditional methods, techniques with little previous application to these genera were used and included, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chaetotaxy, principal components analysis (PCA), and karyology. Furthermore, behavioural aspects such as the release patterns of cercariae from their molluscan hosts were studied to investigate whether they would prove to be of diagnostic value. Metacercariae obtained from the sampling survey were tentatively identified, using all currently employed methods for their determination, i. e. morphology, nature of cyst, host and site specificities, as Ichthyocotylurus erraticus (Rudolphi, 1809), I. variegatus (Creplin, 1825), Apatemon gracilis (Rudolphi, 1819) and A. annuligerum (Nordmann, 1832). Material collected from Finland was considered to contain both Ichthyocotylurus spp. recovered in the U. K., as well as I. platycephalus (Creplin, 1825) and I. pileatus (Rudolphi, 1802). The Ichthyocotylurus spp. were found to be more host specific than A. gracilis, although A. annuligerum was considered oioxenic to perch Perea fluiatilis L. Records of I. erraticus from gwyniad Coregonus lavaretus (L.) and grayling Thymallus thymallus (L.), and A. gracilis from arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) constitute first listings from Britain. The large number of sensilla present on the body surface of these metacercariae, observed by SEM and chaetotaxy, precluded their diagnostic use. PCA was, however, found to be of value for distinguishing between species and determining morphological variation within a species. I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis adults were successfully reared in experimental hosts using metacercariae from a variety of fish hosts, sites within a single fish host and geographical sites. The adults obtained enabled clarification of the identities assigned to the metacercariae. Those metacercariae believed to represent I. pileatus and A. annuligerum failed to establish in experimental hosts. Herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls proved to be extremely good experimental hosts for both Ichthyocotylurus spp., with the vast majority of infections establishing and providing high yields of eggs and adults. These infections yielded information on the establishment, development, fecundity, site specificity, longevity and morphological variability of the adults. Aspects of the morphology and biology of I. variegatus adults recorded were found to support its validity as a species discrete from I. platycephalus which was in some doubt. The experimental hosts used for A. gracilis infections, domestic and mallard ducklings, were found to be less satisfactory. Challenges were performed with A. gracilis metacercariae from three sources, rainbow trout, salmon parr and stone loach. The latter source was the only one to result in egg producing adults, with specimens exhibiting normal morphology and demonstrating an increased longevity over adults raised from salmonid metacercariae. These findings suggest that the metacercarial host may affect the successful completion of the life-cycle. Eggs of known origin were collected for all three cultured strigeid species, enabling further life-cycle studies, these were incubated and miracidia successfully raised. Developmental periods were found to be temperature dependent and differed for the three species at 20 °C: A. gracilis < I. erraticus < I. variegatus. Light microscopy revealed the morphology of all three species to be identical, as were the epidermal plate formulae and chaetotaxy, indicated by silver-staining. The nomenclature for the distribution of miracidial sensilla derived by Dimitrov et al. (1989) was amended to enable a full description of these species. Osmotic shock resulted in an improved deciliation of the miracidia compared to sonication and subsequent SEM observation confirmed the arrangement of body surface structures, while revealing sensilla forms. Behavioural aspects of I. variegatus miracidia were examined, with a maximum longevity (< 11 hours) recorded at the lowest temperature studied (l 0 degrees C), and host finding demonstrated to occur by an increased turning response in the presence of substances emitted from the susceptible snail host, following an initial unresponsive dispersal phase. Ichthyocotylurus cercariae were found in naturally infected Valvata piscinalis which constitutes the first record in Britain of cercariae of this genus. Cercariae of I. erraticus and I. variegatus were successfully raised experimentally from miracidia of known identity and origin within naive, experimentally <b>raised</b> <b>V.</b> piscinalis hosts, while A. gracilis cercariae were obtained from laboratory reared Lymnaea peregra. Cercarial developmental periods within the molluscan host were found to be temperature dependent and markedly different for the strigeid genera investigated, as were their behaviour and morphology. The Ichthyocotylurus spp. exhibit a distinct diurnal emergence rhythm from their molluscan host, being shed during the hours of daylight, while A. gracilis cercariae demonstrate a reciprocal pattern, emerging during the hours of darkness. Behavioural contrasts were also observed in longevities, emergence strategies (route of exit) and swimming behaviour. The two Ichthyocotylurus spp. were extremely similar, the only cercarial features found to be of diagnostic use were: {{the presence or absence of}} eye-spots; their differing developmental periods from miracidium to cercaria; the number and distribution of sensilla when compared by PCA; and their differing longevities at 20 degrees C. Characters considered to be of value in differentiating between strigeid cercariae at the species level, including the armature, chaetotaxy pattern and resting posture, did not differ between these two species. SEM observations enabled descriptions of the variety and structure of sensilla present on different life-stages, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the internal structure of cercarial sensory structures. Experimentally raised cercariae were found to be infective and the life-cycle was completed for the three strigeid species. Host specificities were observed for I. erraticus and A. gracilis, being particularly stringent for the latter species, while site specificities recorded were as observed in natural infections. Metacercarial maturation periods (for encystment) were highly temperature dependent, being comparable for the two Ichthyocotylurus spp. and more rapid than for A. gracilis specimens. Karyological studies were performed on the cercariae-releasing parthenitae of I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis, the identity of which was confirmed through lifecycle studies. The chromosome number and morphology for the three species was described and enabled the ready discrimination of I. erraticus and I. variegatus cercariae which had proved to be problematical using comparisons of gross morphology. The strigeids described here and from all other sources have been found to possess 20 chromosomes in diploid sets. Behavioural and developmental characteristics were found to be of taxonomic value for the separation of morphologically similar species at all life-stages. The fine surface structures of the strigeids investigated using SEM and chaetotaxy revealed many similarities at the species level, but provided evidence for their use in the separation of higher taxa. All comparisons of morphology were enhanced by the ability of PCA to discern subtle variation while karyological investigations provided precise species determinations. The two latter techniques in particular may greatly aid systematicians investigating taxonomic problems within other digenean families...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between raising and subject-control verbs, although {{crucial for the}} construction of semantics, is not easy to make given access to only the local syntactic configuration of the sentence. In most contexts raising verbs and control verbs display identical superficial syntactic structure. Linguists apply grammaticality tests to distinguish these verb classes. Our idea is to learn to predict the raising-control distinction by simulating such grammaticality judgments by means of pattern searches. Experiments with regression tree models show that using pattern counts from large unannotated corpora can be used to assess how likely a verb form is to appear in <b>raising</b> <b>vs.</b> control constructions. For this task it is beneficial to use the much larger but also noisier Web corpus rather than the smaller and cleaner Gigaword corpus. A similar methodology can be useful for detecting other lexical semantic distinctions: it could be used whenever a test employed to make linguistically interesting distinctions can be reduced to a pattern search in an unannotated corpus. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{consider}} the syntactic properties of the subject in typical finite and non-finite complement clauses, (re-) considering those cases that were mainly discussed by Chomsky & Lasnik (1977). It is argued that the (finite) complementizer that (and if) requires a propositional complement, thus a sentence with a lexicalized EPP. When the subject is absent, due to extraction, there is nothing to satisfy the EPP, and therefore the embedded clause does not qualify as the right complement for that (and if), triggering ungrammaticality (the ‘that-t effect’). On the other hand, (non-finite) to, akin to a locative subject, subsumes the EPP. The interpretation of the EPP in this case is that of variable, which may or may not be bound by a matrix DP (control, <b>raising</b> <b>vs.</b> arbitrary reading). The element for also requires a lexicalized EPP, hence the presence of a lexical DP which triggers an obviation effect.

Later in the season this would further change with the addition of the 'forward wing'; an additional cantilevered wing used on high-downforce tracks, mounted forward and above the main plane, attached via endplate extensions.The leading edge of the front wing now also followed a straight profile, rather than curving forward towards the endplates.

40|$|Evidence for the {{syntactic}} attachment of-able At {{least since}} Chomsky (1970), {{it has been}} observed that deverbal adjectives in-able do not allow raising (1 a), even if the corresponding verb does (1 b). Existing accounts of this restriction assume that-able is attached to a stem in the lexicon. Chomsky (1970) attributes the contrast in (1) to a lexical redundancy rule that requires the subject of V-able to correspond to the lexically selected object of <b>V.</b> Since <b>raised</b> subjects are not lexically selected by a <b>raising</b> <b>V,</b> they are predicted to be impossible with-able adjectives. Work from the 1980 s treats raising with-able adjectives, nominalizations (1 c) and adjectival passives (1 d) as a violation of the ECP, on the assumption that these forms enter the syntax as nouns and adjectives, which, unlike verbs, cannot govern the trace of the embedded subject. In this paper, I demonstrate that both the traditional empirical observations and the traditional analysis are incorrect. -able adjectives actually do allow raising, and-able is attached in the syntax, not in the Lexicon.
