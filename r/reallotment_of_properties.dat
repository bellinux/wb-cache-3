I begin in chapter 7 by examining the fundamental question of what justifies the social institution <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> that is, {{the rationale for the}} rights that constitute what we commonly call ownership. I also discuss examples of the emergence <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights. Then I consider a number of important issues about property rights. In chapter 8, I inquire about the division <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights (property rights may be divided contemporaneously, over time, and according to contingency). In chapter 9, I study a variety of issues about the acquisition and transfer <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> including the discovery of unowned or lost property, registration systems for transfer <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> and the transfer <b>of</b> <b>property</b> at death. In chapter 10, I investigate “externalities ” and property [...] problems concerning cooperation and conflict in the use <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> together with the resolution of such problems through bargaining and legal rules.

Types <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations {{and its role in}} public reproduction are investigated. Peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations are considered. Classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects depending on their most essential features is analyzed. Different approaches to classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> subjects are considered. Nature and preconditions of origin <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are investigated. Goals and functions <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are specified. Risks that related to disposal and commercialisation <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> and connected with peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects and growing rate <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights infringements are analyzed.

40|$|In this thesis, I problematize a {{widespread}} assumption in theories of civil disobedience. The {{assumption is that}} destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> is violence.

I put forth three sufficient criteria for viewing destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> as violence {{and use them to}} evaluate two representative cases of civil disobedience in Denmark. I conclude that destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> can be viewed as violence in cases where it results in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations of the right to private property. However, the destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> most common to civil disobedience does not result in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights, and thus cannot reasonably be considered violence.
