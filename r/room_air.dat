25|$|A 2007 {{review of}} HBOT in {{cerebral}} palsy found no difference {{compared to the}} control group. Neuropsychological tests also showed no difference between HBOT and <b>room</b> <b>air</b> and based on caregiver report, those who received <b>room</b> <b>air</b> had significantly better mobility and social functioning. Children receiving HBOT were reported to experience seizures {{and the need for}} tympanostomy tubes to equalize ear pressure, though the incidence was not clear.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{diagnose}} a pulmonary embolism, {{a review of}} clinical criteria to determine the need for testing is recommended. In those who have low risk, age less than 50, heart rate less than 100 beats per minute, oxygen level more than 94% on <b>room</b> <b>air,</b> and no leg swelling, coughing up of blood, surgery or trauma {{in the last four}} weeks, previous blood clots, or estrogen use, further testing is not typically needed.|$|E
25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber gasket so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the <b>room</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} sizes of {{portable}} chambers, {{which are used}} for home treatment.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved chambers for use with <b>room</b> <b>air</b> are available in the USA and may go up to 4.4pounds per square inch (psi) above atmospheric pressure, which equals 1.3atmospheres absolute (ATA), equivalent to a depth of 10feet of sea water.|$|E
2500|$|The 30A {{plug and}} {{receptacle}} look {{similar to the}} 15A one but larger. The higher-current versions are rare, with twist-locking plugs such as L6-30 or direct wiring more common. Generally 6-series non-locking plugs are used for such appliances as large <b>room</b> <b>air</b> conditioners, commercial kitchen equipment, and the occasional home arc welder. Single-phase 6-50 is commonly used on farms for silo unloaders, and is used with a 6-gauge flexible power cord up to [...] long. Some manufacturers of electric vehicle charging stations equip their 30-40A Level 2 EVSEs with a 6-50 plug on a short cord, though it is becoming less common, with manufacturers now favoring the more common 14-50 plug.|$|E

2500|$|A German {{study from}} 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat {{from a dozen}} people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily {{distinguish}} exercise-induced sweat from <b>room</b> <b>air,</b> three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The acoustic startle reflex response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by electromyograph analysis of the orbital muscle, {{which is responsible for}} the eyeblink component. This showed {{for the first time that}} fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's [...] "defensive behavior" [...] prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.|$|E
2500|$|However, if such {{a shelter}} is unavailable, the person should then be advised to follow the Shelter in Place protocol, or if given, Emergency {{evacuation}} advice. Evacuation orders would entail exiting the area completely by following a path perpendicular to the wind direction, and therefore perpendicular to {{the path of the}} fallout plume. While [...] "sheltering in place" [...] is staying indoors, in a preferably sealed tight basement, or internal room, for a number of hours, with the oxygen supply available in such a scenario being more than sufficient for 3+ hours in even the smallest average room, under the assumption that the improvised seal is perfect, until carbon dioxide levels begin to reach unsafe values and necessitate room unsealing for a number of minutes to create a <b>room</b> <b>air</b> change.|$|E

5000|$|In Franklin's stove, {{a hollow}} baffle was {{positioned}} inside {{and near the}} rear of the stove. The baffle was a wide but thin cast-iron box, which was open to the <b>room's</b> <b>air</b> at its bottom and at two holes on its sides, near its top. Air entered the bottom of the box and was heated both by the fire and by the fumes flowing over the front and back of the box. The warmed air then rose inside the baffle and exited through the holes in the baffle's sides. [...] Franklin’s baffle thus performed at least two functions: like Kessler’s heating stove, it lengthened the path that the fire’s fumes had to follow before reaching the chimney, allowing more heat to be extracted from the fumes; and like Gauger’s fireplace, it placed a duct near the fire, which heated the <b>room's</b> <b>air</b> via convection.|$|R
