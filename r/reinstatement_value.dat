40|$|The method Schroeder is {{accepted}} amongst real estate professionals in Switzerland as a near standard for condition monitoring, budgeting of maintenance and refurbishment, and strategic decision support {{in point of}} building portfolios. It {{is based on the}} devaluation curves of 12 or more building elements. Main results are the actual and the prognosticated future building condition in percentage of its <b>reinstatement</b> <b>value,</b> the residual useful service life of building elements, and the calculation of future maintenance and refurbishment costs. 25 years after its first publication, this paper analyses the assumptions made, compares the method to other methods in this field, and validates the method in several steps, based on scientific or empirical evidence. Furthermore, a desktop simulation of a well-documented portfolio was performed and compared, the answers from a questionnaire amongst users are provided, and the partially controversial conclusions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn recent years, risk {{assessment}} {{has become increasingly}} important {{for the protection of}} settlements against natural hazards because the public authorities have to economise their budgets and therefore to legitimate their investments. To quantify risk, information is needed on both, recurrence intervals of the potentially damaging natural processes and on the associated damage potential. In the past, high efforts were undertaken to assess the former, while the latter was almost ignored. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the development of the avalanche risk in the inhabited areas of the municipality of Davos, canton of Grisons, Switzerland, for the period between 1950 and 2000. The extent of avalanche prone areas was quantified using the numerical avalanche model AVAL- 1 D and the current legal hazard maps. The damage potential was quantified by the number and <b>reinstatement</b> <b>values</b> of buildings and by the number of persons per building. It has been demonstrated that, contrary to the frequently expressed statement that the vulnerability of communities has increased, the risk for this settlement in fact decreased substantially. This can mainly be attributed to the realisation of mitigation measures, such as defence structures in avalanche starting zones. The only exception regarding the development of risk was in the category of residential buildings, were an increase in risk was already detectable at medium recurrence intervals. This is remarkable because methods of land use planning, such as hazard mapping, are intended to protect residential buildings from the impact of hazardous processes. However, general statements referring to a larger area (region, country) might be difficult to make, since small-scale disparities have a very important influence on the diversification of risk and risk management. Furthermore, it has to be emphasized that the results are highly dependent on the assumptions made in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{teaching}} profession within the broader sector of Technical, Vocational Education and Training is differentiated {{by the way}} in which this educational provision is manifested in a particular country, the institutions within that country, and what purposes it seeks to serve at a particular moment in that country's social and economic development. As a sector of education that is often seen as needing to be highly responsive to changes in the kinds of skills and knowledge that countries require to develop, it has particular cultural impetuses and forms. Not the least of these {{is the degree to which}} its purposes are aligned with developing directly the skills required for work by the community or some other educational goal, such as more general competencies associated with the quality of working life. For instance, a longstanding debate within Western countries, but evident in practice elsewhere (e. g., Brazil, China and Russia) is the degree to which vocational education should be focused on developing specific vocational knowledge and skills, or comprise a form of education that has an orientation towards paid vocations. That is, whether workplace competence or general education is its primary educational goal. In other countries, this division of purposes takes particular forms. For instance, as contributors in this collection propose, the emphasis on particular values or ideologies or moral education are to be developed alongside workplace competence in China and Russia, whereas there are requests from Brazilian contributors for a <b>reinstatement</b> of <b>values</b> associated with collective and individual needs.

40|$|Buildings is {{the major}} {{importance}} of national economy, real estate market, residential housing, construction industry and others industries. Also the major importance of real estate management is risk management, {{and one of the}} part of risk management â€“ property insurance. The main sense in property insurance is building recovery <b>value</b> or <b>reinstatement</b> costs. In every country territorial location impact on buildings recovery value. It depends of many factors: the national and regional economy of the country, municipal fees and legislation, technical projects of buildings, relief model, engineering technologies, labor costs, building materials and products, building machines, costs of transportation. The research focus sets recovery <b>value</b> (<b>reinstatement</b> costs) elements and factors influencing them. The significance of the topic is set by the economy and industry in Latvia sustainable risk management model in constructing, property management and insurance industries in accordance with territorial location impact on building recovery value. The comparison, data analysis and logical access methods have been used in the study and the recommendations on the improvement of the situation have been developed...|$|R
