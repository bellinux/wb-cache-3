We attached a recent letter re the Early Site Permit processing challenges that we have encountered. One of the major challenges was that the NRC does not educate the public on the total process (exactly what federal, state & local departments are involved and who has what authority for different items) when it issues permits. It appears that the NRC departments do not attempt to get state and local officials involved in the total process, including participating in public hearings and provide integrated schedules for all participants. Our recent ESP experience also indicated that in some cases the Safety and Environmental Departments within the NRC did not seem to coordinate with each other The safety folks did not have any public hearings or issue a draft safety document prior to publication. The public then assumes that all federal and state level departments are looking out for them, when indeed the NRC is limited by its own regulations, procedures and review schedules, and in some cases other federal and/or state laws on exactly what it will comment on.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the ATS program is to develop ultra-high efficiency, environmentally superior and cost competitive gas turbine systems for base load application in utility, independent power producer and industrial markets. Specific performance targets have been set using natural gas as the primary fuel: (1) System efficiency that will exceed 60 % (lower heating value basis) on natural gas for large scale utility turbine systems; for industrial applications, systems {{that will result in}} a 15 % improvement in heat rate compared to currently available gas turbine systems. (2) An environmentally superior system that will not require the use of post combustion emissions controls under full load operating conditions. (3) Busbar energy costs that are 10 % less than current state-of-the-art turbine systems, while meeting the same environmental requirements. (4) Fuel-flexible designs that will operate on natural gas but are capable of being adapted to operate on coal-derived or biomass fuels. (5) Reliability-Availability-Maintainability (RAM) that is equivalent to the current turbine systems. (6) Water consumption minimized to levels consistent with cost and efficiency goals. (7) Commercial systems that will enter the market in the year 2000. In Phase I of the ATS program, Siemens Westinghouse found that efficiency significantly increases when the traditional combined-cycle power plant is reconfigured with closed-loop steam cooling of the hot gas path. Phase II activities involved the development of a 318 MW natural gas fired turbine conceptual design with the flexibility to burn coal-derived and biomass fuels. Phases I and II of the ATS program have been completed. Phase III, the current phase, completes the research and development activities and develops hardware specifications from the Phase II conceptual design. This report summarizes Phase III Extension activities for a three month period. Additional details may be found in monthly technical progress reports covering the period stated on the cover of this report.

30|$|In practice, it {{also means}} that for GM plants that do not express a 'novel' pesticidal protein, as {{herbicide}} resistant (HR) crops or GM plants with altered primary compounds, like starch-altered GM crops, either no stressors are identified or their relevance is dismissed. This applies especially to the most widely used GM plants worldwide, HR crops. The vast majority of them are resistant to the broad spectrum herbicide glyphosate. The considered novel trait/protein (i.e. stressor) is a substitute enzyme from a microorganism (e.g. CP 4 EPSPS conferring resistance to glyphosate) that is similar but not identical to the one naturally occurring in the conventional plants. It is in such significantly different as it enables the GM crop to continue the synthesis of essential amino acids which in non-GM plants is blocked by the corresponding broadspectrum herbicide - as a result, all plants except the HR crop die. However, for biosafety purposes, it is not considered a 'novel' compound and usually no testing for adverse effects of the whole GM plant is deemed necessary (Table 1). Occasionally, however, some toxicity tests with the new, again, bacteria-produced enzyme are performed. Based on this logic, the adverse effects of the broad-spectrum herbicide (on non-target flora and fauna and the evolution of resistant weeds) required to benefit from the technology, are excluded from the ERA [13, 21]. Some ecotoxicological aspects are considered in the registration of the pesticide (typically only submitted as <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>extension</b> of current use) but are not submitted {{in the context of the}} ERA of the GMO. Consequently, it is also not taken into account that GM HR crops do now contain higher concentrations of residues of the applied systemic herbicide, like glyphosate and its metabolite AMPA, than under the conventional use of these herbicides [22 – 24]. Aside of the health issues associated with any pesticide residue in food and feed, these higher herbicide residues have also an associated ecotoxicological dimension with regard to input pathways, persistence and bioactivity of pesticide residues in the ecosystem, in addition to the herbicide residues resulting from the external application. Further ignored are any unintended changes in the activity pattern of both the novel and native enzymes produced in the GM plant. We argue that these are serious shortcomings of the current approach to ERA of GM plants and identify the urgent need for improvement.|$|E

2500|$|Today, {{the circuit}} justice for each circuit is {{responsible}} for dealing with certain types of applications that, under the Court's rules, may be addressed by a single justice. These include applications for emergency stays (including stays of execution in death-penalty cases) and injunctions pursuant to the All Writs Act arising from cases within that circuit, as well as routine requests such as <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>extensions</b> of time. In the past, circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of habeas corpus, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal. Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it [...] "granted" [...] or [...] "denied" [...] or entering a standard form of order. However, the justice may elect to write an opinion—referred to as an in-chambers opinion—in such matters {{if he or she}} wishes.|$|R

In his letter of 8 March 1514, Luka Primojević requested {{approval from the}} Ragusan government (Consilium Rogatorum) to import a printing machine to Ragusa and to open a printing house, to print books in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic script, the latter based on the script used at the Crnojević printing house. Primojević requested a guarantee from the Ragusan government to not allow other printing houses to be opened in Ragusa for the next 15 years. The Ragusan government accepted this {{under the condition that}} the printing house would be finished in one year. One year later Luka <b>requested</b> <b>for</b> <b>extension</b> of this period for another eight months, which was also accepted. Still, for some reason, he failed to establish printing press.|$|R
