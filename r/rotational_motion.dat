Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. <b>Rotational</b> <b>motion</b> may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external.

5|$|One of {{the first}} quantum effects to be {{explicitly}} noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs {{from that of a}} diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into <b>rotational</b> <b>motion</b> in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the <b>rotational</b> <b>motion</b> {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E
25|$|A common {{situation}} in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such <b>rotational</b> <b>motion</b> is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any <b>rotational</b> <b>motion,</b> a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.|$|E

When subsequent authors such as Paul Ehrenfest (1909) tried to incorporate <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> as well, it became clear that Born rigidity is a very restrictive sense of rigidity, leading to the Herglotz-Noether theorem, according to which there are severe restrictions on <b>rotational</b> Born rigid <b>motions.</b> It was formulated by Gustav Herglotz (1909, who classified all forms of <b>rotational</b> <b>motions)</b> and in a less general way by Fritz Noether (1909). Due to these restrictions, Born (1910) and others gave alternative, less restrictive definitions of rigidity.|$|R

The equipartition theorem {{is also known as}} the law of equipartition, equipartition of energy, or simply equipartition.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>rotational</b> seismic <b>motions</b> has received considerable {{attention in the}} last years. Recent advances in sensor technologies allow us to measure directly the rotational components of the seismic wavefield. Today this is achieved with improved accuracy and at an affordable cost. The analysis {{and the study of}} <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> are, to a certain extent, less developed than other aspects of seismology due to the historical lack of instrumental observations. This is due to both the technical challenges involved in measuring <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> and to the widespread belief that <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> are insignificant. This paper addresses the joint processing of translational and <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> from both the theoretical and the practical perspectives. Our attention focuses on the {{analysis of}} motions of both Rayleigh waves and Love waves from recordings of single sensors and from an array of sensors. From the theoretical standpoint, analysis of Fisher information (FI) allows us to understand how the different measurement types contribute to the estimation of quantities of geophysical interest. In addition, we show how rotational measurements resolve ambiguity on parameter estimation in the single sensor setting. We quantify the achievable estimation accuracy by means of Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). From the practical standpoint, a method for the joint processing of rotational and translational recordings to perform maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is presented. The proposed technique estimates parameters of Love waves and Rayleigh waves from single sensor or array recordings. We support and illustrate our findings with a comprehensive collection of numerical examples. Applications to real recordings are also show...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Rotational</b> <b>motions</b> {{generated}} by large earthquakes {{in the far}} field have been successfully measured, and observations agree well with the classical elasticity theory. However, recent rotational measurements in the near field of earthquakes in Japan and in Taiwan indicate that <b>rotational</b> ground <b>motions</b> are 10 to 100 times larger than expected from the classical elasticity theory. The near-field strong-motion records of the 1999 Mw 7 : 6 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake suggest that the ground motions along the 100 km rupture are complex. Some rather arbitrary baseline corrections are {{necessary in order to}} obtain reasonable displacement values from double integra-tion of the acceleration data. Because <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> can contaminate acceleration observations due to the induced perturbation of the Earth’s gravitational field, we started a modest program to observe <b>rotational</b> ground <b>motions</b> in Taiwan.

40|$|Theoretically, {{to fully}} {{describe}} {{the change in}} the medium around a point one needs three components of translation, six components of strain, and three components of rotation. It is expected that collocated measurements of translations and rotations may help (1) correcting translation signals recorded by classical seismometers for contamination by ground rotations, (2) extracting additional information on earthquake source properties, soil-structure interactions, and properties of the subsurface, and (3) providing additional ground motion information to earthquake engineers for seismic design. Thus, in addition to translations and strains, the rotational part of ground motions should also be recorded. However, the lack of instrumental sensitivity did not allow seismologists to observe <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> for decades. Recently, ring laser technology has provided the means to develop instruments that allow in principle the observation of <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> in a wide frequency band and epicentral distance range. Here we present the observations of <b>rotational</b> ground <b>motions</b> around a vertical axis in the P coda (the section between the onsets of direct P- and S- waves) of tele-seismic signals on a ring laser sensor at the Fundamental Observatory Wettzell, southeast Germany. The studies focus on finding the explanation for the observed P coda rotations as well as the way to extract additional information from the use of co-seismic <b>rotational</b> <b>motions.</b> First, the effects of co-seismic tilts on ring laser measurements are quantified based on magnitude-amplitude relations and translation derived tilts. Then the phenomenon of scattering assuming three dimensional random media and topography that may generate the observed P coda rotations is investigated through analysis of observations and forward modelling. The partitioning of P and S energy indicated by the stabilization of the ratio of energies of the two is used to constrain scattering properties. Finally, an analytical approach focusing on the solution of plane waves in linear elastic anisotropic media is used to quantify the anisotropic behavior through the variations of rotational wavefield. The focus is on quasi-P waves and transverse isotropic media. Kelvin-Christoffel equation and the Thomson parameters, descriptive of the degree of anisotropy, are used. The obtained results show that 1) P-SH scattering in the random crust is the main cause of the P-coda observations; and 2) <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> contain additional information (at least) about scattering properties and anisotropic coefficients and that joint measurements of translational and <b>rotational</b> <b>motions</b> at only one point allow the extraction of additional information.
