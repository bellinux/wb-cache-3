30|$|It is {{important}} to notice {{that none of the}} described papers so far have considered the particular features of CRNs. In particular, neither call interruption due to the arrival of PUs, intra-cell spectrum handoff, nor the fluctuating nature of spectrum resource was considered. As stated in [7], there has been little investigation so far on the opportunistic spectrum access performance in the presence of inter-cell handoff calls. Most studies have focused considering a single CRN, and therefore, users’ mobility and inter-cell handoffs have been neither modeled nor evaluated. In [7], by considering a homogeneous cognitive radio multi-cellular system, both inter-cell handoff rate and forced termination probability of SUs are determined. Reference [20] extends the reported work in [7] by considering that instead of channel reservation, the queueing buffer is used to give both intra-handoff and inter-handoff SU calls priority over the initial SU calls. In [21], the performance of secondary users at the packet level in a cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>network</b> was analyzed, where the transmitter and receiver are not able to communicate directly. In [21], it is considered that packets are delay sensitive and can tolerate a limited amount of waiting time. Additionally, the effect of errors in spectrum sensing on the performance of SUs is addressed in [21]. On the other hand, in [22], multirate cognitive radio cellular networks where the users of each class have a different bandwidth requirement are considered. Two call admission control (CAC) policies are studied, and the system is modeled by considering as a multi-dimensional Markov process. An iterative algorithm to find the steady-state probability distribution and compute the performance measures is proposed. Finally, in our previous related work [23], the impact of mobility of both primary and secondary users on the performance of cognitive radio mobile cellular networks with real-time traffic is investigated. In [23], it is considered that all the involved time variables are modeled by exponentially negative random variables for both secondary and primary calls. However, no closed-form mathematical expressions are obtained and only exponentially distributed CDT and UST are considered in [7, 20 – 23]. Furthermore, channel holding times are not analyzed, and Erlang capacity is not addressed in [7, 20 – 23].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{new channel}} {{assignment}} algorithm, called the Viterbi-like algorithm (VLA), is proposed {{to solve the}} channel assignment problem in <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> <b>networks.</b> The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is step-by-step (sequential) channel assignment with the objectives of minimum bandwidth required at every step, subject to adjacent channel and cochannel separation constraints. The VLA provides the benefits of minimum required bandwidth, stability of solution, and fast execution time. The performance of the VLA is evaluated by computer simulation, applied first to 19 benchmark problems on channel assignment and then applied to study <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> <b>network</b> performance. Results from computer simulation studies show that bandwidth requirements by VLA closely match or are sometimes better {{than those of the}} existing channel assignment algorithms. Furthermore, it is found that execution of VLA is approximately two times faster than the local search algorithm—the existing channel assignment algorithm with the least bandwidth requirements. The combined advantages of minimum required bandwidth, stability of solution, and fast execution time make the VLA a useful candidate for <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> <b>network</b> planning.

30|$|Recently, {{implementation}} of cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> (CRCNs) {{has been investigated}} to solve both spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity [4, 5]. The main differences between traditional <b>cellular</b> <b>networks</b> and CRCNs lie in the so-called spectrum handoff, interruption due {{to the arrival of}} PUs (including the possibility of interruption of multiple sessions of SUs due to non-homogeneous bandwidth of PU and SU channels), and the fluctuating nature of spectrum resource because of the arrival and departure of PUs. In CRCNs, SUs are allowed to perform spectrum handoff within a given CR cell (a.k.a. intra-cell handoff) as well as inter-cell handoff among different CR cells [7]. Developing analytical models for the performance analysis of CRCNs that effectively capture relevant aspects of these complex networks represents a very challenging and important topic of research. This is the topic of research of the present paper. Specifically, teletraffic performance and channel holding time characterization of CRCNs under fixed-rate traffic with stringent-delay constraints are investigated.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn <b>radio</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>networks,</b> base {{transceiver}} station (BTS) {{powered by}} hybrid energy (solar/wind/fuel) has become an efficient and attractive solution to help reduce the use of fossil fuel based energy. Such hybrid energy BTSs have been deployed in remote areas with small wind turbines (SWT) located on top of BTS pylon or on a separate mast. Because megawatt WTs or wind farm disturb various radio systems (radars, TVs), the proximity between SWT and BTS raises questions about electromagnetic compatibility.

The {{objective of the}} primary network (PN) and secondary network (SN) is to maximize their profits while respecting a certain carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions threshold. In this study, the PN can switch off some of its base stations (BSs) powered by mircogrids, and hence leases the spectrum in the corresponding cells, to reduce its footprint. The corresponding users are roamed to the SN infrastructure. In return, the SN receives a certain roaming cost and its users can freely exploit the spectrum. We study two scenarios in which the profits are either separately or jointly maximized. In the disjoint maximization problem, two low complexity algorithms for PN and SN BS on/off switching are proposed to maximize the profit per CO 2 emissions utility and {{determine the amount of}} the shared bandwidth. In the joint maximization approach, the low complexity algorithm is based on maximizing the sum of weighted profits per CO 2.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an evolution framework of resource allocation by infection among secondary users (SUs) in an OFDMA-based cognitive <b>radio</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>networks.</b> Each primary user (PU) sells his extra sub-channels to SUs in his sensing range {{to achieve the}} highest payoff and each SU may come across another in his sensing range to make infection. We first analyze the sensing range to guarantee the connectivity of all SUs and then two different infection processes among SUs are considered. For the infection with local knowledge, each SU learns from the SU he meets with in his sensing range, who has larger bandwidth than that of himself, to achieve higher payoff. While in the case without local knowledge, each SU learns from another by probability which may not always help to achieve higher payoff each time. However, we prove the existence and convergence of evolutionary equilibrium (EE) for both cases, and show some interesting properties such as the impact of cheating of SUs in the above infection processes. Besides, we proposed two algorithms for the two infection process to converge to EE in a distributed manner. Simulation {{results show that the}} algorithms with local knowledge can equally share the extra resources among SUs efficiently, which is actually the overall optimal solution (OOS). While for the algorithm without local knowledge, we find that though EE exists, OOS cannot always be achieved. Furthermore, we optimize the second algorithm to make EE approximate to OOS. I...|$|R
