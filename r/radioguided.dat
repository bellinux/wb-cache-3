40|$|OBJECTIVE: To report oncological cases (excluding {{those related}} to breast cancer) for which <b>radioguided</b> surgery {{has been used in}} {{combination}} with the <b>Radioguided</b> Occult Lesion Localization technique. INTRODUCTION: <b>Radioguided</b> surgery enables a surgeon to identify lesions or tissues that have been preoperatively marked with radioactive substances. The <b>Radioguided</b> Occult Lesion Localization technique has been widely used to identify the sentinel lymph node and occult lesions in patients with breast cancer. However, few studies have reported the use of this technique for non-breast cancer pathologies. METHODOLOGY: In all cases, injection of Technecium- 99 m sulfur colloid was performed, directly inside or near by the suspicious lesion, guided by ultrasound or computed tomography, up to 36 hours prior to the surgical procedure. Intraoperative lesion detection was carried out using a gamma-probe. RESULTS: We report five oncology cases in which preoperative markings of the lesions were carried out using the <b>Radioguided</b> Occult Lesion Localization technique. The patients presented with the following: recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, cervical recurrence of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, recurrence of retroperitoneal sarcoma, lesions of the popliteal fossa, and recurrence of rhabdomyosarcoma of a thigh. In each case, the lesions that were marked preoperatively were ultimately successfully excised. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Radioguided</b> surgery {{has proven to be a}} safe and effective alternative for the management of oncology patients. The <b>Radioguided</b> Occult Lesion Localization technique can be useful in selected cases where suspect lesions may be difficult to identify intraoperatively, due to their dimensions or anatomical location. The procedure allows for more conservative excisions and reduces the surgery-related morbidity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} <b>radioguided</b> surgery, which was first {{developed}} some 60 years ago, {{involves the use}} of a radiation detection probe system for the intraoperative detection of radionuclides. The use of gamma detection probe technology in <b>radioguided</b> surgery has tremendously expanded and has evolved into what is now considered an established discipline within the practice of surgery, revolutionizing the surgical management of many malignancies, including breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer, as well as the surgical management of parathyroid disease. The impact of <b>radioguided</b> surgery on the surgical management of cancer patients includes providing vital and real-time information to the surgeon regarding the location and extent of disease, as well as regarding the assessment of surgical resection margins. Additionally, it has allowed the surgeon to minimize the surgical invasiveness of many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, while still maintaining maximum benefit to the cancer patient. In the current review, we have attempted to comprehensively evaluate the history, technical aspects, and clinical applications of <b>radioguided</b> surgery using gamma detection probe technology. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{systematically}} review literature, exploring the role of <b>radioguided</b> surgery with iodine-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in resection of neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, COCHRANE, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and references of key articles were searched to identify potentially relevant studies. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included. A total of 130 procedures in 120 patients were performed. Ninety percent of included studies concerned case reports or case series. It is described that <b>radioguided</b> surgery with iodine-labeled MIBG can improve the quality of macroscopic resection of neuroendocrine tumors in selected cases, ie, in cases where the tumor is small, nonpalpable, difficult to visualize on conventional imaging studies, or located in an area with adhesional scar tissue from previous surgery. However, in a substantial number of cases the gamma probe failed due to technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Since there is limited evidence that <b>radioguided</b> surgery contributes substantially in resection of neuroendocrine tumors, we cannot advocate its use in general. However, we can conclude that it can seemingly improve the quality of resection in selected cases. When <b>radioguided</b> surgery is performed in neuroendocrine tumors, we advocate the use of I to label MIBG...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the feasibility and long-term results of focused <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy using a "low" 37 MBq (1 mCi) 99 mTc-sestamibi dose protocol compared to conventional "high 740 MBq (20 mCi) 99 mTc-sestamibi dose protocol" in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The data of focused <b>radioguided</b> surgery obtained in a group of 320 consecutive PHPT patients with high probability of the presence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) were studied. All patients underwent preoperative imaging work-up of double-tracer 99 mTc-pertechnetate/ 99 mTc-sestamibi subtraction parathyroid scintigraphy (Sestamibi scintigraphy) and high resolution neck ultrasound (US). In 301 / 320 patients (96. 6 %) focused minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> surgery was successfully performed by administering a "low" 37 MBq (1 mCi) 99 mTc-sestamibi dose in the operating room 10 minutes before operation. No major intraoperative complications were recorded. Focused <b>radioguided</b> surgery required a mean time of 32 min and a mean hospital stay of 1. 2 days. Local anesthesia was applied in 75 patients, 66 of whom (88 %) were patients older than 65 years with comorbidities contraindicating general anesthesia. No case of persistent or recurrent PHPT was observed during post-surgical follow-up (range = 18 – 70 months; mean +/- SD = 15. 3 +/- 9. 1 months). Radiation exposure dose to the operating surgeon was 1. 2 μSi/hour with the "low 37 MBq (1 mCi) 99 mTc-sestamibi dose", and less than 1. 0 μSi/hour for the other operating-room personnel. Focused low dose <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy is a safe and effective means to localize parathyroid adenomas in patients affected by solitary PA thus reducing by 20 fold the radiation exposure dose to the patients and operating room personnel...|$|E

40|$|AIM: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} low dose (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi administration for <b>radioguided</b> parathyroid surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). METHODS: Three hundred consecutive PHPT patients were studied between September, 1999 and July, 2003. Pre-operative work-up included (99 m) Tc-pertechnetate/(99 m) Tc-Sestamibi subtraction scintigraphy and high resolution ultrasonography (US). 37 MBq of (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi was injected i. v. in the operating suite approximately 10 min prior {{to the beginning of}} the surgical procedure for intraoperative radiolocalization; quick parathyroid hormone (QPTH) assays were performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and seven of the 211 patients selected for minimally-invasive <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy (MIRP) were successfully treated for a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) through a 2 - 2. 5 cm skin incision (mean operative time 35 min, mean hospital stay 1. 2 days). In the 89 patients selected for traditional bilateral neck exploration (BNE), <b>radioguided</b> surgery was not as successful in the identification of the PA, especially in patients with (99 m) Tc-Sestamibi-avid thyroid nodules. Nevertheless, the combination of probe and QPTH measurement was very helpful in patients with multigland disease.

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 to 15 years surgery of primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (PHPT) {{moved from the}} wide bilateral neck exploration to various types of limited neck exploration ranging from unilateral neck surgery to minimally invasive approaches as the minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy. In contrast with the bilateral neck exploration, an accurate preoperative localizing imaging, which is mainly based on (99 m) TC-sestamibi scintigraphy, is mandatory when planning a concise parathyroidectomy. Following imaging criteria, {{only a fraction of}} PHPT patients accounting for approximately 60 % to 70 % of all PHPT patients can be eligible for a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Only PHPT patients with a high probability to be affected by a solitary parathyroid adenoma showing a high (99 m) TC-sestamibi uptake and with a normal thyroid gland should be offer a minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy. The (99 m) TC-sestamibi SPECT technique and the double-tracer 123 -iodine or (99 m) TC-pertecnetate/(99 m) TC-sestamibi scintigraphic technique are the most sensitive and accurate preoperative imaging modalities and their utilization is recommended when considering a minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy. Two main intraoperative procedures for the minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> surgery have been described: the single-day protocol and the different-day protocol. In the single-day protocol a 740 MBq dose of (99 m) TC-sestamibi is injected to the patient, scintigraphic imaging is obtained by dual-phase technique and then the patient is operated on within approximately 3 hours from radio-tracer injection. In the different-day protocol, a double-tracer parathyroid scintigraphy is obtained some days before surgery with the aim of better planning the type and extension of intervention. The day of intervention, for the purpose of <b>radioguided</b> surgery only, a low 37 MBq dose of (99 m) TC-sestamibi is injected to the patient in the operating theatre a few minutes before the start of intervention. The main advantages of minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy over the traditional wide bilateral neck exploration can be resumed as follows: a shortening in the operating and recovery time, possibility of local anesthesia, possibility of ambulatory surgery or same-day discharge, less postsurgical hypocalcemia, less postsurgical pain, favourable cosmetic results, benefits from a cost-analysis point of view...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intratumoral {{injection}} of nanocolloid for lymphatic mapping enables therapeutic excision of clinically occult breast cancer {{with the aid}} of a gamma ray detection probe. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the success rate of <b>radioguided</b> tumor excision in addition to a guide wire and to identify factors predicting clear margins. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty five consecutive patients with invasive occult breast cancer underwent <b>radioguided</b> tumor excision after intratumoral {{injection of}} 99 mTc-nanocolloid guided by ultrasound or stereotaxis. A localization wire was inserted; subsequently scintigraphy was performed (group 1). Results were compared with retrospective data from 67 consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic wire-directed excision alone (group 2). Factors predicting clear margin (> 1 mm) were determined in a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Adequate margins were obtained in 83 (group 1) and 64 % (group 2; p = 0. 014) respectively. The invasive component was performed in 4 and 14 patients, respectively. Factors predictive of clear margins were decreasing pathologic tumor diameter (p = 0. 035), increasing weight of specimen (p = 0. 046), absence of micro-calcifications (p = 0. 004), and absence of carcinoma in situ component (p = 0. 024). <b>Radioguided</b> excision was an independent predictor of complete excision of the invasive component (p = 0. 012).

40|$|Background: <b>Radioguided</b> surgery using 99 m-Technetium-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) {{has been}} {{recommended}} for the surgical treatment of mediastinal parathyroid adenomas. However, high myocardial 99 mTc-MIBI uptake may limit {{the feasibility of}} <b>radioguided</b> surgery in aortopulmonary window parathyroid adenoma. Case presentation: Two female patients aged 72 (# 1) and 79 years (# 2) with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenomas in the aortopulmonary window were operated by transsternal <b>radioguided</b> surgery. After intravenous injection of 370 MBq 99 mTc-MIBI at start of surgery, the maximum radioactive intensity (as counts per second) was measured over several body regions using a gamma probe before and after removal of the parathyroid adenoma. Relative radioactivity was calculated {{in relation to the}} measured ex vivo radioactivity of the adenoma, which was set to 1. 0. Both patients were cured by uneventful removal of aortopulmonary window parathyroid adenomas of 4400 (# 1) and 985 mg (# 2). Biochemical cure was documented by intraoperative measurement of parathyroid hormone as well as follow-up examination. Ex vivo radioactivity over the parathyroid adenomas was 196 (# 1) and 855 counts per second (# 2). Before parathyroidectomy, relative radioactivity over the aortopulmonary window versus the heart was found at 1. 3 versus 2. 6 (# 1) and 1. 8 versus 4. 8 (# 2). After removal of the adenomas, radioactivity within the aortopulmonary window was only slightly reduced. Conclusion: High myocardial uptake of 99 mTc-MIBI limits the feasibility of <b>radioguided</b> surgery in aortopulmonary parathyroid adenoma. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the clinical efficacy of the "low sestamibi dose" (LSD) protocol to perform thyroid and parathyroid <b>radioguided</b> surgery in a large series of patients homogeneously studied and operated on by the same surgeon. The LSD protocol was initially developed in our center to cure primary hyperparathyroid (PHPT) patients with a high likelihood of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) by minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> surgery (MIRS). Since then, the same protocol has been applied to differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with 131 I-negative, but sestamibi-positive, locoregional recurrent disease in order to obtain radical <b>radioguided</b> extirpation of tumoral lesions at reoperation. Study Design: We reviewed the clinical charts of 453 consecutive patients referred at the surgical department at Padova University (Padova, Italy) to investigate a PHPT or a DTC recurrence: 336 patients (74. 2 %) met the inclusion criteria for <b>radioguided</b> surgery, and these patients were analyzed for the {{aim of this}} study. There were 298 patients affected by PHPT with a high likelihood of a solitary sestamibipositive PA and 38 DTC patients affected by 131 I-negative, but sestamibi-positive, locoregional recurrence. All patients underwent a preoperative imaging work-up, including sestamibi scintigraphy (doubletracer subtraction scan in PHPT patients and single-tracer, wash-out scan in DTC patients) and high-resolution neck ultrasonography (US). The LSD protocol we developed consists of the intravenous injection of a very low (1 mCi) sestamibi dose in the operating theater just 10 minutes before commencing intervention for the purpose of <b>radioguided</b> surgery only. At variance with the traditional "high (20 – 25 mCi) sestamibi dose (HSD) " protocol in which imaging and <b>radioguided</b> surgery are obtained in the same day, in the LSD protocol, imaging and <b>radioguided</b> surgery are performed in different days. The LSD protocol allows some advantages over the HSD protocol: (1) more time for acquiring and interpreting preoperative imaging (planar scintigraphy, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], US); (2) an accurate selection of patients to whom MIRS is offered, especially in countries where the prevalence of nodular goiter with sestamibi-avid thyroid nodules (exclusion criteria for MIRS) is relatively high, as in mid–south-European countries; (3) it facilitates the work planning in the operating theater (bilateral neck exploration requires an operating time of at least double to that of MIRS); and (4) the radiation exposure dose to operating theater personnel is very low—substantially negligible, using the LSD protocol: This aspect assumes great importance in countries where radioproteximetric rules are stringent, as in Europe. Results: PHPT patients. MIRS was successfully performed by a 1. 5 – 2 -cm skin incision in 287 of 298 PHPT patients (96. 3 %) in whom such an approach was scheduled on the basis of preoperative imaging, including 41 of 57 patients (71. 9 %) who had previously received thyroid or unsuccessful parathyroid surgery in another center. No case of major intraoperative complication was recorded. No case of persistent or recurrent PHPT was observed during postsurgical follow-up. DTC patients. A total of 79 metastatic lesions were intraoperatively detected by the gamma probe and successfully removed (68 of them had been correctly visualized at preoperative sestamibi scintigraphy). During subsequent follow-up, 18 patients (72 %) were considered disease-free, whereas 7 had persistent disease (increased serum thyroglobulin levels). The radiation exposure dose to the surgeon using the LSD protocol was 1. 2 uSi/hour, that is, 20 – 30 -fold lower than that delivered with the HSD protocol used for PHPT patients and with the 131 I protocol used for DTC patients with recurrence. Conclusions: On the basis of our data, it can be concluded that the LSD protocol is a safe and effective protocol to perform in both MIRS in PHPT patients and <b>radioguided</b> reoperation in DTC patients with 131 I-negative recurrence. Furthermore, from a radioproteximetric point of view, in comparison with other <b>radioguided</b> protocols used for the same purposes, the LSD protocol minimizes the radiation-exposure dose to the surgeon and operating theater personnel...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of a system {{prototype}} {{that can be used}} as an auxiliary tool in <b>radioguided</b> surgery methods. The use of new technologies in <b>radioguided</b> surgery concern the exact positioning of the lesion to be exerted. This is possible, in operation theatre, thanks to portable scintigraphics devices or to radiation counters. Due to lack of a coordinate system in the operation field, it is difficult for the surgeon to localize the pathology after removing the detection instrument. The system proposed in this paper is composed mainly of three elements: a handheld, high-resolution gamma camera with a small Field Of View (FOV) based on Hamamatsu R 8900 - 00 -C 12 Position Sensitive Photomultiplier Tube (PSPMT), a laser scanner for the reconstruction of the body district and a stereoscopic system for contactless surgical tool tracking. Analyzing a set of scintigraphic images, taken from different projections, it is possible to localize the three-dimensional position of the lesion. Thanks {{to the use of the}} scanner and image fusion techniques, the pathology is shown on a PC monitor correctly positioned with respect to the body surface. Using a couple of stereoscopic cameras, the surgical tool can be tracked and shown on the same monitor, so that the surgeon can know the instantaneous relative position between the tool and the pathology. Exploiting these systems, a navigation system prototype has been developed that is suitable for <b>radioguided</b> surgical application. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A 32 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{diagnosed}} with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Staging FDG PET-CT detected a large right axillary lymph node conglomerate and splenic manifestation. Interim PET-CT following two cycles of ABVD chemotherapy revealed good metabolic response {{with the exception of}} a single axillary lymph node. A second "interim" PET-CT after two further cycles showed a similar result. A biopsy of the metabolically active non-palpable lymph node was performed using <b>radioguided</b> occult lesion localization (ROLL) with ultrasound guidance. The lymph node was successfully removed by minimally invasive surgery. Histological evaluation of the lymph node revealed a T cell-rich diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Based on this finding, a more aggressive treatment regimen followed by high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue was adopted. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a lymphoma case in which the ROLL method was used in the <b>radioguided</b> biopsy of a chemoresistant lymph node detected by interim FDG PET-CT...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chylous fistula {{occurring}} after {{head and}} neck or thoracic surgery is an uncommon but well-described complication, with a reported incidence of 1 % to 2. 5 %. Conservative management can be successful and consists of dietary measures combined with suction drainage. This article reports on percutaneous embolization of the thoracic duct through catheterization of the retroperitoneal lymph vessels. METHODS: Two patients, in whom conservative management for cervical chylous fistula failed, underwent lymphangiography with opacification of the thoracic duct, followed by <b>radioguided</b> catheterization and embolization. RESULTS: Embolization was successful in both patients. In 1 patient the procedure had to be repeated once to stop the chylous drainage. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Radioguided</b> percutaneous catheterization and embolization of the retroperitoneal lymph vessels offers an excellent treatment option for patients with persistent chylous fistulas after failure of conservative management. We revised our stepwise management protocol (de Gier, Head Neck 1996; 18 : 347 - 351) and now consider this procedure as the secondary intervention ste...|$|E
40|$|Biopsy of the {{sentinel}} lymphnode (SLNB), {{the first}} lymphnode to receive lymphatic drainage {{from the primary}} tumor, accurately predicts the axillary lymph node status and, when negative, obviates the need for axillary lymphadenectomy (AL). The {{aim of this study}} was, to verify the SLN localization in breast cancer through preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma-probe, as well as to demonstrate the benefits of such techniques in preventing complications of AL. Medical records of 228 patients with breast carcinoma, who were underwent SLN localization and, <b>radioguided</b> surgery, from March 2005 to December 2007 were analyzed retrospectively. Data regarding age, tumor characteristic, breast involved, type of surgery, radiopharmaceutical drainage pattern, axillary assessment (SLNB or AL) and number of lymph nodes dissected were collected. It was ascertained that <b>radioguided</b> surgery is a selective method of axillary assessment in breast cancer, which makes this technique a safe alternative to radical assessment of total dissection of axillary lymph nodes and its subsequent complications...|$|E
40|$|No sponsorships or {{competing}} interests have been disclosed for this article. Objective. To better understand relationships of parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, adenoma gamma counts, and adenoma mass in patients undergoing minimally <b>radioguided</b> invasive parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism from single-gland disease. Study Design. A prospective review of 104 patients operated on {{by a single}} surgeon. Setting. University tertiary hospital. Subjects. Adults who have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a single gland. Results. There were 23 men and 81 women {{with an average age}} of 63 years. The mean (SD) adenoma mass was 0. 78 (0. 69) g (median, 0. 57 g). The mean (SD) percent of back-ground for the adenoma was 120. 2 (90. 5). Preoperative PTH and percent of background gamma count of the ade-noma showed a likely correlation with a Spearman r value of 0. 2039 and a P value of. 037. There were significant cor-relations between both percent of background of the ade-noma and adenoma mass (Spearman r = 0. 4991 and P 0 ̇ 001). Preoperative PTH and adenoma mass also showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0. 308 and P =. 002). Conclusion. There exist correlations between gland mass, radioactivity, and PTH level. Adenoma radiation counts {{do not appear to be}} a proxy for changes in PTH levels mea-sured during surgery as has been reported. Intraoperative PTH has been shown by others not to be necessary when doing <b>radioguided</b> parathyroid surgery if the Norman rule is observed. However, a <b>radioguided</b> technique and intraoperative PTH can provide complementary informa-tion in making an assessment of completion of parathyr-oid procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of early parathyroid SPECT combined with quantitative analysis as compared with planar imaging in pa-tients undergoing minimally invasive <b>radioguided</b> surgery. Methods: A total of 52 consecutive patients with primary hy-perparathyroidism underwent planar and SPECT parathyroid scintigraphy 2 – 5 d before surgery. Each patient had a single-tracer dual-phase technique using 99 mTc-methoxyisobutylisoni-trile (99 mTc-MIBI) and a double-tracer subtraction technique us-ing a delayed 99 mTc-pertechnetate scan. Immediately after the first 99 mTc-MIBI planar image, a SPECT study was acquired. Before <b>radioguided</b> parathyroidectomy, each patient was rein-jected with 99 mTc-MIBI. Serum calcium levels were available for all patents before surgery and at 8 and 24 h after surgery. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were also available for all patients. Quantitative analysis was performed using the average count ratio of parathyroid to left thyroid lobe, right thyroid lobe, and maximum thyroid activity. All patients had histopathologic examination of the removed glands. Results: The average time for <b>radioguided</b> surgery was 30 min (range, 20 – 40 min). Post-surgical calcium levels correlated significantly with the adenoma weight (r 0. 5; P 0. 016). Combined planar scintigraphy correctly identified 41 adenomas (79 %). SPECT increased the sensitivity to 96 %. SPECT was superior to planar imaging in 9 patients, mainly in patients with ectopic adenomas or with multi-nodular goiters. Gland size did not affect significantly the de-tectability of SPECT. 99 mTc-MIBI retention was noted in only 31 adenomas (60 %). The average uptake ratios of parathyroid counts to the left lobe, right lobe, and maximum thyroid activit...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Medullary thyroid {{cancer is}} a rare carcinoma. Surgery is the only {{curative}} treatment and since cervical lymphnodes metastases are frequent and can occur at an early stage, a standardized central lymphnode dissection is associated to total thyroidectomy. However, the extent of lymphadenectomy to the lateral neck lynphnodes remains debated. To reduce the extent of lymphnode excision, the sentinel node biopsy {{has been used as}} an accurate technique to assess the status of the lymphnodes in the regional drainage basin in solid tumors, and more recently, in thyroid carcinoma. In this case report, we show the utility of the <b>radioguided</b> biopsy of the sentinel lymphnode in the surgical management of the medullary thyrod cancer. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 24 -year-old Caucasian, Italian woman with a sporadic medullary thyroid microcarcinoma occasionally detected by neck ultrasound and diagnosed by high serum calcitonin level and fine needle aspiration cytology. There was no ultrasound evidence of lymphnode involvement both in central and lateral compartment of the neck. We performed a preoperative mapping of the the sentinel lymphnodes by the injection of technetium- 99 m radiolabelled albumin nanocolloids in the thyroid nodule. Then our patient underwent total thyroidectomy combined with <b>radioguided</b> biopsy of the sentinel lymphnodes. Histology confirmed the presence of the medullary thyroid cancer and revealed micrometastases only in two sentinel lymphnodes detected in right lateral compartment of the neck so an ipsilateral lateral neck dissection besides the central neck dissection was performed at the end of operation. Basal and pentagastrin-stimulated serum calcitonin level was undetectable during the follow-up investigations. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case that shows the utility of the <b>radioguided</b> SLN biopsy for the accurate staging of the cervical lymphnode involvement in patient with sporadic medullary thyroid microcarcinoma. Total thyrodectomy and central neck dissection is recommended for all patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, but the indication for the lateral neck dissection is still controversial. The <b>radioguided</b> SLN biopsy technique could be a useful tool to perform the dissection only in those patients with proven lateral neck lymphnode involvement and reduce the extention of the lateral lymphnode excision and the incidence of related complications...|$|E
