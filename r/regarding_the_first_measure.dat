30|$|There are {{two common}} {{performance}} measures used for police district design: the average response {{time and the}} variation of workload [4]. Quick response to citizen calls for service can 1) improve the chances of catching the offender at the scene or nearby 2) increase the changes of identify and locate witnesses, 3) provide immediate gathering of physical evidence, 4) provide immediate lifesaving first aid, 5) enhances the reputation of police department, 6) creates citizen satisfaction with the police [5, 6]. The spatial distribution and allocation of police cars to districts affect both performance measures. In a 1971 study of the New York Police Department {{more than half of}} all dispatches were inter-sector dispatches (between districts). Usually, the nearest police car responds to the CFS incident so it may cross the patrol boundaries to respond. The average response time for these inter-sector responses was approximately 40 % greater than that for intra-sector responses and the average travel distance was about 53 % greater [7]. This large proportion of inter-sector cases indicates that the district design may not be efficient with <b>regard</b> to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>measure,</b> response time.|$|R
