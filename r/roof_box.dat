5000|$|The entrances at many passage tombs {{appear to}} have been {{temporarily}} sealed in a variety of ways: boulders, slabs, blocks, planks or wooden frameworks, as evidenced by postholes by the entrance. Maeshowe has a recess near to the passage entrance that holds a carefully balanced portal stone that can be pivoted into place. [...] This leaves a narrow gap between the top of this block and the passage lintels, thereby allowing light to enter even when the passageway is impassable to people. [...] In contrast, the <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> at Newgrange is situated above the passageway, as is a comparable feature within Cairn G at Carrowkeel. These apertures could be operated independently to the passages. Even in the absence of such devices only minor additions - stone blocks, a hole in a wooden plank, or an animal hide hung between posts at the entrance - are required to convert the monument into an operational camera obscura. The passage serves as a conduit for light and the rear of the chamber acts as a projection surface.|$|E
40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the influence of}} aerodynamic factors of newly designed <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> at various positions over different car geometries. A baseline design of <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> was created and tested using MIRA reference cars in three different configurations at various positions to understand {{the behavior of the}} flow. A scaled design of <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> was also considered to understand the trends at various positions. Further investigation was conducted by varying the shape of the box. There was a lack of information in the literature on this subject. The existing data was insufficient to predict the optimum position of a <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> on a vehicle to reduce aerodynamic drag force. This project includes the analysis of a baseline design of <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> and its design variation which was inspired from Thule Motion 800 using CATIA V 5 R 20. It also includes the analysis at various positions in three perpendicular directions over MIRA vehicles. The key factor analyzed throughout the project was drag coefficient. In parallel, moment coefficients and flow behavior around the car and box were also evaluated. The numerical investigation of flow around MIRA cars and <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> were carried out using Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox - Star-CCM+ V 8. 04. Due to the large number of experiments required to understand the influence of the position variation of <b>roof</b> <b>box,</b> Design of Experiments (DOE) using Taguchi method and general full factorial method in MINITAB were employed. Using Taguchi method, two-thirds of the simulations can be reduced. Out of the three geometric shape vehicles tested, the <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> has the highest influence on fastback car and least effect on squareback car. The average variation of drag due to <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> on squareback and fastback cars were 3 % and 30 % respectively. It was observed that there was a difference of 20 % drag between the lowest and highest drag obtained with fastback car and that of squareback car was 5 %. Nearly 6 kW excess engine power was required to pull the fastback car along with fully loaded <b>roof</b> <b>box.</b> Due to the variation in design of <b>roof</b> <b>box,</b> 6 % drag reduction was obtained on fastback car. Even if the individual drag due to <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> was higher, the overall drag remains less due to the interaction of flow between car and <b>roof</b> <b>box.</b> The results from various positions of <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> were compared using both methods in MINITAB. The result shows that Taguchi method was suitable {{to reduce the number of}} simulations in external aerodynamics...|$|E

40|$|This work {{is about}} the lesson learnt from the {{analysis}} of the damages caused to some churches by the strong earthquake, which struck Northern Italy in the year 2004. Focus is paid to some mechanisms which are not well known in the literature: the excessive and differential rocking of neighbouring transverse arches, the differential deflection of single leaf vault rings, the tie over-tension induced by the transverse arch rocking. In the paper, the structural solutions appositely studied to repair and to reduce the structure seismic vulnerability of these buildings are presented. Among these solutions: internal perimeter ties, lightweight wooden <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> structure, lightweight spandrel ribs are illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{vulnerability}} of single-leaf vaults has repeatedly {{been observed in}} the aftermath of past earthquakes. Major vault damage or even collapse may follow the onset of mechanisms such as the indirect bending of the vault crown caused by the unconstrained rocking of the abutments, the shear failure of the vault lunettes induced by possible differential rocking of the supporting masonries, and the direct differential bending induced by the inertia forces acting as a uniformly distributed horizontal load along the vault crown. Unlike other mechanisms, which can be inhibited by traditional global retrofit interventions aimed at triggering a box-like seismic response of the existing building, limiting direct bending requires targeted measures on the vault crown. In this paper, extrados lightweight plywood restraining structures applying passive confinement actions are conceived to delay the onset of the vault direct bending failure mechanism. The reinforcement is designed as a 3 -hinged arch, hinged-constrained at the springing and at the vault key section to enable small relative displacements of the vault springing, which may follow the deformation of any internal ties or <b>roof</b> <b>box</b> structure. The technique is a lightweight and dry solution that does not require specialised labour; it is reversible and minimally impairs the structure's integrity, thus respecting major restoration principles. The effectiveness of the solution is verified through an experimental study on the behaviour of a strengthened single-leaf vault, also in the case of possible relative displacements of the abutments. A special pivoting testing frame is conceived to apply cyclic, uniformly distributed inertia-like forces. The strengthened vault is shown to substantially outperform the response of an unreinforced single leaf vault, tested in a previous research study...|$|E

40|$|This report {{primarily}} {{investigates the}} factors that affect fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions which are not accounted for in the current type approval test and result in a shortfall between type approval and real-world fuel consumption or the corresponding CO 2 emission values. A comprehensive literature review is carried out, in which we examine the available information and aim to provide qualitative and quantitative data. Where information is e insufficient, we point out the gap in knowledge. In addition, we have examined by means of simulation the significance of several factors that may change during every-day operation and may depend either on the driver or on external conditions. Several factors were identified affecting the in-use fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions resulting in a shortfall between the type approval and real-world values. These include the increased electrical power load (e. g. A/C, steering assist), aerodynamic alterations (<b>roof</b> <b>box,</b> aerofoils), ambient conditions (temperature, wind, rain and altitude), driving behavior (aggressive driving, driver training), vehicle condition (lubrication, tyre condition), increased vehicle mass (passengers, additional equipment), road conditions (road surface, traffic conditions). They are complemented by so-called "flexibilities" associated with the existing NEDC-based type approval procedure. The combined effect of the different factors affecting CO 2 emissions,, although not fully cumulative, can result in shortfall values ranging between 25 % and 35 %, based on information collected, the calculations run and the assumptions adopted in this study. These figures {{are in line with}} other literature sources where shortfall ranges from 20 % up to 50 % compared to the official certification value are reported. The per-passenger CO 2 performance significantly improves when the occupancy rate is considered, hence a separate analysis was performed to this end. It can be concluded that due to the increase complexity of modern vehicles, the increasing number of passenger comfort systems and the great variety of possible operating conditions, it is difficult to capture the real-world fuel consumption with an exhaustive accuracy. It is expected that the introduction of the new test protocol (WLTP) will be a step forward in closing this shortfall. A separate analysis on the expected WLTP impact on CO 2 is presented. It cannot be overlooked that driver behavior is an important element and therefore additional measures, in particular proper driver training and information, can help to reduce the discrepancy observed by drivers between their own in-use CO 2 emissions from passenger cars compared to the test results.
