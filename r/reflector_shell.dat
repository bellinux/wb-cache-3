40|$|Stress and {{deformation}} {{analysis of}} thermally loaded fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures used in aeronautical engineering {{was carried out}} by modelling the micromechanical interaction between fibers and plastics. Packing modes and packing models have been classified and the strain generation has been determined starting with a general instationary solution and non-linear material characteristics. By comparison calculations reference models have been found which are suited for a practical analytical treatment. The analytical solution describes the influence of the nonlinearity of material characteristics and the influence of thermomechanical coupling, and it allows an exact evaluation of the states of failure in laminated layer structures. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by thermal optimization of a torus tank and of a sandwich <b>reflector</b> <b>shell</b> for satellites.

40|$|Scheduled for a June 2001 launch, the Microwave Anisotropy Probe’s (MAP) {{mission is}} to study in detail the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation temperature fluctuations of the universe. The cosmic microwave background is the remnant afterglow of the Big Bang, and the tiny temperature differences from place to place on the sky provides a wealth of information about the basic nature of our universe. The observatory consists of dual back-to-back Gregorian optics and dual differential pseudo-correlation microwave radiometers. MAP will scan the sky over a 22 to 90 Ghz spectrum during a 26 month mission at L 2. To achieve the necessary dimensional stability and stringent total weight limits, the Thermal Reflector System (TRS) consists of dual primary and secondary lightweight composite reflectors mounted to a lightweight but rigid composite truss structure. Design features include the use of lightweight graphite spread fabric and honeycomb core for the <b>reflector</b> <b>shells</b> and stiffening structure, and a bonded mortise and tenon truss structure using two complementary composite materials. Qualification of the TRS included in-situ photogrammetry measurements while at 40 K and 370 K, sine burst and sine sweep dynamic loading, and acoustic excitation. Materials employed, coupon test data, design and construction, and qualification testing will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Future {{generations of}} space-based telescopes will require {{increasingly}} large primary reflectors, with very tight optical-quality tolerances. However, as their size grow, {{it becomes more}} and more difficult to meet the requirements, due to the manufacturing complexity and the associated costs. Chapters 2 and 3 propose two concepts of Adaptive Optics deformable mirrors, intended to be used as secondary corrector to compensate for manufacturing errors, gravity release and thermal distortion of large lightweight primary mirrors of space telescopes: (i) A scalable segmented bimorph mirror, based on independent PZT patches glued on Silicon wafers, providing a large number of degrees of freedom, a low mass while overcoming the problem of a low resonance mode; and (ii) A monolithic bimorph mirror, controlled by an array of independent electrodes, done by laser ablation on a single PZT patch. The modelling, the control strategy and the technological aspects are described. The performances of the manufactured prototypes are demonstrated experimentally. These prototypes have been developed in the framework of the ESA project, Bimorph Adaptive Large Optical Mirror Demonstrator (BIALOM). Chapter 4 introduces alternative designs, allowing to face the thermal distortion inherent to the bimorph architecture. They are compared in terms of stroke, voltage budget and first resonance frequency. These designs are required to be controlled in both directions using only positive voltages. Finally, the last chapter explores the feasibility of the shape control of a small size active thin <b>shell</b> <b>reflector</b> (with double curvature). The prototype is intended to be a technology demonstrator of a future large and very light active primary reflector. The behavior of the shell is studied through numerical simulations, and a preliminary design is proposed. This investigation is carried out in the framework of the ESA project: Multilayer Adaptive Thin <b>Shell</b> <b>Reflectors</b> (MATS).

40|$|The mesh {{reflector}} is {{the only}} type of large, in-space deployable antenna that has successfully flown in space. However, state-of-the-art large deployable mesh antenna systems are RF-frequency-limited by both global shape accuracy and local surface quality. The limitations of mesh reflectors stem from two factors. First, at higher frequencies, the porosity and surface roughness of the mesh results in loss and scattering of the signal. Second, the mesh material {{does not have any}} bending stiffness and thus cannot be formed into true parabolic (or other desired) shapes. To advance the deployable reflector technology at high RF frequencies from the current state-of-the-art, significant improvements need to be made in three major aspects: a high-stability and highprecision deployable truss; a continuously curved RF reflecting surface (the function of the surface as well as its first derivative are both continuous); and the RF reflecting surface should be made of a continuous material. To meet these three requirements, the Membrane <b>Shell</b> <b>Reflector</b> Segment (MSRS) antenna was developed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a concept for a deployable structure to position and support elastic thin <b>shell</b> <b>reflector</b> segments. The structure consists of rigid structural members and compliant hinges arranged in {{an array of}} quadrilateral reticulations. Compliant hinges allow the ability for the structure to deploy into non-planar configurations without binding. The hinge locations on the non-planar surface were iteratively determined to minimize the intersecting angle error, enabling the use of identical hinge designs. The focal length-to-diameter ratio was varied to characterize the effect on the configuration error parameters. Ratios down to 0. 25 are conceivable with the proposed deployable structure architecture.

40|$|This {{innovation}} {{has been}} developed to improve the resolutions of future spacebased active and passive microwave antennas for earth-science remote sensing missions by maintaining surface figure precisions of large membrane/thin-shell reflectors during orbiting. The intention is for these sensing instruments to be deployable at orbit altitudes one or two orders of magnitude higher than Low Earth Orbit (LEO), but still being able to acquire measurements at spatial resolution and sensitivity {{similar to those of}} LEO. Because active and passive microwave remote sensors are able to penetrate through clouds to acquire vertical profile measurements of geophysical parameters, it is desirable to elevate them to the higher orbits to obtain orbital geometries that offer large spatial coverage and more frequent observations. This capability is essential for monitoring and for detailed understanding of the life cycles of natural hazards, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, flash floods, and tsunamis. Major components of this high-precision antenna-surface-control system include a membrane/thin <b>shell</b> <b>reflector,</b> a metrology sensor, a controller, actuators, and corresponding power amplifier and signal conditioning electronics (see figure). Actuators are attached {{to the back of the}} reflector to produce contraction/ expansion forces to adjust the shape of the thin-material reflector. The wavefront-sensing metrology system continuously measures the surface figure of the reflector, converts the surface figure to digital data and feeds the data to the controller. The controller determines the control parameters and generates commands to the actuator system. The flexible, piezoelectric polymer actuators are thus activated, providing the control forces needed to correct any distortions that exist in the reflector surface. Piezoelectric polymer actuators are very thin and flexible. They can be implemented on the back of the membrane/thin-shell reflector without introducing significant amounts of mass or stiffness to the reflector. They can be rolled up or folded to accommodate the packaging needed for launch. An analytical model of the system, which includes the membrane reflector, actuator, and controller {{has been developed}} to investigate the functionality of this control system on a 35 -meter-diameter membrane reflector. The performance of this system under external disturbances such as in space thermal loads and W-error due to inflation has been investigated. A subscale breadboard has been developed, and the functionality of this control concept has been demonstrated by this breadboard...|$|R
