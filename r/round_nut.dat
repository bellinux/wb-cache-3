50|$|The seed heads, or infructescences, of Leucadendron are woody cone-like structures. This {{gave rise}} to their generic common name cone-bush. The cones contain {{numerous}} seeds. The seed morphology is varied and reflects subgeneric groupings within the genus. A few such as the Silvertree, Leucadendron argenteum have a silky-haired parachute, enabling the large <b>round</b> <b>nut</b> to be dispersed by wind. A few are rodent dispersed, cached by rats, and a few have elaiosomes and are dispersed by ants. About half the species store the seeds in fire-proof cones and release them only after a fire has killed the plant {{or at least the}} branch bearing the cone. Many such species hardly recruit naturally except after fires.|$|E

The golden age of coffee, which accounted for 80 % of export revenues before the civil war, is now {{drawing to a close}} in this small, land-locked country. The fall in world prices, together with climate-related problems have disheartened many farmers, who are now turning to new crops (roses, vetiver, passion fruit) in an effort to penetrate more export-oriented markets. A case in point is a project to grow macadamia nuts (Macadamia ternifolia) launched by ISABU, the agricultural research institute in Burundi. Served as a snack, the white kernel of this small <b>round</b> <b>nut</b> is increasingly sought after in Western markets. Its extremely fine oil is prized for cosmetic use. The Burundi government has made a US$ 250, 000 (206, 000) grant to create a nursery containing several thousand macadamia saplings. Each farmer will receive 20 small trees, which, in 2 -years time, should yield between 400 and 800 kg of nuts. The shelled nut currently fetches US$ 12 (about 10) a kilo on the international market.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Best scan {{available}} for pages with "screen shots". Originals are dark. Heritability {{in the narrow}} sense and in the broad sense, variance components and correlation coefficients are important genetic parameters in a breeding program. The estimates of these parameters can provide important information for a breeder {{in the selection of}} parents, the most efficient design for evaluation of seedlings and advanced selections and the choice of selection strategy to improve many target traits simultaneously. In addition, histograms showing the distributions of the traits in offspring may provide additional information about parent combinations for the improvement of target traits. The Oregon State University hazelnut breeding program is developing improved varieties for the kernel market. Estimates of genetic parameters for most traits of interest are not available. Seventy seven trees representing 41 genotypes and 35 progenies were used to investigate midparent values and progeny means for 17 traits, including 13 kernel and nut traits, and 4 phenological traits, for three years. Estimates for heritability in the narrow sense are all high, ranging from 0. 56 for amount of kernel fiber, and 0. 58 for date of opening of female flowers to 0. 87 for percent kernel, 0. 88 for nut compression index and 0. 89 for nut depth. Therefore, progeny means can be predicted from mid-parent values and response to selection is expected to be rapid for the improvement of all traits. The analysis of variance components revealed that genotypic variance accounted for most of the phenotypic variance. Although significant, the genotype X year interaction only accounted for a very small part of the phenotypic variance. It suggested one year's evaluation of genotypes for all traits should be sufficient except for nut weight, kernel weight, number of nuts per cluster, fiber amount, nut maturity, time of catkin elongation, and time of opening of female flowers. Genetic and phenotypic correlation coeficients were large and positive for nut size traits (nut length, width, depth, nut weight and kernel weight). Phenological traits (date of opening of female flowers, time of catkin elongation and time of leafing out) were also highly and positively correlated. But most other traits were uncorrelated with each other. Therefore, selection of parents with <b>round</b> <b>nuts</b> of medium size, high...|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{closely related}} and very similar North American butternut, Japanese walnut is {{resistant}} to the canker disease caused by the fungus Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum. This has led to its being planted {{as a replacement for}} butternuts in North America. The two species hybridise readily; the resulting hybrid Juglans x bixbyi (otherwise known as J. cinerea x ailantifolia or 'buartnut') is also resistant to canker and is likewise planted as a replacement for butternuts. Japanese walnut is distinguished from butternut by its larger leaves and <b>round</b> (not oval) <b>nuts.</b> Prospect Rock Permaculture in Vermont has been backcrossing buartnuts with native butternuts, resulting in 'butterbuarts', which will most likely bear greater resemblance to the butternut parentage, although may also be more susceptible to the canker.|$|R

He told her all {{that went on in}} his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not {{understand}} why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he wasn't so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn't rub him the wrong way. Mrs. Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang.

Maria said she would rather they didn't ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted.|$|R
40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth <b>round</b> bars. <b>Nut</b> loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of thread root acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} thread root radii. The K solutions obtained in this study were compared with available literature solutions for threaded fasteners as well as notched and smooth round bars...|$|R
60|$|It was bitterly cold, and as {{the three}} {{travellers}} stood there, ragged and sore and hungry, they thought they would never weary of gazing at the starry sky and sniffing the keen night air between the trees. But which way should they go? No path ran here, for the Earth-mulgars never let any path grow clear around their mounds. Thumb climbed a little way up a Gelica-tree that stood over them, and soon espied low down in the sky the Bear's bright Seven, which circle about the dim Pole Star. So he quickly slid down again to tell his brothers. It so happened, however, that in this tree grows a small, <b>round,</b> gingerish <b>nut</b> that takes two whole years to ripen, and hangs in thick clusters amid the branches. They have a taste like cinnamon, and with these the Earth-mulgars flavour their meat. And as Thumb slid heavily down, being stiff and sore now, and very heavy, he shook one of these same clusters, and down it came rattling about Nod's head. They have but thin shells, these nuts, and are not heavy, but they tumbled so suddenly, and from such a height, that Nod fell flat, his hands thrown out along the snow. He clambered up, rubbing his head, and in the quietness, while they listened, they heard as it were a distant and continuous throbbing beneath them.|$|R
6000|$|The crab {{to which}} Kathy {{referred}} {{is indeed a}} somewhat eccentric crustacean, besides being unusually large. It makes deep tunnels in the ground larger than rabbit burrows, which it lines with cocoa-nut fibre. One of its claws is developed into an organ of extraordinary power with which it can break a cocoa-nut shell, and even, it is said, a man's limb! It never takes all the husk off a cocoa-nut--that would be an unnecessary trouble--but only enough off the end where the three eyelets are, to enable it {{to get at the}} inside. Having pierced the proper eye with one of its legs it rotates the <b>nut</b> <b>round</b> it until the hole is large enough to admit the point of its great claw, with which it continues the work. This remarkable creature also climbs the palm-trees, but not to gather nuts; that is certain, for its habits have been closely watched and it has been ascertained that it feeds only on fallen nuts. Possibly it climbs for exercise, or to obtain a more extended view of its charming habitat, or simply [...] "for fun." [...] Why not? ...|$|R
40|$|Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is a {{traditional}} nut crop in southern Europe. Germplasm exploration conducted on-farm in five countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, and Greece) identified 77 landraces. The present work describes phenotypic variation in nut and husk traits and investigates genetic relationships using ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers among these landraces, 57 well-known references cultivars, and 19 wild accessions. Among the 77 landraces, 42 had unique fingerprints while 35 showed a SSR profile identical to a known cultivar. Among the 42 unique landraces, morphological observations revealed high phenotypic diversity, and some had characteristics appreciated by the market such as <b>nut</b> <b>round</b> and caliber. Analysis of genetic relationships and population structure allowed investigation of the origin and spread of the cultivated germplasm in southern Europe. Our results indicate the existence of three primary centers of diversity in the Mediterranean basin: northwestern Spain (Tarragona) and southern Italy (Campania) in the West and Black Sea (Turkey) in the East. Moreover, the data suggest the existence of secondary gene pools in the Iberian (Asturias) and Italian (Liguria and Latium) Peninsulas, where local varieties were recently domesticated from wild forms and/or from introduced ancient domesticated varieties...|$|R
60|$|And so I end {{my little}} episode about these Lecythids, only {{adding that the}} reader must not {{confound}} with their nuts the butter-nuts, Caryocar, or Souari, which may be bought, I believe, at Fortnum and Mason's, and which are of all nuts the largest and the most delicious. They have not been found as yet in Trinidad, though they abound in Guiana. They are the fruit also of an enormous tree {230}--there is a young one fruiting finely in the Botanic Garden at Port of Spain--of a quite different order; a cousin of the Matapalos and of the Soap-berries.
