5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the <b>rear</b> <b>hole</b> in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5000|$|A wealthy old {{man named}} Archie hires seven {{servants}} of both genders and different races to get connected {{to him by}} plugging his body openings and remain connected to him until his last breath. The servants are to stay connected to the old man's body {{for the next ten}} days. They eat, sleep, and even use the bathroom and fight thieves together. The party for his reunion with old friends is a lavish one. It includes the once love of his life (Hilda, portrayed by Alexandra Stewart), the one and only true friend he ever had (David Warner), and the Opera singer (Audra McDonald in her film debut) plus the maid (Sonja Kirchberger). They servants overcome many difficulties by staying [...] "united which is the core reason for the whole ritual". The best friends are asked to fill up the remaining openings of his body. Hilda is set upon him to do the final act of love between the two of them, something they never ever did though they have loved each other most of their lives. She commits to the act. Then it is time for David Warner to plug up his <b>rear</b> <b>hole,</b> an act he refuses to deliver and the beautiful maid takes the responsibility on her shoulders and does the impossible act of filling his rear end hole instead of David Warner having to go through the pain. In the final scene where all his openings are filled up except for his mouth, {{it is time for the}} opera singer to plug up his facial opening while singing a most beautiful opera piece. She sings with the greatest heavenly voice by Audra McDonald into his mouth and thus takes the last breath away from him as she blocks his mouth with her lips hence delivering the last kiss of death and preventing Archie from ever breathing again. Archie dies in peace, in pleasure and harmony for he achieved unity of the races around him though he pays for this eternal obsession and desire with his life.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a back {{junction}} {{solar cell}} design is explored for n-type crystalline silicon by using thermally evaporated V 2 O 5 as a <b>rear</b> <b>hole</b> contact and n+ amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as a front electron contact. Photoconductance measurements revealed an implicit open-circuit voltage (i-VOC) of 670 mV for the solar cell precursor (before metallization), achieved by maximizing the work function of V 2 O 5 {{with a thin}} nickel capping layer. The VOC value of the finished device was lower than projected at 617 mV, most likely due to poor passivation of the active area perimeter. Nonetheless, an efficiency of 14. 2 % was achieved (in polished substrates), proving the potential of such a novel structure...|$|E
5000|$|On more {{advanced}} models, {{there is a}} [...] "tuning ring". This is a metal band or ring, placed between the voicing window and the top tone hole. A hole is drilled through this ring and the horn beneath. When the ring is turned with the fingers the hole is partially blocked. This lowers the flute's keynote by up to about one major tone. Partial wax closure of the dorsal (<b>rear)</b> thumb <b>hole</b> will accomplish the same keynote tuning.|$|R
50|$|By stage 2 (day 1-2), {{penetration}} {{is complete}} and the flea has burrowed {{most of its}} body into the skin. Only the anus, the copulatory organs, and four <b>rear</b> air <b>holes</b> in fleas called stigmatas remain {{on the outside of}} the epidermis. The anus will excrete feces that is thought to attract male fleas for mating, described in a later section. The hypertrophic zone between tergites 2 and 3 in the abdominal region begins to expand a day or two after penetration and takes the appearance of a life belt. During this time, the flea begins to feed on the host’s blood.|$|R

If {{it is out of}} alignment, the rear derailleur will not move far enough, with respect to the rear sprockets, with each click. A special tool exists to measure and correct misaligned hangers.|$|R
40|$|Samples of a {{spacecraft}} primary external wall structure, {{as used in}} a low earth orbit remote sensing platform, have been tested to determine {{the response to the}} hypervelocity impact and ballistic limit (for mm-sized impactors) of the 47 mm thick structure at 5 km/s. A strong dependence of the ballistic limit on projectile density was identified. This programme was carried out using the two-stage light gas gun at the University of Kent at Canterbury. The equivalent diameters of the front and rear holes for each impact were analysed {{as a function of the}} impactor parameters. Damage equations derived by other experimenters were compared to the experimental results. X-ray non-destructive testing was used to determine the level of internal honeycomb damage for a sample. The dependence of the witness plate damage (placed behind the target to capture any ejecta from the rear surface) on the impactor parameters was recorded. It was found that the use of 'equivalent thicknesses' of aluminium may not be appropriate as a general conversion factor for carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) facesheets. A simple damage equation is presented, based on the total hole size as a function of the impact energy. The ballistic limit cannot be defined solely in terms of impact energy and shows an additional dependence with projectile density. The amount and type of ejecta produced is a strong function of density and a less strong function of projectile diameter, and its production cannot be linked with the <b>rear</b> <b>hole</b> diameter...|$|E

40|$|During the August 2007 STS- 118 {{mission to}} the International Space Station, a micro-meteoroid or orbital debris (MMOD) {{particle}} impacted and completely penetrated one of shuttle Endeavour s radiator panels and the underlying thermal control system (TCS) blanket, leaving deposits on (but no damage to) the payload bay door. While {{it is not unusual}} for shuttle orbiters to be impacted by small MMOD particles, the damage from this impact is larger than any previously seen on the shuttle radiator panels. A close-up photograph of the radiator impact entry hole is shown in Figure 1, and the location of the impact on Endeavour s left-side aft-most radiator panel is shown in Figure 2. The aft radiator panel is 0. 5 -inches thick and consists of 0. 011 inch thick aluminum facesheets on the front and back of an aluminum honeycomb core. The front facesheet is additionally covered by a 0. 005 inch thick layer of silver-Teflon thermal tape. The entry hole in the silver-Teflon tape measured 8. 1 mm by 6. 4 mm (0. 32 inches by 0. 25 inches). The entry hole in the outer facesheet measured 7. 4 mm by 5. 3 mm (0. 29 inches by 0. 21 inches) (0. 23 inches). The impactor also perforated an existing 0. 012 inch doubler that had been bonded over the facesheet to repair previous impact damage (an example that lightning can strike the same place twice, even for MMOD impact). The peeled-back edge around the entry hole, or lip, is a characteristic of many hypervelocity impacts. High velocity impact with the front facesheet fragmented the impacting particle and caused it to spread out into a debris cloud. The debris cloud caused considerable damage to the internal honeycomb core with 23 honeycomb cells over a region of 28 mm by 26 mm (1. 1 inches by 1. 0 inches) having either been completely destroyed or partially damaged. Figure 3 is a view of the exit <b>hole</b> in the <b>rear</b> facesheet, and partially shows the extent of the honeycomb core damage and clearly shows the jagged petaled exit hole through the backside facesheet. The <b>rear</b> facesheet exit <b>hole</b> damage including cracks in the facesheet measures 14 mm by 14 mm (0. 55 inches by 0. 55 inches). The remnants of the impacting particle and radiator panel material blown through the <b>rear</b> facesheet <b>hole</b> also created two penetrations in the TCS blanket 115 mm (4. 5 inches) behind the rear facesheet. Figure 4 shows these two impacts, which are located 75 mm (3 inches) apart. Some deposits of material were found on the payload bay door beneath the TCS blanket, but no additional damage occurred to the door. Figure 5 illustrates the relationship of the facesheet entry hole to the TCS blanket damage, which may indicate the direction of the impacting particle. The image on the left side of Figure 5 shows an overhead view of the damaged radiator after the facesheet holes were cored out of the panel. The entry hole location and the two underlying TCS blanket damage sites are annotated on the image. Section A-A, running through the entry hole and TCS blanket damage locations, describes a 25 angle from the longitudinal axis of the shuttle. The 2 nd impact angle can be seen in section A-A on the right side of Figure 5. An average 17 angle of impact to the surface normal was derived by measuring the angles of the two damage sites in TCS blanket to the entry hole...|$|R
5000|$|The Weimar Republic, the {{successor}} {{state to the}} German Empire, implemented {{a program designed to}} update their remaining supplies of Gewehr 98 rifles for the Reichswehr in the years following World War I. Rifles allowed into service with the early Weimar security forces were stamped with a [...] "1920" [...] marking on their receiver ring. Further updates to Weimar-era Gewehr 98's often included the replacement of the Lange Visier rear sight with a standard Karabiner 98k-style <b>rear</b> sight, a <b>hole</b> cut through the side of the stock to accommodate a Karabiner 98k-style side mounted sling system and sometimes a shortening of the barrel to Karabiner 98k length. Many were also given a turned-down bolt handle, replacing the original straight bolt handle style. Rifles that received these later modifications will often have both Weimar-era and Nazi markings, and [...] "S/42" [...] stamped on the rear sight base. Some of these rifles saw use in World War II but mostly in second line units because the shortened and improved Karabiner 98k was the standard issue rifle by that time. Gewehr 98s were also sometimes stripped for their receivers and Karabiner 98k rifles were built on those receivers. Some German police officers were seen using Gewehr 98s as the Allies entered Germany in the final months of the war.|$|R
40|$|In the {{photovoltaic}} field, {{the back}} contact solar cells technology has appeared {{as an alternative}} to the traditional silicon modules. This new type of cells places both positive and negative contacts on the back side of the cells maximizing the exposed surface to the light and making easier the interconnection of the cells in the module. The Emitter Wrap-Through solar cell structure presents thousands of tiny holes to wrap the emitter from the front surface to the <b>rear</b> surface. These <b>holes</b> are made in a first step over the silicon wafers by means of a laser drilling process. This step is quite harmful from a mechanical point of view since holes act as stress concentrators leading to a reduction in the strength of these wafers. This paper presents the results of the strength characterization of drilled wafers. The study is carried out testing the samples with the ring on ring device. Finite Element models are developed to simulate the tests. The stress concentration factor of the drilled wafers under this load conditions is determined from the FE analysis. Moreover, the material strength is characterized fitting the fracture stress of the samples to a three-parameter Weibull cumulative distribution function. The parameters obtained are compared with the ones obtained in the analysis of a set of samples without holes to validate the method employed for the study of the strength of silicon drilled wafers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} M1 and M1A1 rocket launchers were {{equipped with}} simple fixed sights {{and used a}} launch tube without reinforcements. During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used a rear iron sight and a front rectangular [...] "ladder" [...] sight positioned at the muzzle. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected [...] "rung" [...] on the front sight. On the M9, the ladder sight {{was replaced by the}} General Electric T43 aperture sight. Ranging was accomplished by looking through the <b>rear</b> sight's peep <b>hole</b> while rotating the assembly (which had graduations of 100, 200, and 300 yards) so it lined up with the blade positioned at the muzzle. In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming. The T43 and T90 sights were interchangeable. Various types of blast deflectors were tried, and an additional strap iron shoulder brace was fitted to the M9 launcher.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) on anxiety in normal and {{hypophysectomized}} (HYPOX) rats was investigated. Intracerebroventricular injection (i. c. v.) of 2 &mu;g of CRF increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze test in normal and HYPOX rats. Anxiety was measured as {{the ratio of}} time spent in the open arms of the maze to total time spent in all arms of the maze. CRF also reduced head dipping and <b>rearing</b> in the <b>hole</b> board, and the number of entries into the arms of the plus maze. These latter changes in behavior were independent of the changes in anxiety. All behavioral effects of CRF in HYPOX rats were blocked completely by the CRF receptor blocker, &alpha;-helical CRF (50 &mu;g). Completeness of hypophysectomy was assessed by measuring plasma corticosterone (CORT) level changes 20 min after i. c. v. CRF (2 &mu;g). CORT levels of all HYPOX rats given CRF were well below (< 1 / 10 th) resting baseline levels of normal rats. Moreover, i. c. v. injection of saline vehicle nearly tripled CORT levels over resting baseline in normal rats, and CRF increased CORT levels 2 -fold over vehicle. Taken together, these findings replicate the observation that CRF administered i. c. v. to rats is selectively anxiogenic in the elevated plus maze. They also indicate that the anxiety produced by CRF does not involve activation of the pituitary&mdash;adrenal axis. Rather, CRF-induced anxiety depends on the binding of CRF to central nervous system CRF receptors. Finally, the plasma CORT data indicate that i. c. v. injection of saline vehicle is stressful, as is injection of CRF.
