Risk-weighted assets are the total of all assets held by the bank weighted by credit risk according to a formula determined by the Regulator (usually the country's central bank). Most central banks follow the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines in setting formulae for asset risk weights.

40|$|Banks use {{internal}} models to optimize <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and better {{account for the}} specific risk of each asset class.

Whether the internal model approaches can provide capital savings depends on the characteristics of the portfolios of the financial institutions. The capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk financial institutions.

The above is only in respect of credit risk. Bangladesh Bank also asked the scheduled banks to maintain capital for Operational Risk as well as for Market Risk. The above Bangladesh Bank circular warrants the banks to have more capital compared to the present amount in the bank reserves.

Such “supervisory discrimination ” in terms of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> gives rise to the moral hazard problem in that the regulator fails to reduce the risk-taking incentives of institutions. The internal model approach does not necessarily provide the capital savings to encourage the institutions to develop internal models.

However adequate disease surveillance can be labor-intensive and expensive and thus there is substantial motivation to conduct it as efficiently as possible.

We present a Bayesian approach to disease surveillance when auxiliary risk information is available which will usually allow for substantial improvements over simple random sampling.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the cyclicality of <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> calculated according to Basel II IRB approach, for SME corporate portfolio of one Nordic bank. Our main focus is to examine effects of both the loan allocation within the portfolio and the bank's rating system in calculating <b>risk</b> <b>weights,</b> and to estimate which of these effects predominates. In this paper an econometric model, a first-order autoregressive model, is designed to measure business cycle sensitivity of a rating system. The model measures sensitivity by estimating elasticities of default probabilities with respect to realised default rates. The analysis of default rates, based on the correlation of default rates and GDP is also carried out in order to measuse the rating system's sensitivity to the business cycle. In this paper we also simulate a fully sensitive to the business cycle system and a fairly neutral to the business cycle system in order to examine the effect of loan allocation and the effect of rating systems' sensitivity on <b>risk</b> <b>weights.</b> The main conclusion in this paper is that the countercyclical effect of loan reallocation within one particular bank's portfolio for corporates predominates the procyclical effect of changes in the borrowers' creditworthiness over the business cycle. Calculated <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> for this portfolio move in a countercyclical manner as a result of the bank's credit policy and the low business cycle sensitivity of the bank's rating system. The results show that the effect of loan allocation has a great impact even in the case with the simulated fully sensitive to the business cycle system. Another finding of this paper is that changes in the bank's credit policy are first and foremost applied on new borrowers, i. e. the bank sets higher thresholds for granting loans in economic downturns...|$|R

40|$|The tight {{linkage between}} {{sovereign}} and bank balance sheets magni ed {{the depth of}} the European sovereign debt crisis. As a response to this, reform efforts are therefore focused on severing this vicious tie. Some progress has been made. The Banking Union framework addresses the transfer of banking sector risk to the sovereign. Policy makers are now discussing how to address the treatment of sovereign debt on bank balance sheets. Currently, it is treated as risk free. Zero <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> are applied, meaning banks do not need to set aside capital to protect themselves from potential losses in these securities. Nor do banks have any limits on their exposure to a particular sovereign. This discussion paper analyses the two widely discussed basic options to address this regulatory gap: applying non-zero <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> to sovereign expo- sures, and putting limits on exposures to sovereigns, akin to those in place for other exposures. Although this paper analyses each option in isolation, the two complement one another as they target different facets of <b>risk.</b> Positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> address counterparty credit risk, whereas large exposure limits address concentration risk. Both policy options would, according to our analysis, lead to improved bank risk management and render banks more resilient. They would equip them to better absorb losses: positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would require higher capital buffers and exposure limits would lead to greater diversi cation. Positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would also improve risk transparency and correct distorted incentives for investing in sovereign bonds. At the systemic level, leverage would decrease and losses in the event of default would be more spread out. On the downside, both regula- tory proposals would lower bank pro tability in the short run. In the longer run, positive risk-weights could permanently reduce bank pro ts by increasing their funding costs, while exposure limits would lead to a more diversi ed portfolio and lower funding costs. The bene ts in terms of increased resilience in the banking sector would come at a cost for some sovereigns. Sovereign bond holdings would become more costly in terms of capital if positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> were applied or the exposures were capped by a hard limit. In both cases, banks would try to deal with excess sovereign bonds on their balance sheets by injecting fresh capital or reducing their portfolio of sovereign bonds. An increased supply of sovereign paper, or a lack of demand for new issues, would raise funding costs for the sovereign and consequently for the whole economy. Furthermore, both policy options would lower liquidity in the sovereign debt markets, as they add to the cost and hinder the ability of banks to provide market-making services. Exposure limits in partic- ular would have signi cant repercussions on markets in the short run, as banks traditionally have large exposures to domestic sovereigns {{that they would have to}} shed. Other market participants would need to absorb this additional supply. Sovereigns would need to re-arrange their nancing sources, which could prove challenging. Additionally, the two options could aggravate long-run macro-level cyclical developments for stressed sovereigns. During an economic downturn, an increased riskiness of a sovereign would translate into higher <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> and a higher capital charge for the bank holding its debt. This would further worsen nancing conditions for sovereigns precisely at the time when scal space is most needed. Similarly, exposure limits could lead to cliff effects in a downturn, if sovereigns fail to extend their investor base. We expect that introducing positive <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> would have the largest effect on stressed sovereigns, while imposing exposure limits would impact sovereigns with large outstanding debt volumes the most. The trade-off between strengthening the resilience of the banking sector to sovereign risk and maintaining the investor base for European sovereigns makes the issue of adjusting regulation particularly complex. Any policy decision needs to take into account the effects it would have on sovereign funding conditions. In addition, as banks traditionally hold large amounts of sovereign debt, any regulatory change could have a large initial impact with potentially destabilising consequences. Hence, a gradual and transparent transition would be crucial for a successful implementation of any combination of the two alternatives...|$|R
