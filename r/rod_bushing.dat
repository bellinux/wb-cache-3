5000|$|Mateba Autorevolvers {{chambered}} in [...]357 Magnum can {{be loaded}} with [...]38 Special ammunition. Typical [...]38 Special loads {{do not have}} enough power to fully cycle the recoil mechanism, but the weapon will still function with a double-action trigger pull. There are two optional recoil springs designed specifically for [...]38 Special cartridges that can be installed by the operator to overcome this problem (.38 Special and [...]38 wadcutter). Replacing the spring requires the removal of the slide assembly, which is blocked by a retaining pin held in place by a small set screw in the triggerguard. The barrel shroud acts as the spring keeper and guide <b>rod</b> <b>bushing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Everett {{was very}} popular with his peers, and many major stars of television, radio and pop music counted him as a friend. This led to many celebrity guest {{appearances}} across all his television work. Terry Wogan – a long-time colleague {{from the early days}} at Radio 1 – made numerous appearances on both Thames and the BBC shows, as did Billy Connolly and Lennie Bennett. Other stars who parodied themselves included <b>Rod</b> Stewart, Kate <b>Bush,</b> ABBA, the Police, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Connecting rod fatigue in {{a certain}} type of diesel engine is {{analyzed}} by using finite element analysis method and the FEM software ANSYS. According the actual working conditions, the three-dimensional model with multi-body contact is established to simulate the contact between the connecting rod parts; By using APDL language programming, the work load on the connecting rod, calculated according all the link work loads, is applied to the connecting <b>rod</b> bearing and <b>bushing</b> through the oil film pressure distribution. By finite element method structural strength of the connecting rod was calculated, that can effectively guide the connecting rod design, which has been proved by practice...|$|R
5000|$|After his {{professional}} playing career was over, Abreu managed one other team in professional baseball before exiting the pro-level. He {{was one of}} four managers of the Class-D Santa Rosa Cats in [...] Abreu asked to be released from Tampa to tend to issues back home in Oakland, California. He then returned to his native California to play for the semi-professional Guy's Drugs of Oakland who won the <b>Bush</b> <b>Rod</b> Winter League (the first league to use the designated hitter rule) pennant. During the mid-1950s, Abreu played softball with the Naval Supply Center team, and was involved in local baseball clinics in the area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interesting}} {{rear suspension}} permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical {{movements of the}} wheels are controlled by two links, in which the upper link doubles as the axle shaft; and a <b>rod,</b> rubber <b>bushed</b> on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the rear suspension linkage permit variations in camber and toe-in to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16" [...] stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became {{the basis of the}} 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located {{on either side of the}} [...] "CERV-I" [...] at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity. Thus, the amount of fuel in the tanks at any given moment will have virtually no effect on weight distribution.|$|R
2500|$|All {{variants}} of the R.C.40 had {{much in common}} with construction of the earlier Asso 750 R.C., though they had two, rather than three, banks of 6 cylinders and 4 rather than 2 valves per cylinder. [...] Cylinder barrels were machined from carbon steel with flat-topped heads and valve seats. Each barrel had a separate sheet steel water jacket. [...] Cast aluminium head blocks were bolted to each of the two banks of 6 cylinders, providing valve ports, guides, coolant passages and camshaft supports. The pistons were also aluminium castings. The crankshaft was a 6-throw design with 8 plain bearings and a double row ball thrust bearing between the front two. [...] The connecting <b>rods</b> had bronze <b>bush</b> little ends and white metal big ends. [...] The crankcase was cast in two parts, the upper one with the housings for the crankshaft bearings.|$|R
