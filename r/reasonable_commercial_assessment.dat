This may have both commercial and political significance. This thesis deals with IP issues in international perspective (with reference, however, to some leading national IP legislation when and where it is necessary) with special reference to the contemporary legal regime governing outer space. While emphasizing the existing legal regime relating to IPRs in outer space, it explores the possibility of commercial exploitation of IPRs made in space and on ground through the existing international trade system. The increasing importance of cooperation between the World Intellectual Property Organization and World Trade Organization in this regard is also examined, against the back drop of space activities and the outer space legal regime relating to IPRs.

40|$|The broad {{notion of}} “commercial common sense” is {{prominent}} in the modern law governing the interpretation of written contracts. For example, in Prenn v Simmonds (1971), 2 Lord Wilberforce said that a suggested interpretation could be tested by considering whether it would “correspond with commercial good sense”. Lord Steyn said in Mannai Investment Co. v Eagle Star Life Assurance (1997) : “Words are … interpreted {{in the way in}} which a <b>reasonable</b> <b>commercial</b> person would construe them. ” 3 In the “Rainy Sky” case (2011), the Supreme Court held that: “If there are two possible constructions, the court is entitled to prefer the construction which is consistent with business common sense and to reject the other. ” 4 Furthermore, Lord Neuberger in Arnold v Britton (2015) 5 placed “commercial common sense” within the list of relevant factors to be applied during the process of interpretation (see Section II for the full quotation). Most people will instinctively nod approval to these important judicial statements. But to what, precisely, are they assenting?

The principal requirement for the issue of a compulsory license is that attempts to obtain a license under <b>reasonable</b> <b>commercial</b> terms must have failed over a reasonable period of time. Specific situations in which compulsory licenses may be issued are set out in the legislation of each patent system and vary between systems. Some examples of situations in which a compulsory license may be granted include lack of working over an extended period in the territory of the patent, inventions funded by the government, failure or inability of a patentee to meet a demand for a patented product and where the refusal to grant a license leads to the inability to exploit an important technological advance, or to exploit a further patent. TRIPs also provides that the requirements for a compulsory license may be waived in certain situations, in particular cases of national emergency or extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use. Article 31.f of TRIPS requires that compulsory licenses be used [...] "predominantly" [...] for local markets, a requirement that complicates the ability of countries to import drugs manufactured overseas.|$|R
40|$|Benzoic and sorbic {{acids and}} their salts are {{extensively}} {{used in the}} preservation of foods. Their levels of use in different food products are regulated by national and international regulatory agencies. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in yoghurt and no reference exists as to its deliberate use in the preservation of this cultured dairy product. Sorbic acid levels up to 1000 mg kg- 1 are allowed by country regulations in yoghurt production presumably to ensure a <b>reasonable</b> <b>commercial</b> shelf life. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is extensively used in the determination of benzoate and sorbate in foods. Thirty samples of commercial yoghurt, produced in Lebanon, were analysed by HPLC for their contents of benzoic and sorbic acids. All samples contained benzoic acid with levels ranging between 12 and 479. 1 mg kg- 1 and 14 samples contained in addition sorbic acid amounts {{in the range of}} 83. 9 and 3719. 1 mg kg- 1. Indigenous benzoic acid levels in laboratory-produced yoghurt, under aseptic conditions, ranged between 5. 5 and 14. 7 mg kg- 1 after storage for 4 weeks. The results indicate that benzoic acid levels higher than those could be attributed to the microbial activity of the starter cultures and sorbic acid amounts higher than those set by regulatory agencies are used in yoghurt production. Application of good manufacturing practices by dairy processors and closer monitoring of preservatives levels by regulatory agencies are warranted to reduce levels of usage of benzoic and sorbic acids in yoghurt production.
