50|$|Wet layup forming {{combines}} fibre reinforcement and {{the matrix}} {{as they are}} placed on the forming tool. <b>Reinforcing</b> <b>Fibre</b> layers are placed in an open mould and then saturated with a wet resin by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as fibreglass, and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.|$|E

Three types of bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (1) flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube, (2) flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer tube with internal flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer rings and (3) flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer wrapping. They were termed as naturally, mechanically and adhesively bonded, respectively. A total of 18 flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined plain concrete and coir <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete cylinders were tested under axial compression. The test results indicated that all the three flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer confinements increased the ultimate compressive strength and ductility of the concrete significantly compared to the unconfined concrete. It {{was found that the}} type of flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer and concrete bond has a significant effect on the ultimate strength and axial strain of the confined cylinders. The composite cylinder with naturally bonded offered the largest ultimate strength and axial strain. In all cases of flax <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> polymer–confined coir <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete, the coir fibre inclusion reduced the numbers and widths of the cracks in the concrete.

The adsorption of two commercial dyes, Basic Astrazon Yellow 7 GLL and Reactive Rifafix Red 3 BN on activated carbons made up of reinforcing fibres from tyre waste and low-rank bituminous coal was studied. The surface chemistry of activated carbons was modified by means of HCl-HNO 3 treatment in order {{to increase the number of}} functional groups. Moreover, the influence of the pH on the process was also studied, this factor being of great importance due to the amphoteric characteristics of activated carbons. The activated carbons made with <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibre</b> and coal had the highest SBET, but the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibre</b> activated carbon samples had the highest mesopore volume. The texture of the activated carbons was not modified upon acid oxidation treatment, unlike their surface chemistry which underwent considerable modification. The activated carbons made with a mixture of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibre</b> and coal experienced the largest degree of oxidation, and so had more acid surface groups. The adsorption of reactive dye was governed by the mesoporous volume, whilst surface chemistry played only a secondary role. However, the surface chemistry of the activated carbons and dispersive interactions played a key role in the adsorption of the basic dye. The adsorption of the reactive dye was more favored in a solution of pH 2, whereas the basic dye was adsorbed more easily in a solution of pH 12...|$|E

The fatigue strength of composites largely depends on the fatigue behaviour of fibres. While the static strength of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibres</b> has been extensively investigated, {{there are very few}} data available on their fatigue properties.

Moreover, some data on the fatigue behaviour of natural fibres, aramid fibres, optical fibres and steel fibres is mentioned.

The arising values of fibre/matrix strain reductions/magnifications decrease/increase with increasing volume fractions of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibre.</b> Significant differences are seen between the transverse, matrix/fibre strain magnification/reduction for the present case where no assumptions are made about the existence of the iso-stress state and others where the assumption applies. The transverse stresses in the composite, matrix and fibre are shown here to be different, which implies that the assumption of transverse iso-stress that is normally made in the study of composite materials is wrong. The fibre stresses are found to be greater in magnitude than the matrix stresses for all volume fractions and up till 71 % reinforcing volume fraction for the hexagonal and square arrays, respectively. The fibre/matrix strain reduction/magnification, fibre and matrix/central sub-region stress ratios are all shown here to be dependent on the fibre geometry for all volume fractions of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>fibre,</b> {{with the exception of the}} fibre/central sub-region stress ratio where this characteristic only prevails below 76 % reinforcing volume fraction...|$|E

30|$|The {{necessity}} of sustainable, non-hazardous and cost effective {{materials in the}} construction industry is inevitable. Concrete being popularly used all over the world is characterised by low strength-strain capacity in tension, and low fracture toughness.

The fibres can insure the post-cracking resistance, high-energy absorption features and increased fatigue resistance of cement based composites (Savastano et al. 2009).
