5|$|Some {{states of}} matter exhibit {{symmetry}} breaking, where the relevant {{laws of physics}} possess some symmetry that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous translational symmetry. Other examples include magnetized ferromagnets, which break <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor, that breaks U(1) phase <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Sudoku with 24 clues, {{dihedral}} symmetry (symmetry on both orthogonal axis, 90° <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> 180° <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and diagonal symmetry) {{is known}} to exist, and is also automorphic. Again here, {{it is not known}} if this number of clues is minimal for this class of Sudoku. The fewest clues in a Sudoku with two-way diagonal symmetry is believed to be 18, and in at least one case such a Sudoku also exhibits automorphism.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the body}} of many species is almost {{radially}} symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the mouth to the opposite end). However, since {{only two of the}} canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> in other words if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.|$|E

5|$|Symmetry is {{pervasive}} in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or mirror symmetry, {{as do the}} leaves of plants and some flowers such as orchids. Plants often have radial or <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as sea anemones. Fivefold symmetry {{is found in the}} echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.|$|E
5|$|This tiling has four-way <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> {{around each}} of its squares. When {{the ratio of the}} side lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its {{cross-sections}} form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E
5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> as in the diagram at the right.|$|E
40|$|We have {{modified}} a 3 D hydrodynamics code {{so that it}} has {{the capability}} to impose periodic boundary conditions on the problem being considered.

40|$|A {{simple method}} using a single-prism common-path {{interferometer}} is presented for the fabrication of complex quasicrystals in sub-micrometer scales. Multiple types of two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) quasicrystalline structures are designed and their diffraction patterns are obtained by using Fourier Transform method. Multi-fold <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> are demonstrated and compared. By using this method, {{a wide range}} of quasicrystals types can be produced with arbitrary complexities and <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries.</b> The transmittance studies of 12 -fold and 18 -fold structures also reveal the existence of complete photonic bandgaps, which also demonstrates increased symmetry and significantly improved characteristics of photonic band-gaps...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} conjectured that a near-extreme Kerr black hole is {{described}} by a 2 d CFT. Previous work has shown that CFT operators dual to axisymmetric gravitational perturbations have integer conformal weights. In this paper, we study the analogous problem in 5 d. We consider the most general near-extreme vacuum black hole with two <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries.</b> This includes Myers-Perry black holes, black rings and Kaluza-Klein black holes. We find that operators dual to gravitational (or electromagnetic or massless scalar field) perturbations preserving both <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> have integer conformal weights, {{the same for all}} black holes considered.

5|$|Elaborate lattices {{are found}} in Indian Jaali work, carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces. Chinese lattices, always with some symmetry, exist in 14 of the 17 {{wallpaper}} groups; they often have mirror, double mirror, or <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry.</b> Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S. Dye; he identifies Sichuan as {{the centre of the}} craft.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). <b>Rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} symmetries in nature besides time {{translation}}, such as spacial translation or <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries.</b> These symmetries {{can be broken}} and explain diverse phenomena such as crystals, superconductivity, and the Higgs mechanism. However, It was thought until very recently that time translation symmetry could not be broken. Time crystals, a newly discovered state of matter, break time translation symmetry.|$|R

5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> called Snakes, in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. <b>Rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} the most general near-horizon geometry of a supersymmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter, black hole solution of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity that admits two <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries.</b> The near-horizon geometry {{is that of}} the supersymmetric, topologically spherical, black hole solution of Chong et al. This proves that regular supersymmetric anti-de Sitter black rings with two <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> do not exist in minimal supergravity. However, we do find a solution corresponding to the near-horizon geometry of a supersymmetric black ring held in equilibrium by a conical singularity, which suggests that nonsupersymmetric anti-de Sitter black rings may exist but cannot be "balanced" in the supersymmetric limit.

40|$|Some image patterns, e. g. circles, {{hyperbolic}} curves, star patterns etc., can {{be described}} in a compact way using local orientation. The features mentioned above is part of a family of patterns called <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries.</b> This theory can be used to detect image patterns from the local orientation in double angle representation of an images. Some of the <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> are described originally from the local orientation without being designed to detect a certain feature. The question is then: given a description in double angle representation, what kind of image features does this description correspond to? This 'inverse', or backprojection, is not unambiguous - many patterns has the same local orientation description...|$|R
5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Many Sudokus {{have been}} found with 17 clues, {{although}} finding them is not a trivial task. A paper by Gary McGuire, Bastian Tugemann, and Gilles Civario, released on 1 January 2012, explains how it was proved through an exhaustive computer search that the minimum number of clues in any proper Sudoku is 17, and this was independently confirmed in September 2013. A few 17-clue puzzles with diagonal symmetry were provided by Ed Russell, after a search through equivalence transformations of Gordon Royle's database of 17-clue puzzles. Sudoku puzzles with 18 clues {{have been found}} with 180° <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry,</b> and others with orthogonal symmetry, {{although it is not}} known if this number of clues is minimal in either case. Sudoku puzzles with 19 clues have been found with two-way orthogonal symmetry, and again it is unknown if this number of clues is minimal for this case.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetry</b> of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

3000|$|As {{previously}} reported, the ZnO growth orientation can {{be altered}} by different growth conditions or substrates [15, 27, 39]. In this work, the use of hexangular MgO(111) substrates leads to a single growth orientation, {{which is consistent with}} the previous expression of the <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> of the substrate and epilayer, as determined by the formula [44]: [...] N=lcm(n,m)/C_m, where N denotes the number of rotation domains in the epilayer; n and m denote the <b>rotational</b> <b>symmetries</b> of the substrate (MgO(111) plane) and epilayer (ZnO(0001) plane), respectively; and lcm(n,m) denotes the least common multiple of n and m. Both the MgO(111) substrate and wurtzite ZnO film possess sixfold symmetry; thus, only one ZnO domain exists on the substrate. This result coincides with the results of the RHEED patterns and XRD spectra in this work.|$|R
