5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or dose limit for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on <b>Radiation</b> <b>Protection</b> by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, {{portable}} X-ray devices use thulium {{that has been}} bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source. These sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, {{as well as to}} detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components.

5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and <b>radiation</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with <b>radiation</b> <b>protection.</b> Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The International Commission on Radiological Protection – whose {{regularly}} updated {{recommendations are}} routinely adopted as law throughout the globe – recently issued the first-ever ICRP protections for the environment. These draft 2005 proposals are significant both because they offer the commission’s first <b>radiation</b> <b>protections</b> for any non-human {{parts of the}} planet and because they will influence both the quality of radiation risk assessment and environmental protection, {{as well as the}} global costs of nuclear-weapons cleanup, reactor decommissioning and radioactive waste management. This piece argues that the 2005 recommendations are scientifically and ethically flawed, or gray, in at least three respects: first, in largely ignoring scientific journals while employing mainly “gray literature”; second, in relying on non-transparent dose estimates and models, rather than on actual radiation measurements; and third, in ignoring classical ethical constraints on acceptable radiation risk. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recently issued landmark 2005 proposals – its first-ever environmental recommendations. 1 Because th...|$|R

25|$|Detectors can {{be divided}} into two major categories: imaging {{detectors}} (such as photographic plates and X-ray film (photographic film), now mostly replaced by various digitizing devices like image plates or flat panel detectors) and dose measurement devices (such as ionization chambers, Geiger counters, and dosimeters used to measure the local radiation exposure, dose, and/or dose rate, for example, for verifying that <b>radiation</b> <b>protection</b> equipment and procedures are effective on an ongoing basis).|$|E
