5|$|In Rome, two Epitaph {{inscriptions}} {{have been}} found bearing {{the name of an}} Artavasdes. The Epitaphs are probably of the son and the grandson of a Median Atropatenian King called Ariobarzanes.

Artavasdes I is mentioned in paragraphs 27 and 33 of the <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> Divi Augusti.|$|E

5|$|The main {{literary}} {{sources for}} the 4th-century army are the <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> (History) of Ammianus Marcellinus, whose surviving books cover the period 353 to 378. Marcellinus, himself a veteran soldier, is regarded by scholars as a reliable and valuable source. But he largely fails {{to remedy the deficiencies}} of the Notitia as regards army and unit strength or units in existence, as he is rarely specific about either. The third major source for the late army is the corpus of imperial decrees published in the East Roman empire in the 5th and 6th centuries: the Theodosian code (438) and the Corpus Iuris Civilis (528–39). These compilations of Roman laws dating from the 4th century contain numerous imperial decrees relating to all aspects of the regulation and administration of the late army.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} prince, Augustus also gave Phraates IV an Italian slave-girl, {{who later became}} Queen Musa of Parthia. To ensure that her child Phraataces would inherit the throne without incident, Musa {{convinced}} Phraates IV to give his other sons to Augustus as hostages. Again, Augustus used this as propaganda depicting the submission of Parthia to Rome, listing it as a great accomplishment in his <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> Divi Augusti. When Phraataces took the throne as Phraates V (r. c.2BC – 4AD), Musa married her own son and ruled alongside him. The Parthian nobility, disapproving of both the incestuous relationship {{and the notion of}} a king with non-Arsacid blood, forced the pair into exile in Roman territory. Phraates' successor Orodes III of Parthia lasted just two years on the throne, and was followed by Vonones I, who had adopted many Roman mannerisms during time in Rome. The Parthian nobility, angered by Vonones' sympathies for the Romans, backed a rival claimant, Artabanus III of Parthia (r. c.10–38AD), who eventually defeated Vonones and drove him into exile in Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{detailed}} and reliable source for the battle, and Julian's Gallic campaign (355–60) generally, is the <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> (Histories) of Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian. Ammianus was a Greek career soldier who joined the army before 350 and served until at least 363. Enlisted as a protector (cadet senior officer), {{he served as a}} staff officer under magister equitum Ursicinus and then under Julian himself in the latter's Persian campaign. Although he was not present at Strasbourg, he had experience of the Gallic front as he was involved in the suppression of the revolt of Claudius Silvanus, the magister equitum (commander-in-chief) in Gaul (355). However, his narrative reveals a passionate admiration of Julian and occasionally descends to the level of eulogy. Furthermore, as he was writing some 40 years after the event, it is likely that Ammianus relied heavily, if not exclusively, on Julian's own memoir of the Strasbourg campaign (which we know he published, but has been lost). Thus Ammianus' account probably reflects Julian's own propaganda. In addition, Ammianus' account is of uneven quality, with many gaps and some contradictory elements.|$|E

25|$|While {{living in}} Rome in the 380s, Ammianus wrote a Latin {{history of the}} Roman empire from the {{accession}} of Nerva (96) {{to the death of}} Valens at the Battle of Adrianople (378), in effect writing a continuation of the history of Tacitus. He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the Serapeum in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into barricading themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple. The <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> (Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI) was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost (historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which if correct would mean that eighteen books have been lost). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378. As a whole it is extremely valuable, constituting the foundation of modern understanding {{of the history of the}} fourth century Roman Empire. It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary; like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the <b>Res</b> <b>Gestae</b> into question.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 918, Conrad I, King of East Francia and Duke of Franconia, died. According to the <b>Res</b> <b>gestae</b> saxonicae by the Saxon chronicler Widukind of Corvey, Conrad persuaded {{his younger}} brother Eberhard of Franconia, the {{presumptive}} heir, to offer the crown of East Francia to Otto's father Henry. Although Conrad and Henry had been at odds with one another since 912, Henry had not openly opposed the king since 915. Furthermore, Conrad's repeated battles with German dukes, most recently with Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria, and Burchard II, Duke of Swabia, had weakened the position and resources of the Conradines. After several months of hesitation, Eberhard and the other Frankish and Saxon nobles elected Henry as king at the Imperial Diet of Fritzlar in May 919. For the first time, a Saxon instead of a Frank reigned over the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Following a famine the Gothic War of 376–382 ensued, {{where the}} Goths {{and some of}} the local Thracians rebelled. The Roman Emperor Valens was killed at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Following the decisive Gothic victory at Adrianople, Julius, the magister militum Eastern Roman Empire, {{organized}} a widescale massacre of Goths in Asia Minor, Syria {{and other parts of the}} Roman East. Fearing rebellion, Julian lured the Goths into the confines of urban streets from which they could not escape and massacred soldiers and civilians alike. As word spread, the Goths rioted throughout the region, and large numbers were killed. Survivors may have settled in Phrygia. Although the Huns successfully subdued many of the Goths, who joined their ranks, a group of Goths led by Fritigern fled across the Danube. Major sources for this period of Gothic history include Ammianus' <b>Res</b> <b>gestae,</b> which mentions Gothic involvement in the civil war between emperors Procopius and Valens of 365 and recounts the Gothic War (376-382). Around 375AD the Huns overran the Alans and then the Goths.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Marozia {{became the}} {{mistress}} of Theophylact's cousin Pope Sergius III, whom she knew when he was bishop of Portus. The two had a son, John (the later Pope John XI). That, at least, is the story found in two contemporary sources, the Liber Pontificalis and the Antapodosis sive <b>Res</b> per Europam <b>gestae</b> (958-62), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920-72). But a third contemporary source, the annalist Flodoard (c. 894-966), says John XI was brother of Alberic II, the latter being the offspring of Marozia and her husband Alberic I. Hence John too {{may have been the}} son of Marozia and Alberic I.|$|R
50|$|Marozia {{became the}} {{concubine}} of Pope Sergius III {{when she was}} 15 and later took other lovers and husbands. She ensured that her son John was seated as Pope John XI according to Antapodosis sive <b>Res</b> per Europam <b>gestae</b> (958-62), by Liutprand of Cremona (c. 920-72). Liutprand affirms that Marozia arranged {{the murder of her}} former lover Pope John X (who had originally been nominated for office by Theodora) through her then husband Guy of Tuscany possibly to secure the elevation of her current favourite as Pope Leo VI. There is no record substantiating that Pope John X had definitely died before Leo VI was elected since John X was already imprisoned by Marozia and was out of public view.|$|R

In a nich in the middle stands on a pedestal the effigies of Sir John cut with a campaign wig and a cravat in pure alabaster. Over his head are the arms of his family, underneath on a table of white marble is the following epitaph in black letters: Ne id nescias lector D(ominus) Joannes Berry Devoniensis dignitate Equestri clarus mari non tantum imperator de rege et patria quod et Barbari norunt bene meritus magnam ob <b>res</b> fortiter <b>gestas</b> adeptus gloriam Famae satur post multas reportatas victorias cum ab aliis vinci non potuit Fatis cessit 14 Febr 1689 baptizatus 7 Jan 1635" [...] ("Lest thou should not know, O reader, the famed Sir John Berry of Devon, with dignity of a knight, not just ruler of the sea (as well know too the Barbaries) having gained from King and Country well-deserved great glory on account of matters happily conducted, satiated with the glory of fame, after many victories brought home, as with others, was not able to defeat the Fates.
