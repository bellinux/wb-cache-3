5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University.

Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E
