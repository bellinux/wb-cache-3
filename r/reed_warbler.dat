5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is substantially larger, and the Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of the Pacific islands and eventually Australia by the Acrocephalus warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations of even remote archipelagos. Although the Hawaiian islands were colonised about 2.3million years ago, the other islands were reached much more recently, in the mid-Pleistocene (between 0.21.4million years ago) or even later. The nearest other warblers geographically to Nauru are the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has {{dark brown}} upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
50|$|Breeding species include <b>reed</b> and sedge <b>warbler</b> {{and water}} rail. Wintering species include bearded reedling, snipe, {{redshank}} and bittern. During the migration periods {{significant numbers of}} swallow and sand martin are seen.|$|R
50|$|In Hlinka {{district}} {{near the}} village of Slezské Pavlovice Velký Pavlovický rybník (The great pond) Natural Reserve is situated. This natural reserve was created to protect the unique habitat as this pond serves as a stopping place for birds during its spring and autumn migrations. During this time you may see many protected birds there such as the blue winged teal, bittern, water crake, snipe and great <b>reed</b> - <b>warbler</b> and during the summer time also many protected wetland and aquatic animals.|$|R
50|$|Berrow Marsh, {{contained}} within the dunes between the village and the beach, {{is a mixture of}} reedbed and salt marsh. Birds found here include many wetland species such as <b>reed</b> and sedge <b>warbler</b> and in winter occasional jack snipe amongst large numbers of common snipe.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} sedentary, {{meaning that the}} birds do not {{naturally}} leave Nauru. Banaba is the nearest island, and despite being similar to Nauru, it lacks any warblers. However, {{it is possible that}} populations of the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> existed on other islands until comparatively recently. On the Marshall Islands, traditional stories refer to a small bird, known variously as annañ, anang and annãng. This bird was considered the property of chieftains. Though no physical descriptions exist of the species, it has been described as butterfly-sized, pleasant-smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands. Ethnographers Krämer and Nevermann reported that the bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880. Based on descriptions of birds seen on Jaluit, Paul Schnee hypothesised that the annañ may have been a Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The extinction of the annañ may have been due to hunting by cats, which were introduced to the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats. They then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets, after which they started to become feral.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{native land}} mammals, {{but there are}} native insects, land crabs, and birds, {{including}} the endemic Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships. The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island, as well as SCUBA diving and snorkelling.|$|E
5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the {{built-up}} area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E

5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, marbled white, small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E

25|$|Otters have {{recently}} recolonised {{the upper reaches}} of the river, however the water vole is now confined to a few isolated populations. Notable species of invertebrates include uncommon mayflies. There is a diverse breeding bird community including lapwing, snipe and redshank. Wildfowl such as mallard and mute swans may also be seen, along with yellow wagtail, sedge warbler, <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and reed bunting.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 phylogenic {{study of}} the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as {{recently}} as 2010 its relation {{with other members of}} the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the [...] Australian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas. The closest relative of the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> A. luscinius yamashinae, but that species is polyphyletic, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands.|$|E
500|$|The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (...) , Acrocephalus rehsei, is a {{passerine}} bird {{endemic to}} the island of Nauru in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two native breeding land-birds on Nauru, the other being the Micronesian pigeon, and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other Micronesian reed warblers, all of which evolved from one of several radiations of the genus across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which was formerly sometimes considered the same species.|$|E
500|$|Though the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in [...] Die Vogelarte der Erde (1980) and Howard and Moore in A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1991), have considered it a subspecies of Acrocephalus luscinius, the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> Recent DNA studies have affirmed {{its status as a}} separate species. It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir.|$|E
500|$|The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is a {{medium-sized}} and warmly coloured <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{with a relatively}} light build. The entirety of the upperparts are dark brown, with the rump and uppertail coverts slightly brighter than the tail and mantle. When closed, the wing is the same colour as the mantle, short and rounded. The wing does not reach {{the start of the}} tail feathers, which enhances the appearance of a long tail. Close inspection of the wing reveals darker centres to both the greater coverts and tertial feathers. Its face shows little contrast, as the ear coverts, crown, nape, chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown. The lores are a dark brown, and there is a pale, creamy supercilium, or [...] "eyebrow", extending from the beak to the ear coverts, which are a cinnamon-brown, darkening and merging with the nape. The beak is long, thin and straight.|$|E
500|$|The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{endemic to}} the island of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two {{indigenous}} land birds which breed on the island, the other being the Micronesian pigeon. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau. It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes. It is also readily observed in gardens and ruderal areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it [...] "as common as the House-Sparrow in England." [...] Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Finsch {{described}} the warbler as insectivorous, feeding primarily on dragonflies. Six species of dragonfly {{have been observed}} on the island; Ischnura aurora, Anax guttatus, Diplacodes bipunctata, Pantala flavescens, Tholymis tillarga and Tramea transmarina. Buden did not observe the species feeding on dragonflies, but did see three different feeding habits. Most frequently, the birds were seen moving through trees and shrubs, catching prey on the foliage. Other birds were seen perched close to the floor, darting to the ground, and returning to the perch with prey. In open areas, the birds were observed moving across the ground, [...] "occasionally grasping a presumed prey item". In coastal areas, they have been observed feeding in coconut trees. Potential predators for the birdlife of Nauru in general include feral cats and dogs, {{as well as the}} Polynesian rat and the Tanezumi rat. Feral cats and wild rats in particular are potential threats to the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Alan Vittery {{raised the}} {{question}} of whether the level of detail required by the committee for a description to be acceptable was too high. Similar points were made by Keith Vinicombe and Mike Pennington in 2001. In the light of the rejection of a record of Blyth's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> on Shetland in 1997, Vinicombe and Pennington wrote to British Birds to question the decision. They suggested that the committee was becoming too focussed on minutiae in assessing bird descriptions, ignoring more obvious evidence, Vinicombe saying that [...] "the Committee has prevaricated to the point where it 'cannot see the wood for the trees'". David Walker and Owen Leyshon, David Ferguson, and Andrew Duff have criticised the committee on similar grounds in relation to its approach to the assessment of rare seabirds, citing the Dungeness herald petrel claim as an example. Vittery, and Moss Taylor both expressed concern that BBRC was adopting too strict an approach for records of birds seen only by their finder.|$|E
500|$|A male {{attracts a}} female to his {{territory}} through song and a display which involves rapid wing beating while perched. He will also build {{a number of}} simple nests (cock's nests) to show to his mate, although only rarely will she complete the structure, usually starting afresh. The nest is concealed in vegetation, the nature of which depends on local availability. Rubus species are commonly used in temperate regions, with willow predominating in alpine valleys. Sometimes, particularly in stinging nettles, the nest may be built around a number of vertical stems, {{in the manner of}} a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The nest is normally between [...] above the ground, and very rarely higher than [...] The nest is a cup of dry grass, moss and twigs, with a soft lining of finer plant material or hair. It is larger and heavier than a blackcap's nest, averaging [...] high and [...] wide with a cup [...] deep and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> nests are {{cup-shaped}} and woven from {{grasses and}} twigs. They sometimes include Cassytha filiformis vine or Casuarina equisetifolia needles. The nests {{are bound to}} upright stems in a way typical of warblers. Buden reported that the warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of [...] The species may also nest on the ground; the young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats. Eggs have variously been reported in December and July, and ornithologist A. Pearson suggested that the species may nest all year round. The clutch size has been reported as two or three eggs. Incubation and fledgling periods are unknown. Pearson reported lower nesting than Buden, recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between [...] from the ground, especially in forked branches of hibiscus and lime. Buden reported that the birds were more vocal in December than in March and April. The song {{has been described as}} similar to that of a song thrush, common blackbird, or willie wagtail, and it is delivered both day and night.|$|E
500|$|Otto Finsch was {{the first}} naturalist to visit the island of Nauru, {{stopping}} for six hours on 24 July 1880 while travelling from the Marshall Islands to the Solomon Islands. His 1881 report included a warbler he initially identified as the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> By 1883 he considered {{it to be a}} new species, Calamoherpe rehsei. The generic name Calamoherpe is now recognised as a synonym of Acrocephalus, leading to the current binomial name. The generic name Acrocephalus derives from the Greek akros, meaning [...] "topmost", and kephale, meaning [...] "head". The akros part of the name may have been given through confusion with acutus, and taken to mean [...] "sharp-pointed", referring to the angular head shape typical of this genus. The synonym Calamoherpe is from the Greek kalamos, meaning [...] "reed", and herpes, meaning [...] "creeping thing". Finsch named the species after Ernst Rehse, a German ornithologist and collector and one of Finsch's travelling companions. Since the original descriptions, little {{has been written about the}} species, and details about its ecology and behaviour are poorly known.|$|E
500|$|The main reedbed on {{the site}} is known as Newlands, an {{extensive}} area forming {{the eastern end of}} the reserve. [...] Together with other areas in the West Marsh, the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares (61 acres). A wind-powered water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare (22 acre) area near the Visitor Centre. This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1,200 hectare (3,000 acres) of reedbed nationwide. The reedbeds support a number of acrocephalid warblers such as the <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> sedge warbler and marsh warbler as well as others such as grasshopper warbler, {{and it was the first}} recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti's warbler. There is a long-term plan to have an endangered species, the Eurasian bittern, breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred, with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009. [...] A new hide overlooking Newlands, named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009, was opened in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The {{western edge}} of Coimbra is covered by the Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila (Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve), which is {{designated}} both as a Special Protection Zone (...) and Special Conservation Zone (...) , coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Paul de Arzila or marsh of Arzila). It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and the Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.|$|E
