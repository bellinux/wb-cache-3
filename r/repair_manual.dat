50|$|Mitchell 1, {{established}} in 1918 as Reed Electrical Manuals, has undergone many changes {{over the last}} 90-plus years, including name and ownership changes. Glenn Mitchell founded the well known “Mitchell Manuals” in his garage in 1946. They focused mainly on repair and service issues and provided an easy-to-use parts catalog for collision repair estimating. His <b>repair</b> <b>manuals</b> were unique to the industry because they arranged collision parts by the quadrant of the car {{where they would be}} used. Previously, <b>repair</b> <b>manuals</b> listed component parts, just like the manufacturers’ manuals. Eventually he added labor and paint times, which help body shops and insurance companies prepare a repair estimate and create a bill of materials and work order.|$|R

50|$|When {{certificated}} in 1944, the Mallard {{design was}} required to satisfy a static strength analysis. However, no fatigue requirement was yet in force, as no satisfactory fatigue analysis method had been developed at that time. The Mallard therefore had not been designed with any 'safe life' figure, unlike most civil transport aircraft today, which have designed fatigue lives of around 65,000-70,000 hrs, or twenty years. In addition, no authorized <b>repair</b> <b>manual</b> for the aircraft type had been issued by the manufacturer, responsibility for authorizing repair techniques having been acquired by an outside company after Grumman discontinued support for the type.|$|E
50|$|For a time, {{they have}} some fun with the entire world (such as giving the Pope a wedgie and {{punching}} Oscar de la Hoya in the stomach) but soon become bored. They find a watch <b>repair</b> <b>manual,</b> but it takes the two 15 years to repair the device. Just before they re-activate the watch, and realizing that they need a scapegoat to avoid the lynch mob's wrath, they place Martin {{in the middle of}} the mob that was about to attack them; he is killed when time restarts. Later, Lisa makes light of the fact that Bart is much older, and asks to play with the watch. She finds a secondary function that changes reality, altering the family in many ways (including causing them to switch genders, and become bobble-heads, TV Guides and the Fantastic Four). Homer has her stop when the family, now normal with Bart at 10 years old again, is playing with hula hoops.|$|E
50|$|Under Civil Aviation Regulation 42U (CAR42U), any {{modification}} or repair that {{is carried}} out on an Australian aircraft must be done in accordance with 'approved data'. This approved data is usually contained within the aircraft's manuals (aircraft maintenance manual, structural <b>repair</b> <b>manual,</b> component maintenance manuals etc.) issued by the aircraft's manufacturer. However, sometimes there is damage to the aircraft that is {{outside the scope of}} these manuals or the operator wishes to modify the aircraft to help it perform a specific function (aerial firefighting, search and rescue) or alter the aircraft in some other way. To ensure that the aircraft continues to be airworthy (i.e. safe to fly), the repair or modification must be examined by an aeronautical engineer so that the many complex factors that affect aircraft flight, structures and systems can be assessed and the design change approved as airworthy. To do this the engineer assesses the design of the modification or repair against the airworthiness requirements for the aircraft and then must justify that the design meets these requirements through the use of analysis, testing and experience. If the design has been shown to meet the airworthiness requirements it may be approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 35 (CAR35) and is hence 'approved data', satisfying CAR42U.|$|E

K-Line has also produced commemorative cars celebrating some of Lionel's significant anniversaries, which has sometimes caused confusion among collectors.|$|R
5000|$|KSFH {{was built}} in the {{technological}} spirit of the 1970s and similar to the famed [...] "Home Brew" [...] Computer Clubs that were frequented by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. The station's transmitters, mixing boards and primary [...] "on air" [...] components were almost all entirely built from scratch, few items were [...] "off the shelf" [...] ready bought. KSFH was hand crafted, built and engineered by students and former students (Primarily engineered thru the diligence of James O'Malley), the station's equipment was built from spares and electronic components purchased from Quement, Haltec and Radio Shack electronics stores. Long cold nights building the station (the rooms had no heat) were fueled by resourcefulness, junk food, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box runs - like all great startups. The original transmitter (10-Watt SPARTA exciter) was built from a <b>repair</b> <b>manual,</b> purchased from SPARTA Electronics, and later christened [...] "Everclear", not only for its clarity but also after a popular 110-proof liquor, only sold in Nevada. Finally, after the erection of the tower and antenna upon the St. Francis Gym roof, all broadcast components worked perfectly - KSFH was on the air. Serving St. Francis High School, its students and community for decades.|$|E
50|$|The final {{investigation}} {{report found that}} the accident {{was the result of}} metal fatigue caused by inadequate maintenance after a much earlier tailstrike incident. On 7 February 1980, the aircraft was flying from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Taoyuan International Airport via King Abdulaziz International Airport and Kai Tak International Airport on China Airlines Flight 009. While landing in Hong Kong, part of the plane's tail had scraped along the runway. The aircraft was depressurized, ferried back to Taiwan on the same day, and a temporary repair done the day after. A more permanent repair was conducted by a team from China Airlines from 23 May through 26 May 1980. However, the permanent repair of the tail strike was not carried out in accordance with the Boeing Structural <b>Repair</b> <b>Manual</b> (SRM). According to the manual, repairs could be made by replacing the entire affected skin or by cutting out the damaged portion and installing a reinforcing doubler to restore the structural strength. These two acceptable options were set aside in favor of a third, improvised option, which entailed installing a doubler over the scratched skin. This external doubler did not effectively cover the damaged area in its entirety, as scratches were found at, and outside, the outer row of fasteners securing the doubler. The doubler having been installed with scratches remaining outside the rivets meant that there was no protection against the propagation of a concealed crack in the area between the rivets and the perimeter of the doubler.|$|E
5000|$|For 1968 only, {{a special}} {{high-performance}} {{version of the}} 302 was offered for the Shelby GT350. Its main features included an angled, high-rise aluminum or iron intake manifold, a larger Holley four-barrel carburetor, and bigger valves of 1.875 in intake and 1.6 in exhaust. It had a longer-duration camshaft, still with hydraulic lifters. The block was made in Mexico. [...] "Hecho en Mexico" [...] casting marks {{are present in the}} lifter valley, and its main strength was the appearance of much larger and stronger two-bolt main bearing caps on the engines bottom end - the same as the HP-289, but not made from nodular iron rather Fords standard material. The heads had special close-tolerance pushrod holes to guide the pushrods without rail rocker arms or stamped steel guide plates. The combustion chambers also featured a smaller quench design for a higher compression ratio and enhanced flow characteristics. Additionally, high-flow cast exhaust manifolds similar to those on the 289 Hi-Po K-code engine further improved output. Heavy-duty connecting rods with high-strength bolts and a nodular iron crankshaft were also included in this package. Rated power (SAE gross) was estimated at [...] at 6,000 rpm and 333 lbft Nm at 3,800 rpm. The package, which cost $692 including some other equipment, was not popular and did not return for 1969. This engine was not a factory engine. Rather, like all Shelby Mustang engines, it was modified by Shelby American in their capacity as a vehicle upfitter. This special engine is well documented in the Ford factory engine <b>repair</b> <b>manual</b> for 1968 Mustangs and Fairlanes. This engine block is considered the strongest production 302 block other than the Boss 302 and the Trans Am 302. The Mexican 302 block was produced through to the mid-1990s and even showed up in Ford cars, trucks, and vans throughout the 1970s and early 1980s (Mexican-made 302 engines were often used by the USA car plants when CEP1 could not produce enough engines and many Ford replacement engines were Mexican).|$|E
