5000|$|Captan was {{previously}} cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but was reclassified in 2004. Since {{the mode of}} action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, captan has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine. The EPA now states, [...] "The new cancer classification considers captan to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and <b>regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia. These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, captan {{is not likely to}} be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels. A similar reclassification has been made for folpet, captan's sister fungicide, which shares a common mechanism of toxicity. A key finding for captan (and folpet) is these fungicides are not mutagenic in vivo; that is, they are not mutagenic in the intact animal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is a rare}} disease (15 cases per million) that is characterized by widespread loss of the pulmonary microcirculation and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leading to pathological right ventricular remodeling and ultimately right heart failure. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> therapies (i. e., therapies involving cells with stem or progenitor-like properties) could potentially restore the effective lung microcirculation and provide a curative therapy for PAH. Preclinical evidence suggests that <b>regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> therapy using endothelial progenitor cells or mesenchymal stem cells may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} PAH. These findings have led to the completion of a small number of human clinical trials, albeit with modest effect compared to animal studies. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy and safety of <b>regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> therapies in preclinical models of PAH as well as assess study quality to inform future clinical studies. Methods We will include preclinical studies of PAH in which a <b>regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> type was administered and outcomes compared to a disease control. The primary outcome will be pulmonary hemodynamics as assessed by measurement of right ventricular systolic pressure and/or mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Secondary outcomes will include mortality, survival, right ventricular remodeling, pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output, cardiac index, pulmonary acceleration time, tricuspid annular systolic excursion, and right ventricular wall thickness. Electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases will be constructed and reviewed by the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) process. Search results will be screened independently in duplicate. Data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random effects models. Risk of bias will be assessed using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool, and individual study reporting will be assessed according to an itemized checklist based on the Animal Research: Reporting of In vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Discussion This systematic review will examine the efficacy and safety of <b>regenerative</b> <b>cell</b> therapy in preclinical models of PAH. As well, the literature will be assessed for study quality and risk of bias. The results will guide the design of future clinical trials and preclinical animal studies.

Immunocytochemical studies revealed that both proteins are expressed in the <b>regenerative</b> <b>cells</b> however, their distribution pattern is clearly different. MsM 38 is localized in the cytoplasm of resting <b>regenerative</b> <b>cells</b> during the feeding period, and is accumulated in the calcospherits {{at the beginning of the}} wandering period. Along with the delamination of the larval epithelium, this protein is released apically from these vesicles. The antiserum labels an additional 76 kDa protein in the wandering larval midgut homogenates. The appearance of this 76 kDa protein coincides with the accumulation of the immunopositive material in the calcospherits. MsM 46 is similarly distributed during the feeding period in the cytoplasm of <b>regenerative</b> <b>cells.</b> At the beginning of the wandering period it accumulates around the newly forming large apical vacuoles, that are released at the time of complete delamination of the larval epithelium. In parallel with this process MsM 46, and another 40 kDa protein, that becomes labeled from this period on Western blots appeares on the apical microvillar projections. Thus both isolated proteins are directed apically from different compartments, that raises the possibility of a dual apical routing pathway in <b>regenerative</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
