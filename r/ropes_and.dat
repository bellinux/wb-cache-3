They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, compasses and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin was left to break up where she grounded.|$|E

60|$|So Halfman {{got down}} and filled a skin with water, and they drew {{it up by}} a <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> drank. When they had done drinking, Halfman, who was {{standing}} in the middle of the stream, called out: 'Throw me the <b>rope</b> <b>and</b> draw me up, for I cannot get out alone.' And the brothers threw him a rope to draw him up the steep bank; but when he was half-way up they cut the <b>rope,</b> <b>and</b> he fell back into the stream. Then the brothers rode away as fast as they could, with his bride.|$|R
5|$|Gameplay in Uncharted is a {{combination}} of action-adventure gameplay elements and 3D platforming with a third-person perspective. Platforming elements allow Nate to jump, swim, grab and move along ledges, climb and swing from <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> perform other acrobatic actions that allow players to make their way along the ruins in the various areas of the island that Drake explores.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|The final {{preliminary}} {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus Booker T. After Booker T backed Angle {{into the ring}} <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> executed a shoulder charge, Angle began to bleed from the mouth. The match saw exchange offense from both Angle and Booker T. The match {{came to an end}} when Angle attempted an Angle Slam, but Booker T grabbed Angle's leg and rolled him into a pinfall victory.|$|E

5|$|While {{the slaves}} lacked {{military}} training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity {{in their use}} of available local materials, and {{in their use of}} clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs {{on the side of the}} mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.|$|E
5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks.

One room, with a ceiling made from palm-logs, is filled with cultural relics of Oman. The square central tower holds the main museum exhibits including rugs, pottery, jewelry, weapons, household utensils and incense holders. A dining hall overlooks the courtyard {{for use by the}} distinguished visitors. An old breeze-maker has been preserved in this room, once manually operated but now mechanized.|$|E

5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|On 29 February {{a rocket}} {{launcher}} {{similar to one}} seized in the 1999 raid was found near an army base in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and on 15 March three men were arrested following the discovery of 500lb of home-made explosives when the RUC searched two cars in Hillsborough, County Down. On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5lb of homemade explosives over the perimeter fence using <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> the bomb subsequently exploded damaging the fence and an unmanned guardhouse.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} and smoke. Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, news reached New York that Congress {{had voted}} for {{independence}} four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons {{of the city}} to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, {{and the rest of the}} statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the salvage {{operation}} {{were approved}} by the Irish Coast Guard, and the salvage operation began on 1 September, with work to remove loose <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> secure the fuel containers; the salvage operation was expected to take up to 3 weeks. Astrid was recovered by the sheerleg GPS Atlas on 9 September 2013 by Atlantic Towage and Marine, and was transported on a barge to Kinsale for assessment and an investigation of what caused the accident. The insurers of the ship deemed the cost of restoring Astrid to be too high due to the damage caused while she was partially submerged (an economic write-off); as such she was scrapped and taken to Cork Harbour to be broken up. The scrapping process was completed by April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> gave them encouragement.|$|E

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended next in {{what was}} {{originally}} promoted as a Three Way match but was fought under elimination rules. Christopher Daniels defended the title against Chris Sabin, who was accompanied by Trinity, and Michael Shane, who was accompanied by Traci. Near the 11 minute mark, Sabin eliminated Shane after performing his signature Cradle Shock maneuver. With the match down to Sabin and Daniels, Daniels gained a near-fall after performing his signature Best Moonsault Ever aerial maneuver. Sabin also gained a near-fall after jumping off the <b>ropes</b> <b>and</b> driving Daniels' head into the mat. Daniels eventually won the bout at 17 minutes and 10 seconds by utilizing his signature Angel's Wings maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The first {{style of}} Hachijō-daiko {{is thought to}} descend {{directly}} from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types of underlying rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} calm for Pagan {{ended in the}} early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the <b>ropes,</b> <b>and</b> Emperor Kublai Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271, sought {{to cut off the}} retreat of Song {{refugees}} in all directions. In Pagan's case, he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.|$|E
