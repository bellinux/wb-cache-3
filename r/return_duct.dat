When both the supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> are constructed in this manner, {{it is possible}} to insulate the ducts and the dropped ceiling so that the upper airspace is not heated or cooled, increasing energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{reduction}} phase: The plunger {{is still}} on its way down, the engine ECU de-energizes the solenoid when required quantity of fuel is delivered, the fuel valve opens, fuel can flow back into <b>return</b> <b>duct,</b> causing pressure drop, which in turn causes the injector nozzle needle to shut, hence no more fuel is injected.|$|E
5000|$|Injection phase: The {{pump element}} {{is still on}} the way down, the solenoid is now {{energized}} and fuel line is now closed. The fuel can not pass back into <b>return</b> <b>duct,</b> and is now compressed by the plunger until pressure exceeds specific [...] "opening" [...] pressure, and the injector nozzle needle lifts, allowing fuel to be injected into the combustion chamber.|$|E
5000|$|Gas fired {{forced air}} {{furnaces}} have a burner in the furnace fuelled by natural gas. A blower forces cold air through a heat exchanger {{and then through}} duct-work that distributes the hot air through the building. [...] Each room will have an outlet from the duct system, often mounted in the floor or low on the wall - some rooms will also have an opening into the cold air <b>return</b> <b>duct.</b> Depending on {{the age of the}} system, forced air gas furnaces use either a pilot light or a solid state ignition system (spark or hot surface ignition) to light the natural gas burner. The natural gas is fed to buildings from a main gas line. The duct work supplying the hot air (and sometimes cool air if an AC unit is tied into the system) may be insulated. A thermostat starts and stops the furnace to regulate temperature. Large homes or commercial buildings may have multiple thermostats and heating zones, controlled by powered dampers. A digital thermostat can be programmed to activate the gas furnace at certain times. For example, a resident may want the temperature in their dwelling to rise 15 minutes before returning from work.|$|E
5000|$|Inspections are {{typically}} visual, looking for water damage or biological growth. [...] When visual inspection {{needs to be}} validated numerically, a vacuum test (VT) or deposit thickness test (DTT) can be performed. A duct with less than 0.75 mg/100m2 {{is considered to be}} clean, per the NADCA standard. A Hong Kong standard lists surface deposit limits of 1g/m2 for supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> and 6g/m2 for exhaust ducts, or a maximum deposit thickness of 60 µm in supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts,</b> and 180 µm for exhaust ducts. Another UK standard recommends ducts cleaning if measured bacterial content is more than 29 colony forming units (CFU) per 10 cm2; contamination is classified as [...] "low" [...] below 10 CFU/cm2, [...] "medium" [...] at up to 20 CFU/cm2, and [...] "high" [...] when measured above 20 CFU/cm2.|$|R

50|$|In {{commercial}} settings, regular {{inspection of}} ductwork is recommended by several standards. One standard recommends inspecting supply ducts every 1-2 years, <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> every 1-2 years, and {{air handling units}} annually.

Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying duct insulation level, supply duct area, <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> area, supply duct leakage, <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> leakage, and ceiling insulation levels. The results of sensitivity analyses show acceptable agreement versus the EnergyGauge program for duct insulation level, supply duct area, <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> area, supply duct leakage, and ceiling insulation level. Significant differences in the <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> leakage calculations were observed. These comparisons show the ESL model is more sensitive to <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> leakage than the EnergyGauge model Comparison of the results of the duct model for two cases (with radiant barrier and without radiant barrier) show acceptable agreements for the parameters of duct insulation, supply duct surface area, <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> surface area, supply duct leakage and ceiling insulation. The results of savings (with and without radiant barriers) indicate that the ESL model shows slightly more savings for all parameters.

40|$|Traditional air {{delivery}} to high-bay buildings involves ceiling level supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> that create an almost-uniform {{temperature in the}} space. Problems with this system include potential recirculation of supply air and higher-than-necessary return air temperatures. A new {{air delivery}} strategy was investigated that involves changing the height of conventional supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> to have control over thermal stratification in the space. A full-scale experiment using ten vertical temperature profiles was conducted in a manufacturing facility over one year. The experimental data was utilized to validated CFD and EnergyPlus models. CFD simulation results show that supplying air directly to the occupied zone increases stratification while holding thermal comfort constant during the cooling operation. The building energy simulation identified how return air temperature offset, set point offset, and stratification influence the building’s energy consumption. A utility bill analysis for cooling shows 28. 8 % HVAC energy savings while the building energy simulation shows 19. 3 – 37. 4 % HVAC energy savings...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of forced-air distribution systems in new residential construction was investigated to determine current conditions and identify improvements. Previous research was reviewed, survey data analyzed to assess current construction practices, and relevant {{codes and standards}} were examined. The decision-making process of HVAC design and installation was explored through focus groups with builders and contractors. Performance analysis of duct systems at 22 data collection sites measured duct leakage, house infiltration, and thermal performance. Ducts located in conditioned spaces perform more efficiently than systems in unconditioned space. <b>Return</b> <b>ducts</b> constructed from building cavities are leaky relative to hard <b>ducted</b> <b>return</b> systems. A best practice was identified to help builders move ductwork from attic spaces to interior walls when practical and economical. Barriers to improved duct efficiency are first cost, traditional practices, lack of consumer interest and education, and inadequate planning. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the applicability of adiabatic humidification in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of semiconductor cleanrooms. Accurate temperature and humidity control are essential in semiconductor cleanrooms and high energy consumption steam humidification is commonly used. Therefore, we propose an adiabatic humidification system employing a pressurized water atomizer to reduce the energy consumption. The annual energy consumption of three different HVAC systems were analyzed {{to evaluate the}} applicability of adiabatic humidification. The studied cases were as follows: (1) CASE 1 : a make-up air unit (MAU) with a steam humidifier, a dry cooling coil (DCC), and a fan filter unit (FFU); (2) CASE 2 : a MAU with the pressurized water atomizer, a DCC, and a FFU; and (3) CASE 3 : a MAU, a DCC, and a FFU, and the pressurized water atomizer installed in the <b>return</b> <b>duct.</b> The energy saving potential of adiabatic humidification over steam humidification has been proved, with savings of 8 % and 23 % in CASE 2 and CASE 3 compared to CASE 1, respectively. Furthermore, the pressurized water atomizer installed in the <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> exhibits greater energy saving effect than when installed in the MAU...|$|E

To accomplish this, FUNCTION commands for DOE- 2 were used to develop the duct model and provide the improved predictions of the duct heat loss or gain from the unconditioned space as well as supply or <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> leakage.

40|$|Empirical {{equations}} {{were developed}} {{and applied to}} predict losses of 0. 01 - 100 {micro}m airborne particles making a single pass through 120 different ventilation duct runs typical of those found in mid-sized office buildings. For all duct runs, losses were negligible for submicron particles and nearly complete for particles larger than 50 {micro}m. The 50 th percentile cut-point diameters were 15 {micro}m in supply runs and 25 {micro}m in return runs. Losses in supply duct runs were higher than in <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> runs, mostly because internal insulation was present in portions of supply duct runs, but absent from <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> runs. Single-pass equations for particle loss in duct runs were combined with models for predicting ventilation system filtration efficiency and particle deposition to indoor surfaces to evaluate the fates of particles of indoor and outdoor origin in an archetypal mechanically ventilated building. Results suggest that duct losses are a minor influence for determining indoor concentrations for most particle sizes. Losses in ducts were of a comparable magnitude to indoor surface losses for most particle sizes. For outdoor air drawn into an unfiltered ventilation system, most particles smaller than 1 {micro}m are exhausted from the building. Large particles deposit within the building, mostly in supply ducts or on indoor surfaces. When filters are present, most particles are either filtered or exhausted. The fates of particles generated indoors follow similar trends as outdoor particles drawn into the building...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and air flow in a vertical open refrigerated display cabinet loaded with packages of test product was studied {{in order to}} analyse unsteady state phenomena. The product and air temperatures in the curtain were measured using tiny thermocouples, air velocity using a hot wire anemometer and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry). A comparison between the air velocities measured by these two methods shows a good agreement at the internal side of the air curtain. However, these two methods give quite different result at the external side of the air curtain which {{can be explained by}} the complex air flow in this region. The temporal variation of the air temperature inside the air curtain is due partly to the "on/off" compressor cycle and partly to the introduction of ambient air via vortices. The latter phenomena contribute to the rapid velocity fluctuations which are greatest in the mixing layer of the air curtain. The product position in the cabinet is a determining factor of its temperature. The convective and radiative heat flux between the products located at the front of the display cabinet and the air was also measured. Near the air supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts,</b> the convective {{heat transfer}} coefficient was higher than between these two positions because of the high instability of air flow near the inlet and <b>return</b> <b>ducts.</b> The radiative exchange is more significant at the top of the display cabinet than at the botto...|$|R
5000|$|The wall inlets are {{connected}} to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air <b>return</b> <b>ducts</b> (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple blowers may {{be present}} in large {{commercial}} air handling units, typically placed {{at the end of}} the AHU and the beginning of the supply ductwork (therefore also called [...] "supply fans").

30|$|The VESDA smoke {{detector}} prototypes manufactured firstly at CSIRO, {{and later in}} several phases in the PMG workshops in Melbourne, utilized pulsed xenon flash tubes and photo-multipliers to detect broad wavelength, white light scattered off smoke particles carried into the detector labyrinth by air pumped out of an HVAC <b>return</b> <b>duct.</b> The high intensity light source and high sensitivity photo-multiplier receiver design enabled very low concentrations of smoke to be detected. The broad spectrum enabled the device to detect quite a significant range of particle sizes, the theory of which Packham, Gibson and others published in various reports and journal articles from 1971 to 1974 (Gibson and Packham 1971), (Gibson, 1973), (Packham et al., 1974).|$|E
30|$|Gibson and Petersen quickly {{understood}} at {{that time}} that some telephone exchanges, computer centres and Defence facilities had air-conditioning systems which could fail or could be shut down at times to save energy. As a result, detection from a <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> would be seriously degraded. They therefore conceived a small bore pipework sampling system mounted initially at ceiling level to draw air samples back from rooms to be protected, regardless of whether the air-conditioning system was on or off. They conducted many experiments as well as field trials in telecommunication facilities, to show such duct sampling and pipework sampling systems using the VESDA concept could still work extremely effectively in this manner, even in high airflow environments. (Neilson, 1976) They developed some empirical rules for sampling pipework designs.|$|E

The tubes are slotted a distance equal to substantially the full width of the sheet material for complete, gentle drying by sheets of air. A common plenum supplies the tubes with heated air; the air is directed from the tube slots at a pronounced angle to the sheet surface to provide for arraying the tubes {{close to the surface}} for maximum drying effect while minimizing the danger of mechanical interference between the edges of the sheets and the slots in the tubes. The driver for the transport is housed in an enclosure between the plenum and the drying chamber; an air <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> is provided along another side to complete insulation of the drying chamber from ambient conditions...|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of skyscrapers, grand hotels {{and other large}} buildings {{led to the development}} of central heating, an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal <b>return</b> <b>ducts.</b> In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{overhead}} mixing systems usually locate {{both the}} supply and <b>return</b> air <b>ducts</b> {{at the ceiling}} level.

High-speed turbulent air jets incoming supply air mix with the room air.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of CFD modeling of the coal pulverizing mill at the Loy Yang B Power Station in Victoria, Australia. The focus of this work is to consider issues relevant to coal power generation whereby the quality of the fuel supply varies in sand content. The Eulerian/Lagrangian approach was used for the numerical modelling due to the low solid-to-gas loading of the industrial power station flows. The sand modelling investigation highlighted that the larger sand particles recirculates through the grinding mill via the classifier <b>return</b> <b>duct.</b> Erosion of the mill-wall system is influenced by the sand loading. Results showed the reduction of wear was significantly reduced as the gas mass-flow was reduced. The CFD modelling produced consistent results for the particle mass flow splits between the three mill-duct legs when compared with the measured data conducted in the earlier trials. The erosion protection plate did not completely eradicate the erosion, however the degree of erosion was reduced...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of test for {{residential}} thermal distribution efficiency {{is currently being}} developed {{under the auspices of}} the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). This test method will have three main approaches, or ``pathways``, designated Design, Diagnostic, and Research. The Design Pathway uses builder`s information to predict thermal distribution efficiency in new construction. The Diagnostic Pathway uses air-flow, temperature, and pressure-difference tests [...] intended to take one to four hours [...] to evaluate thermal distribution efficiency in a completed house. For forced-air systems, three distinct techniques are being considered, one based on thermal inputs and outputs in the duct system, the second based on pressure and leakage-area measurements, and the third based on pressure differentials induced in the house by partial blockage of the <b>return</b> <b>duct.</b> This paper presents and discusses the results of Design Pathway calculations based on measured duct-system and floor-plan layouts and surface areas (in lieu of building plans) for fifteen residential duct systems in Long Island, New York.

40|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{transcritical}} CO 2 refrigeration is the gliding temperature available when cooling the transcritical fluid {{from the final}} high temperature at completion of compression to as low a temperature as practicable. This property may be exploited when requiring simultaneous cooling and heating in building air conditioning applications. The CO 2 compressor discharge can usually heat enough water for heating, reheating and hot water purposes thereby obviating {{the need for a}} boiler and its fuel supply. Using USA Department of Energy data for energy consumption by USA office buildings it is shown that CO 2 cooling reduces primary energy consumption, energy cost, water consumption at the buildings and CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 55 %, 57 %, 75 % and 53 % respectively in the existing building stock when coupled with a 25 % reduction in supply and <b>return</b> <b>duct</b> air velocities, and exhaust duct air velocities. In the case of new buildings these beneficial reductions would be about 63 %, 65 %, 79 % and 61 % respectively. Incorporation of energy recovery from exhaust air and economizing cycles will produce additional reductions in all three areas. The absence of cooling towers eliminates the danger of Legionella disease. The absence of HFC refrigerants eliminates the danger of high GWP fugitive gases escaping...|$|E
40|$|A {{promising}} mean {{to realize}} the integration of decentralized thermal energy sources in districts and urban areas are low-temperature-networks (LTN). However, the general modus operandi of LTN can differ greatly. A very common approach in district heating is to supply consumers with heating and cooling power on the bases of unidirectional mass and energy flows. These systems consist of supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts.</b> On the other hand, more recently designed networks operate on bidirectional mass and energy flows between a warm and cold duct. The underlying concept is inherently non-linear in character and still bears some challenges and open questions to research. The question addressed here is what conceptual system design is more energy efficient. With reference to already realized systems, namely “ETH Hönggerberg” and “Brig-Naters”, two simulation models were developed and equally parametrised to compare their conceptual designs in regard to their exergetic efficiency. One system operates on unidirectional, the other on bidirectional mass and energy flows. The simulation models consider consumers with heating and cooling demands and a source. For both systems the energy and exergy flows {{as well as the}} auxiliary powers were calculated...|$|R

40|$|A heavily {{instrumented}} and unoccupied research {{house is}} used to continuously monitor the temperature in each room, the supply and <b>return</b> <b>ducts,</b> HVAC thermostat location, attic and outdoors. Simultaneous measurements of the differential pressures have been performed across the house walls, indoorfattic zones, the house slab and the indoor zones. Indoor radon concentrations and meteorological conditions have also been monitored. Temperature measurements were conducted using thermocouple wires. All data were collected by computer-controlled data acquisition input boards. An analytical model was developed based on a linear approximation to the weakly exponentially dependent pressures between two temperature zones under hydrostatic equilibrium. The model is utilized to predict the temperature-induced pressure difference between two separated temperature zones. This model is then coupled with a semi-empirical formulation that utilizes pressure differences to predict radon entry into the structure and the air exchange rate across the house shell. The partial contributions of various temperatureinduced pressure differences are assessed on the model driving parameters. The contribution to the indoor radon concentrations are then obtained by incorporating the predicted changes in pressure differentials into the mass balance equation governing the time rate changes of the radon concentrations. It has been demonstrated that temperature differences associated with extreme weather conditions can generate pressure differences of several pascals that profoundly contribute to radon driving forces and indoor radon concentrations. The partial contributions of temperaturedriven radon entry rates and ventilation rates {{for a range of}} HVAC operation were also estimated...|$|R
