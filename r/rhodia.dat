25|$|Another {{recently}} developed source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have significant rare-earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made extraction of rare earths from these materials more feasible, and recycling plants are currently operating in Japan, {{where there is}} an estimated 300,000 tons of rare earths stored in unused electronics. In France, the <b>Rhodia</b> group is setting up two factories, in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons, that will produce 200 tons of rare earths a year from used fluorescent lamps, magnets and batteries.|$|E

[...] At $700/kg, this product, sold under the trademarked name Rhovanil Natural, is not cost-competitive with petrochemical vanillin, which sells for around $15/kg. However, unlike vanillin synthesized from lignin or guaiacol, it can be labeled as a natural flavoring.|$|E
2500|$|The pilots, {{for their}} part, {{declared}} to have attacked the secondary target Dole Tavaux. However, that declaration was made only {{later in the}} year. The claim that the duds of the attack were not German, had already been refuted by the time code. Nevertheless, the myth that foreign aircraft had bombed Freiburg had a long-standing basis. Background for {{this could have been}} memories of the air raids during World War I. Then Freiburg was bombed 25 times by allied aircraft. Another factor might have been the shelling of Freiburg by French artillery on 11 and 13 June 1940. On that occasion shells fell on the southern Loretto mountain, [...] Merzhausen, Günterstal, and the area around the airport {{as well as on the}} premises of the company <b>Rhodia</b> and the gasworks. This possibility of attack was eliminated by the advance of the German troops in France from 15 June 1940 onwards.|$|E

The French knight Guillaume Caoursin, vice-chancellor of the Knights Hospitaller, fought in the siege of Rhodes and wrote its description in his Obsidionis <b>Rhodiae</b> Urbis Descriptio (an English translation exists as a part of Edward Gibbon's Crusades). An earlier English translation was the work of John Caius the Elder (printed 1481-84). D'Aubusson's own report on the siege can be found in John Taaffe's history of the Holy, military, sovereign order of st. John of Jerusalem.|$|R
50|$|Fifteen years later, Petrus {{has succeeded}} his uncle, naming himself Valerius II and making Alixana, {{formerly}} Aliana, his empress. Valerius II commissions a great sanctuary for Jad and summons Martinian of Batiara, a renowned mosiacist, to decorate it. The royal request is sent with Pronobius Tilliticus, an Imperial Courier, who delays {{delivery of the}} message while pursuing personal pleasure along the road. Martinian, partially on whim and partially believing himself too old to travel, causes Tilliticus to mistake his friend and colleague Caius Crispus ("Crispin") of <b>Rhodias</b> for him, delivering the message in a public fashion. Crispin is reluctant to accept the prestigious summons, having lost the desire to live when {{his wife and two}} daughters died of the plague the previous year. Having taken too long receive the summons, the season no longer allows Crispin to Sail to Sarantium; he must take the road. Martinian sends Crispin to talk to his old and well-traveled friend Zoticus for advice on his journey. Zoticus reveals himself to have some supernatural powers and gives Crispin a mechanical bird, Linon, that is alive, being able to both talk to him aloud and within his mind. He also gives Crispin the name of his daughter and another person in Sarantium who may be able to help him.|$|R

5000|$|The Lycian League (Lukiakou systema in Strabo's Greek transliterated, a [...] "standing together") {{is first}} known from two {{inscriptions}} {{of the early}} 2nd century BC in which it honors two citizens. Bryce hypothesizes that it was formed as an agent to convince Rome to rescind the annexation of Lycia to Rhodes. It is not known for certain whether it was formed before or after Lycia was removed from Rhodian control. According to Livy, the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus put Lycia had been under Rhodian control in 190 BC. He wrote that a Lycian embassy complained about the cruel tyranny of the Rhodians {{and that they were}} under king Antiochus III the Great they had been in liberty in comparison. It was slavery, rather that just political oppression, [...] " [...] they, their wives and children were the victims of violence; their oppressors vented their rage on their persons and their backs, their good name was besmirched and dishonoured, their condition rendered detestable in order that their tyrants might openly assert a legal right over them and reduce them to the status of slaves bought with money.. the senate gave them a letter to and to the <b>Rhodias</b> that ...it was not the pleasure of the senate that either the Lycians or any other men born free should be handed over as slaves to the Rhodians or any one else. The Lycians possessed the same rights under the suzerainty and protection of Rhodes that friendly states possessed under the suzerainty of Rome." [...] Polybius wrote that the Romans sent envoys to Rhodes to say that [...] "the Lycians had not been handed over to Rhodes as a gift, but to be treated like friends and allies." [...] The Rhodians claimed that king Eumenes of Pergamon had stirred up the Lycians against them. In 169 BC, during the Third Macedonian War, the relationship between Rome and Rhodes became strained and the Roman senate issued a decree which gave the Carians and the Lycians their freedom. Polybius recorded a decree “freeing” the Carians and Lycians in 168-7 BC.|$|R
