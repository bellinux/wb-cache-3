5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> and thickened bone {{on the top of}} its snout, and the single rounded horn on the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once and hold on until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

25|$|The tongue evolved {{with the}} {{amphibians}} {{from the same}} structures that form fins in fishes. Most amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. As a consequence most vertebrate animals - amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals - have tongues. In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue {{is often used to}} clean the fur and body by licking. The tongues of these species have a very <b>rough</b> <b>texture</b> which allows them to remove oils and parasites. Some dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma. A dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow.|$|E
25|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are large}} and broad, with rounded margins. The two dorsal fins are roughly equal in size and have rounded apices and angular free rear tips; the first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are rounded and almost {{as large as the}} pectoral fins. The anal fin is less than half the size of the dorsal fins and is positioned very close {{to the base of the}} long, low caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises about a quarter of the total length, with no ventral lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are large, giving the skin a <b>rough</b> <b>texture.</b> This species is light to dark brown above, often with white flecks, and lighter below.

Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel are the two main models that attempt to describe the wetting of textured surfaces. However, these equations only apply when the drop size is sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale. When the droplet size is comparable to that of the underlying pillars, the effect of line tension should be considered[...]|$|E

40|$|High {{efficiency}} thin-film silicon {{solar cells}} require texturing {{of the front}} contacts for advanced light management. However, optically favorable textures may be challenging {{in terms of the}} electrical performance. Solar cells deposited on very rough front contacts show a reduced open-circuit voltage, Voc, as compared to flat TCOs. This contribution focuses on the impact of rough surfaces on the Voc in a-Si:H solar cells deposited on six different textured front TCOs. With various i-layer thicknesses from 100 to 400 nm the origin of the Voc loss is investigated. Based on our results we propose that the reduction of Voc in a-Si:H solar cells are mainly due to defective regions in the bulk material induced by very <b>rough</b> <b>textures.</b> It is also seen that enlarging the i-layer thickness can improve the Voc of solar cells when grown on very <b>rough</b> <b>textures.</b> By using variable illumination intensity measurements the existence of shunts could be evidenced...|$|R

2500|$|At most times, Rome's {{thoroughfares}} {{would have}} been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens jostling about their business, in {{a great variety of}} colourful garments, with few togas in evidence. Only a higher-caste Roman, a magistrate, would have had lictors to clear his way, and even then, wearing a toga was hard work. Its apparent natural simplicity and [...] "elegant, flowing lines" [...] were the result of diligent practice and cultivation; its wearer must walk with measured, stately gait, or risk an embarrassing disarrangement.

Vout (1966) suggests that the toga's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the Romans' view of themselves and their civilization.

2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the triboelectric effect. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates {{a great amount of}} static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. Since most surfaces have a <b>rough</b> <b>texture,</b> it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. Conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static electric generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.|$|E
