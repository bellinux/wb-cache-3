40|$|Hamster trachea organ {{cultures}} {{were exposed}} to isolated membranes of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, PI 1428. Attachment, monitored by the uptake of tritiated membranes, was relatively insensitive to neuraminidase pretreatment, unlike the attachment of viable cells. Membrane attachment was optimal when explants were incubated with 50 to 100 micrograms of membrane protein per ml in minimal essential medium broth while gently being rotated (1 rpm) in a <b>roller</b> <b>apparatus</b> for 90 to 120 min at 37 degrees C. Saturation of the receptor sites with viable cells failed to inhibit subsequent membrane attachment. Induction of squamous metaplasia by extended cultivation of tracheal explants in a vitamin A-free medium reduced the content of ciliated cells without significantly affecting total cell viability, but did not alter the attachment of M. pneumoniae membranes. Collectively, the data indicate that the mechanism of attachment of M. pneumoniae membranes to respiratory epithelium is distinct from the receptor site-mediated attachment of M. pneumoniae cells...|$|E
40|$|In Ge-As-Te system, {{the glass}} forming region {{determined}} by normal melt quenching method has two regions (GFR I and GFR II) separated by few compositions gap. With a simple laboratory built twin <b>roller</b> <b>apparatus,</b> we {{have succeeded in}} preparing Ge 7. 5 AsxTe 92. 5 -x glasses over extended composition ranges. A distinct change in T-g is observed at x = 40, exactly at which {{the separation of the}} glass forming regions occur indicating the changes in the connectivity and the rigidity of the structural network. The maximum observed in glass transition (T-g) at x = 55 corresponding to the average coordination number (Z(av)) = 2. 70 is an evidence for the shift of the rigidity percolation threshold (RPT) from Z(av) = 2. 40 as predicted by the recent theories. The glass forming tendency (K-gl) and Delta T (=T-c-T-g) is low for the glasses in the GFR I and high for the glasses in the GFR II...|$|E
40|$|Bone Tissue Engineering (BTE) and Dental Implantology (DI) {{require the}} {{integration}} of implanted structures, with well characterized surfaces, in bone. In this work we have challenged acid-etched titanium (AET) and Laser Sintered Titanium (LST) surfaces with either human osteoblasts or stem cells from human dental pulps (DPSCs), to understand their osteointegration and clinical use capability of derived implants. DPSCs and human osteoblasts were challenged with the two titanium surfaces, either in plane cultures or in a <b>roller</b> <b>apparatus</b> within a culture chamber, for hours up to a month. During the cultures cells on the titanium surfaces were examined for histology, protein secretion and gene expression. Results show that a complete osteointegration using human DPSCs has been obtained: these cells were capable to quickly differentiate into osteoblasts and endotheliocytes and, then, able to produce bone tissue along the implant surfaces. Osteoblast differentiation of DPSCs and bone morphogenetic protein production was obtained in a better and quicker way, when challenging stem cells with the LST surfaces. This successful BTE in a comparatively short time gives interesting data suggesting that LST is a promising alternative for clinical use in DI...|$|E
40|$|Li 2 O-SiO 2 {{glasses with}} high Li 2 O content (33 - 62 mole% Li 2 O) were {{prepared}} by a twin <b>roller</b> quench <b>apparatus,</b> and their electrical characteristics were measured as function of temperature. Glass specimens with conductivity {{as high as}} 10 - 5 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at room temperature were obtained. As far as d. c. conductivity was concerned, rapid quenching was equivalent to increasing the alkali content. On the other hand, the quenching rate had little influence on high frequency (or low temperature) electrical characteristics. This suggests that the quenching rate affects mainly the long range motion of alkali ions...|$|R
40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDA Publishing Association ([URL] audienceIn this paper, we will report our {{achievements}} in developing large area patterning of multilayered ceramic green composites using roller embossing. The aim of our research is to pattern large area ceramic green composites using a modified <b>roller</b> laminating <b>apparatus,</b> which is compatible with screen printing machines, for integration of embossing and screen printing. The instrumentation of our <b>roller</b> embossing <b>apparatus,</b> as shown in Figure 1, consists of roller 1 and rollers 2. Roller 1 is heated up to the desired embossing temperature; roller 2 is, however, kept at room temperature. The mould is a nickel template manufactured by plating nickel-based micro patterns (height : 50 µm) on a nickel film (thickness : 70 µm); the substrate for the roller embossing is a multilayered Heraeus Heralock HL 2000 ceramic green composite. Comparing with the conventional simultaneous embossing, the advantages of roller embossing include : (1) low embossing force; (2) easiness of demoulding; (3) localized area in contact with heater; and etc. We have demonstrated the capability of large area roller embossing with a panel size of 150 mmx 150 mm on the mentioned substrate. We have explored and confirmed the impact of parameters (feed speed, temperature of roller and applied pressure) to the pattern quality of roller embossing. Furthermore, under the optimized process parameters, we characterized the variations of pattern dimension over the panel area, and calculated a scaling factor {{in order to make}} the panel compatible with other processes.

40|$|Production of {{secondary}} metabolites in plant tissue cultures The {{goal of this}} study is to determine the influence of sodium molybdate and sodium tungstate as elicitors on production of scopoletin in cell suspension culture of Angelica archangelica L. The culture was grown in a liquid culture medium Murashige and Skoog on a <b>roller</b> <b>apparatus</b> in the dark and light. The content of scopoletin was in cells and in the culture medium determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. The results show that sodium molybdate served as an elicitor to the production of scopoletin positively, application of sodium tungstate did not increase scopoletin production in any case. The highest production of scopoletin after application of sodium molybdate versus the control cells was reached in the suspension culture of Angelica archangelica L. cultured in the dark at a concentration of 25, 50 mg/l. Scopoletin content increased by 166, 7 %. After application of sodium tungstate the production always decreased, in the medium of a suspension culture of Angelica archangelica L. cultivated in the light at a concentration of 66. 00 mg/l, the production decrease was by up 62, 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Avian rotaviruses were {{isolated}} from feral pigeon faeces treated with trypsin using roller tube cultures of mammalian cells. Two pigeon strains, designated as strains PO- 8 and PO- 13, produced a marked cytopathic effect (CPE), small intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies and high titres of infectious particles in infected MA- 104 and MDBK cell lines without cell adaptation and <b>roller</b> drum <b>apparatus.</b> The pigeon rotaviruses {{shared a common}} group specific antigen with the Lincoln strain of bovine rotavirus by indirect immunofluorescence, but differed from both the Lincoln strain and the Wa strain of human rotavirus in neutralization tests. The RNA segment profile of this virus on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis differed from that of group A mammalian rotaviruses.

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that {{vascular}} smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exhibit varied physiological responses when exposed to altered gravitational conditions. In the present study, we focused on elucidating whether the cell surface glycocalyx could be a potential gravity sensor. For this purpose, a <b>roller</b> culture <b>apparatus</b> was used {{with the intent to}} provide altered gravitational conditions to cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Heparinase III (Hep. III) was applied to degrade cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) selectively. Sodium chlorate was used to suppress new synthesis of HSPG. Glycocalyx remodeling, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation, and F-actin expression induced by gravity alteration were assessed by flow cytometry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot. Results indicate that the exposure of cultured RASMCs to altered gravitational conditions led to a reduction in cell surface HSPG content and the activation of NOS. It also down-regulated the expression of glypican- 1, constitutive NOS (NOSI and NOSIII), and F-actin. On the other hand, Hep. III followed by sodium chlorate treatment of HSPG attenuated the afore-mentioned NOS and F-actin modulation under altered gravitational conditions. All these findings suggest that the glycocalyx, and HSPG in particular, may be an important sensor of gravitational changes. This may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of NOS activation, F-actin modulation, and HSPG remodeling in VSMCs.

3000|$|Drilling fluids are {{designed}} to assist drilling by minimizing reservoir damage and increasing productivity of pay zone. Excess fluid loss due to degradation of additives of drilling fluids causes {{a major problem in}} real-time drilling. Usages of excess biocides are threat to the environment and cause handling problems. Effect of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, a cationic surfactant, on rheology, fluid loss and biocide has been studied in a polymer-based drilling fluid. Inhibitive polymer mud was formulated using XC polymer, shale inhibitors like KCl, K 2 SO 4 and CaCO 3 as bridging agent. Rheology and other properties were studied using Fann VG meter, API filter press, mud balance, <b>roller</b> oven <b>apparatus.</b> Dissolved oxygen meter was used to check the microbicidal property of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide. Addition of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide increased fluid retention capacity of the fluid even at very low concentration 0.1 %(w/v) without affecting the mud properties. Also it is compatible with the commercially available fluid loss preventers like pre-gelatinized starch when used in combination. It also performed well in dissolved oxygen test, suggesting eliminating need of any other biocide to prevent degradation of bio-polymer-based drilling fluid. The dissolved oxygen test results are comparable with commercial available biocides. Thermal stability studies were carried out by using roller oven at different temperatures. It was found suitable for application in high-concentrated brine conditions and at high temperatures up to 120  °C without effecting the rheology and shear thinning property of the fluid. Bridging efficiency was investigated by analysing the mud cake using scanning electron microscope.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{great need}} to {{construct}} more durable roads such as concrete roads in Sri Lanka since the government is spending {{a considerable amount of}} money every year to maintain the national road network which has been constructed using with either conventional asphalt concrete or bituminous paving materials. This research was carried out mainly to explore the possibility of introducing more durable and cost effective Roller Compacted Concrete for road pavements in Sri Lanka. The structural behavior of Roller Compacted Concrete pavement (RCCP), which is a rigid pavement, is completely different from conventional asphalt pavements which are designed as flexible pavements. Since RCCP is not currently used in Sri Lanka there is no local standards available for design and construction of RCCP. An extensive literature review was carried out regarding the design of rigid pavements practiced in other countries. The rigid pavements can be designed using different types of design methods for given conditions. However, out of those methods, American Association of State Highway Traffic Organization method (AASHTO) and Portland Cement Association (PCA) method are popular in the countries where rigid pavements are used. Out of these two methods AASHTO method uses more parameters in designing the pavement thickness. Therefore, parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of each parameter used in AASHTO method. And also a computer program was developed based on PCA method to carry out the thickness design procedure effectively, as it is more suitable for low volume traffic conditions. An experimental investigation was carried out to formulate a mix design procedure for RCC using local materials. Since the thickness of RCCP depends on the flexural strength of RCC, tests were carried out to investigate the factors affecting the flexural strength of RCC and also other properties such as wet density, compressive strength and drying shrinkage. New test methods were developed to measure these properties specially the flexural strength and wet density incorporating actual conditions of RCC such as actions of static and vibrating <b>rollers.</b> A new <b>apparatus</b> was developed to measure the wet density by modifying the conventional V-B apparatus where vibration as well as known static pressure can be applied to compact concrete. Furthermore, use of chemical and mineral admixtures to improve the properties of RCC was also investigated. Based on the results of experimental investigations a mix design procedure for RCC was proposed...|$|R
