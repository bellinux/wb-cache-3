50|$|The inputs to the {{algorithm}} are two waveforms represented by two data vectors containing 16 bit PCM samples. The first vector contains the {{samples of the}} (undistorted) reference signal, whereas the second vector contains the samples of the degraded signal. The POLQA algorithm consists of a temporal alignment block, a sample rate estimator of a sample rate converter, {{which is used to}} compensate for differences in the sample rate of the input signals, and the actual core model, which performs the MOS calculation. In a first step, the delay between the two input signals is determined and the sample rate of the two signals relative to each other is estimated. The sample rate estimation is based on the delay information calculated by the temporal alignment. If the sample rate differs by more than approximately 1%, the signal with the higher sample rate is down sampled. After each step, the results are stored together with an average delay <b>reliability</b> <b>indicator,</b> which is a measure for the quality of the delay estimation. The result from the re-sampling step, which yielded the highest overall reliability, is finally chosen. Once the correct delay is determined and the sample rate differences have been compensated, the signals and the delay information are passed on to the core model, which calculates the perceptibility as well as the annoyance of the distortions and maps them to a MOS scale. A much more detailed and comprehensive description of {{the algorithm}} can be found in. The next few sections are only intended to give an overview on the basics of POLQA’s internal structure.|$|E

The FFP value is approximately constant during normal operation. In this case, the equipment operation process is assumed to be temporally homogeneous and the <b>reliability</b> <b>indicators</b> are calculated by conventional methods. At the burn-in stage, the FFP decreases with time while increasing at the aging stage. Therefore, the operating times between two successive failures at the burn-in and aging stages are not similarly distributed random values and the flow of events cannot be assumed to be recurrent. It shall be taken into account in the reliability performance calculation that the flow of failures is temporally inhomogeneous.

This study reports on a newmethod for the automatic detection and characterization of cell files in wood images obtained by light microscopy. To facilitate interpretation of the results, reliability coefficients have been determined, which characterize the files, their cells and their respective measurements. Methods Histological sections and blocks of the gymnosperms Pinus canariensis, P. nigra and Abies alba were used, together with histological sections of the angiosperm mahogany (Swietenia spp.). Samples were scanned microscopically and mosaic images were built up. After initial processing to reduce noise and enhance contrast, cells were identified using a 'watershed' algorithm and then cell files were built up by the successive aggregation of cells taken from progressively enlarged neighbouring regions. Cell characteristics such as thickness and size were calculated, and a method was developed to determine {{the reliability of the}} measurements relative to manual methods. Key Results Image analysis using this method can be performed in less than 20 s, which compares with a time of approx. 40 min to produce the same results manually.
