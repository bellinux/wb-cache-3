In the background, Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi (Jayasudha), is seen singing a devotional Telugu song while cooking. At the dining table, Aravind, Managing Director of their {{construction}} company, asks if Siddhu will join their office. When Siddhu deliberates, his father becomes impatient {{and plans for}} his marriage despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, Siddhu returns home to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is going to get}} engaged to Subbulakshmi (Neha) against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a daddy's girl (Tanikella Bharani being the father) and does not take a liking to her.

5|$|At Jason's behest, the demigods {{travel to}} Split {{to visit the}} tomb of Diocletian, {{retrieve}} his powerful scepter, and leave a note for Reyna (who has been asked by Annabeth to find the Greek demigods). The god Cupid, guardian of the scepter, refuses to relinquish it until Nico admits that he once {{had a crush on}} Percy Jackson. Sailing through the Adriatic Sea, the ship is attacked by Khione and the Boreads and is only narrowly defended by Piper's newly powerful charmspeaking skills; Piper is still disappointed in her performance and resolves to train in swordsmanship. During the attack, Leo is transported to Ogygia, where he falls in love with Calypso. Although he leaves the island, Leo promises to return for her. While Leo is detained, {{the rest of the crew}} meets with Notus, who helps Jason to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has chosen to be a Greek rather than a Roman demigod, thus settling an internal conflict within himself. Jason later gives up his praetorship to Frank in accordance with this decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
5|$|While Kiara and Kovu's {{friendship}} {{continues to}} grow, Simba, encouraged by Nala, attempts to show Kovu kindness by spending {{a day with}} him. Realizing that Kovu is beginning to side with Simba because of his love for Kiara, Zira ambushes and attacks Simba. Convinced by Zira that Kovu {{is responsible for the}} ambush, Simba exiles him and forbids Kiara to see him, but she makes her father <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is acting irrationally, before leaving to find Kovu. When a battle ensues between the Pride Landers and the Outsiders, Kiara and Kovu arrive and stop them, with Kiara telling them that they are one. When a furious Zira attacks Simba, she is intercepted by Kiara, causing the two to fall over the edge of a cliff. Having landed safely on a ledge, Kiara offers to help Zira, who is struggling to hang on. However, Zira, consumed by her resentment towards Simba, falls to her death. Simba finally approves of Kiara's love for Kovu and reconciles with his daughter, and accepts the two lions as future king and queen of the Pride Lands.|$|E
25|$|Có then phoned Cao, {{further south}} in the Mekong Delta's largest town Cần Thơ, where the IV Corps was headquartered. The rebel colonel assured Cao that the divisional and corps {{transfer}} had taken place smoothly. Có, a central Vietnamese, was afraid that Cao, a Mekong Delta native would recognise his fake southern accent, and <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was impersonating Phat, another southerner. However, Cao did not notice.|$|E
50|$|The {{next morning}} Nick {{goes to school}} to find {{that no one can}} see or hear him.

25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight, the patient's awareness of their mental illness. Insight requires theory of mind—a patient {{must be able to}} adopt a third-person perspective and see the self as others do. A patient with good insight would be able to accurately self-represent, by comparing oneself with others and by viewing oneself from the perspective of others. Insight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms; however, a patient who lacks insight would not <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a mental illness, because of his inability to accurately self-represent. Therapies that teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} late {{afternoon}} that Buell learned of McCook's plight, whereupon he sent two brigades from Gilbert's corps to reinforce him. This halted the Confederate advance on McCook north of Perryville. Meanwhile, small Confederate brigades encountered Gilbert's force of 20,000 men {{to the west and}} Crittenden's force, also 20,000 strong, to the south. Only then did Bragg <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was facing Buell's main force, and that he was vastly outnumbered. As night approached and halted the battle, Bragg conferred with his officers and decided to retreat to Harrodsburg to meet Smith. From Harrodsburg, the Confederates exited Kentucky through Cumberland Gap. For the remainder of the war, there would be no concerted efforts by the Confederacy to hold Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|Justus von Liebig, widely {{credited}} with inventing the modern process for silvering glass, also worked on gilding glass with gold chloride. James Pratt, a British glass worker, {{was the first}} to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could make affordable gold mirrors by depositing a layer of silver on top of the gold. He was granted a British patent in 1885. Gold mirrors and gold mirrored signs were very popular in English public houses (pubs) in the late Victorian era and many wonderful examples of the art can be found all over Britain today. Felix Andres, a sign painter in San Francisco, introduced a process for spray gilding glass in 1923, but the fashion for elaborate detail in signs was changing to the modern neon style and his business was not successful.|$|E
25|$|Anna {{returns to}} Albert's farm, where he angrily shouts {{at her for}} lying to him. Clinch pursues Anna to the farm; Albert helps her escape, then escapes himself. While fleeing, he is {{captured}} by a tribe of Apache Indians, who threaten to burn him alive. The Indians spare him when he reveals that he can speak their language. They give him a bowl of peyote, which sends him flashing back to his birth and through painful events of his childhood before making him <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves Anna. Meanwhile, Clinch recaptures Anna in town, in front of Edward's (Giovanni Ribisi) house. Albert returns to Old Stump and confronts Clinch. He wounds Clinch with a bullet poisoned with rattlesnake venom before his own gun is shot out of his hand, but he manages to stall until Clinch fatally succumbs to the poison. Louise attempts to win back Albert, but he rejects her and instead happily enters a relationship with Anna. Albert also receives a bounty for killing Clinch and uses {{the money to buy}} more sheep.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by Lucifer, {{ruler of}} the demons who loves Alexiel, Rosiel unseals the Tower of Etenamenki, where God rests, with Alexiel's body. Intent on {{restoring}} the Earth, Setsuna follows him, with Kurai and the archangels of fire and earth; along the way, he aids an injured Katan, who hopes to save Rosiel before he loses his free will to do so. At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes {{into a state of}} destructive despair. Awakening in her own body with Setsuna's help, Alexiel reveals to him that she had always loved him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to never show him any compassion. She then kills him, and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna.|$|E
