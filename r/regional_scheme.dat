25|$|Gwelup is {{bounded by}} Lake Gwelup, the Mitchell Freeway to the east, Old Balcatta Road {{to the north}} (Reid Highway, {{accessible}} via Duffy Road, is located {{just a few hundred}} metres further north) and Karrinyup Road to the south. Due to Gwelup's swampy nature and the Lake Gwelup Reserve, considerable tracts of land remain undeveloped. Peaty soils around the lake region that have been reclaimed, now feature the highest concentrations of dissolved arsenic in the world - some 25000ug/L (some 400 times higher than that identified as safe levels for drinking water). It is well known among scientific communities that disturbance of acid sulphate soils causes the release of As, iron sulfides and other chemicals. In the previous 32 years prior to 2000, the lake was recorded to dry out twice, since that year the lake barely remained wet once over the summer in 2005/2006. The lowered water tables can be blamed on reduced rainfall and over consumption of <b>regional</b> <b>scheme</b> waters.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> model studies and assumptions, we extend studies from two-level voting scheme models to multi-level voting scheme models. Due to mathematical complexity, {{we use the}} Monte Carlo approach in studying {{the stability of the}} multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> with respect to region sizes and levels. Using this model, we are able to obtain the stability characteristics of the national voting <b>scheme,</b> the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme,</b> and apply it in FERET human face database. According to our study, we verify again that the <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> (including the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme)</b> is always more stable than the national voting scheme. We find that the stability of the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> is not as good as the stability of the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> when region size is within a certain range. Out of this range, the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may compete with the two-level voting scheme. We conclude that the multi-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> may be comparable to the two-level <b>regional</b> voting <b>scheme</b> and prove our conclusion in the face recognition application.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{phenomenon}} of creating interstate <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>schemes</b> around the world (regionalism) has achieved high visibility and importance in world politics. The new wave of regionalism, new regionalism, which was initiated {{near the beginning of}} the 1990 s has much increased the importance of this phenomenon hence attracting significant research and academic interest. Moreover, most regions in the so-called developing world have attracted much global attention through their good economic performance and / or their increasing importance to world order and politics. Within most of these regions, neighboring states have initiated <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> (e. g. ASEAN, Mercosur, SADC, COMESA etc) which’s importance has risen along the general importance of regionalism as a worldwide phenomenon. This PhD focused on the comparative analysis of three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, namely the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Southeast Asia, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Mercado Comun del Sur (Mercosur) in South America. The main argument lays on the position that in order for a <b>regional</b> integration <b>scheme</b> to be created in the developing world, the presence of a regional hegemon is needed. The methodology used is that of the comparative analysis of the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus after a set of hypotheses / conditions has been created. This requires for an in-depth analysis of relevant theories on regionalism and interstate cooperation which in this case resulted in the adoption of an international relations’ theoretical approach as the main analytical tool to be used. The Hegemonic Stability Theory was selected and used for setting three conditions / hypotheses for testing and comparing the three <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> under focus. The main conclusion reached is that the theoretical model used, namely the Regional Hegemonic Stability Theory, can be used as the main interpretive tool of the creation of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> in the developing world, but it seems that recent developments in Mercosur, ASEAN and SADC require a wider use of theories to be soundly explained. The existence of a hegemonic state in the different parts of the developing world has {{played a crucial role in}} the creation and development of <b>regional</b> integration <b>schemes</b> but as the world becomes more and more interdependent their impact seems to decrease. ...|$|R

50|$|The Saskatchewan government, manoeuvred by Burak into {{initiating}} {{a more comprehensive}} scheme than the preventive medicine program it had planned, passed an Order-in-Council on December 11. The region’s hospitalization and health care scheme took effect on July 1, 1946—a full two years before Great Britain’s “cradle to the grave” health care plan was implemented. Within the Swift Current Health Region (Saskatchewan’s Health Region #1) the residents felt empowered, and the region assembled statistical data on the costs of health care that were unrivalled in Canada. The <b>regional</b> <b>scheme</b> flowered when Dr. Vince Matthews, the public health officer, provided seamless integration of preventive work and medical care, a first in Canada. There was {{a high level of}} rapport between the local administration, the constituent municipalities, patients, and physicians: Stewart Robertson, the administrator, Dr. Vince Matthews, and Dr. Cas Wolan, president of the district medical association, met informally most days for coffee.

40|$|Abstract The use of {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor-targeting antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer has been restricted to patients with wild-type KRAS tumors by the European Medicines Agency since 2008, based on data showing a lack of efficacy and potential harm in patients with mutant KRAS tumors. In an effort to ensure optimal, uniform, and reliable community-based KRAS testing throughout Europe, a KRAS external quality assessment (EQA) scheme was set up. The first large assessment round included 59 laboratories from eight different European countries. For each country, one <b>regional</b> <b>scheme</b> organizer prepared and distributed the samples for the participants of their own country. The samples included unstained sections of 10 invasive colorectal carcinomas with known KRAS mutation status. The samples were centrally validated by one of two reference laboratories. The laboratories were allowed {{to use their own}} preferred method for histological evaluation, DNA isolation, and mutation analysis. In this study, we analyze the setup of the KRAS scheme. We analyzed {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the <b>regional</b> <b>scheme</b> organization by analyzing the outcome of genotyping results, analysis of tumor percentage, and written reports. We conclude that only 70 % of laboratories correctly identified the KRAS mutational status in all samples. Both the false-positive and false-negative results observed negatively affect patient care. Reports of the KRAS test results often lacked essential information. We aim to further expand this program to more laboratories to provide a robust estimate of the quality of KRAS testing in Europe, and provide the basis for remedial measures and harmonization. status: publishe...|$|E
