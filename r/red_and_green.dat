40|$|Two {{white lights}} {{may have the}} same chromaticity, and yet when used to light an array of objects may differ {{in their ability to}} reveal colors. For example, any white light can be matched by a mixture of two {{narrow-band}} lights, a yellow plus a blue. In this extreme case, <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> <b>greens</b> become black or brown and the red-green dimension is lost. At the other extreme, a light with three narrow bands, at the proper wavelengths, can brighten <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> <b>greens</b> <b>and</b> increase redgreen contrast, relative to a broad-band light such as daylight. Many commercial lights tend to dull <b>reds</b> <b>and</b> <b>greens,</b> relative to broad-band sources, a central reason that color rendering is a practical concern. A telling example is neodymium glass, a yellow-absorbing filter that is sometimes used to improve color rendering. This article seeks to bring these ideas to life through detailed graphical examples...|$|R

5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green.</b> Totally red with a green circle in the center, to which were added the inscriptions referring to the republican center to whom it belonged - the Centro Democrático Federal 15 de Novembro.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Constitutional Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, a white field {{charged with}} the coats of arms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Two Sicilies, and Granada, was {{modified}} by Ferdinand II through {{the addition of a}} <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> border. This flag lasted from 3 April 1848 until 19 May 1849. The Provisional Government of Sicily, which lasted from 12 January 1848 to 15 May 1849, adopted the Italian tricolour, defaced with the trinacria, or triskelion.|$|E

5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> light).|$|E

5|$|FireRed and LeafGreen {{were first}} {{announced}} in September 2003 as upcoming remakes {{of the original}} Pocket Monsters <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> games that were released in Japan in 1996. Game director Junichi Masuda stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity, as the game engine was a slightly {{modified version of the}} one used in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. As a result, FireRed and LeafGreen were made fully backward compatible with Ruby and Sapphire, allowing players to trade Pokémon between games.|$|E
5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E

The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using a food processor, a blender, or by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|E

5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the design}} and {{significance}} of maritime flags flying on ships in Tunis are unknown. However, various sources {{have been able to}} distinguish certain similarities among the flags: they were designed with a crescent-oriented shape {{in the presence of the}} colors blue, green, red, and white. Thereafter, and until the early 19th century, the flag was composed of horizontal blue, <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> stripes, identifying the Ottoman regency in Tunis. This kind of flag with multiple bands and irregular contours floated on top of ships all along the coast of North Africa; similar flags with different colors and arrangements were also used on the continent.|$|E

5|$|Although he was {{not part}} of Nintendo at the time, Iwata {{assisted}} in the development of Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 by reading the original coding in Pokémon <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokemon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pokémon to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red/Green, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with the Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. The <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>green</b> colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.|$|E
