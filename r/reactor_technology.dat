Ijaz made extensive trips abroad during his career, including sabbaticals as a visiting professor at Saudi Arabia's King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. in the early 1980s and as a visiting faculty member at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy in 1985. He retired Professor Emeritus of Physics from Virginia Tech in December 1991 after a 27-year career in teaching and research. Ijaz and his wife emigrated to the United States and settled in Virginia, where had five children. He died in 1992 after a battle with cancer.|$|E

40|$|Less {{developed}} <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> {{are characterized}} by a high uncertainty level of the key performance indicators, as compared to more mature options, {{due to lack of}} information on the design, operation and cost data, etc., while the expected performance of such systems is normally more attractive in comparison with more mature options. Evidently, a greater uncertainty leads to higher economic risks involved in the deployment of the respective technology. Evaluating comparatively the competitiveness and performance of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> at different maturity levels requires taking into account economic risks to balance the judgments regarding the expected performance of the considered options. A reliable basis for this is formed by the economic risk theory. Evaluation of risk indicators requires calculation of characteristics for probabilistic distributions of economic performance indicators and systemic use of statistical approaches based on Monte Carlo methods. Demonstration analysis results for the risk indicator evaluation have been discussed as applied to different economic performance indicators based on the example of a comparative analysis for two hypothetical light water <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> to be considered in the selection of the most attractive option. Use of economic risk indicators for the comparative evaluation of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> appears to be helpful to decision makers not familiar with the technical characteristics and performance measures of <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies</b> but informed about the economic risk concepts. Such methodology may be employed efficiently to interpret the ranking results in a multi-criteria comparative evaluation of less and more mature <b>reactor</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R
