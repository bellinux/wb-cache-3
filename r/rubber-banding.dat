50|$|One {{example of}} this {{balancing}} loop {{is a situation where}} a number of units manufactured is increasing (current state), which causes the manufacturing utilization to increase (end eventually exceed capacity). This will make each additional unit of manufacturing more expensive, reducing the growth in units manufacture. One can note that a <b>rubber-banding</b> effect occurs, since the more units are manufactured, the more expensive the manufacturing is. This loop taken in isolation would eventually find a stable state, independently of its beginning state.|$|E
50|$|Scott Butterworth of GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10. Butterworth praised Need for Speed for the {{visually}} stunning city, deep rewarding progression, genuinely customizable handling, and nail-biting sense of speed, {{but at the}} same time criticized the <b>rubber-banding</b> AI, draconian drift scoring system, and always-online, rendering the game unable to be paused. Sam Loveridge of TrustedReviews gave Need for Speed 4½ out of five stars giving praise to the stunning night racing and weather effects, but panned the inability to play offline, the inability to pause gameplay, and the live action cutscenes and constant calls become insufferable.|$|E
40|$|We are {{studying}} five interacting genes {{involved in the}} regulation or coordination of muscle contraction in Caenorhabditis elegans. A distinctive ``rubber-ban'' muscle-defective phenotype was previously shown to result from rare altered-function mutations in either of two of these genes, unc- 93 and sup- 10. Null mutations in sup- 9, sup- 10, sup- 18 or unc- 93 act as essentially recessive suppressors of these <b>rubber-band</b> mutations. In this work, we identify three new classes of sup- 9 alleles: altered-function <b>rubber-band,</b> partial loss-of-function and dominant-suppressor. The existence of <b>rubber-band</b> mutations in sup- 9, sup- 10 and unc- 93 and the suppression of these mutations by null mutations {{in any of these}} three genes suggest that these proteins are required at the same step in muscle contraction. Moreover, allele-specific interactions shown by the partial loss-of-function mutations indicate that the products of these interacting genes may physically contact each other in a multiple subunit protein complex. Finally, the phenotypes of double <b>rubber-band</b> mutant combinations suggest that the <b>rubber-band</b> mutations affect a neurogenic rather than a myogenic input in excitation-contraction coupling in muscle...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of trans- forming a single-layer topological routing of n two-terminal nets into a <b>rubber-band</b> equivalent using rectilinear wires {{in the presence of}} rectilinear circuit modules. Given a topological planar VLSI layout sketch with IF 1 features and JWl noncrossing wire segments connecting n two-terminal nets, we present an O((F 1. IWl) time algorithm to do the vertex-disjoint <b>rubber-band</b> equiv- alent transformation of these n nets if it exists. The algorithm consists of two phases, computing a loose homotopy with four spokes matrices, and computing a vertex-disjoint <b>rubber-band</b> equivalent of the given homotopy, each phase taking O(I F I. I W I) time and space. Both complexities are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. From the vertex-disjoint <b>rubber-band</b> equivalent of the given homotopy, one can obtain the detailed routing within the same time complexity. Experimental results are also presented...|$|R

50|$|Need for Speed {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's near photo-realistic visuals and customization but criticized it for being always-online, having only dusk to dawn racing, <b>rubber-banding</b> AI, lacking a cockpit view, performance issues {{due to the}} always-online requirement on all platforms, the inability to pause the game, having no manual transmission, and lacking drag races (the latter two being added in an update). Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 67.12% based on 39 reviews and 66/100 based on 69 reviews, the Xbox One version 66.12% based on 26 reviews and 65/100 based on 29 reviews, and the PC version 61.00% and 68/100 based on 23 reviews.|$|E
40|$|Grizzly Bear {{is a new}} demonstrational {{tool for}} specifying user {{interface}} behavior. It can handle multiple application windows, dynamic object instantiation and deletion, changes to any object attribute, and operations on sets of objects. It enables designers to experiment with <b>rubber-banding,</b> deletion by dragging to a trashcan and many other interactive techniques. To the author's best knowledge it is currently the most complete demonstrational user interface design tool that does not base its inferencing on rule-based guessing. There are inherent limitations to the range of user interfaces that can ever be built by demonstration alone. Grizzly Bear is therefore designed to work hand-in-hand with a user interface specification language called the Elements, Events & Transitions model. As designers demonstrate behavior, they can watch Grizzly Bear incrementally build the corresponding textual specification, letting them learn the language on the fly. They can then apply their knowledge [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present Subversion Statistics Sifter, a {{visualisation}} {{and statistics}} system {{for exploring the}} structure and evolution of data contained in Subversion repositories with respect to both developer activity and source code changes. We support a variety of visualisation techniques, including statistical graphics and graph plots. We exploit the inherent hierarchical structure of software archives to support users of the tool in navigation and orientation tasks and {{to allow them to}} obtain insight from the data on different levels of granularity such as directories, files, or even down to single lines of code. The tool is targeted towards large, tiled displays driven by graphics clusters; therefore, distant corresponding views are highlighted by a <b>rubber-banding</b> technique. The system is built on a. NET and WPF basis that exploits data binding and theming of common controls. Following this principle, the system can easily be extended by additional visualisation techniques. We illustrate the usefulness of Subversion Statistics Sifter by case studies of student lab and open source software projects. ...|$|E
50|$|A snapper is a hoax {{mechanical}} puzzle {{consisting of}} a pointed piece attached to a notched dowel and a hollow block with a secondary hole along its length through which a <b>rubber-band</b> is stretched (across the shaft) and tied off. A demonstrator inserts the dowel into the hollow block, hooks the <b>rubber-band</b> on the notch, pulls on the pointed end, and allows the dowel to snap back into place. The demonstrator hands the puzzle to an observer who cannot hook the <b>rubber-band</b> onto the dowel's notch. The demonstrator takes the puzzle back and makes it snap immediately. The trick is that {{the ends of the}} dowel are tapered so that the demonstrator can squeeze the fingers holding it together, causing it to snap into the block.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{interaction}} technique for manipulating precise data or selecting one element {{from a large}} number of items. Although conventional graphical interaction tools like sliders cannot be used for selecting more items than the pixel size of the slider, we can specify more precise data by using the elastic slider based on the <b>rubber-band</b> metaphor, where a control object can be moved by pulling the object with a <b>rubber-band</b> between the object and the mouse cursor. The same technique can be applied to many graphical interface tools like scroll bars and drawing editors...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} typically {{consist of}} small, very simple network nodes without any positioning device like GPS. After an initialization phase, the nodes know {{with whom they}} can talk directly, but have no idea about their relative geographic locations. We examine how much geometry information is nevertheless hidden in the communication graph of the network: Assuming that the connectivity {{is determined by the}} well-known unit-disk graph model, we show that using a very simple distributed algorithm we can identify a large, provably planar subgraph of the communication graph that faithfully reflects the topology of the network. This planar subgraph can then be embedded using a simple distributed <b>rubber-banding</b> procedure, finally obtaining virtual coordinates for the nodes of the subgraph which can be instrumented for various protocols based on geographic location information. That is, there is enough geometry information hidden in the connectivity structure not only to identify topological features like network holes (as it was also exhibited in the predecessor paper [7]) but even enough information to compute a sketch of the network layout. Our simulation results indicate that the algorithm works very well even for very sparse network deployments and produces network sketches that come close to the original layout. ...|$|E

He conceived the idea of a toy loom for <b>rubber-band</b> crafting after seeing his young daughters make <b>rubber-band</b> bracelets.

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} sixteen {{consecutive}} patients seen {{for the first}} time with symptomatic haemorrhoids entered trials of conservative and minor surgical treatment. They were divided into two groups according to their pretreatment maximal anal pressure. Patients with pressures of 100 cm H 2 O (73. 7 mm Hg) or more (108 patients) were treated by anal dilatation (37), sphincterotomy (34), or high-fibre diet (37). Four and 12 months later anal dilatation had produced significantly better results than sphincterotomy or diet. Furthermore, anal dilatation was the only treatment associated with a significant reduction in anal pressure at four and 12 months. Patients with pressures under 100 cm H 2 O (108 patients) were treated by <b>rubber-band</b> ligation (35), cryosurgery (36), or diet (37). Four and 12 months later significantly more patients were improved by <b>rubber-band</b> ligation than by cryosurgery or diet. These results suggest that haemorrhoids in patients with excessive activity of the internal anal sphincter are best treated by anal dilatation and that in all other patients <b>rubber-band</b> ligation is the treatment of choice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} simple cube-curves in the orthogonal 3 D grid. The {{union of}} all cells contained {{in such a}} curve (also called the tube of this curve) is a polyhedrally bounded set.

So far only one general algorithm called <b>rubber-band</b> algorithm was known for the approximative calculation of such an MLP. A proof that this algorithm always converges to the correct curve, is still an open problem. This paper proves that the <b>rubber-band</b> algorithm is correct for the family of first-class simple cube-curves. ...|$|R
