2500|$|The Germans treated Bader {{with great}} respect. When he bailed out, Bader's right {{prosthetic}} leg became {{trapped in the}} aircraft, and he escaped only when the leg's <b>retaining</b> <b>straps</b> snapped after he pulled the ripcord on his parachute. General Adolf Galland notified the British of his damaged leg and offered them safe passage to drop off a replacement. Hermann Göring himself gave the green light for the operation. The British responded on 19 August 1941 with the [...] "Leg Operation"— an RAF bomber was allowed to drop a new prosthetic leg by parachute to St Omer, a Luftwaffe base in occupied France, as part of Circus 81 involving six Bristol Blenheims and a sizeable fighter escort. The Germans were less impressed when, task done, the bombers proceeded on to their bombing mission to Gosnay Power Station near Bethune, although bad weather prevented the target being attacked. Galland stated {{in an interview that}} the aircraft dropped the leg after bombing Galland's airfield. Galland did not meet Bader again until summer 1945, when he, Günther Rall and Hans-Ulrich Rudel arrived at RAF Tangmere as prisoners of war. Bader, according to Rall, personally arranged for Rudel, a fellow amputee, to be fitted with an artificial leg.|$|E
5000|$|Improvements to the armour {{included}} {{the addition of}} a more robust right hand shoulder assembly, and <b>retaining</b> <b>straps</b> over the side panels to reduce instances of the velcro opening when under stress. This had been mitigated in the Mk 2 armour by the use of a bungee cord around the armour, hooked to the PALS webbing ...|$|E
50|$|Tautliner or curtainsider {{is used as}} {{a generic}} name for curtain sided trucks/trailers. It is the trade name of {{commercial}} vehicles built by Boalloy of Congleton, Cheshire, England. The curtains are on runners, top and bottom, and can be pulled back and forklifts used all along the sides for easy and efficient loading and unloading. When closed for travel, vertical load <b>retaining</b> <b>straps</b> are tightened between the runners, hence the 'Tautliner' name, which stop the curtain from drumming in the wind and also retain the load from slipping sideways.|$|E

25|$|From 1972 to 1981 a {{modified}} M1911A1 called the RIA M15 General Officer's Model was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both {{came with a}} black leather belt, open holster with <b>retaining</b> <b>strap,</b> and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of this project it was known that functional electrical stimulation (FES) rowing was technically feasible, but no studies on health benefits had been conducted and it was unclear what levels of fitness could be reliably attained by spinal cord injured (SCI) users. This thesis shows that training with the first-generation of the FES-rowing system (RowStim II), seven paraplegics achieved high V 02 peak values (21. 0 27. 9 ml-kg- 1 -min- 1) and a significant (10 %) increase in V 02 peak. This was also found to significantly improve insulin sensitivity and leptin levels but it had no significant effect on lipid profiles or body composition, possibly caused by technological limitations of the RowStim 11. However, training volumes were positively correlated with improvements in lipid profile and body composition. This motivated further technical development of the RowStim to enable paraplegics to train harder and longer.

This thesis shows that training with the first-generation of the FES-rowing system (RowStim II), seven paraplegics achieved high V 02 peak values (21. 0 - 27. 9 ml-kg- 1 -min- 1) and a significant (10 %) increase in V 02 peak. This was also found to significantly improve insulin sensitivity and leptin levels but it had no significant effect on lipid profiles or body composition, possibly caused by technological limitations of the RowStim 11.

This motivated further technical development of the RowStim to enable paraplegics to train harder and longer. The development included a more stable seat configuration with redesigned trunk <b>retaining</b> <b>straps,</b> a rigid low friction carriage/brake system, improved leg stabiliser, improved stimulation control and a gravity-assisted return phase. This RowStim III has enabled paraplegics to participate in the British (2004, 2005 and 2006) and World Indoor Rowing Championships (2006). The rowers have achieved higher exercise intensities (26. 8 - 31. 0 ml. kg- I. min- 1) and increased exercise volumes (1, 150 kcal-week- 1) with the RowStim III. Such levels of physical activity, which are difficult to achieve for paraplegics using traditional exercises, are correlated with significant health benefits in the able-bodied. Preliminary results suggest that perfusion of the quadriceps muscle during FES-rowing might limit the exercise time in novice rowers. Other preliminary data from pressure mapping indicate that there is a dynamic pattern during FES-rowing, which might reduce the risk for pressure sores during FES-rowing. This thesis shows that FES-rowing is now a rapidly developing exercise modality, which has been shown to enable safe and well-tolerated exercise for individuals with SCI. It can offer unprecedented levels of cardiovascular fitness, competitive challenges and potentially important health benefits. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
25|$|Bader's fuselage, {{tail and}} fin were gone from behind him, {{and he lost}} height rapidly at what he {{estimated}} to be 400mph (640km/hr) in a slow spin. He jettisoned the cockpit canopy, released his harness pin, and the air rushing past the open cockpit started to suck him out, but his prosthetic leg was trapped. Part {{way out of the}} cockpit and still attached to his aircraft, Bader fell for some time before he released his parachute, at which point the leg's <b>retaining</b> <b>strap</b> snapped under the strain and he was pulled free. A Bf 109 flew by some 50 yards away as he neared the ground at around 4,000feet (1,200metres).|$|R
5000|$|And so forth. During the 1980s, {{stampings}} {{began to}} include the model number, a trend that continued under Camilluss ownership. The Coleman era (1984-1990) saw the use of some COLEMAN WESTERN stamps as well as ColemanWestern markings on the <b>retaining</b> <b>strap</b> buttons of knife sheaths.IDENTIFYING WESTERN STATES POCKETKNIVES Western States early knives follow the traditional numbering system of a pattern number, along with letters and other numbers that described the knife's features. Unfortunately, the numbering system was an internal protocol for employees and pattern numbers were not marked on the companys products until 1954. With Camillus now out-of-business, much of that inside company information has beenlost. Collectors today must identify early knives from catalogs and application of the numbering system. Most of the old stock numbers can be deciphered by using the numbering key explained below. Some older pocketknife numbers have a zero inserted justbefore the pattern number to signify a modification, usually in material or finish, such as (9393 or 93093) ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Jordan Son of Mars" [...] is an Air Jordan hybrid shoe, that {{released}} in the Summer of 2012. It borrows prominent design elements from the Air Jordan III, IV, V, VI, and XX.It also <b>retains</b> a <b>strap</b> across the shoe laces, that is a custom modification with a design {{that seems to be}} elephant print but is instead a series of relevant icons, etc.The Jordan Son Of Mars was birthed from the Spizike, which was originally inspired by all the Jordan shoes made in collaboration with famous urban director Spike Lee. Son of Mars is a sneaker directly influenced by Spike Lee's longtime involvement with the brand, as the shoe pieces together models in which Spike (or Mars Blackmon rather) had a hand in launching.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower link}} {{itself is not}} {{designed}} to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment. Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush. Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety <b>straps</b> <b>retain</b> the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was also}} a wooden structure, square in section and built around four ash longerons but unusually orientated with one diagonal vertical. It was plywood skinned throughout, apart from an inevitable break in the upper longeron and in the upper surface skin for the under-wing open cockpit. The wing was mounted by two parallel pairs of thin struts from the mid-fuselage longerons to the two wing spars. The upper longeron loads were carried across the break via the wing structure by two pairs of struts, one well forward and one well aft of the cockpit to the mounting points on the wing spars, together with a near vertical pair just behind the cockpit. A landing skid extending from the nose to below the wing trailing edge was <b>retained</b> by leather <b>straps</b> {{very close to the}} lower longeron, with landing forces absorbed by rubber blocks.|$|R
5000|$|The current U.S. Air Force Service Dress Uniform, {{which was}} {{initially}} adopted in 1994 and made mandatory on 1 October 1999, {{consists of a}} three-button coat, {{similar to that of}} a men's [...] "sport jacket" [...] (with silver mirror-finish [...] "U.S." [...] pins on the lapels), matching trousers, and either a service cap or flight cap, all in Shade 1620, also known as [...] "Air Force Blue." [...] This is worn with a light blue shirt (Shade 1550) and a herringbone patterned necktie (Shade 1620). Metal buttons on the dress uniform were also changed at this time, transitioning satin finish buttons that employed the contemporary U.S. Air Force seal to a historically significant retro insignia that had been used by the U.S. Army Air Forces as a shoulder patch during World War II. This change was also applied to buttons on service hats <b>retaining</b> the chin <b>strap</b> and to buttons on mess dress uniforms, to include mess dress shoulder board insignia for officers.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the 300 mK system for Herschel-SPIRE is complex, with many difficult, {{sometimes}} conflicting, requirements and constraints placed upon it. Five detector arrays, mounted from a 2 K box, are linked to a single 3 He sorption-cooler tip by a high-conductance copper strap network. This <b>strap</b> <b>retains</b> high thermal conductance, even though it incorporates an electrical break {{to comply with the}} SPIRE grounding scheme. It requires stiffness to withstand launch vibrations, but needs compliance to avoid transmission of loads to the detector arrays. The strap is stiffly supported by novel, compact cryogenic stand-offs which provide a high degree of thermal isolation from the 2 K stage. An additional complication is that the detectors reside in a 2 K environment, whilst the cooler tip is in a 4 K environment. Two of the cryogenic stand-offs also act as light-tight feed-throughs to pass the strap from the 4 K environment {{to the inside of the}} 2 K detector boxes. Active thermal control is provided on the 300 mK system to address the detector stability requirements. This paper describes the system, and gives results of the performance in SPIRE flight model ground tests...|$|R
5000|$|On the May 1 {{episode of}} Impact!, LAX asked Hector Guerrero {{to be their}} advisor, which he accepted. On the May 11 {{pay-per-view}} Sacrifice, LAX won the vacant TNA Tag Title after defeating Team 3D in the [...] "Deuces Wild" [...] tournament final with help from Guerrero. Afterward, Team 3D attacked Hector and left him beaten, creating another feud between LAX and Team 3D. After defeating 3D to <b>retain</b> the tag <b>straps,</b> they would {{find themselves in a}} feud with Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm, Robert Roode and their manager, Jacqueline). Beer Money whipped all four members of LAX with belts, resulting in a Fans' Revenge match being booked for the tag titles at Victory Road. After defeating Beer Money, Inc. at Victory Road, LAX fought them once again for the TNA World Tag Team Championships at Hard Justice this time in a regular two-on-two match. Beer Money, Inc. claimed victory in the match when Roode crashed a beer bottle over Homicide's head, allowing Storm to gain the pinfall, thus ending LAX's four-month reign as champions. At No Surrender, LAX was once again defeated by Beer Money, Inc. when they met for a championship rematch. Before the match, Jacqueline was revealed to have attacked Salinas backstage, and as a result she had to be rushed to the hospital. This was done to write her out of the LAX and their feud with Beer Money on-screen, and explain her departure from TNA shortly before the pay-per-view. On the September 25 episode of Impact! Homicide, Hernandez and Guerrero fought Roode, Storm and Jacqueline in a six-person [...] "Loser's manager leaves town" [...] match. Beer Money, Inc. won the match when Roode pinned Hernandez {{and as a result of}} the match Guerrero could no longer manage Homicide and Hernandez in TNA. At Bound for Glory IV LAX competed in a four team Monster's Ball match, but were defeated when Robert Roode pinned Hernandez after Team 3D had put him through a table covered with thumbtacks.|$|R
