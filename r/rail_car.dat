5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths {{and the need to}} keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Changing the bogies on a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> takes {{hours and}} special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first <b>rail</b> <b>car,</b> and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner {{was born}} in Edinburgh, Scotland to John and Janet Gardiner. The fourth of five children, there was also Gardiner's two older brothers, John and Alexander, an older sister, Edith, and a younger sister, Christina. In 1911, when Gardiner was seven, he {{and the rest of}} his family emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba. The family {{initially}} lived in a house on William Avenue before relocating to Alexander Street; both streets were south of the railways, and were full of Scottish-Irish working-class families. John took a job as a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> repairer, and Gardiner took an early interest in the trains, often waiting up late at night to watch them arrive into the city. He was enrolled at the Albert School, and befriended Wilf Cude, who had immigrated from Wales who would also go on to be a National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender.|$|E
25|$|During {{the more}} than 130 years of <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> ferry {{operations}} on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers {{all of the major}} railroads, including Michigan Central, Pere Marquette, Wabash and Canadian Pacific, all had ferry operations on the Detroit River. The GTW/CN <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> ferry service was the last to operate in the Great Lakes when it ended operations on the St Clair River in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Piggyback is the {{transporting}} of trailers or entire trucks on <b>rail</b> <b>cars,</b> {{which is}} a more fuel efficient means of shipping and saves loading, unloading and sorting labor.

50|$|From 2010 to 2015, the Michigan Department of Transportation {{refurbished}} and leased 1950's-1960's retired Metra <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> {{in anticipation}} of WALLY, which still had not received any approval or capital or operational funding. Over the five-year period, the passenger <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> sat unused in a railyard owned by Great Lakes Central Railroad in Owosso, northeast of Lansing. The state paid over $12 million lease the passenger <b>rail</b> <b>cars,</b> spending $7.3 million in refurbishments, $3 million in lease charges, and another $1.1 million for consulting. Public outcry led to the termination of the lease which had continued to cost the state $1.1 million annually. The terms of the new agreement allowed Grand Lakes Central to lease the <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> to other entities, but the cars would be made available upon request to MDOT {{for the next five}} years. In addition, 50-70% of the lease or sale revenue from the <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> would be returned to the state.|$|R

25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> mover to pull them away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local particleboard industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's storm sewer system.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} ten years of production, Ensign {{manufactured}} iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden freight cars in the early 1880s, selling {{a large portion of}} its inventory to the Chesapeake and Ohio, Southern Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington. In 1962, the Huntington ACF plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow covered hopper car, was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.|$|E
