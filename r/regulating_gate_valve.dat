5000|$|A <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. <b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to <b>regulate</b> flow. Typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were performed}} using the {{computational fluid dynamics}} model Flow- 3 D, a peer reviewed and validated three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic model. Results were studied to determine the impacts of water surface elevation and discharge though the three regulating outlets on flow velocities in the reservoir forebay. These simulations were in general support of a larger research program conducted by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game that is evaluating the efficacy of strobe lights to deter fish from entering the regulating outlets and powerhouse turbine intakes. Simulation results indicate that large variations in forebay water velocities occur over the typical range of regulating outlet operations and seasonal water surface fluctuations. As expected, water velocities generally increase with larger outlet gate openings and higher water surface elevations. Simulations span typical regulating outlet operations: forebay water surface elevations between 1460 ft and 1600 ft and <b>regulating</b> outlet <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> openings between 1 ft and 10 ft open. In addition, simulations examined flow conditions when {{only one or two}} of the three regulating outlets were operating. The resulting matrix of 24 unique simulations have been distilled and summarized in this report...|$|R

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most <b>gate</b> <b>valves,</b> between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> and a double-disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> under pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5. For the parallel disc <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> pressure locking loads were higher by a factor of 2. 05 to 2. 4. The results also show that seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|R

Depending on the accuracy, cost consideration, and available space, the flowmeter selected could be an insertion type or fixed type such as orifices or venturi meters. Insertion flow sensors or flowmeters are mostly preferred for use in existing buildings because of their ease of installation, removal and reinstallation. Two types of commercially available insertion type flowmeters, series 225 B and SDI- 000125, both from Data Industrial[TR], were tested at different angles of orientation (0 ?, 45 ?, and 90 ?) and at different locations downstream of a 4 -inch <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> in straight sections of PVC pipe with flow rates between 80 gpm (2 ft/s) and 320 gpm (8 ft/s). The measured flow rates were compared to the flow rates obtained with a standard orifice meter. The effects of the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> on the accuracy of each flowmeter were investigated. A baseline test was conducted with no <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> upstream of meter 1 (series 225 B). Results from this test showed that the presence of the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> distorts flow meter readings. Measured flow rates were decreased with meter orientations of 0 ?, 45 ?, and 90 ? when the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> was present, indicating that the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> partially blocks the flow in the upper region of the pipe.

40|$|<b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> for subsea {{oil and gas}} {{operation}} work under harsh conditions. Proper design ensures the valves functional integrity over the designed lifetime of the valve. The design of the valve includes material choice for protection against wear and corrosion, and functionality (i. e. friction). More specifically, sealing interfaces on the valves are usually coated with thermally sprayed tungsten carbide (WC) based materials to provide wear resistance. In order to assess {{the design of the}} valve, rigorous testing of the valves is required according to requirements from authorities and the customers (oil companies). Testing is done at the rated temperatures and pressures of the valve, in gas (nitrogen) and water. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear of coatings used in subsea <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> a proper investigation of mechanisms acting on actual <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> components is necessary. During this PhD work, several components from <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> that have seen actual testing and subsea operation have been analyzed and wear mechanisms identified. Friction and wear of several candidate coatings were evaluated in small scale tribological testing and the acting mechanisms compared to the ones from full scale testing. Five different coatings of WC-CoCr, produced by high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF), high velocity air-fuel (HVAF) and warm spray (WS) were evaluated. Tribological testing was conducted in controlled atmosphere (nitrogen gas) to best mimic the conditions in actual <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> testing. The results indicate that testing in nitrogen reduces both friction and wear within the frame of testing. Surface analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and SEM revealed surfaces covered in tribofilms with large amount of oxide species of WC and Cr. These films were detrimental to the frictional performance, however they may act as a beneficial lubricant for reducing the incidence of galling during the initial sliding cycles (i. e. running-in). The results from this PhD work show that controlling the atmosphere during small scale tribological testing more closely correlates to testing of <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> in large scale.
