50|$|In 2009, a joint {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} Bureau of Prisons, the FBI and the IRS uncovered a scheme in which three inmates at FCI Herlong: Scott Whitney, Diego Paucar and Erik Alexander, filled out false tax returns for other inmates seeking <b>refunds.</b> In <b>order</b> to portray the inmates as taxpayers, they made false W-2 forms using the names of real employers, {{but none of the}} inmates had worked for them. The IRS discovered the scheme and no refunds were paid. If the scheme had been successful, the three co-conspirators would have obtained $93,950 from the IRS. Whitney, Paucar and Alexander subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the IRS and had seven, four, and three years added to their original sentences, respectively.|$|R

In late 1973, vacancy refund for domestic properties was abolished. Refund for non-domestic vacant properties was eventually removed on 1 July 1995. Thereafter, refund of rates is not allowed for vacant properties unless they are vacated {{as a result of}} a Government initiated court <b>order.</b> <b>Refunds</b> are also allowed for vacant open land, providing it is not used for the parking of motor vehicles.|$|R

I also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had notice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as a victory over the Government extorted by fear, {{and that he had}} already collected about $4000 of the money.

40|$|A buyer {{can learn}} her value for a {{returnable}} experience good by trying it out, with {{the option of}} returning the good for whatever refund the seller o¤ers. Sellers tend to o¤er a “no questions asked ” refund for such returns, a money back guarantee. The refund is often too generous, generating ine ¢ ciently high levels of returns. We present two versions of {{a model of a}} returnable goods market. In the Information Acquisition Model, consumers are ex ante identical and uninformed of their private values for the good. The …rm then o¤ers a generous <b>refund</b> in <b>order</b> to induce the consumers to learn their values by purchasing and trying the good out, rather than by doing costly research prior to purchasing. In the Screening Model, some consumers have negligible costs of becoming informed about their values prior to purchasing, and always do so; other consumers have prohibitive costs of acquiring pre-purchase information and always stay uninformed. The …rm’s optimal screening menu may then contain only a single contract, one that speci…es a generous refund, and hence a high purchase price, in order to weaken the incentive constraint of the informed consumers...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the general}} election, Stumbo {{garnered}} 46,895 to Sturgill's 41,973. As {{a result of}} her win, Stumbo became the second woman to serve on the court, and the first to be elected to the court without first having been appointed. She took the oath of office on December 1, 1989. The partial term to which she was elected expired at the end of 1991. She was unopposed for election to a full, eight-year term. The Lexington Herald-Leader wrote that Stumbo generally sided with consumers and workers against businesses and with defendants in criminal law cases, but noted that there were exceptions. In what the paper called [...] "her most criticized ruling", she found that, under a literal reading of Kentucky law, a litigant who had been injured in an automobile accident could not collect damages unless there was a court ruling that found the other driver in the accident to be negligent. The Kentucky Supreme Court reversed this decision, saying Stumbo should have considered the legislature's intent. Stumbo also halted <b>refund</b> payments <b>ordered</b> by a lower court in a finding against Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E) in a rate dispute, saying the court had no power to set utility rates. She returned the case to the Public Service Commission, but also scolded two of the commissioners for secretly meeting with LG&E about the settlement terms.|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Taxpayers {{who do not want}} to wait for their tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may choose to obtain refund anticipation loans (RAL). RALs are short-term, high-interest bank loans that are advertised and brokered by both national chain and local tax preparation companies. Although the annual percentage rate (APR) on RALs can be over 500 percent, they allow taxpayers to receive cash refunds quickly [...] sometimes within the same day and even within an hour of filing their tax returns. After filing a taxpayer's return electronically, the tax preparer works in cooperation with a bank to advance the refund as a loan minus tax preparation costs, other fees, and a finance charge. As part of the RAL process, the taxpayer provides authorization to IRS to send the refund directly to the bank to repay the loan. Despite the benefits of receiving cash quickly based on an expected refund, IRS officials and others have raised concerns about whether taxpayers are fully aware of the costs involved and their tax filing alternatives. For example, in a 2007 report to Congress, the IRS National Taxpayer Advocate questioned whether RAL consumers actually understand the nature of the loan product they are receiving. According to the Advocate, while tax preparers offering RALs are required to obtain taxpayers' signatures on written disclosure forms, there are no requirements that such disclosures be made orally. The Advocate wrote that despite the written disclosures provided to them, consumers may not fully understand that the RAL is in fact a loan and not simply a way to receive a faster refund from IRS. Further, without an oral explanation, consumers may lack a general {{understanding of the nature of}} the product and its impact on credit reports, as well as other consequences of default. In January 2008, in order to address this issue, IRS and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) indicated in a Federal Register notice that they were considering rules to prohibit tax preparers from marketing RALs based on information gathered during the tax preparation process. In their notice, IRS and Treasury cite concerns about tax preparers improperly inflating <b>refunds</b> in <b>order</b> to market RALs, particularly when working with customers eligible for the earned income tax credit (EITC). IRS studies have found that this credit is particularly susceptible to fraud, in many cases perpetuated by paid tax preparers. In 1999, an IRS compliance study found $ 10. 4 billion of overclaims on the EITC, of which $ 7. 2 billion (70 percent) was attributed to tax returns completed by paid preparers. Based on continuing concerns over how RALs are marketed to taxpayers, Congress requested that GAO perform a limited investigation to identify examples of where RALs are marketed and the types of information tax preparers disclose to potential RAL applicants. ...|$|R
