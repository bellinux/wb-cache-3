40|$|A {{special class}} of {{orthogonal}} <b>rational</b> <b>functions</b> (ORFs) {{is presented in}} this paper. Starting with a sequence of ORFs and the corresponding <b>rational</b> <b>functions</b> of the second kind, we define a new sequence as a linear combination of the previous ones, the coefficients of this linear combination being self-reciprocal <b>rational</b> <b>functions.</b> We show that, under very general conditions on the self-reciprocal coefficients, this new sequence satisfies orthogonality conditions {{as well as a}} recurrence relation. Further, we identify the Caratheodory function of the corresponding orthogonality measure in terms of such self-reciprocal coefficients. The new class under study includes the associated <b>rational</b> <b>functions</b> as a particular case. As a consequence of the previous general analysis, we obtain explicit representations for the associated <b>rational</b> <b>functions</b> of arbitrary order, {{as well as for the}} related Caratheodory function.

500|$|The {{approximation}} {{problem in}} network synthesis {{is to find}} functions which will produce realisable networks approximating to a prescribed function of frequency within limits arbitrarily set. The approximation problem {{is an important issue}} since the ideal function of frequency required will commonly be unachievable with rational networks. For instance, the ideal prescribed function is often taken to be the unachievable lossless transmission in the passband, infinite attenuation in the stopband and a vertical transition between the two. [...] However, the ideal function can be approximated with a <b>rational</b> <b>function,</b> becoming ever closer to the ideal the higher the order of the polynomial. [...] The first to address this problem was Stephen Butterworth (1930) using his Butterworth polynomials.
