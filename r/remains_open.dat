5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement that this is true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture <b>remains</b> <b>open,</b> with only some special cases solved.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only used}} for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981, Concorde G-BBDG was {{dismantled}} and transported by road from Filton then restored from essentially a shell at the Brooklands Museum in Surrey, where it <b>remains</b> <b>open</b> to {{visitors to the}} museum.|$|E
5|$|Hagley's cricket {{team was}} formed in the 1890s and was playing by 1896.

5|$|Nevertheless, it is conjectured that Zarankiewicz's and Urbanik's {{formula is}} optimal. This {{has come to}} be known as the Zarankiewicz {{crossing}} number conjecture. Although some special cases of it are known to be true, the general case <b>remains</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Division Street Bridge {{was last}} rehabilitated in 1985, but it <b>remains</b> <b>open</b> under no {{restrictions}} after its inspection in May 2012.

5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} {{management}} of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it {{as it might have}} appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old signal station tower. The site <b>remains</b> <b>open</b> to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument. The air station's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.|$|E

5|$|St Botolph's Aldersgate <b>remains</b> <b>open</b> as a {{functioning}} church. Unusually for an English church, {{because of its}} location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|The 11 {{miles of}} Devon section <b>remains</b> <b>open,</b> despite various threats to its future, {{and is now}} a {{designated}} country park and local nature reserve, and allows navigation.

It maintains a historical interest and has been subject to some archaeological excavations.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations <b>remains</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E

Dota 2 was officially released in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Both {{stations}} {{closed in}} the 1960s {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe.

Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet. However, the nearest station on the East Somerset Railway is Mendip Vale, which is {{a mile and a half}} away.|$|E
