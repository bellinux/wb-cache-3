40|$|<b>Rheotropism</b> in fish {{has been}} shown to be a {{response}} to visual or tactile stimuli resulting from displacement in a water current past an external reference point (Lyon, 1904, 1909; Dykgraaf, 1933). Flatfish resting on the sea-bed could detect the current directly by the flow over the whole body or over the lateral line, which is known to b...|$|E
40|$|At 16 - 17 {{months of}} age, {{three groups of}} fish from the embryonated eggs in the ASTP killifish {{experiment}} were subjected to postflight tests consisting of rapidly changing environments. It {{was found that the}} group of fish with the least amount of development at orbital insertion (A- 32) had a decreased <b>rheotropism</b> for both the moving background and the rotating water current tests when compared to ground control fish. Exposure to parabolic aircraft flight conditions revealed that the A- 32 fish were less disoriented during zero gravity periods and were hypersensitive to high-gravity periods. These results suggested a modified vestibular competency due to a 9 -d prehatching weightlessness exposure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rheotropism</b> (the {{ability to}} detect and respond to a current) and rheotaxis (deliberate {{orientation}} relative to a current) are widespread in fishes and aquatic organisms, but {{the relative importance of}} different sensory modalities as references for the rheotaxis response in fishes is largely unknown. While mechanical stimuli (including water flows) have been used to evaluate rheotaxis behavior in fishes, comparison between sensory modalities is rare, and there has been little or no investigation into the mechanosensory role of barbels in rheotaxis for bottom-oriented fish. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the role of visual stimuli (in the form of an optomotor belt) and barbels in juvenile green sturgeon rheotaxis behavior. The green sturgeon did not exhibit a clear optomotor response, and spent a higher proportion of time positively oriented toward a flowing current than they did toward a moving background in the absence of flow. Removal of barbels increased the average individual tendency to orient positively in the presence of flow. While visual cues almost certainly play a role in rheotaxis behavior at large, individuals vary greatly in their degree of responsiveness to stimuli, and the optomotor stimuli used in our experiments were not as effective as the mechanosensory stimuli in provoking positive rheotaxis. Further, the barbels of green sturgeon do not appear to influence their ability to display positive rheotaxis in the presence of water current...|$|E
