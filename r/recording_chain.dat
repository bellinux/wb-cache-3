Voigt (1940) {{showed that the}} early Wente-style {{condenser}} microphones contributed to a 4 to 6dB midrange brilliance or pre-emphasis in the <b>recording</b> <b>chain.</b> This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company in the 1925 era had a higher amplitude in the midrange region. Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis above 1,000Hz in 78rpm and rpm records.|$|E

5000|$|Flim and the BB's {{recorded}} {{its second}} album, Tricycle, for DMP Digital Music Products, an audiophile record label started by Tom Jung. The album {{was the first}} non-classical recording {{to be released in}} compact disc format. It was recorded on the Mitsubishi X-80 digital audio recorder at Sound 80. The disc displayed the full dynamic range available in CDs, becoming a popular test disc for this reason. It was also the first jazz album to be recorded, mastered, and delivered in the digital domain. The <b>recording</b> <b>chain,</b> after the first few feet of microphone cable from the musicians' instruments, remained in the digital domain until it was decoded by the consumer's CD player. DMP's releases were for the most part recorded directly to two-tracks as opposed to the more common multi-track method. This means that there was minimal use of overdubs and the majority of the music was performed, recorded, and mixed [...] "live" [...] to the digital recorder. The cover art for Tricycle was drawn by Bill Berg's son Jacob.|$|E

Based on this plan, national and supranational authorities have developed legislation {{to fight the}} so called IUU fishing.

This article outlines a general framework for evaluation {{of these types of}} requirements, using a predictor-outcome N-way matrix. A "good practise" system is described, against which the existing systems and practises can be evaluated.

40|$|The “European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy” (EDIT) is an {{initiative}} of 28 European, North American and Russian institutions {{to build a}} network in “Taxonomy for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research”, with the objective to reduce the fragmentation in taxonomy through institutional integration in Europe (www. etaxonomy. eu). European Commission funding (FP 6) for this “Network of Excellence” has started in March 2006, and runs for 5 years. For EDIT Work Package 7 (WP 7) “Applying Taxonomy to Conservation” {{the aim is to}} strengthen the input of taxonomic expertise in Europe for biodiversity conservation, by organizing the participation of individual taxonomists and experts in biodiversity inventory and monitoring efforts in conservation areas (www. atbi. eu). For biodiversity inventories and monitoring, the advantage of using digital field recording tools is to simplify data recording as well as to improve data quality. The use of electronic field tools and software should be promoted to help minimizing error rates, in particular to avoid mistakes {{from the beginning of the}} <b>recording</b> <b>chain.</b> Many errors may be avoided by using authority lists, e. g. for countries, habitat-types or taxa that can already be determined in the field. Automated georeferencing and recording of date and time in standardized formats already in the field will also avoid errors when importing or retyping such data into a database. Relevant software should be usable for tools such as mobile phones with GPS (Global Positioning System) functionality up to water resistant PDAs - Personal Digital Assistant (e. g. Magellan - Mobile Mapper; Trimble – Juno, Nomad). Examples presented here for more efficient electronic data recording in the field include the application of mobile recording devices with customized forms, which are tested for field work in ATBI+M (All Taxa Biodiversity Inventories + Monitoring; www. atbi. eu) sites operated in the EDIT project. This is a general approach for recording georeferenced, individual species data using customized forms for ESRI ArcPad applications. Species names can be selected from a taxonomic authority list provided in a file in dBASE-format. Such files can be easily created, modified, and exchanged to allow individual researchers to use regional or otherwise customized species lists. Fields and field formats correspond to ABCD standards so that exports of recorded locality, event, and species data can be directly integrated into a central database and applications for individual ATBI+M websites (e. g. www. atbi. eu/mercantour-marittime/ or www. atbi. eu/gemer/). The authority species lists may be customized for a geographic area (e. g., a nature reserve) and/or a group of taxa (e. g., larger birds). This allows each expert to choose the species list needed for his/her research. Problems remain with observation records which cannot be reliably determined in the field. Therefore identification help should be made available on the PDA at least for difficult taxa...|$|E
