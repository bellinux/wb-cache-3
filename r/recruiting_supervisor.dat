40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examines the knowledge, views, {{and experiences of}} Navy recruiters and <b>recruiting</b> <b>supervisors</b> regarding the Navy Recruiting Simulation Tool (NRST). Also known as SIMmersion, NRST is an interactive, role-playing program designed to boost a recruiter's confidence and skills by providing supplementary sales training beyond the classroom. The primary source of information is an online survey distributed in January 2010 to 5, 139 Navy recruiters and <b>recruiting</b> <b>supervisors.</b> A total of 1, 058 persons (21 percent) responded to the survey. The results of the survey show that 58 percent of Navy recruiters never use NRST; further, four out five feel that NRST has no positive impact on their confidence, sales skills, productivity, or time management. Additionally, fewer than one in four Navy recruiters rated NRST favorably on its usability. The responses of <b>recruiting</b> <b>supervisors</b> were {{very similar to those}} of Navy recruiters. These results suggest that NRST has not been adequately presented to Navy recruiters and <b>recruiting</b> <b>supervisors,</b> who are generally unfamiliar with its potential benefits. Negative views on usability are influenced largely by the program's lack of compatibility with existing platforms. Recommendations are offered to increase the awareness, understanding, and use of NRST. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the efficiency of the poultry farm in Bangladesh and to assess the influence of contract farming system, using a Data Envelopment Analysis. Seventy five commercial poultry farms (25 and 50 independent and contract farms, respectively) were randomly selected. The results reveal that efficiency scores vary across sample farms. To explain some of these variations, the efficiency scores were regressed on some human capital variables and farming system using a Tobit model. The study also estimate elasticities to provide the information on the magnitude of the variables influence on technical, allocative and economic efficiency. The results show that contracting system is positively and significantly related to farm's technical, allocative and economic efficiency. This is expected because under contractual agreement, in order to obtain sufficient supplies of the right quality of poultry meat at the right time, the company provides technical know-how assistance through company's <b>recruited</b> <b>supervisor,</b> production inputs & services, and production credit along with intensive supervision, which in turn improves farm efficiency. Thus, by receiving technical know-how contract farmers have gained more knowledge on their resource and practices, which enables them to use resources more efficiently. Empirical results can provide crucial information to policy makers that improve poultry farm efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Background Foot ulcers are {{a common}} reason for diabetes-related hospitalisation. Foot ulcer {{simulation}} training (FUST) programs have increased podiatry participants self-confidence to manage foot ulcers. However, supervisors’ perspectives on their participants attending these simulation programs have not been investigated. This mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) study aimed to investigate home clinical supervisors’ perspectives on any changes to their participants’ competence and practice following FUST. Methods Clinical supervisors of fifteen podiatrists, who participated in a two-day Foot Ulcer Simulation Training (FUST) course, were <b>recruited.</b> <b>Supervisors</b> completed quantitative surveys evaluating their participants’ foot ulcer competence pre-FUST and 6 -months post-FUST, via a purposed designed 21 -item survey using a five-point Likert scale (1 =Very limited, 5 =Highly competent). Supervisors also attended a semi-structured qualitative group interview to investigate supervisors’ perspectives on FUST. Results Supervisors surveys returned were pre-FUST (n= 10) and post-FUST (n= 12). Significant competence improvements were observed at the 6 -month survey (mean scores 2. 84 cf. 3. 72, p < 0. 05). Five supervisors attended the group interview. Five sub-themes emerged: i) FUST provided a good foundation for future learning, ii) FUST modelled good clinical behaviour, iii) clinical practice improvement was evident in most participants, iv) clinical improvements were dependent on participant’s willingness to change and existing workplace culture, v) FUST needs to be reinforced back in the home clinic. Conclusion Overall, supervisors of FUST participants indicated that the course improved their participants’ competence and clinical practice. However, the degree of improvement appears dependant on the participants’ home workplace culture and willingness to embrace change...|$|R
40|$|Leadership plays a {{vital role}} in {{building}} the process, structures, and climate for an organisation to become innovative and to motivate team expectations toward innovations. This study explores the leadership styles that engineers regard as significant for innovation in the public sector. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the principal leadership styles influencing innovation in the Australian Public Service (APS), using survey data extracted from the 2014 APS employee census comprising 3 125 engineering professionals in Commonwealth of Australia departments. EFA returned a two-factor structure explaining 77. 6 % of the variance of the leadership for innovation construct. In this study, the results from the EFA provided a clear estimation of the factor structure of the measures for leadership for innovation. From the results, the two factors extracted were transformational leadership and consideration leadership. In transformational leadership, a leader values organisational objectives, inspires subordinates to perform, and motivates followers beyond expected levels of work standards. Consideration leadership refers to {{the degree to which a}} leader shows concern and expressions of support for subordinates, takes care of their welfare, treats members as equals, and displays warmth and approachability. These findings highlight the role of leadership as the most critical predictor when considering the degree to which subordinates strive for creativity and innovation. Both transformational and consideration leadership styles are recommended to be incorporated into management training and development programs. This study also recommends that Commonwealth departments <b>recruit</b> <b>supervisors</b> who have both of these leadership styles before implementing innovative projects...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to depict the}} shared meanings or collective schemas about the training of new <b>recruits</b> in organizations. <b>Supervisors</b> understood little about the new recruits’ maps of the world, whereas new recruits had {{a greater understanding of}} their supervisors’ points of view. The researchers investigated strategies that would close this gap in understanding and increase training effectiveness. Results from a 2 -month pretest-posttest design demonstrated changes in the construings (ways of thinking about the world) in the groups regarding the 12 training activities. After the intervention, both groups perceived the training activities as being more conducive to understanding the others’ points of view, with the supervisors making a moderate shift and the new recruits a smaller shift...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} supports the importance of supervisors’ safety leadership in promoting employees’ engagement in safety. However, the factors that give rise to these safety leadership behaviors are under-explored. The current study addressed this void by adopting a Job Demands-Resources framework to identify contextual influences on supervisors’ safety leadership behaviors. Focus group data from sixty-nine <b>supervisors</b> <b>recruited</b> from the UK construction industry showed that role overload, production demands, formal procedures, and workforce characteristics hindered supervisors’ engagement in safety leadership. In contrast, social support (especially from the organization and co-workers) and perceived autonomy promoted supervisors’ engagement in safety leadership. Exploration around these issues highlighted a need for more training for supervisors in this role {{and the development of a}} supportive environment between supervisors affiliated with different parent companies...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{describe}} the current recruitment for supervisors according to the ownership types, and sizes in the manufacturing sector. The population for this research consisted of all companies (with a minimum of 75 employees) in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia. The population frame was the listing of 3214 companies in the 1998 directory provided by MIDA (Malaysian Industrial Development Agency) Samples were chosen by using the stratified random sampling according to the industries. Data were collected by means of mail questionnaire. 1907 questionnaires were mailed to the selected companies. Minus the undelivered mails, 130 questionnaires were received representing 8. 27 percent response rate. Job posting on bulletin board or printed bulletins leads {{the most frequently used}} recruitment methods for supervisors, followed by newspaper advertising, skill inventories, and employee referrals. This finding emphasizes the importance of current employees as a source to fill up vacancies at the supervisory level since other than newspaper advertising all sources are from the internal recruitment. No significant difference in terms of sizes and types of ownership was found among these most frequently used methods. However, this study also finds that manufacturing companies in Malaysia do use other sources to <b>recruit</b> <b>supervisors</b> even though collectively the usage percentages are low. These sources include internship or practical training,publicly funded employment agencies, private employment agencies, former employees, walk-ins or unsolicited applications, customers, campus visit, suppliers and also trade unions. Another important finding {{of this study is that}} only 25. 6 percent of the organizations do maintain a record on time-lapse data i. e. the average time that elapses between points of decision making for each recruitment source used and only 24. 2 percent of the organizations do maintain a record on yield ratio i. e. the ratio of applicants to hires at each step in the recruitment process. The two findings above tell a lot about the efficiency of the practices of the firm's human resource managers. It is quite safe to say that their ratings were only based on their perceptions and were not based on any empirical evidence because only 25. 6 percent and 24. 2 percent of them conducted the time-lapse and yield and yield ratio study. These finding expose weakness in the practice of staffing among the companies in Malaysia because without these data, it is very hard for any practitioners to do the human resource planning and staffing effectively and efficiently. However, in terms of the training aspect for the recruiters, majority of the organizations do provide some training on the process of recruitment before they were given a recruitment assignment, do not give a recruitment assignment to their recruiters before they fully understand the knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience required for the vacant jobs and do not give a recruitment assignment to their recruiters before they fully comprehend the values and goals of the organization. These findings reveal quite a good sign of concerned of the human resource managers towards the quality of hiring even though they did not maintain any record on the time-lapse data and yield ratio...|$|R
40|$|Nepal has {{a history}} of nearly three decades of public health education. Public health {{graduates}} are working under different capacities at governmental and non governmental organizations. If the health system can utilize this human resource, this will contribute to health system strengthening in Nepal. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the opportunities for public health graduates in government health system in Nepal. MoHP needs to expand opportuni-ties for public health graduates in different areas within government system. <b>Recruiting</b> district level <b>supervisors</b> from bachelor in public health background would enhance performance because of their knowledge and skills on areas like district health management, research, public health administration, health economics and medical sociology as compared to those with certificate level education on General medicine currently being recruited. In the meantime this will create hundreds of job placements in district health system for job aspirants. Role of community health inspectors needs to be made clear and sanctioned at the district and peripheral level. Also, there is necessity of environmental health technicians, health educators, health economists and other types of health personnel. It is equally necessary to establish environmental health, occupational health, urban health, health care waste management, mental health and oral health units at district level. The other areas where public health graduates can work as health officers are District Development committee, Municipality, Women and Child office and Water and Sanitation Division Office. Th...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} Thai science students’ {{experiences}} in writing their master’s dissertations in English in a Thai university. Situated in an interpretive, qualitative case study design, the study implements {{a theoretical framework}} drawing on the notions of communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) and imagined communities and investment (Norton, 2000, 2001). The research participants were five master’s students and their paired dissertation <b>supervisors</b> <b>recruited</b> from three master’s programmes in science disciplines where the medium of instruction was Thai. The students, however, wrote their dissertations in English. Data were derived from questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, collaborative conversations, writing samples, and documents produced by the university. The findings revealed that the students’ preference for writing their dissertations in English encompassed their negotiation and shaping of their social identities and investment in their communities of practice. The students reported that they put {{a great deal of}} effort into preparing themselves to cope with the perceived linguistic demands of dissertation writing. However, they perceived that their preparation, to a certain extent, was unsuccessful, attributing this to the university’s lack of appropriate language support and their unfamiliarity with autonomous language learning. The students’ negotiation with the demands of writing their dissertations during the writing-up stage reflected their multidimensional engagement in different literate activities of their communities of practice. This included making use of authoritative written artefacts, accommodating their supervisors’ expectations, and developing a linguistic repertoire through interacting with other members of their communities, particularly those from their local, immediate, interactive communities of practice. This study articulates the various needs in understanding dissertation writing practices and other interconnected academic literacy practices as socially and ideologically constructed in a local, immediate milieu. The study also provides EAP practitioners with pedagogical implications for planning, preparing and delivering dissertation writing support for science postgraduate students. It also suggests that dissertation supervisors should initiate an open dialogue with their students during the supervision process and engage in collegial discussions with their colleagues in order to co-construct effective supervision practices.

5000|$|The {{link between}} race and poverty was first {{acknowledged}} by Sanford in 1961 {{when he realized}} that many African-American factory workers were paid less than minimal wage, about half of the students {{dropped out of high school}} without having obtained a high school diploma, and most of the adults were illiterate.9 [...] Seeing how alarming the situation was in the state of North Carolina, the governor realized that he was facing a pressing issue that was not only affecting the African-American community of Durham, but that was also blocking the economic growth and spread of the industries found in that region. Most of the recipients of the program were African Americans, but it was not exclusively directed towards them, which served as an incentive for the general population to accept it. Even though the level of white poverty was a lot lower, Operation Breakthrough was still helpful to them. It was also a way to emphasize that poverty affected the general population, and not only one ethnic group, which overall served as a great marketing strategy. Even though Operation Breakthrough engaged itself in some civil rights work, it was not considered to be a civil right organization. The Black community started to discover that they could have a voice in their community, and decided to fight for their rights and better living conditions. People started to request that their basic needs were met, just like Ann Atwater did, with the support of Howard Fuller, when she finally decided to go talk to her landlord to demand reparations in her house. She then was <b>recruited</b> as a <b>supervisor</b> for neighborhood workers for the Operation Breakthrough program as well as declared head of the Housing Committee for United Organizations.11 [...] She was strongly involved in the Civil Rights Movement. Seeing the success Operation Breakthrough had in North Carolina, the program was then extended to different states, being modified in order to respond to the needs the different communities were facing.|$|R
