40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a 3 D reconstruction {{approach to the}} detection of static obstacles from a single <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> parking <b>camera.</b> Corner features are tracked to estimate the vehicle’s motion and to perform multiview triangulation in order to reconstruct the scene. We model the camera motion as planar motion and use {{the knowledge of the}} camera pose to efficiently solve motion parameters. Based on the observed motion, we selected snapshots from which the scene is reconstructed. These snapshots guarantee a sufficient baseline between the images and result in more robust scene modeling. Multiveiw triangulation of a feature is performed only if the feature obeys the epipolar constraint. Triangulated features are semantically labelled according to its 3 D location. Obstacle features are spatially clustered to reduce false detections. The distance to the nearest obstacle cluster is reported to the driver. ii Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in SAE Technical Paper 2016 - 01 - 1604 and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper focuses on methods used to model vehicle surface contamination arising {{as a result of}} rear wake aerodynamics. Besides being unsightly, contamination, such as self-soiling from rear tyre spray, can degrade the performance of lighting, <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> <b>cameras</b> and obstruct visibility through windows. In order to accurately predict likely contamination patterns, it is necessary to consider the aerodynamics and multiphase spray processes together. This paper presents an experimental and numerical (CFD) investigation of the phenomenon. The experimental study investigates contamination with controlled conditions in a wind tunnel using a generic bluff body (the Windsor model.) Contamination is represented by a water spray located beneath the rear of the vehicle. The aim is to investigate the fundamentals of contamination in a case where both flow field and contamination patterns can be measured, and also to provide validation of modelling techniques in a case where flow and spray conditions are known. CFD results were obtained using both steady RANS and unsteady URANS solvers, combined with particle tracking methods. Steady RANS does not capture the wake structures accurately and this affects the contamination prediction. URANS is able to recover the large-scale wake unsteadiness seen in the experimental data, but the difference between the experimental and computational contamination distributions is still notable. The CFD is also able to provide further insight by showing the behaviour of particles of different sizes. Large particles are found to take on a ballistic trajectory and penetrate the wake. In contrast, small particles are shown to be less likely to become entrained into the wake...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{classification}} {{has become}} a very important subject of study because of its importance in autonomous navigation, surveillance and traffic analysis. Classification of vehicles from the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> is challenging because all the vehicles have subtle appearance differences from the <b>rear</b> <b>view,</b> changing illumination conditions, presence of shadows and real-time considerations. While numerous approaches have been introduced for this purpose, no specific study has been conducted to provide a robust and complete video-based vehicle classification system based on the <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> where the <b>camera’s</b> field of <b>view</b> is directly behind the vehicle. In this paper we present a multi-class vehicle classification system which classifies a vehicle into one of four possible classes Sedan, Minivan, SUV and Pickup truck when seen from its <b>rear</b> <b>view.</b> For a given geometric setup of the camera we use a feature set of Visual Rear Ground Clearance, height of the vehicle and perpendicular distance between {{the bottom of the}} license plate and bottom of the rear bumper for classifying the vehicle. Results are shown on large data-sets of freeway videos...|$|R
50|$|Development of a solar car {{to enter}} the World Solar Challenge became a Western Engineering reality as {{a small group of}} {{inspired}} students took on the challenge as part of a fourth year capstone project. The SunStang Project with the encouragement of Professor John Tarasuk, under the student leadership of Matthew Butson undertook a major task: design and build a solar powered car to compete in the World Solar Challenge 1993, with the event date less than two years away. The team of about one dozen was mainly 3rd and 4th year mechanical engineering students and one or two senior electrical students. The team from early stages had good representation of female students (roughly 30%). Sub-groups were tasked with designing the chassis, drive system, steering, braking and safety systems. The vehicle even had a fibre optic <b>rear</b> <b>view</b> vision <b>camera</b> and an adiabatic air conditioning unit designed to work in the hot & dry Australian outback. Another monumental task of the inaugural team was coordinating the fund-raising effort to pay the expenses of building and shipping the car to the race. The team arranged goods-in-kind for the magnesium tubes of the vehicle frame from local industry. The motor and solar panels were also sponsor donated. The tiny cells were laminated and wired together individually to create an energy array. Team marketing and raising awareness on campus helped collect funds from the student population. One of the main sponsors of the 1993 vehicle was UWO supporter, turned Australian businessman Jack Cowin, the logo can be seen on both side of the SunStang cockpit. Team members enjoyed free Hungry Jack's food during the race in Australia in November of 1993.|$|R
