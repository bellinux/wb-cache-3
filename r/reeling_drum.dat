Piping competitions are held in multiple sections. Open (Professional) and Amateur I-IV. Drumming events include: March, Strathspey & <b>Reel,</b> Tenor, Bass, <b>Drum</b> Pad, Etc. Like piping, drumming competitions are held in multiple sections. Open (Professional) and Amateur I-IV. There are also specific divisions for Tenor Drum.|$|R
5000|$|All {{electrical}} cables {{are somewhat}} flexible, {{allowing them to}} be shipped to installation sites wound on <b>reels</b> or <b>drums.</b> Where applications require a cable to be moved repeatedly, such as for portable equipment, more flexible cables called [...] "cords" [...] or [...] "flex" [...] are used. Flexible cords contain fine stranded conductors, not solid core conductors, and have insulation and sheaths to withstand the forces of repeated flexing and abrasion. Heavy duty flexible power cords such as those feeding a mine face cutting machine are carefully engineered — their life is measured in weeks. Very flexible power cables are used in automated machinery, robotics, and machine tools. See power cord and extension cable for further description of flexible power cables. Other types of flexible cable include twisted pair, extensible, coaxial, shielded, and communication cable.|$|R
25|$|There are {{generally}} three jumbie dancers in a unit, who perform {{accompanied by the}} babala (tambourine, or jumbie drum), triangle, fife or pulley (accordion, concertina or melodeon), and most importantly the French <b>reel</b> (also jumbie <b>drum</b> or woowoo), a skin drum that produces an ominous sound which is said to attract the jumbie spirits. Both the babala and French reel {{are similar to the}} Irish bodhran in construction; all three drums are played with the fingertips, palms and the backs of the hands.|$|R
5000|$|On April 3, 2012, {{the band}} {{released}} its fifth full-length album, Day Job. It includes new songs, four re-recorded tracks from Going on Tour, a collaborative track with rapper Lyrics Born, {{as well as}} two Disney covers, [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid and [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" [...] from The Lion King, which have been long-time staples of the band's live performances. In November 2012, long-time drummer Derek Rock left the band to pursue other career options. <b>Reel</b> Big Fish <b>drummer</b> Ryland Steen and former Big D and the Kids Table drummer Max MacVeety filled in on drums between Rock's departure and the hiring of current drummer Edward Larsen in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|In the reel-lay system, the {{pipeline}} is assembled onshore and is spooled onto a large drum typically about 20 m x 6 m in size, mounted {{on board a}} purpose-built vessel. The vessel then goes out to location to lay {{the pipeline}}. Onshore facilities to assemble the pipeline have inherent advantages: they are not affected by the weather or the sea state and are less expensive than seaborne operations. Pipeline supply can be coordinated: while one line is being laid at sea, another one can be spooled onshore. A single reel can have enough capacity for a full length flow line. The reel-lay system, however, can only handle lower diameter pipelines - up to about 400 mm (16 in). [...] Also, the kind of steel making up the pipes {{must be able to}} undergo the required amount of plastic deformation as it is bent to proper curvature (by a spiral J-tube) when <b>reeled</b> around the <b>drum,</b> and straightened back (by a straightener) during the layout operations at the installation site.|$|R
40|$|Long booms or masts are {{frequently}} required on spacecraft {{for a variety}} of purposes, such as supports for solar arrays, as antennas, or to locate experiments remote from the spacecraft environment. Prior to, and during launch, the masts must be stored in a compact form on board the spacecraft. There may also be a need to retract and redeploy masts when in orbit, for example to minimize the angular momentum during changes in the attitude of the spacecraft. A variety of designs of extendable or foldable masts have been developed. Some are based on a series of telescopic tubes, others make use of the de Haviland tube principle consisting of a thin-walled tube of elastic material, split longitudinally, which is opened out flat and coiled for launch. When uncoiled, it reverts to a circular cross-section and in some designs, provision is made for the edges of the split to interlock mechanically to increase the rigidity. The Collapsible Tube Mast (CTM) is a closed tube of lenticular cross-section that can be flattened and then <b>reeled</b> on a <b>drum</b> for storage in a relatively small volume. Collapsible masts made from thin metal sheet were explored in the United States space programme in the 1960 's 1, 2, 3 and steel CTM's were used in the Viking Lander 1 and 2 spacecraft to collect soil samples on Mars in 19764.

500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and <b>reels,</b> handlines, setlines, <b>drum</b> nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{wind energy}} systems {{consist of a}} lifting body and a tether. Several {{airborne}} wind energy systems have been created by others, but the most promising consists of a wing which translates through the air in a crosswind motion. Two computational models of a translating wing system were used to study the dynamics and performance of these systems. The rst model that was examined consists of a rigid connecting arm between a rotating base station and a wing. A study of this model showed that one can increase the power production of the system by changing the wing angle relative to the connecting arm during motion. Using a variable relative wing angle, an average power of 7 : 7 W is generated which is an increase of 30 % over the xed wing angle system. A second model was examined which used a exible tether that could change in length. For this system, power is generated as the tether is <b>reeled</b> o a <b>drum</b> at the base station when tether tension is high. The tether tension can be maximized by the optimal usage of the control parameters such as the reel-in and the bridle orientation of the kite-system. A study of this model showed {{that the system is}} capable of asymptotically stable periodic motions with a simple controller for tether length. In addition, this simple controller is able to achieve positive power production of 1 : 05 kW in a 10 m=s windspeed. The simple model demonstrates the concept that, for these types of systems, {{it may be possible to}} generate higher average cycle powersby strategically using energy to quickly accelerate the system at the ends of the stroke...|$|R
