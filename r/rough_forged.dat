(Combination guns, usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "Drilling", is a highly complex hand-made long gun with several joined barrels combining both rifle and shotgun calibers and gauges sharing a common breech and buttstock.) The highest level examples of custom-made firearms usually start out as several pieces of blank steel stock or <b>rough</b> <b>forged</b> parts, a slab (stock blank) of walnut; steel tubes with rifled or smooth holes ("bores") drilled their length, and are usually hand made by highly skilled gunsmiths using nothing more than an occasional lathe, milling machine, heat treating furnace (for making springs, hardening parts to the proper hardness, and color case hardening) with the majority of roughing, fitting, and finishing done completely by hand using files, scrapers, abrasive paper and cloth, chisels and rasps.|$|E
5000|$|The {{civil parish}} has a total area of 1130 acre. The terrain is gently undulating, with high points of 110 metres at [...] south of Admiral's Gorse and 102 metres at Prince Hill (...) [...] The area is {{predominantly}} rural, {{with the major}} land use being agricultural. There are several small areas of woodland within the parish, including Acorn Coppice, Lea's Wood, Harrow's Wood, Threeper's Drumble and part of Shaw's <b>Rough.</b> <b>Forge</b> Brook and several other unnamed brooks run through the parish, {{and there are many}} scattered small meres and ponds. A small area of Doddington Park, including part of Doddington Pool, falls within the civil parish north of Hunterson Road. Landscaped in the 18th century by Capability Brown, the park is listed at grade II by the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.|$|R
6000|$|... 34. We have {{hitherto}} got {{no farther}} in our {{notion of a}} Salian Frank than a glimpse of his two principal weapons,--the shadow of him, however, begins to shape itself to us on the mist of the Brocken, bearing the lance light, passing into the javelin,--but the axe, his woodman's weapon, heavy;--for economical reasons, in scarcity of iron, preferablest of all weapons, giving the fullest swing and weight of blow with least quantity of actual metal, and <b>roughest</b> <b>forging.</b> Gibbon gives them also a 'weighty' sword, suspended from a 'broad' belt: but Gibbon's epithets are always gratis, and the belted sword, whatever its measure, was probably for the leaders only; the belt, itself of gold, the distinction of the Roman Counts, and doubtless adopted from them by the allied Frank leaders, afterwards taking the Pauline mythic meaning of the girdle of Truth--and so finally; the chief mark of Belted Knighthood.|$|R
5000|$|These {{stresses}} {{are called}} residual stresses, because they reside within the metal workpiece. Residual stresses {{are caused by}} rapid, unequal cooling {{as opposed to the}} stresses caused by external loading. This unequal cooling occurs during welding, casting, <b>forging,</b> <b>rough</b> machining or hot rolling. These stresses often lead to distortion or [...] of the structure during machining, assembly, testing, transport, field-use or over time. In extreme cases, residual stress can cause structural failure.|$|R
50|$|Forging: Unlike awase bocho, honyaki {{in general}} {{have no need}} to raise to forge welding heat. This skips the {{possible}} carbon migration to the mild steel and decarburization from the heating to around 1000 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the smith skips the need to weld the layers careful under careful heating and to evenly forge the core steel. In this regard to forging white 2 steel, honyaki is easier than in awase bocho. More alloy and higher carbon make this more difficult. There are multiple re-heatings and forging from high temperatures downward. Blades are cooled and annealed in carbonized rice straw or ash, cut to <b>rough</b> shape, cold <b>forged,</b> and corrected for distortion multiple times. They are preferably left to stabilize for a bit between each step to help reduce distortion. The knife is rough ground to shape with the omote, urasuki, and profile. These steps generally require more effort than with laminated knives.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of government is to protect {{public health and the environment}} from exposure to environmental risk. Through the enactment of environmental laws governments have established regulatory programs that seek to provide comprehensive protection against environmental harm. Yet regulatory policy inevitably must confront considerable uncertainty in assessing risks and determining how to control them most effectively. As society struggles to <b>forge</b> <b>rough</b> consensus over appropriate approaches to regulation in the face of this uncertainty, decisions to regulate or not to regulate individual products, chemicals, or pollutants often generate enormous controversy. The precautionary principle wisely counsels that lack of full scientific certainty should not preclude the adoption of prudent precautionary measures to prevent harm. Although the precautionary principle has been widely embraced, it often is misunderstood and it even has become a focus of controversy (Percival 2006) Regulatory policy generally seeks to prevent harm before it occurs, but the reality is that it usually has been more reactive than precautionary, responding only after harm has become manifest (Percival 1998; Percival et al. 2009). As regulators seek to improve their responses to new and emerging environmenta...|$|R
40|$|Conventional Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers {{high-resolution}} imaging of {{a target}} region in the range and cross-range dimensions along the ground plane. Little or no data {{is available in the}} range-altitude dimension, however, and target functions and models are limited to two-dimensional images. This thesis first investigates some existing methods for the computation of target reflectivity data in the deficient elevation domain, and a new method is then proposed for three-dimensional (3 -D) SAR target feature extraction. Simulations are implemented to test the decoupled least-squares technique for high-resolution spectral estimation of target reflectivity, and the accuracy of the technique is assessed. The technique is shown to be sufficiently accurate at resolving targets in the third axis, but is limited in practicality due to restrictive requirements on the input data. An attempt is then made to overcome some of the practical limitations inherent in the current 3 -D SAR methods by proposing a new technique based on the direct extraction of 3 -D target features from arbitrary SAR image inputs. The radar shadow present in SAR images of MSTAR vehicle targets is extracted and used in conjunction with the radar beam depression angle to compute physical target heights along the range axis. Multiple inputs of elevation data are then merged to <b>forge</b> <b>rough</b> 3 -D target models. The project is a continuation of prior SAR research at Cal Poly under Dr. John Saghri with the sponsorship of Raytheon Space 2 ̆ 6 Airborne Systems...|$|R
40|$|The early {{detection}} of defects in forged parts offers economical advantages due {{to the possibility of}} sorting them out of the process chain betimes. Hence, no further production costs are occurred by those parts. However, the detection of defects during forging processes is not state of the art. Usually defects of forged parts – which are often not obvious and therefore cannot be identified by the press operator – are detected by measurements after cooling or later by the customer. In both cases costs occur. Due to the <b>rough</b> conditions in <b>forging</b> shop floors (e. g. high temperatures and forces) the integration of sensors monitoring the forging process is hardly viable. Within the presented research project an in-situ forging process monitoring system is developed which works without sensors in the forging tool and shows results on the process quality directly after forging. A system consisting of two independent concepts (defect-identification and filling-identification) is developed to detect typical forging process failures. On the one hand the defect-identification is able to detect e. g. wrong press energy or insert-position. On the other hand the filling-identification aims to detect, if the cavity is completely filled by the work-piece. Both concepts work in real-time {{with the help of a}} computer and a screen visualising the results. One the one hand this paper presents the results of forging trials using the defect-identification and evaluates its capability. On the other hand the concept for the filling identification is presented...|$|R
