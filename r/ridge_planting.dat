Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively. The results indicated that soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance in conservational tillage system were higher than the conventional tillage system. <b>Ridge</b> <b>planting</b> system yielded higher values {{than that of the}} flat planting system.

40|$|Field {{cultivation}} practices affected {{soil temperature}} that influenced the crop development of winter crops. This study was undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of different mulch materials, tillage depths and planting methods on spike differentiation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The field experiment was consisted of three tests: (i) polythene mulch, straw mulch and no mulch; (ii) <b>ridge</b> <b>planting</b> and furrow planting; (iii) conventional tillage and shallow tillage. The results showed that soil temperature was affected by different practices. The higher soil temperature under polythene mulch resulted in the earlier initiation of spike differentiation, while straw mulch decreased soil temperature in spring that delayed the initiation compared with the non-mulch treatment. The spike initiation under <b>ridge</b> <b>planting</b> started earlier than that of furrow planting. Reduced tillage delayed the initiation compared with the conventional tillage. Duration of spike differentiation lasted longer under earlier starting of initiation that increased the grain numbers per spike. Other yield component characters were not affected by soil temperature. It was concluded that in the North China Plain where grain-filling duration of winter wheat was limited, agricultural practices that increased soil temperature in spring were favorable for grain production...|$|E

40|$|Advantages and {{disadvantages}} of the ridge plant system, weed control before and at planting and economics of the system are discussed. <b>Ridge</b> <b>planting</b> combines tillage and herbicides to achieve improved weed control in row crops. Crop seed is planted into ridges formed during cultivation and/or ditching of the previous crop. In <b>ridge</b> <b>planting,</b> the planter follows the old row and ridge clearing sweeps or disks move the surface soil, residue {{and much of the}} weed seed out of the row. Weed seeds are deposited between the rows where, upon germination, they can be controlled with cultivation. Two cultivations are generally used for weed control. The first cultivation loosens the soil and the second rebuilds the ridge. The ridge plant system is well suited to furrow-irrigationd crops. It also works well with dryland crops or those under center pivot irrigation. On furrow irrigationd land, corn or sorghum stalks may need to be shredded to assist in decomposition and hence irrigation because crop residue slows water advance in the furrow. Slowing the water may be a benefit, however, on soils which have a low water intake rate. With center pivot and dryland acres the need for shredding depends on how much residue the cultivator can handle...|$|E

In this perspective a detailed and systematic series of field studies were undertaken for three consecutive years (2013 -   2015) at Soil Salinity Research Institute, Pindi Bhattian, Pakistan to evaluate different nitrogen levels and the cost-effective planting technique for onion production under salt affected conditions. The experiment was laid out in split plot arrangement using randomized complete block design having three replications. Two planting methods, ridge and bed planting and 4 nitrogen levels, 1 - recommended dose (RD) of N (90 kg ha - 1), 2 - 75 % N of RD (67. 5 kg ha - 1), 3 - 125 % N of RD (112. 5 kg ha - 1), 4 - 150 % N of RD (135 kg ha - 1) were used. Planting methods were kept in main plots and nitrogen levels in sub plots keeping sub-plot size of 4 m x 6 m. Measurements included were: plant height, number of leaves/plants/m - 2, bulb diameter, bulb mass, total bulb yield, number of flowers/umbel, seed mass/plant and 1000 -seed mass.

40|$|The {{effects of}} drip {{irrigation}} and different cultivation methods on seed germination {{and growth of}} Puccinellia tenuiflora in saline-sodic soils were investigated in field experiments during 2008 - 2010 in the Songnen Plain, China.

Drip irrigation affected the distributions of electrical conductivity of saturated-soil extract (ECe) and pH of the saline-sodic soil.

The {{influence}} of root pruning and {{different ways of}} tree planting on the growth, cropping and fruit quality was estimated in the experiment conducted in 1993 - 2001 at the Fruit Experimental Station near Wrocław. Trees on M. 26 rootstock were planted at two densities: 3077 trees/ha (control and root pruning) and 6154 trees/ha (ridge). The experiment {{was carried out in}} 4 replications, with 11 trees per plot. In some trees the shoots were mechanically pruned (from 1994 at the end of blooming) from both sides of a row, 50 cm from the trunk, to a depth of ~ 30 cm. Results of the study proved that trees placed on the soil and earthed up gave the highest yield per hectare. Fruits from trees densely planted on a ridge were significantly smaller as compared to the control. Root pruning reduced the vegetative growth of apple trees and significantly increased their productivity.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the advantages}} and disadvantages of targeting soil conservation measures on the basis of off-site water quality goals. The Stratford Avon watershed in Perth County and the Big Creek watershed in Middlesex County, both located in southwestern Ontario, are used as case studies. Targeting criteria, used as proxies for measuring the contribution to offlfarm damage from particular parcels of crop land, are based on the physical characteristics of the parcels. Alternative conservation tillage practices include fall chisel ploughing, <b>ridge</b> <b>planting,</b> no tillage and buffer strips. At each level of the targeting criteria, the reduction in offyarm damage is estimated using the Guelph Model for Evaluating the Effects of Agricultural Management Systems on Erosion and Sedimentation (GAMES). Economic targeting criteria are based on the value of improved water quality under a conservation practice minus the onlfarm costs of adoption of that practice. Targeting conservation policies on the basis of reduction of offlfarm damages can result in greater eficiency in public policy. The authors conclude that further efforts in targeting conservation policies have the potential to improve the cost effectiveness of soil conservation programs if technical and adminis-trative problems can be overcome...|$|E

The object {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of a low-cost organic mulch application in a newly planted peach orchard under a <b>ridge</b> <b>planting</b> system. Three treatments were performed in 12 elementary plots using a randomized complete block design. The orchard was drip-irrigated. Mulch was applied in two treatments, which differed in fertigation (none vs. multi-nutrient fertigation), while the third treatment did not include either mulch or fertigation and served as the control. Treatments were compared in terms of their effects on the physical properties of the soil, crop response, and water-use efficiency. Mulch treatments did not alter the soil bulk density. However, the mulch significantly (p = 0. 0004) increased the water infiltration rate (2. 21 mm/h vs. 121 mm/h), which is a key issue when working in high frequency irrigation systems under soil limiting conditions. Similarly, mulched treatments showed a more favorable water status both in the second and the third year, which was translated in a better crop response. Thus, mulched treatments recorded higher yields both in the second (+ 155 %, p = 0. 0005) and the third year (+ 53 %, p = 0. 0007) of the experiment. Water use efficiency (WUE agr) was higher in the mulch treatments (+ 50 % in average, p = 0. 0007) than in the control in the third year of the study.
