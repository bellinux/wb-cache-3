At that time, Dunedin was a fertile ground for bands, many of whom {{recorded}} on the Flying Nun Records label, based in Christchurch. Among the bands with strong Dunedin connections at this time were The Chills, The Clean, The Verlaines, The Bats, Sneaky Feelings, The Dead C and Straitjacket Fits, all of which had significant followings throughout New Zealand and on the college <b>radio</b> <b>circuit</b> in the United States and Europe.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the term}} {{alternative}} rock came into common usage around 1990, {{the sort of}} music to which it refers was known {{by a variety of}} terms. In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term Alternative Music to describe the groups he was writing about. In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled [...] "Rock and Roll Alternative". [...] "College rock" [...] was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college <b>radio</b> <b>circuit</b> and the tastes of college students. In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged {{as a result of the}} punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, NME and Sounds magazines published charts based on small record stores called [...] "Alternative Charts". The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term indie was used literally to describe independently distributed records. By 1985, indie had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.|$|E

5000|$|RF modules {{are widely}} used in {{electronic}} design owing {{to the difficulty of}} designing radio circuitry. Good electronic radio design is notoriously complex because of the sensitivity of <b>radio</b> <b>circuits</b> and the accuracy of components and layouts required to achieve operation on a specific frequency. In addition, reliable RF communication circuit requires careful monitoring of the manufacturing process to ensure that the RF performance is not adversely affected. Finally, <b>radio</b> <b>circuits</b> are usually subject to limits on radiated emissions, and require Conformance testing and certification by a standardization organization such as ETSI or the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). For these reasons, design engineers will often design a circuit for an application which requires radio communication and then [...] "drop in" [...] a pre-made radio module rather than attempt a discrete design, saving time and money on development.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an eight-order continuoustime Butterworth band-pass filter with quality factor of 10 is presented, {{intended}} {{to be used for}} selectivity in modern DECT handset receivers. A distortion analysis is performed and a model to describe the frequency dependent Spurious-Free Dynamic-Range (SFDR) in absolute value is presented. Measurements show a SFDR of 48 dB with a 3 mW power consumption. I. Introduction Until now, Surface-Acoustic-Wave (SAW) filters are frequently used in DECT handset receivers for selectivity. However, they have some disadvantages: the relatively large package, the fixed input-output impedance, the insertion loss and the high cost. The aim of the filter to be presented is to beat these disadvantages by integrating selectivity along with other <b>radio</b> <b>circuits.</b> These <b>radio</b> <b>circuits</b> are already realized in a high-frequency bipolar process, and therefore, the integrated filter must be bipolar too.
