40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{performance}} bound calculus on feedforward networks where data packets are routed under wormhole routing discipline. We are interested in determining maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs of messages or packets going from a source node to a destination node, through a given virtual path in the network. Our objective here is to give a network calculus approach for calculating the performance bounds. First we propose a new concept of curves that we call packet curves. The curves permit to model constraints on packet lengths of a given data flow, when the lengths are allowed to be different. Second, we use this new concept to propose an approach for calculating <b>residual</b> <b>services</b> for data flows served under non preemptive service disciplines. Third, we model a binary switch (with two input ports and two output ports), where data is served under wormhole discipline. We present our approach for computing the <b>residual</b> <b>services</b> and deduce the worst case bounds for flows passing through a wormhole binary switch. Finally, we illustrate this approach in numerical examples, and show how to extend it to feedforward networks. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we empirically {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of existed several economic instruments in 31 provinces in China and develop the ways that could control the industrial pollution effectively. Although the current pollution norms and the informal pressure {{have a positive effect}} on controlling the water pollution in China, there are still some tasks we are supposed to do to improve the water quality. In this paper, the author suggests testing the monitoring and enforcement efforts of city wastewater pollution control authorities, which are affected by local community characteristics that act as proxies for political power. We utilize the dataset of plant-level annual emission data from 31 provinces in China to serve the model environmental pollution equilibrium. Use demand for <b>residual</b> disposal <b>service</b> and supply of <b>residual</b> disposal <b>service</b> to test the efficiency of the community on government monitoring enforcement.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the service life design of {{existing}} reinforced concrete structures in a marine environment. The general procedure of condition assessment for estimating the <b>residual</b> <b>service</b> life of structures before a repair measure is illustrated. For assessment of the <b>residual</b> <b>service</b> life of structures which have undergone a repair measure a simplified mathematical model of chloride diffusion in a 2 -layer system is presented. Preliminary probabilistic calculations demonstrate the effect of various conditions on the <b>residual</b> <b>service</b> life. First studies of the chloride diffusion in a 2 -layer system have been conducted using the finite element method. Results of a long-term exposure test are presented to illustrate the performance of two different repair materials. The distribution of residual chlorides after application of a repair material is being studied in laboratory investigations. The residual chlorides migrate from the concrete layer into the new layer immediately after the repair material {{has been applied to}} the concrete member. The content and gradient of residual chlorides, along with the thickness and the chloride ingress resistance of both the remaining and the new layer of cover, will determine the <b>residual</b> <b>service</b> life of the repaired structures...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} facing public asset owners is the {{decision}} of refurbishing aged built assets. This decision requires {{an assessment of the}} “remaining service life” {{of the key}} components in a building. The remaining service life is significantly dependent upon the existing condition of the asset and future degradation patterns considering durability and functional obsolescence. Recently developed methods on <b>Residual</b> <b>Service</b> Life modelling, require sophisticated data that are not readily available. Most of the data available are in the form of reports prior to undertaking major repairs or in the form of sessional audit reports. Valuable information from these available sources can serve as bench marks for estimating the reference service life.

Using these informations, the <b>residual</b> <b>service</b> life of a case study building façade has been estimated in this paper based on state-of-the-art approaches.

40|$|Generalised Processor Sharing (GPS) is a {{well-known}} ideal service policy designed to share the capacity of a server among the input flows fairly: each backlogged flow receives a pre-defined {{fraction of the total}} server capacity, according to its weight. Several practical implementations of GPS have been proposed, among which Deficit Round Robin (DRR) is widely deployed since it can be implemented in a very efficient way. The worst-case performance of DRR has been studied by several papers, all of which assume that the shared server has a constant rate. This paper studies DRR using Network Calculus, under very general assumptions.

Socially, politically and culturally there are few differences between Norway and Sweden. Child protection and out-of-home placement of {{children and young people}} are integrated parts in the welfare state that are shared by the Nordic countries. It is a model that builds on principles of universalism and decommodification of social rights. The welfare model presupposes high public legitimacy for a high level of social expenditure. However the idea of marketization and privatization has also affected the welfare model in Sweden and Norway. Although there are more similarities than differences between the two countries’ child protection systems, the article discusses some differences, for example the after care services, new groups of children and young people in the out-of-home care, like young unaccompanied asylum seekers. There are also some differences when it comes to privatization, the introduction of evidence-based methods in the child protection system and the tension between general and <b>residual</b> <b>services</b> for children and young people in the child protection system...|$|R
