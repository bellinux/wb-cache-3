25|$|Like {{most cities}} in Italy, Milan has {{developed}} its own local culinary tradition, which, {{as it is}} typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, butter than vegetable oil and features almost no tomato or fish. Milanese traditional dishes includes cotoletta alla milanese, a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese Wiener Schnitzel). Other typical dishes are cassoeula (stewed pork <b>rib</b> <b>chops</b> and sausage with Savoy cabbage), ossobuco (braised veal shank served with a condiment called gremolata), risotto alla milanese (with saffron and beef marrow), busecca (stewed tripe with beans), and brasato (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes).|$|E

5000|$|Short ribs {{cut from}} the rib area near the spine (the dorsal area) are better known as [...] "back ribs" [...] or [...] "dinosaur ribs". They consist of {{what remains of the}} rib in this area after the <b>rib</b> <b>chop</b> is removed. Due to the {{thinness}} of the serratus ventralis here, the meat on these ribs is generally intercostal muscle (e.g., the muscle between each rib).|$|R
5000|$|A meat chop is {{a cut of}} {{meat cut}} perpendicularly to the spine, and usually {{containing}} a rib or riblet part of a vertebra and served as an individual portion. The most common kinds of meat chops are pork and lamb. A thin boneless chop, or one with only the rib bone, may be called a cutlet, though the difference is not always clear. The term [...] "chop" [...] is not usually used for beef, but a T-bone steak is essentially a loin <b>chop,</b> and a <b>rib</b> steak a <b>rib</b> <b>chop.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{pork loin}} chops, {{lamb loin chops}} contain almost one muscle. They are bigger than <b>rib</b> <b>chops,</b> and the biggest lamb chop {{that does not have}} bands of {{connective}} tissue separating the meat. They do very well with hot, fast, dry methods of cooking, such as grilling or broiling.|$|E
50|$|Like on a pig, <b>rib</b> <b>chops</b> from a lamb {{that has}} a layer of fat, two actually. If the whole primal cut is left intact, it becomes a rack of lamb. Again, they have little {{connective}} tissue, so they are usually roasted as a rack, or grilled one by one.|$|E
50|$|Lamb chops are {{cut from}} the rib, loin, and {{shoulder}} areas. The <b>rib</b> <b>chops</b> include a rib bone; the loin chops include only a chine bone. Shoulder chops are usually considered inferior to loin chops; both kinds of chops are usually grilled. Breast of lamb (baby chops) can be cooked in an oven.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Twenty-nine selected styles of subprimals or sections of veal were obtained from a commercial facility to assist {{in the development of a}} software support program for retailers. They were fabricated into bone-in or boneless retail cuts and associated components by trained meat cutters. Each style selected (n = 6) was used to generate mean retail yields and labor requirements, which were calculated from wholesale and retail weights (kg) and processing times (s). Means and standard errors for veal ribs consisting of five different styles (n 30) revealed that style # 2, 7 rib 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm), had the lowest percentage of total retail yield (P <. 05) due to the greatest percentage bone. Furthermore, rib style # 2 required the most total processing time (P <. 05). Rib styles # 3, 7 <b>rib</b> <b>chop</b> ready, and # 5, 6 <b>rib</b> <b>chop</b> ready, yielded the greatest percentage total retail yield and also had the lowest total processing time (P <. 05). Within veal loins, style # 2, 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loin kidney fat in, had the greatest percentage fat (P <. 05). Loin styles # 2 and # 3, 4 (10 cm) x 4 (10 cm) loin special trimmed, generated more lean and fat trimmings, and bone, resulting in lower percentage total retail yields than loin style # 1, 0 (O cm) x 1 (2. 5 cm) loin special trimmed (P <. 05). Results showed that bone-in subprimals and sections required more processing time if fabricated into a boneless endpoint. In addition, as the number of different retail cuts increased, processing times also increased. As percent yield increases on higher priced retail cuts of the rib and loin, their associated profit also increases. Ribs and loins that yielded higher percentages of chops required less labor...|$|R
5000|$|In United States markets, {{pork chops}} are {{classified}} as [...] "center-cut" [...] or [...] "shoulder". Lamb chops {{are classified as}} shoulder, blade, rib, loin or kidney, and leg or sirloin chops. The <b>rib</b> <b>chops</b> are narrower, fattier, and tastier, while the loin chops are broader and leaner. Lamb chops are sometimes cut with an attached piece of kidney.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rib</b> <b>chops</b> from a pig are {{cut from}} the loin, or {{the back of the}} pig. A rib chop has a thin layer of fat around the outside.

5000|$|The center cut or {{pork loin}} chop {{includes}} a large T-shaped bone, and is structurally {{similar to the}} beef T-bone steak. <b>Rib</b> <b>chops</b> come from the rib portion of the loin, and are similar to rib eye steaks. Blade or shoulder chops come from the spine, and tend to contain much connective tissue. The sirloin chop is taken from the (rear) leg end and also contains much connective tissue. The shoulder end produces chops that are considerably fattier than the chops taken from the loin end. [...] The so-called [...] "Iowa Chop" [...] is a thick center cut; the term was coined in 1976 by the Iowa Pork Producers Association. A [...] "Bacon Chop" [...] is cut from the shoulder end and leaves the pork belly meat attached. Pork chops are sometimes sold marinated to add flavor; marinades such as a chili sauce or a barbecue sauce are common. As pork is often cooked more thoroughly than beef, thus running the risk of drying out the meat, pork chops can be brined to maintain moistness. One could also wrap their pork chops in bacon to add further moistness during the cooking process.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 52 - 57). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An in-home lamb study evaluated consumer ratings from users of lamb (at least once per month) as influenced by cut (blade <b>chop,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>chop,</b> loin chop, and leg steak), demographics, preparation method, and degree of doneness. Consumers in Dallas and Houston (n = 51) evaluated each cut for overall like (OLIKE), tenderness (TEND), juiciness (JUIC), flavor intensity (IFLAV), and flavor desirability (DFLAV) using 10 - point scales (10 = extreme like, extremely tender, extremely juicy, extremely intense, and extremely desirable; 1 = extreme dislike, extremely tough, extremely dry, extremely bland, and extremely undesirable). Income had a slight effect on consumer OLIKE ratings (P = 0. 047). Consumers earning more than $ 50, 000 rated lamb lower than those earning $ 40 - 50, 000. Differences (P 0. 10). A preparation method effect existed for TEND in the blade chop (P < 0. 05). Consumers rated grilling higher than other methods. A preparation method x degree of doneness interaction existed for OLIKE (P = 0. 019) and TEND (P = 0. 014) ratings of leg steaks. Cuts prepared by grilling x medium or higher were rated lower than those prepared by other methods x medium or higher. Preparation method was related to IFLAV (P < 0. 05). Leg steaks that were grilled had lower IFLAV ratings than steaks prepared with other methods. TEND and DFLAV were important and contributed to overall like (r = 0. 84 and r = 0. 83, respectively). IFLAV had a lower correlation (r = 0. 32) with OLIKE, which suggests that it did not influence consumer ratings of lamb. Rib and loin cuts were rated higher than shoulder and leg cuts and are subject to less variation from dependent factors of palatability, including preparation method and degree of doneness. Leg steaks were influenced more by tenderness than flavor desirability, which suggests that tenderness may be a more important factor in tougher cuts...|$|R

40|$|Norway is an {{important}} fish catching and producing country and has traditionally used fish and fish by-products in feed for monogastric animals, the pig is no exception. Fish and fish by products are excellent sources of essential amino acids, healthy fatty acids, vitamins {{and serves as a}} mineral supplier. Extended use has, however, caused negative effects on pork quality in terms of fat firmness, off-flavours and off-odours. During the last years feed recommendations, for most pigs in Norway, have been: no use of fish or fish by-products in feed for slaughter pigs, maximum iodine value product (IVP) 57 /feed unit and minimum 200 mg/kg vitamin E. These limitations have challenged the formulation of pig feeds. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of different dietary fat level, fatty acid composition and of sex (entire male and female) on sensory, technological and nutritional pork quality parameters. Three feeding experiments were conducted using entire males and females of the crossbreed [(Norwegian Landrace x Yorkshire) x (Duroc) ]. Pigs were individually and restricted fed. Fat sources used were soybean oil, palm kernel oil and fish oil. Experimental diets varied in IVP: 31 to 118, fish oil inclusion in percent: 0, 0. 25, 0. 48, 0. 52, 0. 72 and 3. 0 and fat level in percent of dry matter 2. 9 up to 9. 6. The <b>ribs,</b> pork <b>chops</b> and mince for meat balls were shortterm frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for 3 months, and belly and neck were short-term frozen stored for 2 and 4 months, respectively, at - 80 ˚C. All products were tested by sensory profiling after short-term frozen storage. Long-term stored ribs, loins and meat balls were wrapped in plastic bags and frozen stored at - 20 ˚C for additional 6 months and meat balls for additional 7 months. The ribs were long-term stored in darkness while the chops and meat balls were exposed to light simulating normal retail display. Long-term stored bellies were stored for 12 months at - 80 ˚C with additional 6 months at - 20 ˚C. Fatty acid composition was measured in shoulder fat (outer and inner layer), in backfat (outer and inner layer) at P 2 location and in neutral lipids and phospholipids of M. longissimus dorsi (LD). Backfat firmness and colour, and meat colour were also evaluated. The results from the present study showed that the fatty acid composition of backfat, inner and outer layer and neutral lipids of LD changed towards the dietary fatty acid composition. Feeding low fat diets seemed to enhance the de novo fatty acid synthesis, producing SFA and MUFA, especially C 18 : 1. Pigs fed low fat diets had low percentages of the very long chain (VLC) n- 3 fatty acids, mostly C 22 : 5 n- 3 in backfat and in neutral fat of LD. These pigs had also a high C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentage indicating production from C 18 : 2 n- 6. Dietary soybean oil, giving a high IVP, led to an increase in the percentage of C 18 : 2 n- 6 linearly to the dietary contribution. These pigs were also low in VLC n- 3 and still the C 22 : 5 n- 3 was dominating. When introducing fish oil, high in VLC n- 3 fatty acids, a substantial increase in the percentages of C 20 : 5 n- 3, C 22 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 in backfat and neutral lipids of LD was found indicating a higher nutritional quality. Increasing the fat level, by use of other added fat in combination with fish oil, seemed to improve the wanted incorporation of VLC n- 3 fatty acids into both backfat and neutral fat of LD. Our results further suggest that fish oil and high PUFA diets can be used for slaughter pigs without detrimental effects on sensory attributes like odour and flavour on short-term frozen stored products. After long-term frozen storage rib, meat balls and belly were not negatively influenced by high dietary PUFA, or dietary fish oil up to 0. 7 %. Only pork chops from the highest dietary IVP group showed increased odour and flavour rancidity and intensity. Longterm stored belly from pigs fed the second highest fish oil inclusion (0. 5 %) gave no offflavour or off odour. Only tendencies to higher fish oil flavour in the long-term stored belly was found in the highest fish oil group. After reheating, bellies from the highest fish oil group had a slightly increased fish oil flavour and odour together with a significant rancid flavor and odour. Dietary IVP slightly influenced the backfat firmness. Higher firmness scores were obtained when the dietary IVP declined. Fat colour was less influenced by the dietary fatty acid composition. Phospholipids had, as expected, high percentages of PUFA but were also influenced by the dietary treatments. Both low fat and soybean oil diets gave higher C 20 : 4 n- 6 percentages and lower percentage of VLCn- 3 fatty acids than fish oil fed pigs. The supply of C 18 : 3 n- 3 seemed to enhance the desaturation and elongation into C 20 : 5 n- 5 and C 22 : 5 n- 3 but a decrease in the percentage of C 22 : 6 n- 3 when feeding these diets strongly supports the view that the synthesis of this fatty acid is very limited in pigs. Providing dietary VLC n- 3 fatty acids by using fish oil, these fatty acids were incorporated into phospholipids, now with the C 20 : 5 n- 3 and C 22 : 6 n- 3 as the prominent Sex had an impact on fatty acid composition. Males had higher PUFA and lower MUFA percentages in outer and inner layers of backfat and shoulder fat and in neutral fat of LD. The percentage of C 18 : 1 was in particular lower in males, indicating a lower delta- 9 -desaturase activity as compared to females. In conclusion, it is possible to change the fatty acid composition of pork towards healthier products for human consumption without detrimental effects on important sensory traits. Care must, however, be taken when long term storage or reheating is intended...|$|R
