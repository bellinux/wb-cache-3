40|$|Deregulation of Rho family small {{guanosine}} triphosphatases {{has been}} implicated in human carcinogenesis. <b>Rho-kinases</b> are downstream effectors of Rho guanosine triphosphatases in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility. However, their functions in human cancers remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of <b>Rho-kinases</b> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor progression and invasion. We first examined {{the expression of the}} two <b>Rho-kinases</b> (ROCK 1 and ROCK 2) in human HCC, and found that ROCK 2 was frequently overexpressed in primary HCCs (22 / 41 [53. 66 %]). Clinico-pathological analysis revealed that overexpression of ROCK 2 was significantly associated with the presence of tumor microsatellite formation (P = 0. 005), suggesting that deregulation of ROCK 2 may contribute to the intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Consistently, we demonstrated that stable overexpression of ROCK 2 significantly enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in HCC cells. Conversely, stable knockdown of ROCK 2 by short hairpin RNA approach remarkably reduced HCC cell migration and invasion. Moreover, orthotopic liver xenograft models provided further support that stable knockdown of ROCK 2 suppressed HCC invasion in vivo. Stable knockdown of ROCK 2 in HCC cells significantly inhibited Golgi reorientation, myosin phosphatase phosphorylation, and formations of stress fibers, filopodia, and lamellipodia; these molecular and cellular events are crucial for cell motility and cancer invasion. Conclusion: Our results indicate that ROCK 2 was overexpressed in human HCCs, and this overexpression was associated with a more aggressive biological behavior. Our findings also demonstrate that ROCK 2 {{played a significant role in}} regulating cytoskeletal events and contributed to the invasion of HCC.

The role of ROCKs in cell shape change and motility suggests a potentially important role for Rho-ROCK signaling in tissue morphogenesis during development. Indeed, in Drosophila, a single ROCK ortholog, DRok, has been identified and {{has been found to be}} required for establishing planar cell polarity. Results We have examined a potential role for DRok in additional aspects of tissue morphogenesis using an activated form of the protein in transgenic flies.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{pathophysiological}} mechanisms of erection have been partially clarified, and the molecular machinery of the cellular components of the corpus cavernosum (CC) has been widely investigated.

40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} exercise-induced cardioprotection are poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training down-regulated gene {{expression of the}} Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). RhoA and its first effectors, the <b>Rho-kinases</b> (ROCK), have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of a RhoA/ROCK inhibitor (fasudil) and exercise in the Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mouse model of atherosclerosis. Methods: Four groups of 14 week old ApoE mice were randomised as follows (n = 12 /group) : i) sedentary controls (Cont); ii) fasudil (Fas) treatment (100 mg/kg bodyweight/day) for 8 weeks; iii) exercise intervention (Ex:free access to running wheel for 8 weeks) and iv) exercise intervention and fasudil treatment (ExFas) for 8 weeks. Results: Phosphorylation of myosin light chain was significantly reduced in the brachiocephalic artery of all treatment groups compared with sedentary controls, implying an inhibitory effect of exercise and fasudil on the RhoA/ROCK pathway. Furthermore, atherosclerotic lesions were significantly smaller in all treatment and intervention groups compared with the control group (Fas: 34. 7 %, Ex: 48. 3 %, ExFas: 40. 9 % less than Control). The intima:media ratio was reduced by both exercise intervention and fasudil treatment alone or in combination (Fas: 23. 6 %, Ex: 35. 5 %, ExFas: 43. 9 % less than Control). Exercise alone and fasudil treatment alone also showed similar effects on plaque composition, increasing both smooth muscle cell and macrophage density.

40|$|The endomembrane {{system is}} the {{characteristic}} symbol for eukaryotic cells, which provides a much more precise and high-speed performance of various cellular events. The functional integrity of individual organelle relies on specific protein trafficking to these compartments, {{as well as the}} tight regulation of local lipid turnover. The former is highly dependent on the collaborative actions of biomoelcues in the membrane trafficking nano-machinery, whereas the latter is always sensible to different extracellular stimulations and subsequently triggers the signal transduction inside the cell. The main focus of this dissertation is to unveil the biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of selected signaling and trafficking proteins that are involved in membrane binding and/or membrane trafficking. A unique subclass of signaling proteins called split PH domain proteins have been systematically studied in this dissertation. In the mammalian genome, there are only six split PH domain proteins, which are characterized by insertion of one or more autonomously folded protein modules. I have determined the three dimensional structure of the PHN-PDZ-PHC tandem of α-syntrophin using NMR spectroscopy. For the first time, I showed that two halves of the split PH domain fold into a canonical PH domain conformation intra- and inter-molecularly, and the PDZ insertion in the PH domain does not change the structure of the PH domain. Although completely unstructured in their isolated form, de novo folding could be observed by simply mixing of two complementary split PH domain fragments. Further biochemical studies demonstrated that the site specific insertion of PDZ domain {{in the middle of the}} PH domain creates a supramodule with distinct lipid binding properties. Structure studies of other split PH domains from phospholipase C-γ 1 (PLC-γ 1), PI 3 -kinase enhancer (PIKE), and <b>Rho-kinases</b> (ROCK) further demonstrated that two halves of split PH domain fragments interact with each other to fold into canonical PH domain structure, and the domain insertion may occur in different loop regions of the domain. In addition, the supramodular nature of split PH domain together with its inserted sequence is not an exclusive property for the PH-PDZ tandem of syntrophin, but also extended to the PH-insertion tandems from PLC-γ 1, PIKE, and ROCK. For PIKE and ROCK, the domain insertions also modify the lipid binding properties of their split PH domains. Whereas for PLC-γ 1, whose split PH domain cannot bind to phospholipid, the split PH domain controls the orientation of the inserted SH 2 -SH 2 -SH 3 tandem toward the catalytic X-Y boxes, and thus regulates the lipase activity of this enzyme. The systematic structural and functional studies of split PH domains indicate that these special tandem-arranged protein-protein interaction modules are not just simple attachments of “beads on a string”, but often represent functional supramodules with distinct structures and biological functions to satisfy the diverse requirements of an organism. This dissertation also describes regulatory mechanism of Dynein Light Chain 1 (DLC 1), which functions as a dimer and plays a critical role in the molecular motor dynein-mediated protein trafficking process. With a combination of gel filtration chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy, I showed that substitution of Ser 88 (which is buried in the dimer interface) with phosphorylation mimicking Glu disrupts DLC 1 dimer formation, and consequently impairs its target binding property. This structural insight was further demonstrated by our cellular data showing that DLC 1 phosphorylation on Ser 88 by p 21 -activated kinase 1, promotes mammalian cell survival by regulating its interaction with Bim and Bim’s cellular stability...|$|R

50|$|To {{explain how}} {{anterior}} and posterior cells are kept separated, the differential adhesion hypothesis proposes {{that these two}} cell populations express different adhesion molecules, producing different affinities for each other that minimize their contact.The selector affinity model proposes that difference in cell affinity between compartments {{is a result of}} differential selector gene expression. The presence or absence of selector genes in a given compartment produces compartment-specific adhesion or recognition molecules that are different from those in its counterpart.For example, engrailed expressed in the posterior, but not the anterior, cells provides the differential affinity that keeps these compartments separately.It is also possible that this difference in cell adhesion/affinity is not directly due to en expression, but rather to the ability to receive Hh signaling. Anterior cells, capable of Hh transduction, will express given adhesive molecules that would differ from those present in posterior cells, creating differential affinity that would prevent them from intermixing.This signaling-affinity model is supported by experiments that demonstrate the importance of Hh signaling. Clones mutant for the Smoothened (smo), the gene responsible for transducing Hh signaling, retain anterior-like features, but move into the posterior compartment without any changes in the expression engrailed or invected. This demonstrates that Hh signaling, rather than the absence of en, is what gives cells their compartmental identity. Nonetheless, this signaling-affinity model is incomplete: smo mutant clones of anterior origin that migrate into the posterior compartment, do not completely associate with these cells, but rather form a smooth boundary with these posterior cells. If signaling-affinity were the only factor determining compartment identity, then these clones, which are no longer receiving Hh signaling, would have the same affinity as the other posterior cells in that compartment and be able to intermix with them.These experiments indicate that although Hh signaling could be having an effect in adhesive properties, this effect is limited to the border cells rather than throughout both compartments.It is also possible that both compartments produce the same cell adhesion molecules, but a difference in its abundance or activity could result in sorting between the two compartments. In vitro, transfected cells with high levels of a given adhesion molecule will segregate from cells that expressing lower levels of this same molecule.Finally, differences in cell bond tension could also {{play a role in the}} establishment of the boundary and the separation of the two different cell populations. Experimental data has shown that Myosin-II is up-regulated along both the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior boundaries in the imaginal wing disc. The D/V boundary is characterized by the presence of filamentous actin and mutations in Myosin-II heavy chain impairs D/V compartmentalization. Similarly, both F-actin and Myosin-II are increased along the A/P boundary, accompanied by a decrease of Bazooka, which was also observed in the D/V border. The <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor Y-27632, of which Myosin-II is the main target, significantly reduces cell bond tension, suggesting that Myosin-II could be the main effector of this process. In support of the signaling-affinity model, creating an artificial interface between cells with active vs. inactive Hh signaling induces a junctional behavior that aligns the cell bonds of where these opposing cell types meet. Moreover, a 2.5-fold increase in mechanical tension is observed along the A/P boundary, compared to the rest of the tissue. Simulations using a vertex model demonstrate that this increase in cell bond tension is enough to maintain proliferating cell populations in separate compartment boundaries. Parameters used to measure cell bond tension are based cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension input.It has also been suggested that boundary formation is not a result of differential mechanical tension between the two cell populations, but could be a result of the mechanical properties of the boundary itself.Interestingly, the level the adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, was unaltered and the biophysical properties of cells between the two compartments were the same. Changes in cell properties, such as an enlarged apical cross-section area, are only observed in anterior and posterior border cells. Along the boundary, orientation of cell divisions was random and there is no evidence that increased cell death or zones of non-proliferating cells are important for maintaining the A/P or D/V boundary.|$|E
40|$|Background: In liver {{cirrhosis}} <b>Rho-kinase</b> expression and activation is increased and mediates contraction of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and therefore portal hypertension. <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibition decreases myosin light chain phosphorylation and contraction of HSC.

Phospho-myosin light chain and collagen was immunohistologically stained in cirrhotic CCl 4 rat liver sections to detect the <b>Rho-kinase</b> activity in HSC. Results: The HSC-directed carrier coupled to <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor was localized within the HSC of cirrhotic livers. In contrast to the undirected <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibition HSC-directed <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibition decreased the <b>Rho-kinase</b> expression and activity.

40|$|AbstractPhosphorylation of CPI- 17 by Rho-associated kinase (<b>Rho-kinase)</b> and {{its effect}} on myosin {{phosphatase}} (MP) activity were investigated. CPI- 17 was phosphorylated by <b>Rho-kinase</b> to 0. 92 mol of P/mol of CPI- 17 in vitro. The inhibitory phosphorylation site was Thr 38 (as reported previously) and was identified using a point mutant of CPI- 17 and a phosphorylation state-specific antibody. Phosphorylation by <b>Rho-kinase</b> dramatically increased the inhibitory effect of CPI- 17 on MP activity. Thus, CPI- 17 as a substrate of <b>Rho-kinase</b> could be involved in the Ca 2 + sensitization of smooth muscle contraction as a downstream effector of <b>Rho-kinase...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{and others}} have {{reported}} that <b>Rho-kinase</b> {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of heart ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Studies have also demonstrated that the activation of <b>Rho-kinase</b> is reversed in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, the mechanisms by which <b>Rho-kinase</b> is increased in I/R and reversed in IPC are not thoroughly understood. In female Wistar rats, we created I/R by ligating the left anterior–descending branch of the coronary artery (LAD) for 30 min and releasing the ligature for 180 min. IPC rats underwent IPC (two cycles of 5 -min ligation of the LAD and 5 -min reflow) before I/R. IPC caused a significant increase in extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 activity and reduced <b>Rho-kinase</b> activity and cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P < 0. 05 versus I/R). Administration of PD 98059, an inhibitor of ERK–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, Caspase- 3 activity and myocardial infarction size (P < 0. 05 versus IPC). Western-blot analysis showed that administration of PD 98059 increased <b>Rho-kinase</b> activity. Treatment with fasudil, an inhibitor of <b>Rho-kinase,</b> reversed cell apoptosis caused by treatment with PD 98059 in IPC. In addition, ROCK 1 (<b>Rho-kinase</b> 1) may be the major <b>Rho-kinase</b> isoform that is opposed by ERK-MAPK signaling in IPC. These results indicate that ERK-MAPK signaling is required in IPC to oppose <b>Rho-kinase</b> activity in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe <b>Rho-kinase</b> {{signaling}} pathway is associated with coronary vasculopathy and myocardial dysfunction after cardiac transplantation. This study evaluated whether using a <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor during allograft storage could limit early endothelial dysfunction and improve myocardial performance after reperfusion. MethodsThis experiment was performed with an isolated working rabbit heart model and a support rabbit. Donor hearts (control group, n = 8) were arrested with an extracellular type of cardioplegia, preserved with University of Wisconsin solution, and then immersed in University of Wisconsin solution for 24 hours (1 °C). The <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor (<b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor group, n = 8) was administrated in the cardioplegic solution, the preservation University of Wisconsin solution, and the storage University of Wisconsin solution. Left ventricular performance was evaluated from the modified Frank–Starling curve in the working mode. Coronary blood flow and donor heart rate were measured in Langendorff mode. Effective evaluation of the <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor was inferred from phosphorylated myosin light chain. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA was analyzed to assess endothelial function. ResultsThe Frank–Starling curve showed a significant left and upward shift in the <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor group compared with the control group (P <. 05). The coronary blood flow and heart rate in the <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor group at 120 minutes {{was significantly higher than}} in the control group (P <. 05). Phosphorylated myosin light chain was significantly suppressed in the <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor group (P <. 05). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in the <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor group increased 4 -fold relative to those seen in the control group. ConclusionsTreatment with <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor during allograft harvest and storage enhanced coronary blood flow and ventricular recovery through nitric oxide–dependent endothelial protection after reperfusion. <b>Rho-kinase</b> inhibitor could help prevent early myocardial dysfunction after transplantation...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCell rearrangements {{shape the}} Drosophila embryo via {{spatially}} regulated changes in cell shape and adhesion. We show that Bazooka/Par- 3 (Baz) {{is required for}} the planar polarized distribution of myosin II and adherens junction proteins and polarized intercalary behavior is disrupted in baz mutants. The myosin II activator <b>Rho-kinase</b> is asymmetrically enriched at the anterior and posterior borders of intercalating cells in a pattern complementary to Baz. Loss of <b>Rho-kinase</b> results in expansion of the Baz domain, and activated <b>Rho-kinase</b> is sufficient to exclude Baz from the cortex. The planar polarized distribution of Baz requires its C-terminal domain. <b>Rho-kinase</b> can phosphorylate this domain and inhibit its interaction with phosphoinositide membrane lipids, suggesting a mechanism by which <b>Rho-kinase</b> could regulate Baz association with the cell cortex. These results demonstrate that <b>Rho-kinase</b> plays an instructive role in planar polarity by targeting Baz/Par- 3 and myosin II to complementary cortical domains...|$|E
