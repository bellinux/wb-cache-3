40|$|The {{methods of}} {{automatic}} pilotage along a guided path {{are well known}} in the practice of navigation. However these methods have a number of drawbacks, which reduce the effectiveness of their application. It is especially important for <b>river-sea</b> <b>vessel</b> in poor visibility. Because of the large inertia of the vessel and its hydrodynamic properties that are changed by external influences, the process has unstable oscillatory nature. Therefore the vessel moves not in a straight line, but on a winding curve having the general direction that corresponds to the specified value. In this paper new method of coastal navigation with invented new devices supported with satellite navigation receiver is presented...|$|E

To the south, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Astrakhan, the Caspian Sea, and Black Sea are directly reachable. To the west, the Volga River connects Cheboksary with Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Moscow and the northern regions of Russia. By using <b>river-sea</b> <b>vessels,</b> cargo transportation is possible from Chuvash river ports {{all the way to}} Saint Petersburg, Novorossiysk (on the Black Sea), Astrakhan, and ports situated on the Danube River. However, the river is frozen from December through April.|$|R
