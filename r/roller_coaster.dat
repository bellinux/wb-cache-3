5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> {{being built}} at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay began to {{circulate}} after a <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> enthusiast emailed the park and received a response saying that a <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> would be built. These rumors stated that the <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> would include a splashdown and an inversion on Bolliger & Mabillard's Dive Coaster, both a first for its kind. Later in the season, the park began to remove part of the track of Serengeti Express. On April 26, 2004, construction permits were discovered that confirmed that a <b>roller</b> <b>coaster,</b> restaurant, and gift shop would be constructed.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} progressed {{with the}} theme park in early 2013, {{the owners of the}} park gave no details about the <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> other than that it would be the largest <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> in India. Even after the <b>Roller</b> <b>Coaster</b> Database reported that a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster would be built at the park, the owners still released no details. In April 2013, the first pieces of the <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> were erected. By the end of August, all of the coaster's track was installed. Then {{in the third quarter of}} 2013, Adlabs Imagica released the details of Nitro.|$|E

5|$|Behemoth is a steel <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> at Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It is a Hypercoaster {{designed}} and developed by Swiss manufacturer, Bolliger & Mabillard. Behemoth was the tallest and fastest <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> in Canada until 2012 when Leviathan, a <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> also manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, was {{built at the}} opposite side of Canada's Wonderland, claiming these titles. Behemoth is similar to Diamondback (Kings Island), Goliath (La Ronde) and Nitro (Six Flags Great Adventure).|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Leviathan {{joined the}} {{similarly}} named Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada. It {{was the first}} new ride in Medieval Faire {{in more than a}} decade. Leviathan is ranked as the seventh tallest, and the eighth fastest <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> in the world. It is Canada's Wonderland's 16th <b>roller</b> <b>coaster.</b> The addition came quickly after the launch of the 230-foot-tall Behemoth <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> in 2008, and the 301-foot-tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are {{amusement}} rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are still being produced, steel <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|Over-the-shoulder restraints, {{the most}} common type, consist of a roughly U-shaped padded bar mounted {{to the top of}} each seat that swings downward. <b>Roller</b> <b>coasters</b> that have inversions usually have this type of restraint. Additionally, almost all Inverted <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> and Floorless <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> have this type of restraint, since it is {{difficult}} to mount a lapbar restraint. One disadvantage of over-the-shoulder restraints is that they can provide discomfort to the rider (known among coaster enthusiasts as headbanging), especially on rougher <b>roller</b> <b>coasters.</b> It is recommended that earrings should be removed before riding <b>roller</b> <b>coasters</b> with Over the Shoulder restraints. Some rides, such as Maverick at Cedar Point, require that guests must remove earrings before riding.|$|R

The ride was {{originally}} manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. After the 2000 season, D.H. Morgan Manufacturing {{was brought in to}} renovate the ride, most notably to remove the four inversions. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure is longer than its first drop.|$|E
5|$|Rougarou, {{formerly}} known as Mantis, is a floorless <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> located at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Designed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard, the <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> originally opened in 1996 as a stand-up <b>roller</b> <b>coaster</b> called Mantis, {{which at the time}} was the tallest, fastest, and longest {{of its kind in the}} world. Cedar Point had planned to name the ride Banshee, but due to negative publicity following the announcement, the name was later changed to Mantis.|$|E
50|$|The Suspended Looping Coaster {{is similar}} in design to other {{inverted}} <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> however unlike the four-across seating found on Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M) inverted <b>roller</b> <b>coasters,</b> Vekoma SLC's use two-across seating.|$|R
