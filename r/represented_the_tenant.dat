Following the {{initiative}} of George Wyndham, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was instrumental in forming the 1902 Land Conference of which he was chairman, representing the landlord side. Together with William O'Brien, who <b>represented</b> <b>the</b> <b>tenant</b> side, the conference resulted in the publication of a unanimous report in January which led to the enactment of the Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act (1903). This terminated the last vestige of absentee landlordism in Ireland and enabled tenants to purchase land from their landlords under favourable financial provisions.|$|E

25|$|In response, some Cabrini–Green tenant activists {{organized}} to prevent themselves from becoming homeless {{and to protect}} what they and their supporters see as a right to public housing for the city's poorest residents. The activists succeeded in obtaining a consent decree guaranteeing that some buildings will remain standing while the new structures are built, so that tenants can remain in their homes until new ones are available. The document also guarantees displaced Cabrini residents {{a home in the}} new neighborhood. In 2001, a <b>tenants</b> group sued <b>the</b> CHA over relocation plans for displaced residents of Cabrini–Green under the city's Plan for Transformation, a $1.4 billion blueprint for public housing renewal. Richard Wheelock, an attorney <b>representing</b> <b>the</b> <b>tenants,</b> said <b>the</b> authority's demolition program had outpaced its reconstruction program, thus leaving families with their own responsibilities to find options beyond equally dangerous and segregated areas elsewhere in the city, or simply becoming homeless.|$|R

40|$|I {{present an}} {{empirical}} model {{that is based}} upon the findings of both the conceptual and empirical models of previous research.

Next I introduce two new variables that <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> transaction constraint and the default risk of <b>the</b> <b>tenant.</b> I find that the variable market which <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> time an individual property is on the market is statistically significant and has a negative coefficient of when regressed on sales price and a positive coefficient when regressed on the cap rate. When the market variable is further broken into bins, I found that the time on the market does not negatively impact a property unless it is in fact on the market for over 2 years. When <b>the</b> variable <b>representing</b> a <b>tenant’s</b> default risk is regressed on the cap rate I found <b>the</b> <b>tenants</b> probability of default to be statistically significant with a negative coefficient.
