5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield Dock Company, which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Following {{criticism}} of BMO Field's use of FieldTurf and its rapid deterioration, MLSE {{agreed to a}} deal with the city to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a natural grass surface in time for the 2010 MLS Season. Along with the grass, a heating and drainage system was also installed at a cost of $3.5million to MLSE.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E

5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building’s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped “skyroom” atop its eight-story tower) {{has become a symbol}} of the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E
5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid {{greater attention to}} the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a classical statue.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} several years, KTNV has been phasing out {{syndicated}} programming and <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> either news, or more recently, self-produced lifestyle programming. Most notably in 2004, KTNV lost Oprah to rival CBS affiliate KLAS-TV (channel 8), <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a half-hour 4 p.m. newscast and syndicated programming; and in 2009, KTNV declined to renew the local rights to the syndicated morning talk show Live with Regis and Kelly (<b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the Morning Blend). On March 5, 2012, the 4 p.m. newscast was moved back to 3:30, {{in order to make}} room for Judge Judy (which it acquired from KSNV-DT) in the newscast's former timeslot.|$|R
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E
5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a wider and higher crossing of the river.|$|E

5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He {{is known to have}} issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E

The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's Royal York Hotel. The thieves were never found.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} {{in what is}} now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch raid on the Medway. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham.|$|E
