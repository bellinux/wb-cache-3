We explain the two different paths leading participants to behavioural change: (1) We adapt the model of interbodily resonance, a process of bodily interaction observable between, for example, partners engaged in verbal dialogue, to describe the unconscious bodily response to subtle changes in the environment. (2) And we apply the model of secondary control, an adjustment of one’s own expectations to maintain the pretence of control, to describe conscious cognitive adaptation to the changing environment.

40|$|The use {{of active}} {{controls}} for rotorcraft {{is becoming more}} important for modern aerospace configurations. Efforts to reduce the vibrations of helicopter blades with use of active-controls are in progress. Modeling oscillating control surfaces using the linear aerodynamics theory is well established. However, higher-fidelity methods are needed to account for nonlinear effects, {{such as those that}} occur in transonic flow. The aeroelastic responses of a wing with an oscillating control surface, computed using the transonic small perturbation (TSP) theory, have been shown to cause important transonic flow effects such as a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> surface effectiveness that occurs as the shock wave crosses the hinge line. In order to account for flow complexities such as blade-vortex interactions of rotor blades higher-fidelity methods based on the Navier-Stokes equations are used. Reference 6 presents a procedure that uses the Navier-Stokes equations with moving-sheared grids and demonstrates up to 8 degrees of control-surface amplitude, using a single grid. Later, this procedure was extended to accommodate larger amplitudes, based on sliding grid zones. The sheared grid method implemented in EulerlNavier-Stokes-based aeroelastic code ENS AERO was successfully applied to active control design by industry. Recently there are several papers that present results for oscillating control surface using Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. References 9 and 10 report 2 -D cases by filling gaps with overset grids. Reference 9 compares integrated forces with the experiment at low oscillating frequencies whereas Ref. 10 reports parametric studies but with no validation. Reference II reports results for a 3 D case by modeling the gap region with a deformed grid and compares force results with the experiment only at the mid-span of flap. In Ref. II grid is deformed to match the control surface deflections at the section where the measurements are made. However, there is no indication in Ref. II that the gaps are explicitly modeled as in Ref. 6. Computations using overset grids are reported in Ref. 12 for a case by adding moving control surface to an existing blade but with no validation either with an experiment or another computation...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{patients}} with multiple sclerosis and healthy control subjects as regards hemodynamics of cerebral venous drainage. Material and Methods: Between December 2012 and May 2013, 44 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent the B-mode, color Doppler, and duplex Doppler evaluations of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and vertebral vein. The following four parameters were investigated: IJV stenosis, <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> postural <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the cerebral venous outflow pathways, absence of detectable blood flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins, and reflux in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins in the sitting or supine position. Results: In the study group, IJV stenosis, postural <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the cerebral venous outflow pathways, and absence of flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins were found in 3 (6. 8 %), 2 (4. 5 %), and 3 (6. 8 %) patients, respectively. In the control group, IJV stenosis (P= 0. 12), postural <b>control</b> <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the cerebral venous outflow pathways (P= 0. 50), and absence of flow (P= 0. 12) were not detected.

40|$|Purpose: Female {{sterilization}} {{rates and}} subsequent desire for <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the procedure are substantially higher in minorities, low-income women, {{and those who}} use public insurance. Despite the disproportionate distribution of these outcomes, few studies in this area have considered {{the extent to which}} such disparities are attributable to a restricted set of contraceptive options among medically underserved populations, which may in turn explain higher rates <b>of</b> desire for <b>reversal.</b> Methods: We use the most recent wave of NSFG data (2011 - 2013) to estimate odds ratios for race/ethnicity on the likelihood <b>of</b> desire for <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> sterilization, while <b>controlling</b> for an array of factors that have been shown to negate or lessen the racial/ethnic association including age at sterilization, primary reason for sterilization, and insurance coverage, among others. Results: Outcomes indicate much higher odds <b>of</b> desire for <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> sterilization among black and Latina women, despite the inclusion of a range <b>of</b> <b>controls.</b> Additionally, we find that rates are much higher in women who reported “single service or no insurance coverage” {{as well as those who}} cited “some other reason” (versus completion of desired childbearing) as the main reason for their sterilization. Conclusions: These findings are noteworthy and suggest that disadvantage seems to play an important role in desire for <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> sterilization. Additional research in this area is needed in inform efforts to improve care and enhance the reproductive autonomy of medically underserved women...|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} {{generation of}} adjoints of mathematical models that are implemented as computer programs is receiving a increased {{attention in the}} scientific and engineering communities.

It allows for the computation of gradients at a small constant multiple of the cost for evaluating the objective function itself, that is independent of the number of input parameters. Source-to-source transformation tools for AD are available to generate adjoint codes based on the adjoint version of every statement, built by applying simple differentiation rules. A <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> flow <b>of</b> the original program becomes necessary. To guarantee correctness, certain values that are computed and overwritten in the original program must be made available in the adjoint program. They can be determined by performing a static data flow analysis, the so-called TBR analysis. Overestimation of this set must be kept minimal to get efficient adjoint codes. For many real-world applications, this efficiency is compulsory to apply a source-to-source transformation such as AD...|$|R
40|$|On April 6, 1994, the {{airplane}} returning the President of Rwanda home was shot down. After appearing to {{have achieved a}} negotiated end to the countries ongoing civil war, the nation was now plunged into an ethnically motivated genocide with horrendous results. What led the extremist elements of the Presidents ruling elite class to view this alternative as a plausible solution {{to the loss of}} power and prestige they would incur with implementation of the peace accords? To answer this question, this thesis examines how Rwanda's two ethnic groups were manipulated to ethnically stratify the country. After independence and a <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> ethnic <b>control,</b> the new regionally based elites consistently returned to an ethnically divisive strategy to unite the population and maintain their narrow base of power over other regional elites. The onset of civil war in 1990 by exiled Tutsi refugees, coupled with international pressure for democratic reforms ultimately led to the Arusha Accords. The Accords in due course failed both because of extremist fears of the loss of their power and prestige, and the failure of the international community to back the vital provisions of the accords...|$|R

In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we demonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be implemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure. After applying two sequent voltage pulses (X 1, X 2) as the logic inputs on the memtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic " 1 "), positive low (logic " 0 "), or negative (logic " 0 "), depending on the levels of X 1 and X 2. The underlying physical mechanism {{is related to the}} complete or partial <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> ferroelectric polarization <b>controlled</b> by inputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient.

40|$|The {{methods of}} the {{probability}} theory {{have been used in}} order to build up a new model of hysteresis. It turns out that the <b>reversal</b> points <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> parameter (e. g., the magnetic field) are Markov points which determine the stochastic evolution of the process. It has been shown that the branches of the hysteresis loop are converging to fixed limit curves when the number of cyclic back-and-forth variations <b>of</b> the <b>control</b> parameter between two consecutive reversal points is large enough. This convergence to limit curves gives a clear explanation of the accommodation process. The accommodated minor loops show the return-point memory property but this property is obviously absent in the case of non-accommodated minor loops which are not congruent and generally not closed. In contrast to the traditional Preisach model the reversal point susceptibilities are non-zero finite values. The stochastic model can provide a good approximation of the Raylaigh quadratic law when the external parameter varies between two sufficiently small values. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|Menezes CC, Peceguini LAM, Silva ED, Simoes CM Use of Sugammadex after Neostigmine Incomplete <b>Reversal</b> <b>of</b> Rocuronium-Induced Neuromuscular Blockade. Background and objectives: Neuromuscular {{blockers}} (NMB) {{have been}} used {{for more than half of}} a century in anesthesia and have always been a challenge for anesthesiologists. Until recently, the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers had only one option: the use of anticholinesterase agents. However, in some situations, such as deep neuromuscular blockade after high doses of relaxant, the use of anticholinesterase agents does not allow adequate <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> neuromuscular blockade: Recently, sugammadex, a gamma-cyclodextrin, proved to be highly effective for <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> NMB induced by steroidal agents. Case report: A female patient who underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy after rapid sequence intubation with rocuronium 1. 2 mg. kg(- 1). At the end of surgery, the pat ent received neostigmine <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> NMB. However, neuromuscular junction monitoring did not show the expected recovery, presenting residual paralysis. Sugammadex 2 mg. kg(- 1) was used and the patient had complete <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> NMB in just 2 minutes time. Conclusion: Adequate recovery of residual neuromuscular blockade is required for full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the pharynx and respiratory functions in order to prevent complications. Adequate recovery can only be obtained by neuromuscular junction monitoring with TOF ratio greater than 0. 9. Often, the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> NMB with anticholinesterase drugs may not be completely reversed. However, in the absence of objective monitoring this diagnosis is not possible. The case illustrates the diagnosis of residual NMB even after reversal with anticholinesterase agents, resolved with the administration of sugammadex, a safe alternative to reverse the NMB induced by steroidal non-depolarizing agents...|$|R

40|$|The author {{discusses}} the factors influencing <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> resistance to DDT, BHC and diazinon, as {{revealed by the}} experience of the last 15 years in the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the housefly on farms in Denmark. Supplementary data from the literature on the stability of resistance in field populations of other insects are also taken into consideration and the genetic mechanisms involved in the development and <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> resistance are examined. The author concludes that reversal often results in a heterozygous population with few highly resistant insects. If the heterozygotes are sufficiently susceptible, resumption of the use of the insecticide may give good control for a time, but resistance tends to return quickly. The earlier the development of resistance is detected and the insecticide withdrawn, the more rapidly and completely does reversal take place. Regular surveys of susceptibility are therefore necessary, preferably by methods distinguishing between homozygous and heterozygous resistance. When resistance occurs and another insecticide is substituted, reversal may be promoted by choosing an insecticide that selects against the resistant genotypes. In practice, this is difficult to achieve and there is more often a positive correlation between the two insecticides, so that the substitute insecticide slows down or prevents the <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> resistance. The author refers briefly to methods of counteracting this effect and to the possible influencing <b>of</b> <b>reversal</b> by using methods <b>of</b> <b>control</b> other than insecticides...|$|R
