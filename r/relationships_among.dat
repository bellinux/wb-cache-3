5|$|The <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> Gediminas' {{children}} were generally harmonious, with {{the notable exception}} of Jaunutis, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from the}} rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> families of frogs are still debated.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E

5|$|Other realist novels by Moore {{from this}} period include A Drama in Muslin (1886), a satiric story of the {{marriage}} trade in Anglo-Irish society that hints at same-sex <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> the unmarried daughters of the gentry, and Esther Waters (1894), {{the story of an}} unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover. Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication. His 1887 novel A Mere Accident is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences. He also published a collection of short stories: Celibates (1895).|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, boobies and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact <b>relationships</b> <b>among</b> the three lineages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Relationships</b> <b>among</b> lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet.

With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Time of Our Lives is {{the first}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus. The EP was released on August 28, 2009 by Hollywood Records, initially as a United States' Walmart exclusive. With alterations in artwork and track listing, an international edition was issued October 16, 2009. The Time of Our Lives was conceived as a release to accompany Cyrus' newly launched apparel line with Max Azria. The tracks on the EP were primarily composed by John Shanks and Dr. Luke, who also produced their respective cuts. Cyrus co-wrote one out of seven songs on The Time of Our Lives; one is a cover and another is a live rendition. Musically, the uptempo tracks on the record are in the pop rock and dance-pop genres while ballads are largely soft rock. Lyrically, it explores the themes of romantic <b>relationships,</b> <b>among</b> other subjects.|$|E
