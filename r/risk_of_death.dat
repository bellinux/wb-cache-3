We analysed National Health Service admissions data for England (1 April 1997 - 31 March 2012) for 10 - 19 y olds with emergency admissions for adversity-related injury (violent, drug/alcohol-related, or self-inflicted injury; n = 333, 009) or for accident-related injury (n = 649, 818). We used Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression to estimate and compare 10 -y post-discharge <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and emergency re-admission. Among adolescents discharged after adversity-related injury, one in 137 girls and one in 64 boys died within 10 y, and 54. 2 % of girls and 40. 5 % of boys had an emergency re-admission, with rates being highest for 18 - 19 y olds. <b>Risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were higher than in adolescents discharged after accident-related injury (girls: age-adjusted hazard ratio 1. 61, 95 % CI 1. 43 - 1. 82; boys: 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 98 - 2. 29), as were <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> re-admission (girls: 1. 76, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 1. 79; boys: 1. 41, 95 % CI 1. 39 - 1. 43). <b>Risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and re-admission were increased after all combinations of violent, drug/alcohol-related, and self-inflicted injury, but particularly after any drug/alcohol-related or self-inflicted injury (i. e., with/without violent injury), for which age-adjusted hazard ratios for death in boys ranged from 1. 67 to 5. 35, compared with 1. 25 following violent injury alone (girls: 1. 09 to 3. 25, compared with 1. 27).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a robust {{normative}} evaluation of the recent evolution of Indians' exposures to health-related risks. Design/methodology/approach – The paper compares empirically the distributions <b>of</b> individuals' <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in India on the basis of new ethically robust criteria in 1995 and 2002. Probabilities <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are assigned individuals as an estimated probit function of several explanatory variables, including the individual's district of residence. The criteria used ranks distributions <b>of</b> individual <b>risks</b> in the same way as would all Von Neumann–Morgenstern (VNM) social planners who respect, in the usual Pareto sense – individuals VNM preferences over individual <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Two criteria are considered in turn. The first criterion assumes that individuals' VNM utilities are increasing in money and value more a unit of money received in the bad state than one received in the good one. The second criterion makes the extra assumption that individuals are risk averse and have VNM utility functions that are more concave in the bad state than in the good one. Findings – It is found that there is unanimity among all VNM social planners who respect individual VNM preference for considering that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in India was better in 2002 than in 1995. This is at least so if individuals can be assumed to prefer more money to less, to be risk averse, and to be more risk averse in the bad state than in the good one. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of the empirical research of the paper is that it concerns only one kind <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Future research would apply the tools of this paper to other kinds <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> like <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> crime or <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> unemployment. Practical implications – A practical implication of the paper is to illustrate the usefulness of robust dominance methodology to evaluate the outcome of various policies. Originality/value – The novelty of the paper is to be one of the first to apply empirically new dominance criteria th at are specifically designed to compare distributions <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> between individuals. It is certainly the first paper to apply the tool to appraise the distribution <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in India.

40|$|Background: Patients {{with heart}} failure are at {{increased}} <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> both sudden <b>death</b> and pump failure death. Strategies to better identify {{those who have}} greatest net benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation could reduce morbidity and maximize cost-effectiveness of ICDs. Objective: We aimed to identify baseline variables in patients with cardiomyopathy that are independently associated with a disproportionate fraction <b>of</b> mortality <b>risk</b> attributable to sudden death vs nonsudden death. Methods: We used data from 9885 patients with heart failure without ICDs, of whom 2552 died during an average follow-up of 2. 3 years. Using commonly available baseline clinical and demographic variables, we developed a multivariate regression model to identify variables associated with a disproportionate <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sudden <b>death.</b> Results: We confirmed that lower ejection fraction and better functional class were associated with {{a greater proportion of}} mortality due to sudden death. Younger age, male sex, and higher body mass index were independently associated with a greater proportional <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sudden <b>death,</b> while diabetes mellitus, hyper/hypotension, higher creatinine level, and hyponatremia were associated with a disproportionately lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sudden <b>death.</b> The use <b>of</b> several heart failure medications, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, or NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide concentrations were not associated with a disproportionate <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sudden <b>death.</b> Conclusion: Several easily obtained baseline demographic and clinical variables, beyond ejection fraction and New York Heart Association functional class, are independently associated with a disproportionately increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> sudden <b>death.</b> Further investigation is needed to assess whether this novel predictive method can be used to target the use of lifesaving therapies to populations who will derive greatest mortality benefit...|$|R
