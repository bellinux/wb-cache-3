40|$|Multilayer {{techniques}} such as: tape wrapping, braiding, and filament winding represent versatile and economical routes for fabricating composite tubes and cylindrical structures. However, multilayer architectures lack the radial reinforcement required to <b>retain</b> <b>threads</b> when the desired means of connection or closure is a threaded joint. This issue was {{addressed in the}} development of a filament wound, carbon-carbon composite impact shell for the NASA radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The problem of poor thread shear strength was solved by incorporating a number of radial elements of triangular geometry around the circumference of the thread for the full length of thread engagement. The radial elements significantly increased the shear strength of the threaded joint by transmitting the applied force to the balance of composite structure. This approach is also applicable to ceramic composites...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{throughput}} processors such as GPUs achieve {{high performance}} and efficiency by exploiting data parallelism in application kernels expressed as threaded code. One drawback {{of this approach}} compared to conventional vector architectures is redundant execution of instructions that are common across multiple threads, resulting in energy inefficiency due to excess instruction dispatch, register file accesses, and memory operations. This paper proposes to alleviate these overheads while <b>retaining</b> the <b>threaded</b> programming model by automatically detecting the scalar operations and factoring {{them out of the}} parallel code. We have developed a scalarizing compiler that employs convergence and variance analyses to statically identify values and instructions that are invariant across multiple threads. Our compiler algorithms are effective at identifying convergent execution even in programs with arbitrary control flow, identifying two-thirds of the opportunity captured by a dynamic oracle. The compile-time analysis leads to a reduction in instructions dispatched by 29 %, register file reads and writes by 31 %, memory address counts by 47 %, and data access counts by 38 %...|$|R

This paper looks at Britten 2 ̆ 7 s cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake and a song cycle by myself based on J. R. R. Tolkien 2 ̆ 7 s The Gest of Beren and Luthien. Divided into two main parts, the first focuses on Britten 2 ̆ 7 s song cycle, and the second on my own work, Lingering Light: The Tale of Beren and Luthien. Each part examines the context for the work, the original text and how it has been shaped to create a coherent cycle, {{and the way in which}} the music crystallises some vital element of the text. The Blake cycle is a bleak and fatalistic exposition of the human condition, matched by Britten 2 ̆ 7 s equally forbidding setting. Every musical gesture, from the time and tonality to each motivic figure, is uniquely suited to the text, creating an interpretation that is both an illustration and an illumination of the poetry. Tolkien 2 ̆ 7 s tale of Beren and Luthien follows a similarly doomed path, yet nevertheless <b>retains</b> a <b>thread</b> of hope that outlasts the Fate to come. My purpose in writing this cycle is to share this tale with a wider audience, with Britten 2 ̆ 7 s views on the role of the composer and his poetic sensitivity as my guide...|$|R

Sivanath Sastri had class friends such as Aghore Nath Gupta and Vijay Krishna Goswami, who had joined the Brahmo Samaj. Another Brahmo, Umesh Chandra Mukhopadhyay influenced him. He started attending prayers of the Brahmo Samaj against the wishes of his father. Keshub Chunder Sen formally initiated him into the Brahmo Samaj in 1869. Twenty other persons were also initiated on the same day. That included Ananda Mohan Bose, Krishna Behari Sen, Rajaninath Roy and Srinath Dutta. He abandoned his sacred thread.

A Hamsa monk has matted hair, is like Bahudaka, but wanders and begs from houses he has not preselected. A Paramahamsa monk has abandoned his sacred thread, cut off his topknot and hair, abandoned all social and material things, begs with his hand as bowl, and is happy whether he finds something to eat or not. A Turiyatita monk eats fruits and leaves like a cow, states the text, and the days he eats cooked food, it comes from three different houses he has never visited before. An Avadhuta monk meditates all the time on his own nature, receives food from anyone who gives it to him.|$|R
40|$|A hybrid denture is {{one that}} is {{fabricated}} over a metal framework and <b>retained</b> by screws <b>threaded</b> into the implant abutments. The anterior part of a mandibular hybrid denture is fixed on implants while the posterior part of the denture is extended and cantilevered from implants. This article presents the fabrication of a maxillary over-denture opposing mandibular implant retained hybrid prosthesis. A total of four implants were placed in the mandibular arch. Castable abutments were used to produce the optimal angulations. Framework was waxed, cast recovered, and the fit was refined until the framework seated passively on the master cast. The mandibular denture teeth were waxed to the hybrid framework, and a final wax try-in was performed to verify and correct maxillomandibular relations before processing. The prosthesis was inserted after verification of occlusion, retention, and stability. The rehabilitation of edentulous patients with hybrid dentures has been observed to achieve greater masticatory function and psychological satisfaction than with conventional over-dentures. Producing a passive-fitting substructure for a fixed removable screw retained hybrid prosthesis is arguably one of the most technically complex tasks in implant dentistry. The technique presented may not initially produce a perfectly passive framework, but use of disclosing media and adjusting the internal aspect of the casting can result in non-binding, fully seated prostheses...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the following scenario. A set of n jobs with different threads is being run concurrently. Each job has an associated weight, which gives the proportion of processor time {{that it should be}} allocated. In a single time quantum, p threads of (not necessarily distinct) jobs receive one unit of service, and we require a rule that selects those p threads, at each quantum. Proportionate fairness means that over time, each job will have received an amount of service that is proportional to its weight. That aim cannot be achieved exactly due to the discretisation of service provision, but we can still hope to bound the extent to which service allocation deviates from its target. It is important that any scheduling rule be simple since the rule will be used frequently. We consider a variant of the Surplus Fair Scheduling (SFS) algorithm of Chandra, Adler, Goyal, and Shenoy. Our variant, which is appropriate for scenarios where jobs consist of multiple <b>threads,</b> <b>retains</b> the properties that make SFS empirically attractive but allows the first proof of proportionate fairness in a multiprocessor context. We show that when the variant is run, no job lags more than pH(n) - p + 1 steps below its target number of services, where H(n) is the Harmonic function. Also, no job is over-supplied by more than O(1) extra services. This analysis is tight and it also extends to an adversarial setting, which models some situations in which the relative weights of jobs change over time...|$|R
40|$|We have modi ed Mach 3. 0 {{to treat}} cross-domain remote {{procedure}} call (RPC) as a single entity, instead of a sequence of message passing operations. With RPC thus elevated, we improved the transfer of control during RPC by changing the thread model. Like most operating systems, Mach views threads as statically associated with a single task, with two threads involved in an RPC. An alternate model is that of migrating threads, in which, during RPC, a single thread abstraction moves between tasks with the logical ow ofcontrol, and &quot; code is passively executed. We have compatibly replaced Mach's static threads with migrating threads, {{in an attempt to}} isolate this aspect of operating system design and implementation. The key elementof our design is a decoupling of the thread abstraction into the execution context and the schedulable thread of control, consisting of a chain of contexts. A key element of our implementation is that threads are now &quot; in the kernel, and temporarily make excursions into tasks via upcalls. The new system provides more precisely de ned semantics for thread manipulation and additional control operations, allows scheduling and accounting attributes to follow threads, simpli es kernel code, and improves RPC performance. We have <b>retained</b> the old <b>thread</b> and IPC interfaces for backwards compatibility, with no changes required to existing client programs and only a minimal change to servers, as demonstrated by a functional Unix single server and clients. The logical complexity along the critical RPC path has been reduced by a factor of nine. Local RPC, doing normal marshaling, has sped up by factors of 1. 73. 4. We conclude that a migrating-thread model is superior to a static model, that kernel-visible RPC is a prerequisite for this improvement, and that it is feasible to improve existing operating systems in this manner. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the usefulness of}} the “inducer grafting” technique for regeneration of the semitendinosus (ST) tendon after its harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Methods Twenty knees of 20 patients (mean age at the time of surgery, 23. 1 [*]years) underwent ACL reconstruction with a double bundle autograft using the ST tendon (7 patients) and the ST + the gracilis (G) tendons (13 patients). “Inducer grafting” technique After harvesting the ST tendon, a passing pin with a loop thread is inserted along with the tendon stripper. The passing pin is pulled out from the medial thigh and the loop <b>thread</b> <b>retained.</b> As an inducer graft, the ST tendon branch is used. After the ACL graft has been secured, the inducer graft is sutured to the pes anserinus and the proximal end passed through by pulling the thread out. Then the inducer graft is placed within the tendon canal. The mean follow-up period was 15 [*]months. The presence and morphology of the regenerated ST tendon were examined by MRI. And the isometric hamstring strength was examined at 45 °, 90 ° and 120 ° of knee flexion. Results One month after the operation in all the patients, MRI demonstrated a low-intensity structure at the anatomical location of the ST, {{at the level of the}} superior pole of the patella and the joint line, apparently representing the regenerated ST tendon. Four months after the operation, the distal portion of the regenerated ST tendon had reached the pes anserinus in all patients. Twelve months after the operation, the regenerated ST tendon was hypertrophic in 19 of the 20 patients (95 %). The isometric knee flexion torque of the ACL-reconstructed limb was significantly lower at 90 ° and 120 ° compared with the contralateral limb. Conclusion These results suggest that the “inducer grafting” technique is able to improve the regeneration rate of the harvested ST tendon and promote hypertrophy of the regenerated ST tendon, extending all the way to the pes anserinus. However, this technique couldn’t improve the deficits in knee flexion torque after ACL reconstruction. </p...|$|R
