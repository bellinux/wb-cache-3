5|$|The {{telescope}} possibly detected {{signals from}} Venera 1, a Russian satellite {{en route to}} Venus, in 19–20 May 1961. However, {{it was not possible}} to confirm the origin of the signals. A few years later, in December 1962, the telescope tracked and <b>received</b> <b>data</b> from Mariner 2. On 18 October 1967, the telescope received signals from, and tracked, Venera 4, a Russian probe to Venus.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also <b>received</b> <b>data</b> from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles (12.9 million km) away. It also <b>received</b> <b>data</b> from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 The last signal was picked up from the probe at a distance of 36.2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960.|$|E

25|$|Congress {{had passed}} the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986, which {{addressed}} issues raised {{as more and more}} companies stored records with highly personal data about individual consumers in off-site databases operated by third parties. A key section, known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA), distinguished between electronic communications services which actively transmitted and <b>received</b> <b>data</b> and remote communications services whose only role was to archive and backup transmitted data for at least some period of time. The former could release transmitted data only to its sender or recipient; the latter could also release that information to the subscriber regardless of who had sent or received it.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{this the}} ICC <b>received</b> <b>data</b> from {{laboratory}} based analyses, {{on the basis that}} these measurement environments are more controlled, involving more sophisticated measurement technologies such as the Vicon Motion Analysis system. These were subject to less measurement error. Data was provided by the Australian Institute of Sport, the University of Western Australia and the Motion Analysis Corporation system from the University of Auckland. The ICC also carried out further video based three-dimensional analyses on all bowlers during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England. Regardless of the biomechanical measurement protocol used, a strikingly similar pattern emerged: the normal biomechanics of cricket bowling, whether it be spin or pace, features an element of elbow extension. The average extension of a normal, seemingly legal delivery was 8-10 degrees for all bowler types. There were virtually zero instances of no elbow extension at all in accordance with the original laws.|$|E

500|$|Within a weak {{steering}} environment {{between a}} mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and a mid-level ridge over the northern Caribbean Sea, Nate drifted slowly southwestward initially. Though {{an abundance of}} dry air was expected to limit a rapid rate of intensification, warm sea surface temperatures and light to moderate wind shear allowed for gradual strengthening. Operationally, the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994mb (29.35inHg) on September8. However, {{as part of its}} post-season routine, the NHC <b>received</b> <b>data</b> from an offshore oil rig in the southeastern quadrant of the system that yielded maximum sustained surface winds of as a result, Nate was re-designated as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale while centered approximately 80mi (130km) north-northwest of Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Following peak intensity, the storm's broad wind field and slow forward motion led to significant ocean upwelling. With cooler sea surface temperatures and low ocean heat content, the coverage of deep convection decreased and Nate weakened to a tropical storm at 0600UTC on September9.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reception}} quality {{during the early}} stage of deployment of DAB was poor even for people who live well within the coverage area. The {{reason for this is}} that the old version of DAB uses weak error correction coding, so that when there are a lot of errors with the <b>received</b> <b>data</b> not enough of the errors can be corrected and a [...] "bubbling mud" [...] sound occurs. In some cases a complete loss of signal can happen. This situation has been improved upon in the new DAB standard (DAB+, discussed below) that uses stronger error correction coding and as additional transmitters are built.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{clock is}} sent in {{parallel}} with data, that clock {{can be used to}} sample the data. [...] Because the clock must be received and amplified before it can drive the flip-flops which sample the data, there will be a finite, and process-, temperature-, and voltage-dependent delay between the detected clock edge and the <b>received</b> <b>data</b> window. [...] This delay limits the frequency at which data can be sent. [...] One way of eliminating this delay is to include a deskew PLL on the receive side, so that the clock at each data flip-flop is phase-matched to the received clock. In that type of application, a special form of a PLL called a delay-locked loop (DLL) is frequently used.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{traditional}} socket interface to TCP/IP {{communication with the}} ability to seek rather than simply <b>receive</b> <b>data</b> in order. Seeking on a TCP socket allows a user program to <b>receive</b> <b>data</b> without first <b>receiving</b> all previous <b>data</b> on the connection. Through repeated use of seeking, a messaging application or library can treat a TCP socket as a list of messages with the potential to <b>receive</b> and remove <b>data</b> from any arbitrary point rather than simply the head of the socket buffer. Seeking facilitates copyavoidance between a messaging library and user code by eliminating the need to first copy unwanted data into a library buffer before <b>receiving</b> desired <b>data</b> that appears later in the socket buffer. The seekable sockets interface is implemented in the Linux 2. 6. 13 kernel. Experimental results are gathered using a simple microbenchmark that <b>receives</b> <b>data</b> out-oforder from a given socket, yielding up to a 40 % reduction in processing time. The code for seekable sockets is now available for patching into existing Linux kernels and for further development into messaging libraries. ...|$|R
