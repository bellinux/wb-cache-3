5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> on the wealthiest 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated {{that the budget}} be balanced {{over a number of}} years through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|E
5|$|Clayton used various {{tactics to}} pay for the needed {{infrastructure}} changes in the state. Most of the South was in desperate need of infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in this respect. He <b>raised</b> <b>taxes,</b> tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and flooded the state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and drove up the state debt.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War was ongoing during Robinson's administration. During Robinson's tenure, the Confederacy {{made its}} major advance into the Commonwealth. In {{an attempt to}} protect the {{citizens}} of the Commonwealth, Robinson <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> in an effort to revive Kentucky's state militia. He was also concerned with the effect the war had on public education in the state. He asked the General Assembly to investigate the condition of state schools, especially in war-ravaged areas, and encouraged them to accept the Lincoln administration's offer of land to establish an agricultural and mechanical college.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, Clements succeeded Willis as governor, {{defeating}} Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's preferred candidate, in the Democratic primary. As governor, Clements <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> {{and used}} the revenue to increase funding for the state park system and construct and maintain more roads. He also achieved advancements in education, including some progress toward desegregation. In 1950, Clements {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. He resigned as governor to accept his Senate seat. While in the Senate, he served as Democratic party whip under party leader Lyndon Johnson and {{as executive director of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee from 1957 to 1959. He was defeated by Thruston Morton in his re-election bid in 1956; a lack of support from Chandler (then serving his second term as governor) contributed to Clements' defeat. At Johnson's insistence, Clements resumed chairing the Senate Democratic Reelection Committee in 1957 and 1959.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and <b>raised</b> <b>taxes,</b> in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and <b>raised</b> <b>taxes.</b> The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies {{and set up a}} power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E

25|$|As Patriarch Cyril {{had three}} priorities: the {{recovery}} of the patriarchal finances, the fight against Catholic positions and the instruction of the monks. To improve the finances he <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> on the metropolitan bishops and relieved the little parishes: this action was quite successful but made him unpopular among the bishops. He strongly supported the need to re-baptise all converts, and especially women, because he considered the Armenian and Catholic baptisms as not valid. These positions created discontent among the metropolitans, who deposed him in May 1751 and reinstalled the moderate Paisius II in his place. Cyril retired on island of Halki, near Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|His {{first elected}} office was {{president}} of the New Castle County Council, elected in 2000 and serving four years before being elected county executive in 2004. He was the endorsed candidate of the New Castle County Democratic Party in 2008, and was re-nominated by the party on September 9, 2008. Coons was re-elected on November 4, 2008, unopposed in the general election. In his six years in office as county executive, Coons balanced the budget with a surplus in fiscal year 2010 by cutting spending and raising taxes. As New Castle county executive, Coons <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> despite having campaigned on a promise not to increase them. New Castle County maintained a AAA bond rating throughout his tenure.|$|E
25|$|Instead of ratifying {{the peace}} treaty, the Commonwealth Sejm, {{with most of}} the deputies finally united by anger due to the {{territorial}} losses and the demeaning tribute (which could in fact be seen as reducing the Commonwealth to Ottomans' vassal) finally <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> for a new army (of about 37,000 strong was raised) and increased the Cossack register to 40,000. Hetman John Sobieski led a military campaign against the Ottomans and dealt several defeats to the Ottomans; of which the battle of Khotyn was the largest; next he took control of the Moldavia territory and most of disputed Ukrainian lands. That year king Michael I of Poland died, and in recognition of his victories and dedication, John Sobieski was elected King of the Commonwealth in 1674.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{the monarch}} of Silla was Queen Jinseong (Gung Ye's half sister), {{who was the}} third and the last female head of state in Korean history (the other two being: Queen Seondeok of Silla and Jindeok of Silla). Queen Jinseong was a {{powerless}} ruler and the government was largely corrupted by interventions of royal family members and rampant bribery {{among members of the}} royal court. The corrupt government continuously exploited the peasants and farmers, and after a year of famine, massively <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> in 889 which led to many revolts and rebellions. Local aristocrats, called hojok (hangul:호족, hanja:豪族) emerged as de facto rulers of many provinces, with the attention of government concentrated on suppression of rebellion and their own power struggles. Among the rebel leaders and local aristocrats, Gi Hwon and Yang Gil gained the most power.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} rural Massachusetts {{suffered}} an economic depression {{after the war}} ended. Merchants, pressured for hard currency by overseas partners, made similar demands on local debtors, and the state <b>raised</b> <b>taxes</b> {{in order to pay}} off its own war debts. Efforts to collect both public and private debts from cash-poor farmers led to protests that flared into direct action in August 1786. Rebels calling themselves Regulators (after the North Carolina Regulator movement of the 1760s) succeeded in shutting down courts meeting to hear debt and tax collection cases. By the end of 1786 a farmer in western Massachusetts named Daniel Shays {{emerged as one of the}} ringleaders, and government attempts to squelch the protests only served to radicalize the protestors. In January 1787 Shays and Luke Day organized an attempt to take the federal Springfield Armory; state militia holding the armory beat back the attempt with cannon fire. A private militia raised by wealthy Boston merchants and led by General Benjamin Lincoln broke the back of the rebellion in early February at Petersham, but small-scale resistance continued in the western parts of the state for a while.|$|E
25|$|Revolts against Muhammad bin Tughlaq {{began in}} 1327, {{continued}} over his reign, {{and over time}} the geographical reach of the Sultanate shrunk. The Vijayanagara Empire originated in southern India as a direct response to attacks from the Delhi Sultanate., and liberated south India from the Delhi Sultanate's rule. In 1337, Muhammad bin Tughlaq ordered an attack on China, sending part of his forces over the Himalayas. Few survived the journey, and they were executed upon their return for failing. During his reign, state revenues collapsed from his policies such as the base metal coins from 1329-1332. To cover state expenses, he sharply <b>raised</b> <b>taxes.</b> Those who failed to pay taxes were hunted and executed. Famines, widespread poverty, and rebellion grew across the kingdom. In 1338 his own nephew rebelled in Malwa, whom he attacked, caught, and flayed alive. By 1339, the eastern regions under local Muslim governors and southern parts led by Hindu kings had revolted and declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate. Muhammad bin Tughlaq {{did not have the}} resources or support to respond to the shrinking kingdom. The historian Walford chronicled Delhi and most of India faced severe famines during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule in the years after the base metal coin experiment. By 1347, the Bahmani Sultanate had become an independent and competing Muslim kingdom in Deccan region of South Asia.|$|E
