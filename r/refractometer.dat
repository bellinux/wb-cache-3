It is recommended that newborn calves receive at least 4 quarts (liters) of colostrum with each containing at least 50 grams of IgG/liter.

25|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and {{the volume of}} titrant used to reach the endpoint {{is used to calculate}} the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held <b>refractometer</b> is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The <b>refractometer</b> allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{handheld}} <b>refractometers</b> {{are generally}} more precise than traditional handheld <b>refractometers,</b> but less precise than most benchtop <b>refractometers.</b> They also may require a slightly larger amount of sample to read from since the sample is not spread thinly against the prism.|$|R

25|$|The {{refractive}} index (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) of turquoise is approximately 1.61 or 1.62; {{this is a}} mean value seen as a single reading on a gemmological <b>refractometer,</b> owing to the almost invariably polycrystalline nature of turquoise. A reading of 1.61–1.65 (birefringence 0.040, biaxial positive) has been taken from rare single crystals. An absorption spectrum may also be obtained with a hand-held spectroscope, revealing a line at 432nm and a weak band at 460nm (this is best seen with strong reflected light). Under longwave ultraviolet light, turquoise may occasionally fluoresce green, yellow or bright blue; it is inert under shortwave ultraviolet and X-rays.|$|E
25|$|The effect honey has {{on light}} {{is useful for}} {{determining}} the type and quality. Variations in the water content alter the refractive index of honey. Water content can easily be measured with a <b>refractometer.</b> Typically, the refractive index for honey ranges from 1.504 at 13% water content to 1.474 at 25%. Honey also {{has an effect on}} polarized light, in that it rotates the polarization plane. The fructose gives a negative rotation, while the glucose gives a positive one. The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture. Honey may vary in color between pale yellow and dark brown, but other bright colors may occasionally be found, depending on the source of the sugar harvested by the bees.|$|E

2500|$|The Brix degrees are {{measured}} using an infrared sensor. This measurement does not equate to Brix degrees from a density or refractive index measurement, {{because it will}} specifically measure dissolved sugar concentration instead of all dissolved solids. When using a <b>refractometer,</b> one should report the result as [...] "refractometric dried substance" [...] (RDS). One might speak of a liquid as having 20 °Bx RDS. This refers to a measure of percent by weight of total dried solids and, although not technically the same as Brix degrees determined through an infrared method, renders an accurate measurement of sucrose content, since sucrose in fact forms the majority of dried solids. The advent of in-line infrared Brix measurement sensors has made measuring the amount of dissolved sugar in products economical using a direct measurement.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{more than}} 90% {{of all the}} {{dissolved}} solids in grape juice are sugars, measuring the must weight is a good indicator {{of the amount of}} sugars in the wine. Rather than measure the actual [...] "weight" [...] of the must, the density or specific gravity of the juice is measured in relation to the specific gravity of distilled water. Viticulturists and winemakers can use a <b>refractometer</b> which uses a refractive index to indirectly measure the must weight from the juice of a single grape or they can use a hydrometer in the winery with the juice from several dozen or hundreds of grape berries. Different countries around the world use various scales to measure the must weight of grape juice. In the United States, New Zealand, and parts of Australia it is measured in degrees brix (symbol °Bx); in Germany (wine) it is degrees Oechsle (°Oe); in France and most of Europe the Baumé scale is used and in Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (°KMW) scale is used.|$|E
2500|$|Diamonds {{are usually}} cut into brilliants {{to bring out}} their {{brilliance}} (the amount of light reflected back to the viewer) and fire (the degree to which colorful prismatic flashes are seen). Both properties are strongly affected by the cut of the stone, {{but they are a}} function of diamond's high refractive index (RI—the degree to which incident light is bent upon entering the stone) of 2.417 (as measured by sodium light, 589.3nm) and high dispersion (the degree to which white light is split into its spectral colors as it passes through the stone) of 0.044, as measured by the sodium B and G line interval. Thus, if a diamond simulant's RI and dispersion are too low, it will appear comparatively dull or [...] "lifeless"; if the RI and dispersion are too high, the effect will be considered unreal or even tacky. Very few simulants have closely approximating RI and dispersion, and even the close simulants can be separated by an experienced observer. Direct measurements of RI and dispersion are impractical (a standard gemological <b>refractometer</b> has an upper limit of about RI 1.81), but several companies have devised reflectivity meters to gauge a material's RI indirectly by measuring how well it reflects an infrared beam.|$|E

2500|$|The SSP {{contained}} {{a number of}} sensors designed to determine the physical properties of Titan's surface {{at the point of}} impact, whether the surface was solid or liquid. An acoustic sounder, activated during the last 100 meters of the descent, continuously determined the distance to the surface, measuring the rate of descent and the surface roughness (e.g., due to waves). The instrument was designed so that if the surface were liquid, the sounder would measure the speed of sound in the [...] "ocean" [...] and possibly also the subsurface structure (depth). During descent, measurements of the speed of sound gave information on atmospheric composition and temperature, and an accelerometer recorded the deceleration profile at impact, indicating the hardness and structure of the surface. A tilt sensor measured pendulum motion during the descent and was also designed to indicate the probe's attitude after landing and show any motion due to waves. If the surface had been liquid, other sensors would also have measured its density, temperature, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) and refractive index (using a critical angle <b>refractometer).</b> [...] A penetrometer instrument, that protruded 55mm past the bottom of the Huygens descent module, was used to create a penetrometer trace as Huygens landed on the surface by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the surface as the instrument broke though the surface and was pushed down into the planet by the force of the probe landing itself. [...] The trace shows this force as a function of time over a period of about 400 ms. [...] The trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles [...] on the surface photographed by the DISR camera.|$|E
