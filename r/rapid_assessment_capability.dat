40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} methods for performing biological dosimetry are {{of paramount importance}} {{in the event of}} a large-scale nuclear event. Traditional dosimetry approaches lack the requisite <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>capability,</b> ease of use, portability and low cost, which are factors needed for triaging a large number of victims. Here we describe the results of experiments in which mice were acutely exposed to (60) Co gamma rays at doses of 0 (control) to 10 Gy. Blood was obtained from irradiated mice 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after exposure. mRNA expression levels of 106 selected genes were obtained by reverse-transcription real time PCR. Stepwise regression of dose received against individual gene transcript expression levels provided optimal dosimetry at each time point. The results indicate that only 4 - 7 different gene transcripts are needed to explain ≥ 0. 69 of the variance (R(2)), and that receiver-operator characteristics, a measure of sensitivity and specificity, of ≥ 0. 93 for these statistical models were achieved at each time point. These models provide an excellent description of the relationship between the actual and predicted doses up to 6 Gy. At doses of 8 and 10 Gy there appears to be saturation of the radiation-response signals with a corresponding diminution of accuracy. These results suggest that similar analyses in humans may be advantageous for use in a field-portable device designed to assess exposures in mass casualty situations...|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-platform}} inter-disciplinary {{observation network}} {{has been operating}} at the Rutgers University Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO) since 1996, with real-time capabilities beginning in July 1999. The network integrates numerous remote (satellites and shore- based), stationary (surface and subsurface), moveable (ships and AUVs) observation systems. The observation network provides spatially extensive updates of the physics, optics, chemistry and biology on time scales of an hour or less which are communicated in real-time to shipboard scientists and AUV operators. This <b>rapid</b> environmental <b>assessment</b> <b>capability</b> is already changing current paradigms for ocean adaptive sampling strategies. For example, in the well-sampled ocean, where forecast errors are dominated by uncertainties in the model physics or future boundary conditions rather than initial conditions, ensemble forecasts with differing model parameterizations {{can be used to}} identify regions in which additional data can be used to keep a model on track. Furthermore these approaches are key for sampling episodic events that play a disproportionately large role in driving the biogeochemistry of the coastal ocean. Results from the 1999 and 2000 seasons demonstrate the usefulness of the LEO network to identify, track and sample small-scale (10 m) features that would otherwise go unnoticed with traditional sampling approaches. For example, during HyCODE 2000, real-time data from physical survey vessels identified offshore convergence features. These observations combined with the surface current CODAR measurements were used to adjust and successfully maneuver other ships that were outfitted with bio-optical instrumentation. Bioluminescent Ceratium fusus, a red-tide dinoflagellate, were observed in the convergence zone. The covergence zone resulted from material collecting against a southward flowing alongshore jet of low saline water and tidally driven onshore flow of offshore waters. The feature was dramatically impacted by tidal forcing with convergence at high tide and dispersion at low tide...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of observations on eye worm and Calabar swellings for the <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis at the community level. METHOD: A total of 12 895 individuals {{over the age of}} 15 years living in 102 communities in Cameroon and Nigeria took part in the study. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants from whom finger-prick blood samples were collected and examined for Loa loa microfilariae. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessments</b> of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis were {{made on the basis of}} a history of eye worm or Calabar swellings. FINDINGS: There was a strong correlation between the indices of the <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> procedures and the parasitological indices of L. loa endemicity. The <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> indices were effective in diagnosing high-risk communities (sensitivity 94 - 100 %; specificity 66 - 92 %). The highest sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (92 %) were obtained with a <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> procedure based on a history of eye worm lasting 1 - 7 days together with confirmation by the guided recognition of a photograph of adult L. loa in the eye.

40|$|<b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> ” {{methods have}} the {{potential}} to generate important public health information that can be used with monitoring, surveillance and other available data systems to develop intervention programmes. That potential is now the subject of discussion within the field of substance use. First emerging in the early 1990 s, the last three years have seen the approach endorsed as an expedient method for profiling drug-related problems, mobilizing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention efforts, initiating policy change and service reorientation and, more recently, as a potential component of “second-generation ” surveillance. In the pres-ent article, the authors consider the role of <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> in generating knowledge for public health action and, more specifically, the relationship between rapid approaches and the cornerstone of public health science, epidemiology. Drawing on case studies and examples, the authors propose that <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> is best under-stood not as a new method, but as a practical convergence of existing research and intervention traditions (including field epidemiology and anthropology). Six roles for <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> in either informing or complementing drug use epidemiology are outlined: (a) in information poor situations; (b) as a means of informing ongoing monitoring; (c) optimizing community involvement; (d) informing quantitative research; (e) questioning quantitative research; and (f) as a tool for responding to emerging health problems...|$|R
40|$|Extract] When {{financial}} {{and human resources}} are limited, policy makers and health care providers need cost effective and simple indicators for health problems. The so-called <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> method {{is a way to}} investigate situations in which some issues are not yet well defined and where sufficient time or resources for long-term assessments are not given. In case of infectious and parasitic diseases, these simple indicators (such as asking a patient if he/she considers being infected, or simple clinical assessments) are commonly used to plan and monitor mass interventions. Additionally, <b>rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> also helps to detect parasitised individuals, and to plan individual treatment. <b>Rapid</b> <b>assessment</b> methods have been developed for a variety of diseases and health conditions, and thus have a great value in resource-poor as well as in high income settings [1 - 4].
