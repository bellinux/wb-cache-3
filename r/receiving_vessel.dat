6000|$|In the hospital, and that, too, at a {{place like}} Pensacola there was little {{opportunity}} for me to break out into my old excesses; though I found liquor, {{on one or two}} occasions, even there, and got myself into some disgrace in consequence. On the whole, however, the discipline, my situation, and my own resolution, kept me tolerably correct. It is the restraint of a ship that alone prevents sailors from dying much sooner than they do; for it is certain no man could hold out long who passed three or four months every year in the sort of indulgencies into which I myself have often run, after returning from long voyages. This is one advantage of the navy; two or three days of riotous living being all a fellow can very well get in a three years' cruise. Any man who has ever been in a vessel of war, particularly in old times, can see the effect produced by the system, and regular living of a ship. When the crew first came on board, the men were listless, almost lifeless, with recent dissipation; some suffering with the [...] "horrors," [...] perhaps; but a few weeks of regular living would bring them all round; and, {{by the end of the}} cruise, most of the people would come into port, and be paid off, with renovated constitutions. It is a little different, now, to be sure, as the men ship for general service, and commonly serve a short apprenticeship in a <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel,</b> before they are turned over to the sea-going craft. This brings them on board the last in a little better condition than used to be the case; but, even now, six months in a man-of-war is a new lease for a seaman's life.|$|E

50|$|Freezing a {{water-based}} solution converts all {{bulk water}} into ice crystals, but water associated with solutes—in {{the case of}} a soup stock, gelatin, fat, and flavor compounds—remains unfrozen to much lower temperatures; in practice, the freezing temperature of this associated water is well below the reach of conventional freezers. Thus, gelatin filtration works by freezing a gelatin-containing, water-based solution and then allowing it to thaw in a mesh strainer at just above the freezing temperature of water. The gelatin and other solutes concentrate in the unfrozen, associated water, and the gelatin forms a stable network through cross-linking, just as it would in a standard gel. This stable network acts as a filter, trapping large particles of fat or protein, while allowing water and smaller, flavor-active compounds to pass. As the bulk water melts, it passes first through the gelatin network and then through the mesh strainer, into a <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b> Because the temperature is kept just above the freezing point, the bulk water melts slowly and, as it is strained into a separate vessel, it is never in contact with the gelatin for long enough to begin dissolving the gelatin network. After all of the bulk water melts, the gelatin network remains in the strainer with the trapped macroscopic particles, and the clarified stock (the bulk water and flavor compounds) is collected in the <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

50|$|In home or {{restaurant}} cooking, a ball {{of wheat}} flour dough is kneaded under water until the starch disperses out. In industrial production, a slurry of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass. This mass is collected by centrifugation, then transported through several stages integrated in a continuous process. About 65% {{of the water in}} the wet gluten is removed by means of a screw press; the remainder is sprayed through an atomizer nozzle into a drying chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature a short time to evaporate the water without denaturing the gluten. The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is air cooled and pneumatically transported to a <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b> In the final step, the processed gluten is sifted and milled to produce a uniform product.|$|E

Nodules <b>receiving</b> <b>vessels</b> from salivary glands were assumed to be intraglandular; those accepting vessels from paraparotid spaces were considered to arise from outside the gland. Imaging results were correlated with biopsy and surgical findings. In 38 of 40 cases, color and power Doppler sonography displayed discrete feeding arteries leading to the nodules: 25 nodules had one supplying artery, nine received two arteries, and four had three or more arteries. Intraparotid nodules <b>received</b> <b>vessels</b> from the gland in 20 cases. In two cases, the source of vessels was indeterminate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the time to washout of radiographic contrast medium trapped distal to an occluded collateral <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> is inversely related to collateral flow, and that this provides an accurate method for characterising coronary collaterals.  METHODS—An intracoronary pressure derived collateral flow index was determined in 54  patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). The study group was subdivided according to whether the collateral vessels were sufficient (n =  17) or insufficient (n =  37) to prevent ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia during PTCA. Washout collaterometry—an angiographic washout method—was carried out simultaneously; after injection of radiographic contrast medium into the collateral <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> followed immediately by vascular occlusion, the number of heart beats was counted until approximately half the length of the epicardial vessel was cleared of contrast.  RESULTS—The collateral flow index was higher (0. 28  (0. 09) v 0. 12  (0. 07); p <  0. 0001) and the contrast washout time shorter (8. 0  (2. 9) v 17. 5  (6. 7) heart beats; p <  0. 0001) in patients with sufficient versus insufficient collaterals. There was an inverse correlation between contrast washout time and collateral flow index (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 0001). Washout of contrast distal to the occluded vessel within 11  heart beats correctly determined sufficient and insufficient collaterals with 88 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity.  CONCLUSIONS—Washout collaterometry is a new radiographic contrast washout method based on the inverse relation between collateral flow and the time to clearance of radiographic dye injected into the ipsilateral vessel during PTCA. It appears to be an accurate method of characterising coronary collateral vessels.    Keywords: coronary artery disease; collateral circulation; coronary angiograph...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} century, the Earth has {{increased}} in temperature by about 5 °C and {{this is because of}} an increase in concentration of the main greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide. Therefore, a modification of gas phase of adsorption-absorption process was used. In the recent research, this technique was established by using a single adsorbent. To compare the effect of changing the gas removal techniques and to study the performance on the CO gas removal from different adsorbent, Gas Absorption Adsorption Unit was used with granular activated carbon and zeolites as the adsorbents. For this purpose, purified CO 2 was used. This study was conducted using various gas flow rate (100, 75 and 50 m 2 3 /hr) and water flow rate (250 and 200 L/hr). The experiment had been run twice at different condition; with present and absent of zeolites. At the end of the study, it was observed that increasing of gas flow rate reduce the composition of CO dissolved in the water. On the other hand, increasing the water flow rate will increase the composition of CO 2 dissolved in the water solution. Beside that, higher gas flow rate increases the efficiency of the process. Increasing of water flow rate will increase the CO 2 2 composition dissolved even greater rather than increasing gas flow rate. The CO composition dissolved in water is decrease with the present of zeolites. This shows that by having zeolites, it helps to decrease the rate of absorption of C 02 2.

40|$|Management Plan was {{prepared}} by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and is intended to improve management of the scup commercial fishery, pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA) in 1996. The commercial fishery for scup is managed under a system that allocates quota to three periods: Winter I: January-April (45. 11 %), Summer: May- October (38. 95 %), and Winter II: November-December (15. 94 %). During the winter periods, a coastwide quota and possession limits are in effect. This document considers alternatives {{that could result in}} no action (Alternative 1) or allow for the transfer at sea of scup between vessels (Alternative 2 - Preferred Alternative). The Council intends that the transfer of scup at sea would occur only under safe weather and sea conditions. Under the transfer at sea alternative, any amount of scup less than the possession limit could be transferred between two vessels given the following conditions:- transfers could only occur between vessels with Federal scup permits- transfer could only occur seaward of a boundary line that is roughly 20 nm from shore (see Figure 1) - the donating and receiving vessels must possess gear which is Federally approved for scup harvest- transfers would occur in the Winter I or Winter II period- only one transfer would be allowed per fishing trip for the donor vessel- the transfer would include the entire codend- only scup and its normal bycatch could be transferred- only scup could be retained by the receiving vessel- the donating and <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel</b> would report the transfer amount on the vessel trip report for each vesse...|$|E
40|$|A novel way {{of cooking}} rice to {{maximize}} {{the removal of the}} carcinogen inorganic arsenic (Asi) is presented here. In conventional rice cooking water and grain are in continuous contact, and it is known that the larger the water:rice cooking ratio, the more Asi removed by cooking, suggesting that the Asi in the grain is mobile in water. Experiments were designed where rice is cooked in a continual stream of percolating near boiling water, either low in Asi, or Asi free. This has the advantage of not only exposing grain to large volumes of cooking water, but also physically removes any Asi leached from the grain into the water <b>receiving</b> <b>vessel.</b> The relationship between cooking water volume and Asi removal in conventional rice cooking was demonstrated for the rice types under study. At a water-to-rice cooking ratio of 12 : 1, 57 ± 5 % of Asi could be removed, average of 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples. Two types of percolating technology were tested, one where the cooking water was recycled through condensing boiling water steam and passing the freshly distilled hot water through the grain in a laboratory setting, and one where tap water was used to cook the rice held in an off-the-shelf coffee percolator in a domestic setting. Both approaches proved highly effective in removing Asi from the cooking rice, with up to 85 % of Asi removed from individual rice types. For the recycled water experiment 59 ± 8 % and 69 ± 10 % of Asi was removed, on average, compared to uncooked rice for polished (n= 27) and wholegrain (n= 13) rice, respectively. For coffee percolation {{there was no difference between}} wholegrain and polished rice, and the effectiveness of Asi removal was 49 ± 7 % across 6 wholegrain and 6 polished rice samples.
