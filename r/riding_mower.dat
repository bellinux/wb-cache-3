50|$|A zero-turn riding {{lawn mower}} (colloquially, a z-turn) is a {{standard}} riding lawn mower with a turning radius that is effectively zero. Different brands and models achieve this in different ways, but hydraulic speed control of each drive wheel {{is the most common}} method. Both commercial duty and homeowner models exist, with varying engine power options, size of cutting decks, fuel type (gasoline or diesel), and prices. A z-turn mower typically drives faster and costs more than a similarly sized conventional <b>riding</b> <b>mower</b> that has steerable front wheels.|$|E

50|$|Around 1900, one of {{the best}} known English {{machines}} was the Ransomes' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models. Numerous manufacturers entered the field with petrol (gasoline) engine-powered mowers after the start of the 20th century. The first was produced by Ransomes in 1902. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, produced a range of very popular chain-driven mowers. About this time, an operator could ride behind animals that pulled the large machines. These were the first <b>riding</b> <b>mowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Riding</b> <b>mowers</b> (U.S. and Canada) or ride-on mowers (U.K. and Canada) are {{a popular}} {{alternative}} for large lawns. The operator {{is provided with}} a seat and controls on the <b>mower</b> and literally <b>rides</b> on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of ride-on mower is the lawn tractor. These are usually designed to resemble a small agricultural tractor, with the cutting deck mounted amidships between {{the front and rear}} axles.|$|R

50|$|Rotary mowers {{can throw}} out debris with extreme {{velocity}} and energy. Additionally, the blades of a self-powered push mower (gasoline or electric) can injure a careless or inattentive user; as such, many come {{equipped with a}} dead man's switch to immediately disable the blade rotation when the user is no longer holding the handle. In the United States, over 12,000 people per year are hospitalized {{as a result of}} lawn mower accidents. The vast majority of these injuries can be prevented by wearing protective footwear when mowing. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children be at least 12 years old before they are allowed to use a walk-behind lawn mower and at least 16 years of age before using a <b>riding</b> <b>mower.</b> They also should demonstrate proper judgment and maturity. Persons using a mower should wear heavy footwear, eye protection, and hearing protection in the case of engine-powered mowers.|$|E

Don and Joan share kind words at the hospital, as the Putnam, Powell and Lowe executives mourn over the young Guy MacKendrick's career, lamenting that the boy could no longer work clients with a missing foot; as a result Lane retains his position at Sterling Cooper. Don is aghast at how quickly the executives disregard Guy's career.|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} {{purchased}} the Johnston Lawn Mower Company of Ottumwa, Iowa, and used this division {{to enter the}} residential mower market, offering reel-type and rotary-type mowers for this market in the 1950s. The Javelin <b>riding</b> <b>mower</b> came {{out at the end}} of the 1950s, and the Jacobsen Chief garden tractor was launched in 1961 with the 100A which was electric start with 7hp Kohler K161 and the 100B which was rope start with 7hp Kohler K161.In the 1965 Ford entered the garden tractor market with their two models, T-800 powered by an 8hp Kohler K181 and the T-1000 powered by a 10hp Kohler K241. In 1966, Jacobsen Chief Tractors started using a Peerless 2300 and steering was improved as well as a style change. Jacobsen made tractors for Oliver, Ford, Minneapolis-Moline, and White.Jacobsen also made light tractors aimed at the farm market, with innovative attachments to make the tractors more useful and to make them qualify for tax breaks.Textron purchased Jacobsen around 1975, but continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.|$|E

In the episode [...] "King of the Ant Hill" [...] with Cinco de Mayo approaching, Hank purchases an exorbitant new lawn of Raleigh St. Augustine sod for $1.25 per square foot, which Dale destroys with fire ants as an act of revenge to Hank for terminating his exterminating services. Just as Hank is about to beat him up, Dale redeems himself by saving Bobby from the fire ants, who attacked him for confining them. His friends and neighbors gifted him with a few square feet of new Raleigh, albeit only enough to cover a small fraction of his front yard. When he converted his back yard into a putting green, he installed kikuyu grass. In only one episode did Hank purposely allow his lawn to die; when water restrictions and a drought forced Hank to run for public office on a platform opposing the city water policy which wasted more water than it saved. He later discovered Kahn was bribing the water department employee to keep his lawn green and Bobby blackmailed him to keep Hank's lawn from dying. Refusing to be corrupt, he ceased watering.

40|$|Every year, twenty-two {{million workers}} {{are exposed to}} {{potentially}} damaging noise at work. Last year, U. S. businesses paid more than 1. 5 million in penalties for not protecting workers from noise. (OSHA, 2016). In the United States ten million people {{have some kind of}} noise related hearing loss (CDC, 2016) and noise damage to the ear may not be detected until it is great enough to cause hearing impairment. Grounds keeper’s functions consist of a variety of activities that require the use of powered tools such as mowers, riding mowers, leaf blowers, pressure washers, trimmers/edgers and chainsaws. OSHA has stated that “noise is a potential hazard for most jobs that involve abrasive or high-power machinery, impact of rapidly moving parts (product or machinery), or power tools”. (OSHA, 2016) in addition to this, their job is mostly outdoors exposing them to the added noise of traffic, construction and people. The purpose of this research study was to obtain occupational noise exposure data for groundskeepers who use powered equipment to do their job. The groundskeepers who participated in this research study were volunteers and worked in a University campus in the State of Florida. Personal noise dosimeters were used to collect the data in this study. Exposure information was collected over 6 days for 8 -hour work shifts during the summer months of the year. Dosimetry was done on a maximum of five groundskeepers per monitoring day, ranging from 1 to 5 employees per day depending on availability. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the highest noise exposures occurred on groundskeepers in charge of mowing by means of a <b>riding</b> <b>mower.</b> Results of this study indicate that the highest 8 -hr TWA noise exposure for the groundskeepers (GK) 1 and 2 occurred the first day of testing which was a Monday. Using the OSHA PEL measurement method GK 1 exposure was 98. 5 dBA, GK 2 was 97. 6 dBA. Using the same measurement method the highest exposure to GK 3 : 89. 2 dBA, occurred on day five of the assessment. For GK 4 the highest exposure occurred on the third day of testing with an exposure measurement of 86. 1 dBA. GK 5 was only assessed one day and his exposure measured at 84. 5 dBA. GK 6 AND GK 7 were evaluated two days and their highest exposures measured at GK 6 : 89. 3 dBA and GK 7 : 85. 7 dBA. Using the OSHA Hearing Conversation Act measurement method, GK 1 was exposed to excessive noise levels (3 ̆e 85 dBA as an 8 -hr TWA) on five days of the six day assessment period. GK 2 was exposed to hazardous noise levels on all four days he was assessed. GK 3 and GK 4 exceeded the OSHA HCA standard one of the two days they were monitored. GK 5 did not have noise exposure levels above 85 dBA on the day he volunteered for monitoring. GK 6 had exposures over 85 dBA on both days he volunteered to be monitored. Finally, GK 7 exceeded the 85 dBA limit on one of the two days they volunteered for this study...|$|E
50|$|Garden {{tractors}} (mini tractors) are small, light tractors {{designed for}} use in domestic gardens and small estates. Garden tractors are designed for cutting grass, snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term <b>riding</b> lawn <b>mower</b> today often is {{used to refer to}} mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called lawn tractors; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are garden tractors. Garden tractors are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined <b>riding</b> <b>mowers,</b> garden tractors are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a belt-drive to transaxle-type transmissions (usually of four- or five-speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or hydraulic drives). Garden tractors from Wheel Horse, Cub Cadet, Economy (Power King), John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case Ingersoll are built in this manner. The engines are generally a one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although diesel engine models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered garden tractors are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.|$|R
