25|$|In laboratories, a slurry of dry ice in {{an organic}} solvent {{is a useful}} {{freezing}} mixture for cold chemical reactions and for condensing solvents in <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators.</b> Dry ice/acetone forms a cold bath of −78°C, {{which can be used}} for instance to prevent thermal runaway in a Swern oxidation.|$|R
2500|$|A Dimroth condenser, {{named after}} Otto Dimroth, is {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} [...] "coil condenser"; it has an internal double spiral through which coolant flows such that the coolant inlet and outlet are both at the top.

50|$|Myhrvold started buying {{equipment}} for the research kitchen in the Intellectual Ventures lab. Much of the equipment was standard cooking equipment, but it also included items such as rotor-stator homogenizers, ultrahigh-pressure homogenizers, freeze-dryers, a 50,000 G centrifuge, ultrasonic baths, and <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators.</b> The laboratory already included other high-tech and industrial equipment, a 100-ton hydraulic press, a large water-jet cutter, an electrical discharge machine, and automated milling machines.|$|R
50|$|After {{extraction}} the solvent is removed, typically {{by means}} of a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator,</b> yielding the extracted compound. The non-soluble portion of the extracted solid remains in the thimble, and is usually discarded.|$|E
50|$|A cooling bath, in {{laboratory}} chemistry practice, is a liquid mixture {{which is used}} to maintain low temperatures, typically between 13 °C and −196 °C. These low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation, to remove solvents using a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator,</b> or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature (see: kinetic control).|$|E
50|$|Evaporation, {{especially}} in production quantities {{rather than merely}} for analysis, is now mostly performed in a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator.</b> This is preferred because it works much faster and may be used under vacuum, avoiding unwanted reactions with the atmosphere and allowing control of noxious fumes. Evaporation under vacuum also reduces the severity of bumping and violent ebullition.|$|E
50|$|The round bottoms {{on these}} types of flasks allow more uniform heating and/or boiling of liquid. Thus, round-bottom flasks are used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} where the contents are heated or boiled. Round-bottom flasks are used in distillation by chemists as distilling flasks and receiving flasks for the distillate (see distillation diagram). One-neck round-bottom flasks are used as the distilling flasks in <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heavy metal azides, such as {{lead azide}} are primary high {{explosives}} detonable when heated or shaken. Heavy-metal azides are formed when solutions of sodium azide or HN3 vapors {{come into contact}} with heavy metals or their salts. Heavy-metal azides can accumulate under certain circumstances, for example, in metal pipelines and on the metal components of diverse equipment (<b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators,</b> freezedrying equipment, cooling traps, water baths, waste pipes), and thus lead to violent explosions.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the forces}} {{created by the}} {{rotation}} suppress bumping. The combination of these characteristics and the conveniences built into modern <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators</b> allow for quick, gentle evaporation of solvents from most samples, even {{in the hands of}} relatively inexperienced users. Solvent remaining after rotary evaporation can be removed by exposing the sample to even deeper vacuum, on a more tightly sealed vacuum system, at ambient or higher temperature (e.g., on a Schlenk line or in a vacuum oven).|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that sodium azide and polymer-bound azide reagents react with dichloromethane and chloroform to form di- and triazidomethane resp., which are both unstable in high concentrations in solution.

30|$|Bacterial cell {{suspensions}} were centrifuged at 12, 000  rpm for 5  min. One {{hundred and}} fifty milliliters of the cell-free supernatant solution was adjusted to pH 7 with 6  M HCl solution, preserved overnight at 4  °C, and then extracted according to the procedure described previously (Cataldi et al. 2004, 2007). Briefly, 150  mL of the cell-free supernatant solution was extracted twice with 150  mL of ethyl acetate each. The combined organic phases were evaporated by <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators</b> at 37  °C. The residue was redissolved in 200  μL of ethyl acetate and stored at 4  °C.|$|R
40|$|Solid phase {{extraction}} (SPE) {{was used}} for the formulation of several radiopharmaceuticals. The method involves dilution of the previously purified HPLC compound with water, trapping of the activity on an SPE bed, washing off the support, elution of the radiopharmaceutical with a small volume of ethanol (< 1 mL) and dilution with sterile isotonic saline solution. Recovery of the radiopharmaceuticals was always higher than 97 %. Two different methods of automation were developed for the formulation of [11 C] and [18 F]radiopharmaceuticals. In all cases, organic solvent levels in the injectable solution were below the recommended limits. This fast (3 - 6 min.) and easy to automate process can be considered {{as an alternative to the}} conventional methods (<b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators).</b> Copyright © 1999 John WileyPeer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vacuum system}} used with <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators</b> {{can be as}} simple as a water {{aspirator}} with a trap immersed in a cold bath (for non-toxic solvents), or as complex as a regulated mechanical vacuum pump with refrigerated trap. Glassware used in the vapor stream and condenser can be simple or complex, depending upon the goals of the evaporation, and any propensities the dissolved compounds might give to the mixture (e.g., to foam or [...] "bump"). Commercial instruments are available that include the basic features, and various traps are manufactured to insert between the evaporation flask and the vapor duct. Modern equipment often adds features such as digital control of vacuum, digital display of temperature and rotational speed, and vapor temperature sensing.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator</b> (or rotavap/rotovap) is {{a device}} used in {{chemical}} laboratories for the efficient and gentle removal of solvents from samples by evaporation.

50|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have very}} high boiling points.

50|$|A {{centrifugal}} evaporator is {{a device}} used in chemical and biochemical laboratories for the efficient and gentle evaporation of solvents from many samples {{at the same}} time, and samples contained in microtitre plates. If only one sample required evaporation then a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator</b> is most often used. The most advanced modern centrifugal evaporators not only concentrate many samples at the same time, they eliminate solvent bumping and can handle solvents with boiling points of up to 220 °C. This is more than adequate for the modern high throughput laboratory.|$|E
50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, reflux, and <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators,</b> {{several types}} of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a cooling water jacket, and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase. These three types of condensers are laboratory glassware items since they are typically made of glass. Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water.|$|R
30|$|For the {{determination}} of citrinin, after the filtration described above, 10  mL of the filtrate was concentrated by a <b>rotary</b> vacuum <b>evaporator</b> and then the pellet was dissolved in 1  mL of methanol, which was subjected to HPLC analysis following previously described method (Yang et al. 2012). A citrinin standard compound (Sigma, USA) was used to confirm the HPLC analysis.|$|R
30|$|Celite is a cheap material, which {{together}} with activated carbon and silica gel increases {{the efficiency of}} purification. This material with good pores traps the heavier fullerenes of C 60 and allows fullerene C 60 {{to pass through the}} column. The use of this material with silica gel and activated carbon can increase the efficiency significantly. Here are a series of chemical and physical interactions of fullerene with celite and also celite with AC and silica gel. This method is a simple and yet efficient method to use. In addition to the laboratory base, this method can be used in the bench base. The applied solvents are easily recyclable by <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporators</b> for use in the next stages. The mobile phase can be recovered using a suitable solvent. In this method, parameters including efficiency, low cost, and simplicity are of great importance in the aim of obtaining an optimized method. As a result, a suitable method with low cost and high efficiency was used in this research.|$|R
50|$|Typically a cold finger {{is used in}} a {{sublimation}} apparatus, or {{can be used as}} {{a compact}} version of a condenser in either reflux reaction or distillation apparatus. Many commercially available rotary evaporators can be purchased with a cold finger in place of a Dimroth condenser, for example. When used as a condenser in a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator,</b> cold fingers can be cooled to a lower temperature of &minus;78 °C (dry ice), compared with water condensers that can be cooled to &minus;40 °C (ethylene glycol/water mixture). The lower temperature achieved reduces the quantity of volatile material exhausted into the air.|$|E
50|$|Each {{batch run}} of the gin {{produces}} 180-200 bottles and uses Soil Association-approved organic ingredients including juniper, angelica, fresh lime peel, bay laurel, cardamom, red raspberry leaf and honey from London hives at The London Honey Company. The first batch of 141 bottles was sold exclusively at English department store, Fortnum & Mason. Using a proprietary production method developed by TLDC, the base spirit is distilled in ‘Christina’, a traditional 140-litre copper alembic. A small proportion of the base is then used to macerate more delicate botanicals for 24 hours before being re-distilled in ‘Little Albion’, a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The two spirits are then married for several weeks before being hand-bottled and labelled at the distillery.|$|E

(13)A {{solution}} of TFD (4.60 mL, 0.50 M, 2.30 mmol) in trifluoroacetone/CH2Cl2 (2:1 v/v) at -20 ° {{was added to}} a {{solution of}} adamantane (136 mg, 0.100 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL) also at -20 °, while stirring vigorously magnetically. The progress of the reaction was followed by GLC analysis, which indicated that 97% of the adamantane was converted to its hydroxylated products in 40 minutes. Removal of the solvent on a <b>rotary</b> <b>evaporator</b> (-20 °, 15 mmHg) afforded a mixture of the 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane (156 mg, 91%) and the monohydroxy adamantane (4.6 mg, 3%). Spectral data for 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane is as follows. IR (KBr): 3275 (O-H), 2930 and 2851 (C-H), 1453, 1135, 1027, 968, 911, 801 cm−1. 1H NMR (CDCl3): 1.50 (m, 2 H), 1.62 (apparent d, 8 H), 1.65 (s, 2 H), 2.23 (m, 2 H), 4.88 (OH).|$|E
50|$|A key {{disadvantage}} in rotary evaporations, besides its single sample nature, {{is the potential}} of some sample types to bump, e.g. ethanol and water, which can result in loss of {{a portion of the}} material intended to be retained. Even professionals experience periodic mishaps during evaporation, especially bumping, though experienced users become aware of the propensity of some mixtures to bump or foam, and apply precautions that help to avoid most such events. In particular, bumping can often be prevented by taking homogeneous phases into the evaporation, by carefully regulating the strength of the vacuum (or the bath temperature) to provide for an even rate of evaporation, or, in rare cases, through use of added agents such as boiling chips (to make the nucleation step of evaporation more uniform). <b>Rotary</b> <b>evaporators</b> can also be equipped with further special traps and condenser arrays that are best suited to particular difficult sample types, including those with the tendency to foam or bump.|$|R
