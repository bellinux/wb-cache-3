25|$|An institution's {{overnight}} reserves, averaged {{over some}} maintenance period, must equal or exceed its average <b>required</b> <b>reserves,</b> calculated {{over the same}} maintenance period. If this calculation is satisfied, there is no requirement that reserves be held {{at any point in}} time. Hence reserve requirements play only a limited role in money creation in the United States.

2500|$|In the United States, {{a reserve}} {{requirement}} (or liquidity ratio) is a minimum value, {{set by the}} Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of the ratio of <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> to a category of deposit liabilities (called the [...] "Net Transaction Accounts" [...] or [...] "NTAs") owed by depository institutions to their customers (e.g., owed by commercial banks including U.S. branches of a foreign bank, savings and loan association, savings bank, credit union). The deposit liability categories currently subject to reserve requirements are mainly checking accounts. There is no reserve requirement on savings accounts and time deposit accounts owned by individuals. The total amount of all NTAs held by customers with U.S. depository institutions, plus the U.S. paper currency and coin currency held by the nonbank public, is called M1.|$|E
2500|$|The Lebanese {{banking system}} is endowed with several {{characteristics}} that promote {{the role of}} Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on {{the free flow of}} capital and earnings {{into and out of the}} Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the [...] "secret of the profession". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio. The <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio sets the balance that the Federal <b>Reserve</b> System <b>requires</b> a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above.

50|$|Part of the bank's <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> {{were held}} in silver dollars, which {{provided}} the opportunity to profit from a rise in silver prices. The holdings, estimated to be 1.5 million silver dollars, was sold to a coin dealer to raise money in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Eurodollars {{can have}} a higher {{interest}} rate attached to them {{because of the fact}} that they are out of reach from the Federal Reserve. U.S. banks hold an account at the Fed and can, in theory, receive unlimited liquidity from the Fed if necessary. These <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> and Fed backing make U.S. Dollar deposits in U.S. banks inherently less risky, and Eurodollar deposits slightly more risky, which requires a slightly higher interest rate.|$|E
50|$|According to Smith, all {{monetary}} systems, including money markets, should function within fractional-reserve banking.

Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.|$|E

50|$|The {{dividends}} paid to member banks are considered partial {{compensation for the}} lack of interest paid on member banks' <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> held at the Federal Reserve.

The Federal Reserve now has authority, granted by Congress in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) of 2008, to pay interest on these funds.|$|E
50|$|Another way banks {{can borrow}} funds {{to keep up}} their <b>required</b> <b>reserves</b> is by taking a loan from the Federal Reserve itself at the {{discount}} window. These loans are subject to audit by the Fed, and the discount rate is usually higher than the federal funds rate. Confusion between these two kinds of loans often leads to confusion between the federal funds rate and the discount rate.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> levels due to the incremental trend of injecting wind energy into the power grid {{with a high level}} of wind energy penetration is complicated because of the variability of wind energy. This study proposes a method, based on the logarithmic barrier interior point method for optimal power flow and Monte Carlo analysis, to evaluate the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> levels for a grid with variable generation. A Gaussian distribution was used to model the dynamic load demand, while a unique linearized least-square approximation was used to model the wind turbines. In order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm, the methodology was applied to a modified IEEE 30 -bus system with two wind-farms. The simulation results showed that the determined reserve requirement was considerably reduced compared with that obtained with classical approaches. The proposed method also satisfies all the considered constraints and maintains system reliability...|$|R
50|$|By {{mid to late}} 1837, many Latter Day Saints (including some {{prominent}} leaders) became disaffected {{in the wake of}} the Kirtland Safety Society banking debacle, in which Smith and several of Smith's associates were accused of various illegal or unethical banking actions when the bank, with the charter held by Smith, collapsed just prior to a nationwide banking crisis. Many critics leveled accusations that Smith was actively misleading KSS members from the beginning of the financial enterprise as it was operating without an official Ohio bank charter and <b>required</b> <b>reserves.</b> Supporters of Smith, on the other hand, hold that the financial institution's collapse was more than partially due to state and federal financial regulations and that the charges against Smith and his associates are at best inflated.|$|E

50|$|On October 3, 2008, Section 128 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 {{allowed the}} Federal Reserve banks to begin paying {{interest}} on excess reserve balances ("IOER") {{as well as}} <b>required</b> <b>reserves.</b> The Federal Reserve banks began doing so three days later.

30|$|When the 2008 {{financial}} crisis lashed China's economy, China opted for an overall expansionary economic policy, i.e. a more proactive fiscal policy and a relatively loose monetary policy, switching the policy mix to the expansionary direction. For a year's {{time from the}} third quarter of 2009, the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio dropped from 17.5 % to 15.5 %. It was more than 2 years until October 2010 when the macro-economic policy changed again. From that time onwards, expansionary macro-economic policy changed to an opt-out-when-appropriate direction. Facing pressures of inflation and slowing economic growth, China again adopted a mix of proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy. Compared with the ‘more proactive fiscal policy’ in the past that aimed at cushioning the impact of the {{financial crisis}}, this time the policy was still an expansionary policy, even though it placed controls on the fiscal deficit and government debt. At the same time, a prudent monetary policy that put inflation prevention as its priority replaced the easing policy of the past. By using monetary instruments such as the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio and central bank bills, the policy tightened the control of the money supply. As a result, the <b>required</b> <b>reserve</b> ratio grew from 15.5 % in 2009 to 20.5 % {{in the second quarter of}} 2011, and the interest rate for central bank bills grew from 1.5 % in July 2009 to 3.5 % in 2011 (Yao and Tan 2011).|$|R

50|$|The {{central bank}} was {{instrumental}} in the growth and financial credibility of Nigerian commercial banks by making sure that all the financial banks operating in the country had a capital base (<b>required</b> <b>reserves).</b> This helped to make sure that bank customers just did not bear losses alone, in the event of bank failures. However, this policy led to the failure of some Nigerian commercial banks; some banks could not meet up with the new capital base requirements, which was 25,000,000,000.00 Naira at the time. Those banks that could not meet the new capital base requirements had to fold up, while some that could not {{come up with the money}} on their own, had to merge with other banks in order to raise the money. This policy helped solidify the commercial banks of Nigeria, and made it impossible for individuals or organizations without financial stability to operate a bank in the country.
