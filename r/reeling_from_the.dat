5|$|Sharp {{took office}} at a {{critical}} time Kentucky's history. Still <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> financial Panic of 1819, state politicians had split into two camps: those who supported legislation favorable to debtors (the Debt Relief Party) and those who favored the protection of creditors (typically called Anti-Reliefers.) Sharp had identified with the Relief Party, as had Governor Adair.|$|E
5|$|Forty-niners {{came from}} Latin America, {{particularly}} from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile. Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China, began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to Gum San ("Gold Mountain"), the name given to California in Chinese. The first immigrants from Europe, <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France, with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.|$|E

North Korean and US forces unexpectedly ran into one another and a confused battle ensued. American forces were better equipped with heavy weapons and armor thanks to newly arrived equipment in the country, and their better ground during the battle allowed them to repel North Korean advances.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large debtor class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces {{that he wants to}} make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie {{had anything to do with}} his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns to {{the office and}} announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E
5|$|On November6, storm {{warnings}} {{were posted}} in Samar, Leyte, {{and much of}} the Visayas chain, as well as, for the Bicol Peninsula on Luzon, which was just <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of Typhoon Ruby and Tropical Storm Tess, in preparation for the typhoon. The next day, this alert was expanded into the northeastern provinces of Mindanao Island. Simultaneously, a lower level alert was issued for half of Luzon, including the capital of Manila. Small crafts were ordered to stay at port. Philippine Airlines canceled 75domestic flights as the storm approached. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) suspended all passenger ship service to ports in the Visayas Islands on November6, stranding thousands of passengers in Manila and other major ports throughout the nation. Select Military Airlift Command flights to Japan and the United States left early to avoid the core of the typhoon. The city of Manila ordered all schools to close for a day.|$|E
5|$|Task Group 38.2 {{remained}} off {{the eastern}} coast of Luzon {{for the first}} week of November providing continued support to U.S. Army forces at Leyte. On November 5–6, 1944, Air Group 18 flew sorties against airfields and shipping on southern Luzon. Fighters participated in strafing runs far more often than they engaged in aerial combat. Out of a total of 194 sorties flown by the air group over these two days, two airborne aircraft were destroyed compared with fifty-five on the ground. By this time Japan was <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> effects of Operation Cartwheel, which had deprived it of fuel needed to get planes off the ground; its air force was short on experienced and even freshly-trained pilots, who were lost in huge numbers in conflicts like the Battle of the Philippine Sea; and finally, it lacked an effective seagoing navy since the back of the IJN had been broken at the Battle of Leyte Gulf the previous month. These factors, in tandem with a week spent refueling, rearming and re-provisioning at Ulithi between November 7 and 14, limited opportunities for Harris to further run up his score.|$|E

5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the misallocation of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought and concerns about takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, still <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> personal attacks levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his personal attacks. Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began to sour once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division {{participated in}} its fourth amphibious assault landing during Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, at St. Maxime, in Southern France. The 45th Infantry Division landed its 157th and 180th regimental combat teams and {{captured}} {{the heights of}} the Chaines de Mar before meeting with the 1st Special Service Force. The German Army, <b>reeling</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Normandy, in which it had suffered a major defeat, pulled back after a short fight, {{part of an overall}} German withdrawal to the east following the landings. Soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division engaged the dispersed forces of German Army Group G, suffering very few casualties. The U.S. Seventh Army, along with Free French forces, were able to advance north quickly. By 12 September, the Seventh Army linked up with Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, advancing from Normandy, joining the two forces at Dijon. Against slight opposition, it spearheaded the drive for the Belfort Gap. The 45th Infantry Division took the strongly defended city of Epinal on 24 September. The division was then reassigned to V Corps, under the command of Major General Leonard T. Gerow, for its next advance. On 30 September the division crossed the Moselle River and entered the western foothills of the Vosges, taking Rambervillers. It would remain in the area for a month waiting for other units to catch up before crossing the Mortagne River on 23 October. The division remained on the line with the U.S. 6th Army Group the southernmost of three army groups advancing through France.|$|E
