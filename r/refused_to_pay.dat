5|$|In December 1973, state {{subsidies}} for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, {{resulting in the}} MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> its $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton also did not reach an agreement. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.|$|E

5|$|The first {{openly gay}} British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his {{last night in}} Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US {{authorities}} were planning to extradite him and charge him with sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him blackmail.|$|E

During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and {{the producers}} {{could not find}} a clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E

25|$|A tax protester {{is someone}} who <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a tax {{claiming}} that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from tax resisters, who <b>refuse</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes as a protest against the government or its policies, not out of {{a belief that the}} tax law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.|$|R

Because of the occupancy rate and low profits so far, the developers had initially <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> $5.4 million in development fees that would be spent on rent subsidies, job training programs and community development in the South of Market area. However, the developers finally agreed to pay the city.|$|E
5|$|The idea of anti-Ottoman {{struggle}} was revived by John III the Terrible (15721574) who <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the {{tribute to the}} sultan. As a result, Ottoman and Wallachian troops invaded Moldavia, but they were defeated by John III in a surprise attack near Jilişte. Now the sultan sent a large army against Moldavia, and the prince was captured and quartered. Next Aaron the Tyrant joined the anti-Ottoman coalition of Transylvania and Wallachia, and started a rebellion on November 13, 1594, simultaneously with Michael the Brave of Wallachia.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E

Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of Sirmium in 582, while the Slavs began to make inroads across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for {{concessionary}} {{travel for}} the tram scheme, {{as it does}} for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E

50|$|One {{party has}} {{performed}} their {{part of the}} contract, but the other party <b>refuses</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> unless the amount owed is reduced.

The rule will apply, so the contractor could accept the $8,000 and sue for the remaining $2,000 because there was an 'honest dispute' as to the duty.|$|R
