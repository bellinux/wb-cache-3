50|$|Crab {{steering}} is {{a special}} type of active four-wheel steering. It operates by steering all wheels {{in the same direction}} and at the same angle. Crab steering is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but under an angle (i.e. when moving loads with a <b>reach</b> <b>truck,</b> or during filming with a camera dolly), or when the rear wheels may not follow the front wheel tracks (i.e. to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment).|$|E

5000|$|Electric forklifts - {{powered by}} {{lead-acid}} batteries or sometimes lithium-ion batteries, {{several types of}} forklifts are electric: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, <b>reach</b> <b>trucks</b> and pallet jacks. Electric forklifts are primarily used indoors on flat, even surfaces. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in food-processing and healthcare sectors.|$|R

A special toothed grab holds the pallet to the forks. The operator hand transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time. This is an efficient way of picking less than pallet load shipments, and is popular for use in large distribution centers.|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} World War II, like World War I before, spurred {{the use of}} {{forklift}} trucks in the war effort. Following the war, more efficient methods for storing products in warehouses were being implemented. Warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights and new forklift models were made that filled this need. For example, in 1954 a British company named Lansing Bagnall, now part of KION Group, developed what was {{claimed to be the}} first narrow aisle electric <b>reach</b> <b>truck.</b> The development changed the design of warehouses leading to narrower aisles and higher load stacking that increased storage capability. During the 1950s and 1960s operator safety became a concern due to the increasing lifting heights and capacities. Safety features such as load back rests and operator cages, called overhead guards, began to be added to forklifts produced in this era. In the late 1980s ergonomic design began to be incorporated in new forklift designs to improve operator comfort, reduce injuries and increase productivity. During the 1990s exhaust emissions from forklift operations began to be addressed which led to emission standards being implemented for forklift manufacturers in various countries. The introduction of AC power forklifts, along with fuel cell technology, are also refinements in continuing forklift development.|$|E
40|$|The task of {{handling}} reach trucks frequently involves poor working postures. The {{location of the}} steering wheel in most reach trucks {{is in front of}} the operator which requires the drivers to bend forward and stretch their hands for holding onto the steering wheel. To overcome visibility restrictions, this posture is aggravated by twisting and bending their torso sideways. This paper presents a usability study which was conducted to compare adoption of ergonomic features in a new <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> cabin with the way they were intended to be employed for improving physical working conditions. Participants drove the <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> on a test track performing tasks of varying complexity. Video recordings were utilized to facilitate the observations. The results indicate that improved ergonomics features of the <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> are not used as intended. The test subjects instead adopted postures that they were accustomed to when driving common reach trucks. The possible contributing factors to this posture regression are discussed. The procedure used in this study is recommended for the companies to determine the effectiveness and adoption of ergonomics solutions...|$|E

The complexity of designing warehousing systems in an analytical way is hightherefore the discrete simulation models were performed {{in order to gain}} the basic data for {{different types of}} warehousing-transportation vehicles. First, the counter balance lift truck is analyzed, which is useful for a lower rack warehouse construction and a lower frequency of operation. Next, the <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> is analyzedit enables to achieve higher lifting places, with a relatively high frequency and lift capacity. The narrow aisle lift truck can reach heights up to twelve meters, and is suitable for high frequency demands and lift capacities. Finally, the automated storage and retrieval system is analyzed. The presented models prove to be a very useful and flexible tool for choosing a particular type of warehousing system on the first stage of designing the warehouse process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Reach</b> <b>truck</b> masts are {{subjected}} to oscillations, which have signiﬁcant impacts on {{the dynamics of the}} entire vehicle. Mast oscillations can cause undesirable outcomes in extreme situations and therefore it is desirable to be able to predict these outcomes before they occur. A forklift manufacturer in Mjölby initiated a thesis with the intention to obtain a model that can simulate mast sway for situations where oscillations occur. The objective of the thesis was to create a model of Triplex masts and ﬁnd dependencies between model parameters and variables such as fork height and load. The thesis was conducted modelling the mast with a rigid multibody approach where torsion springs and dampers were used between mast parts to simulate mast elasticity. Clearance at the connections were considered and included in the model. The obtained model constitutes of 8 parameters that could be tuned to attain diﬀerent oscillation characteristics. Parametric optimisation was carried out to ﬁnd optimal sets of parameters for compliance with sway measurement tests with diﬀerent load and fork height cases.   The thesis has resulted in a model that is able to simulate mast sway with diﬀerent oscillation characteristics depending on model parameters. Performed parametric optimisation resulted in parameters that reveal useful information about how model parameters depend on load and fork height. The method used for obtaining optimal parameters can likewise be applied to other mast models in order to gain insight into model parameters as functions of load and fork height...|$|E

H-E-B converted 14 of its lift reach trucks to fuel cell power using Nuvera Fuel Cells’ PowerEdge™ units {{to verify the}} value proposition and environmental benefits associated with the technology. Issues associated with the increasing power requirements of the distribution center operation, along with high ambient temperature {{in the summer and}} other operating conditions (such as air quality and floor surface condition), surfaced opportunities for improving Nuvera’s PowerEdge fuel cell system design in high-throughput forklift environments. The project included on-site generation of hydrogen from a steam methane reformer, called PowerTap™ manufactured by Nuvera. The hydrogen was generated, compressed and stored in equipment located outside H-E-B’s facility, and provided to the forklifts by hydrogen dispensers located in high forklift traffic areas. The PowerEdge fuel cell units logged over 25, 300 operating hours {{over the course of the}} two-year project period. The PowerTap hydrogen generator produced more than 11, 100 kg of hydrogen over the same period. Hydrogen availability at the pump was 99. 9 %. H-E-B management has determined that fuel cell forklifts help alleviate several issues in its distribution centers, including truck operator downtime associated with battery changing, truck and battery maintenance costs, and reduction of grid electricity usage. Data collected from this initial installation demonstrated a 10 % productivity improvement, which enabled H-E-B to make economic decisions on expanding the fleet of PowerEdge and PowerTap units in the fleet, which it plans to undertake upon successful demonstration of the new PowerEdge <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> product. H-E-B has also expressed interst in other uses of hydrogen produced on site in the future, such as for APUs used in tractor trailers and refrigerated transport trucks in its fleet...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} emphasis on developing systematical research approaches for design of products that appeal to people’s emotions and values. This thesis proposes methodological developments for investigating people’s subjective emotional needs and values towards quality and explores interactions of related physical design attributes for product design. The overall aim of the licentiate thesis is to gain an understanding on Affective engineering of products through exploring the concept of quality feeling and to develop methodological approaches for this. Quality feeling {{can be described as}} a holistic concept considering individuals’ perceptions, expectations, experiences, physical and psychological expressions for a product or service. Affective Engineering methodology aims at translating human psychological processes, such as feelings and emotions, into appropriate product design attributes, such as size, shape, and surface characteristics. The thesis presents three methodological approaches when evaluating products for affective engineering and one approach for an interactive product design support system development. The first study presented deals with feelings of quality for <b>reach</b> <b>truck</b> operator’s cabin components. Components that would convey to give a higher total quality feeling were identified and improvement opportunities were prioritized. The second study presented is based on developing an interactive affective design and decision support system software for design of the steering wheel from drivers’ individual and shared preferences. In the third study affective values arising from judgments for important feelings of quality is the study basis. The author presents research on identifying interactions of design attributes for affective values in waiting areas of primary health care services. Further, a new approach for applying Affective Engineering in design of complex contexts is proposed. The proposed approach aims to handle contexts where feelings and design attributes have complex interactions for products and services that give almost an infinite number of design alternatives that are difficult to handle in traditional Kansei Engineering studies. With this thesis also an interactive product design and decision support system software is developed for steering wheel design and proposed for educational and industrial use. The proposed system works based on linking product design attributes to human feelings by applying Genetic algorithms and provides potential basis for future product development and improvements. This thesis has also contributed with affective design recommendations applicable for vehicle cabins and waiting areas in primary health care. Moreover, a number of existing methods in Affective Engineering have been tested and methodological experience is drawn, including advantages, disadvantages and limitations of using these methods...|$|E

40|$|With {{warehouse}} operations {{contributing to}} the major part of logistics, architects tend to utilize {{every inch of the}} space allocated to maximize the stacking space. Increasing the height of the aisles and narrowing down the aisle-aisle space are major design issues in doing so. Even though forklift manufacturing companies introduced high <b>reach</b> <b>trucks</b> and forklifts for narrow aisles, forklift operators face many issues while working with heavy pallets. This thesis focused on developing a systemthat uses Augmented Reality(AR) to aid forklift operators in performing their pallet racking and pick up tasks. It used AR technology to superimpose virtual cues over the real world specifying the pallets to be picked up and moved and also assist in operating the forklift using depth cues. This aims to increase the productivity of the forklift operators in the warehouse. Depth cues are overlaid on a live video feed from a camera attached {{to the front of the}} forklift which was displayed using a laptop to the participants. To evaluate the usability of the system designed, an experiment was conducted and the performance results and the feedback from the participants was evaluated. A remote controlled toy forklift was used to conduct the experiment and a motion tracking system was set-up to track the cab and pallet. Simple pallet handling tasks were designed for the participants and their performance and feedback was collected and analysed. This thesis shows how AR offers a simple and effecient solution for the problems faced by forklift operators while performing pallet handling tasks in warehouse...|$|R
