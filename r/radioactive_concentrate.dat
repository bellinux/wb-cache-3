40|$|For {{assessments}} of hard-to-detect radionuclides (HD-RN) contents in various type of radwastes at the NPP-A 1, available empirical data referenced to 137 Cs (actinides, 90 Sr, 99 Tc, 63 Ni, 14 C) and the theoretical assessment {{for the remaining}} HD-RN using calculated RN inventory and a simple model with effective relative (137 Cs) spent fuel release fractions was applied. The analytical data of extended radiochemical analysis for the existing available operational radwaste forms have been reviewed for this purpose. 137 Cs, 90 Sr and 241 Am were set up as release markers for partial spent fuel release groups of HD-RNs within which the total fractions of HD-RN released to the operational radwastes were assumed to be constant. It was shown by the assessment carried out that 137 Cs and HD-RNs 129 I, 99 Tc, and partly 79 Se and 14 C are the main contributors to the disposal dose limit for the <b>radioactive</b> <b>concentrate</b> at NPP A- 1. In {{the case of the}} radioactive sludge from the operational radwaste system the role of predominant dose contributors belongs to actinides 239, 240 Pu and 241 Am. In the case of clearance of radioactive material from the NPP-A 1 site, only the reference radionuclide, 137 Cs was predicted to be the most dominant dose contributor. In all of these cases the estimated contributions of other hard-to-detect radionuclides to respective disposal or release dose limit are lower by 2 and more orders of magnitude. As a lesson learned, the most attention is proposed to focus on the control and measurement of the critical HD-RNs indicated by the assessment. For the control of less important HD-RNs, the developed release coefficient method is sufficient to be applied...|$|E

40|$|Radiation sources can {{be either}} {{external}} to the body, such as medical X-rays, or internal. The latter can result from the ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption or injection of radionuclides. The effects of radiation {{are directly related to}} the dose that an organ receives, and any difference between the effects of external and internal sources is in large part related to the distribution of dose within and among body organs.

Internal sources of radiation are more difficult to evaluate because of problems in determining the distribution of doses in tissues and organs. The dose received from external sources depends on the parts of the body that were irradiated, whereas the distribution of dose from internal sources can be affected by biological processes and metabolism.

However, virus replication in tumor tissue has generally not been monitored in these oHSV clinical trials, and the data suggest that its oncolytic potency needs to be improved.

Our data demonstrate that a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCap, efficiently <b>concentrates</b> <b>radioactive</b> iodine after the cells have been infected in vitro or in vivo. In vivo replication of oHSV-NIS in tumors was noninvasively monitored by computed tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography imaging of the biodistribution of pertechnetate and was confirmed. LNCap xenografts in nude mice were eradicated by intratumoral administration of oHSV-NIS. Systemic administration of oHSV-NIS prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, and the therapeutic effect was further enhanced by administration of 131 I after the intratumoral spread of the virus had peaked. oHSV-NIS {{has the potential to}} substantially enhance the outcomes of standard therapy for patients with prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work that}} was completed in FY 1992 on the program "Technology Development for Concentrating Process Streams. " The purpose of this program is to evaluate and develop evaporator technology for <b>concentrating</b> <b>radioactive</b> waste and product streams such as those generated by the TRUEX process. Concentrating these streams and minimizing the volume of waste generated can significantly reduce disposal costs; however, equipment to concentrate the streams and recycle the decontaminated condensates must be installed. LICON, Inc., is developing an evaporator that shows {{a great deal of}} potential for this application. In this report, concepts that need to be incorporated into the design of an evaporator operated in a radioactive environment are discussed. These concepts include criticality safety, remote operation and maintenance, and materials of construction. Both solubility and vapor-liquid equilibrium data are needed to design an effective process for concentrating process streams. Therefore, literature surveys were completed and are summarized in this report. A model that is being developed to predict vapor phase compositions is described. A laboratory-scale evaporator was purchased and installed to study the evaporation process and to collect additional data. This unit is described in detail. Two new LICON evaporators are being designed for installation at Argonne-East in FY 1993 to process low-level radioactive waste generated throughout the laboratory. They will also provide operating data from a full-sized evaporator processing radioactive solutions. Details on these evaporators are included in this report...|$|R
