40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} supraspinatus tendon integrity with ultrasound (US) {{in patients}} submitted to proximal humeral fracture (PHF) fixation with a locking intramedullary nail., Methods: Thirty-one patients with PHF treated with curvilinear locking intramedullary nail, aged between 50 and 85 years, were assessed by US at six months postoperatively and clinically at six and 12 months postoperatively. The primary aim was supraspinatus tendon integrity, evaluated by US at six months postoperatively. Secondary aims included the Constant-Murley, DASH score, and visual analog pain scores, {{as well as}} complications and reoperation rates. Results: Full-thickness rotator cuff <b>ruptures</b> were observed in four patients (13 %), supraspinatus <b>ruptures</b> in three cases (10 %), and subscapularis <b>ruptures</b> in one case (3 %). Partial <b>ruptures</b> were diagnosed in 10 cases (32 %). The results using the Constant-Murley score at 12 months were 71. 3 ± 15. 2 points for the entire series, with 73. 2 ± 16. 1 points for patients without rotator cuff <b>ruptures</b> and 68. 7 ± 14. 1 points for those with partial or complete <b>ruptures,</b> without {{a statistically significant difference}} (p= 0. 336). Complications, exclusively for rotator cuff <b>ruptures,</b> were observed in nine patients (29 %). Conclusion: A high rate of rotator cuff <b>ruptures</b> was demonstrated, with partial <b>ruptures</b> in 32 % of cases and full-thickness <b>ruptures</b> in 13 %. However, clinical results are satisfactory, and are not influenced by the presence of rotator cuff <b>ruptures...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} blood chemical variables and compare changes that occurred with <b>ruptured</b> bladders and <b>ruptured</b> urethras in steers and yearling bulls. The fatality rates were 10. 5 % in steers with <b>ruptured</b> urethras and 50. 8 % in steers with <b>ruptured</b> bladders. Both groups had significantly decreased serum sodium and chloride values and significantly increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and plasma protein concentrations compared to the normal group. Steers with <b>ruptured</b> bladders were more dehydrated, had significantly lower serum sodium and chloride values and had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations than steers with <b>ruptured</b> urethras. The combination of a decreased serum sodium, a decreased serum chloride, and a decreased ratio of serum phosphate to blood urea nitrogen occurred consistently within the <b>ruptured</b> bladder group. Of the variables examined, serum phosphate was the best prognostic indicator in the steers with <b>ruptured</b> bladders as all of the steers that died had a serum phosphate in excess of 2. 9 mmol/L.

5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{displacement}} along the Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that observed for {{the northern part of the}} <b>rupture</b> during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the <b>rupture</b> did not extend across the border into Mexico.

The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the <b>rupture</b> speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear <b>rupture</b> was inferred.|$|E

Case presentation This case was a 60 -year-old man who had a large, <b>ruptured</b> HCC in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) -enhanced RFA successfully controlled the bleeding and made the tumor completely necrotic.

40|$|<b>Ruptured</b> {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) {{is associated with}} a high mortality despite surgical management. Earlier reports indicate that a major cause of immediate intraoperative death in patients with <b>ruptured</b> AAA is related to hemorrhage due to coagulopathy. Acidosis is, besides hypothermia and hemodilution, a possible cause of coagulopathy. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the incidence of coagulopathy and acidosis preoperatively in patients with <b>ruptured</b> AAA in relation to the clinical outcome with special regard to the influence of shock. For this purpose, 95 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for AAA (43 <b>ruptured</b> with shock, 12 <b>ruptured</b> without shock, and 40 nonruptured) were included. Coagulopathy was defined as prothrombin time (international normalized ratio [INR]) 1. 5 and acidosis was defined as base deficit 6 mmol/L. Mortality and postoperative complications were recorded. The present study shows a state of acidosis at the start of surgery in 30 of 55 patients with <b>ruptured</b> AAA. However, only in 7 of 55 patients with <b>ruptured</b> AAA a state of preoperative coagulopathy was demon-strated. Furthermore, in our patients with shock due to <b>ruptured</b> AAA only 2 of 12 deaths were due to coagulopathy and bleed-ing. Indeed, our results show a relatively high incidence of thrombosis-related causes of death in patients with <b>ruptured</b> AAA, indicating a relation to an activated coagulation in these patients. These findings indicate that modern emergency management of <b>ruptured</b> AAA has improved in the attempt to prevent fatal coagulopathy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: {{this study}} compares our costs of {{salvaging}} patients with <b>ruptured</b> abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) with the costs for unruptured AAAs. Methods: details of all AAAs presenting over 18 months were obtained. Costs of repair were carefully {{calculated for each}} case and were based upon ITU and ward stay {{and the use of}} theatre, radiology and pathology services. We compared the costs in unruptured AAAs with both uncomplicated <b>ruptures</b> and <b>ruptures</b> with one or more system failure. Results: the mortality rate for <b>ruptures</b> undergoing repair was 18 % and for elective repairs was 1. 6 %. The median cost for uncomplicated <b>ruptures</b> was £ 6427 (range £ 2012 - 13 756). For 12 complicated <b>ruptures,</b> it was £ 20 075 (range £ 13 864 - 166 446), and for 63 unruptured AAAs, was £ 4762 (range £ 2925 - 47 499). Conclusion: relatively low operative mortality rates for <b>ruptured</b> AAA repair can be achieved but this comes at substantial cost.
