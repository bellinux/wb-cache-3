40|$|This project {{intends to}} apply Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} to deploy asset tracking {{and enhance the}} operational efficiency {{in order to minimize}} asset misplacement and theft in the Tian Ann Temple. The results would demonstrate a solution of tracking assets more accurately and efficiently to similar small community organizations or businesses. Subsequently, their asset tracking productivity and security can be significantly enhanced. The researcher defined the system's function and architected the <b>RFID</b> asset <b>tracking</b> system. After testing the system and making appropriate modifications, three scenarios (items out of the secured area, items into a secured room, and take the antennas to find misplaced items in unsecured areas in the Temple) were used to implement the asset tracking. The results indicated that the <b>RFID</b> asset <b>tracking</b> system was successfully deployed in all three scenarios...|$|R
2500|$|In some cases, {{laboratory}} mix-ups (misidentified gametes, {{transfer of}} wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to {{legal action against}} the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example {{is the case of}} a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son. This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups. [...] The HFEA, for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system, [...] the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered RFID tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of <b>RFID</b> <b>tracking</b> has expanded in the USA, it is still not widely adopted. However, In other cases there has been not mix-up of embryos or gametes, but the intentional use of embryos of another couple or gamete donor, without informed consent of parents, both: receptors or donors. Some of these cases are taking a legal and judicial course.|$|E

40|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID, for short) {{is regarded}} as a fundamental technology for ubiquitous services and thus a growing security and privacy concern goes along with its applications integrated into everyday life, often in an invisible way. The possible abuse of <b>RFID’s</b> <b>tracking</b> capability raises threats to user privacy. It has inspired lot of research interest, but many measures bring about a very challenging risk, that is, synchronization. Failure to keep changes of the shared secret in step between the tag and the back-end server will cause RFID system out of action. This paper presents an effective privacy-preserving protocol by means of commutative cipher to obviate the possibility of the mistake. In the proposed scheme, the tag output associated to the fixed secret identifier is dynamic at every session to conduct mutual authentication with reader-to-tag and tag-to-reader in turn. Therefore, our work is robust against desynchronization attacks and other security attacks, such as cloned use and man-in-the-middle attack, as well. Key words...|$|R

5000|$|The school {{district}} has spent over $500,000 {{on a system}} whereby students wear an RFID chip and barcode around their necks, allowing the school to track their location during the school day.

One student was expelled in 2012 after refusing to either wear the tag or to wear a version of it that included the barcode but not the RFID tag.
