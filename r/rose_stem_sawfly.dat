40|$|The wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Cephus cinctus Norton) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an economically significant pest since the introduction of cereal grains in the northern Great Plains of the United States and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether differences in soil water holding properties were responsible for the observed differences between damaged and undamaged winter and spring wheat fields in the Golden Triangle area of north central Montana. Wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly</b> activity was observed and documented in fourteen wheat fields on a privately owned and operated farm near the western boundary of Hill County, Montana. Management and cultural practices had been the same for each of the fields for the past eight years, but some fields consistently sustained greater sawfly cutting damage than neighboring fields. Soil and plant samples were taken in each of the fields. Soil properties analyzed were percentage of clay in the top twelve inches of the soil profile, depth to calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), soil textural class, and plant available water holding capacity (PAWHC) throughout the soil profile. Plant samples were taken at each site to determine sawfly larval infestation and cutting damage. A strong negative relationship existed between total PAWHC and sawfly larval infestation. Also, as total PAWHC of the soil profile decreased, the actual cutting damage to the wheat increased. Based on soil textural classes, {{it may be possible to}} make managemen...|$|R
40|$|The wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly,</b> (Cephus cinctus Norton) Hymenoptera: Cephidae, {{has been}} a major pest of winter wheat and barley in the {{northern}} Great Plains for more than 100 years. The insect's cryptic nature and lack of safe chemical control options make the wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly</b> (WSS) difficult to manage; thus, biological control offers the best hope for sustainable management of WSS. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) have been used successfully against other above-ground insect pests, and adding adjuvants to sprays containing EPNs has been shown to improve their effectiveness. We tested the hypothesis that adding chemical adjuvants to sprays containing EPNs will increase the ability of EPNs to enter wheat stems and kill diapausing WSS larvae. This is the first study to test the ability of EPNs to infect the WSS, C. cinctus, and test EPNs combined with adjuvants against C. cinctus in both the laboratory and the field. Infection assays showed that three different species of EPNs caused 60 - 100 % mortality to WSS larvae. Adding Penterra, Silwet L- 77, Sunspray 11 N, or Syl-Tac to solutions containing EPNs resulted in higher WSS mortality than solutions made with water alone. Field tests showed that sprays containing S. feltiae added to 0. 1 % Penterra increased WSS mortality up to 29. 1 %. These results indicate a novel control method for WSS, and represent a significant advancement in the biological control of this persistent insect pest...|$|R

A few are pests of cereal grains (e.g. Cephus cinctus, which attacks wheat).

40|$|The wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), {{is a key}} pest {{of wheat}} in the {{northern}} Great Plains of North America, and damage resulting from this species has recently expanded southward. Current pest management practices are inadequate and uncertainty regarding geographic origin, as well as limited data on population structure and dynamics across North America impede progress towards more informed management. We examined the genetic divergence between samples collected in North America and northeastern Asia, the assumed native range of C. cinctus using two mitochondrial regions (COI and 16 S). Subsequently, we characterized the structure of genetic diversity in the main wheat producing areas in North America {{using a combination of}} mtDNA marker and microsatellites in samples collected both in wheat fields and in grasses in wildlands. The strong genetic divergence observed between North American samples and Asian congeners, in particular the synonimized C. hyalinatus, did not support the hypothesis of a recent American colonization by C. cinctus. Furthermore, the relatively high genetic diversity both with mtDNA and microsatellite markers offered additional evidence in favor of the native American origin of this pest. The genetic diversity of North American populations is structured into three genetic clusters and these are highly correlated with geography. Regarding the recent southern outbreaks in North America, the results tend to exclude the hypothesis of recent movement of damaging wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly</b> populations from the northern area. The shift in host plant use by local populations appears to be the most likely scenario. Finally, the significance of these findings is discussed in the context of pest management...|$|R

The main objectives were to (i) quantify phenotypic diversity and identify variation in the durum wheat landraces for the different stresses and (ii) characterize the agronomic profiles of landraces {{in reaction to the}} stresses. Significant changes in reactions of landraces to stresses were observed. Landraces resistant to each stress were identified and agronomically characterized. Percentage reduction due to the stresses varied from 11. 4 % (yellow rust) to 21. 6 % (cold stress) for 1000 -kernel weight (TKW) and from 19. 9 (yellow rust) to 91. 9 % (cold stress) for grain yield. Landraces from Asia and Europe showed enhanced genetic potential for both grain yield and cold tolerance under highland rainfed conditions of Iran. The findings showed that TKW and yield productivity could be used to assess the response of durum wheat landraces to different stresses. In conclusion, landraces showed high levels of resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses, and selected landraces can serve in durum wheat breeding for adaptation to cold and drought-prone environments...|$|R

Coincident QTL (LOD = 94 - 127, R 2 = 78 - 92 %) were localized near the telomere of chromosome 3 BL in both mapping populations, which we designate SSt 1. We further examined the SSt 1 interval by using available consensus maps for durum and common wheat and compared genetic to physical intervals by anchoring markers to the current version of the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence. These results suggest that the SSt 1 interval spans a physical distance of 1. 6 Mb in WEW (positions 833. 4 - 835. 0 Mb). In addition, minor QTL were identified on chromosomes 2 A, 2 D, 4 A, and 5 A that were found to synergistically enhance expression of SSt 1 to increase stem-solidness.

40|$|Wheat <b>Stem</b> <b>Sawfly</b> (WSS), Cephus Cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests, causing yield and economic losses in wheat and barley. The lack of information about molecular mechanisms of WSS for defeating plant’s resistance prevents application of effective pest control strategies therefore, it is essential to identify the genes and their regulators behind WSS infestations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized with their regulatory functions on gene expression, tuning protein production by controlling transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. A transcriptome-guided approach was followed in order to identify miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNA of WSS, and their interaction networks. A total of 1, 893 were presented here as differentially expressed between larva and adult WSS insects. There were 11 miRNA families detected in WSS transcriptome. Together with the annotation of 1, 251 novel mRNAs, the amount of genetic information available for WSS was expanded. The network between WSS miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs suggested miRNA-mediated regulatory roles of lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs. In the light of the previous evidence that small RNA molecules of a pathogen could suppress the immune response of host plant, we analyzed the putative interactions between larvae and wheat at the miRNA level. Overall, this study provides a profile of larva and adult WSS life stages in terms of coding and non-coding elements. These findings also emphasize the potential roles of wheat and larval miRNAs in wheat resistance to infestation and in the suppression of resistance which is critical for the development of effective pest control strategies...|$|R

Recently a new source of resistance has been made available combining a single dominant solid pith gene from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) with spring bread wheat cultivars. Our study had two objectives: (i) assess levels of C. cinctus damage and larval C. cinctus mortality in wheat with the novel solid germplasm, conventional solid-stems and susceptible cultivars; and (ii) determine plant genotype effects on populations of C. cinctus parasitoid Bracon cephi (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The study was conducted in plots near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada from 2003 – 2005. The novel solid-stemmed hexaploid G 9608 B 1 -L 12 J 11 BF 02, solid-stemmed AC Eatonia and hollow-stemmed durum AC Navigator reduced the infestation level and girdling damage by C. cinctus. Another synthetic hexaploid B 9973 B 03 &AC 4 AW, hollow-stemmed AC Cadillac, McKenzie and AC Barrie were more susceptible to C. cinctus damage. Larval parasitism by B. cephi increased along with C. cinctus infestation levels. Stem solidness itself, regardless of source, had no direct negative effect on B. cephi but due to lower infestation and survival of C. cinctus in solid stem genotypes, the overall population of parasitoids was reduced. When planting monocultures of effective solid stem wheat, strategies to conserve populations of parasitoids should be considered for long term sustainable management of C. cinctus...|$|R

The declining cover {{of natural and}} semi-natural habitats, in particular, {{has been shown to}} reduce natural-enemy attack of crop pests, but also in some cases reduced crop colonization by such pests. In this study, we examined the influence of changes in two elements of landscape composition, natural grassland cover and cover of a highly suitable crop host, on infestation by a generalist insect pest in wheat, and parasitism of this pest by its dominant natural enemies. Surprisingly, we found no significant influences of increasing natural grassland habitat, at either local or landscape scales, on infestation by the wheat <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Cephus cinctus, or parasitism of this pest by the native parasitoid wasps, Bracon cephiand Bracon lissogaster. In contrast, we found significant increases in levels of C. cinctus infestation with increasing wheat cover at the landscape scale. This pattern was consistent across six study regions spanning three states in the northern Great Plains of North America, despite large differences in cropping systems and pest population densities across regions. Regional variation in pest infestation was best explained by long-term averages in precipitation, with higher C. cinctus infestation rates found in drier regions. Results suggest that landscape-mediated variation in pest pressure in this system is better explained by a direct response of pest insects to increasing cover of a highly suitable crop rather than an indirect response via reductions in natural enemies as natural habitat declines. The implication is that habitat diversification at the landscape scale could play a role in suppressing agricultural pest populations via reductions in area of suitable crop hosts...|$|R
