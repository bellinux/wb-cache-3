40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} remote hospitals and then assess their performance in the first three years of the Hospital Value Based Purchasing program. A definition for remote hospital was created using clinical outcome literature and travel time. The hospitals were then identified as those hospitals more than 60 minutes driving time from the next nearest hospital by using geographic information systems software (n = 127). The <b>remote</b> hospitals’ <b>payment</b> adjustments and raw quality scores were be compared with non-remote hospitals. Remote hospitals have done well in the first three years improving their payments over time. However, little change is seen in the quality metrics used in the program. A review of economic theories relevant to hospital performance and behavior identified several hospital characteristics that may contribute to performance.

40|$|National noncash {{retail payment}} {{markets in the}} euro area will {{gradually}} migrate to a single euro payments area (SEPA) from 2008 onwards. Within SEPA, citizens {{will be able to}} make and receive payments to and from other euro countries as easily and safely, and on the same conditions, as in their own country using one bank account and one set of payment instruments (debit card, credit transfer and direct debit). This study reveals that the Dutch pay differently for their cross-border purchases than for their domestic purchases and that payment behaviour differs per euro country. The limited cross-border acceptance of the debit card hampers its cross-border usage and encourages the usage of cash and credit cards. Furthermore the Dutch most often use electronic transfers, followed by the credit card, for <b>remote</b> cross-border <b>payments.</b> The speed at which the Dutch will switch over to European debit cards and credit transfers will depend heavily on acceptance levels, prices and safety. Migration to the European direct debit may be hardest to archieve. Here, safety is of vital importance. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{terminals}} available to merchants, although most have the same basic purpose and functions. They allow a merchant to insert, swipe, or manually enter the required credit/debit card information, to transmit this data to the merchant service provider for authorization and finally, to transfer funds to the merchant. Most newer models not only process credit and debit cards but can also handle gift cards, cheques, and so on. The majority of card terminals transmit data over a standard telephone line or a wired or wireless Internet connection. Some also {{have the ability to}} cache transactional data to be transmitted to the gateway processor when a connection becomes available; the major drawback to this is that immediate authorization is not available at the time the card was processed, which can subsequently result in failed <b>payments.</b> <b>Remote</b> wireless terminals can transmit card data using either cellular or satellite networks.|$|R

40|$|There {{are more}} than 5. 6 billion mobile phone users worldwide, making mobile phones more common than PCs. Mobile {{technology}} is a modern phenomenon with {{a great impact on}} industries and our society. Mobile phones began as very limited devices that provided only voice services. Today, these devices also provide a myriad of data services that allow us to browse the Internet, send text messages, check emails, watch movies, listen to music, take pictures, record videos, play video games and read documents. Mobile can also be used for payments, thus adopted by merchants in such a way to provide a new way for their customers to make their purchases. 	Different systems and business models have been developed for enabling Mobile Payments such as "Proximity" systems based on NFC technology and "Remote" systems that use the Mobile Operator's network and mostly widely adopted technologies such as SMS, WAP and Mobile Internet. Mobile <b>remote</b> <b>payment</b> systems {{are one of the most}} popular technologies for transactions today, especially across the media and online industries. 	Prior research mostly focuses on technology innovation or consumer-centric view while there is still less knowledge related to supply-side perspective and merchant attitude towards adoption of Mobile Payments. Literature is even more scarce when it comes to understanding the merchant adoption of specific Mobile Payment Systems such as "Remote Payment" systems based on carrier billing technologies. Typically, these systems have been widely adopted by merchants around the world and for some have become a phenomenal tool of success. There is also scarcity of research describing the operative factors affecting the deployment and management of Mobile Payments. 	This research is an exploratory research of the merchant adoption of Carrier Billed Mobile Remote Payments. This qualitative study was based on in depth interviews conducted on executives and managers from 15 international companies that operate globally in the digital space and that have made a successful use of Mobile Remote Payments. 	The results of this research are divided into two parts. In the first one, which is dedicated to the "Strategic Phase", the research aims to understand what enables, drives and inhibits the adoption of Mobile <b>Remote</b> <b>Payment</b> systems by merchants. In the second part, the “Operative Phase”, the research instead outlines the factors driving or inhibiting the successful deployment and management of such systems by merchants. Both parts are organized into descriptive frameworks where the factors identified are analyzed in great detail and explained also through direct quotes of the interviewees. 	What emerges from the “Strategic” part of this study is that in order for merchants to adopt Mobile Remote Payments, they must operate within very strict limitations, such as offering mainly digital goods and services and within a micro-transaction based business model. Furthermore, these merchants have to bear incredibly high commissions if compared to credit card or other payment tools. However it emerges that this tool is so simple and secure to use, and immediately available to anybody with a mobile phone that it produces key beneficial factors for the merchants that really drive their adoption. These factors include addressing unbanked users (Young people, emerging markets), increasing impulse purchases and the possibility of developing new business models. 	The result of the study of the operative phase shows that 4 macro factors clearly need to be considered when merchants deploy and manage a Mobile <b>Remote</b> <b>Payment</b> system. These are 1) Purchase Experience; 2) Payment System Reputation; 3) Merchant – Provider Relationship; 4) Price Structure and Billing Policies...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{restaurant}} industry {{has so far}} been cautious in adopting electronic payment technology for customer use, but a survey of 385 U. S. restaurant operators suggests that this is about to change. Nearly all of the respondents were aware of customer-facing payment technology (CFPT), such as mobile wallets, tabletop boxes, and <b>remote</b> <b>payment</b> mechanisms, and nearly half of them expected to install such equipment {{in the next year or}} two. At the time of this survey, however, only one-eighth of the respondents had installed such technology. Potential benefits from allowing customers to pay electronically include faster settlement, less wait-staff time needed, greater security, improved customer satisfaction, reduced labor costs, increased revenue, and access to better customer data. Ironically, security is also considered to be a potential barrier. Other barriers include infrastructure issues, the cost of CFPT devices, the cost of integrating CFPT with existing POS and payment systems, the impact of reduced customer contact, and the fact that the CFPT industry is still highly fragmented. Survey respondents believed they were saving money with the new technology, but they also cautioned that any payment mechanism must synchronize with the POS system...|$|E
40|$|Smartphone apps {{are often}} granted to {{privilege}} {{to run with}} access to the network and sensitive local resources. This makes it difficult for remote endpoints to place any trust in the provenance of network connections originat-ing from a user’s device. Even on the phone, different apps with distinct privilege sets can communicate with one another. This can allow one app to trick another into improperly exercising its privileges (resulting in a confused deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security mechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, Quire tracks the call chain of on device IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the reduced privileges of its callers or exercising its full priv-ilege set by actiing explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight signature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be verified by any app on the same phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in network RPCs. This allows remote systems visibility into the state of the phone when the RPC was made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example applications: an advertising service that runs advertise-ments separately from their hosting applications, and a <b>remote</b> <b>payment</b> system. We show that Quire’s perfor-mance overhead is minimal. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} mobile payments {{market is}} expected to have reached “$ 171. 5 billion as a total in 2012, with a 61. 9 % increase compared to 2011 ” and a constant annual forecasted growth of 42 % until 2016 according to (Christy, 2012, para. 1). In this fast growing market, there are two major categories identified, according to (Cluckey, 2011, p. 1) : proximity and <b>remote</b> <b>payments.</b> For the mobile proximity case, NFC is a technology that has seen a tremendous hype in the last years. However, barcode and QR code are also relevant and are addressed in the analysis section as well. NFC is a set of wireless standards based technology, that functions in short distance radio frequency identification (RFID) of approximately 4 inches and that can be applied in areas from simple data transfers to payments, by replacing credit card, according to (Hasoo, Lee, & Heekuck Oh, 2013). The same source mentions that the protocol is extremely secure, by granting privacy of the user and in the same time enabling personalized services, fact seen as very suitable for its usage in mobile payments services. Thus, in mobile proximity payments, NFC is a set of standards that enable device-to-device communication between mobile phones and other pieces of equipment, such as POS terminals. The thesis focuses mainly on NFC “self-organized” phone-based schemes, (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), owned by players such as Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer that are looking forward to enter the market from outside and thus cause disruption in relation to the already existing initiatives, the “operator-driven ones” (J. Ondrus & Pigneur, 2005, p. 2), where the banks and MNOs take the lead together. In the current thesis, the concept of the operator-driven models is extended to that of collaboration models(Smart Card Alliance, 2008), referred here as the collaborative models. These type of models are already working according to the functional standardized “four corners card payment working model” (LLC, 2010, p. 1) and have the banks as leaders in network in charge of payments, and the mobile network operators, responsible for storing the payment credentials in the mobile handsets. According to (LLC, 2010), the four corners card payment model links the buyer and the merchants through their issuing and acquiring banks, by making use of the card schemes companies (ex. Visa, MasterCard, Maestro). Thus, these so called “disruptive or insurgent players” (Jan Ondrus & Lyytinen, 2011,p. 2) have different organizational models compared to what is considered the traditional, reference one, in their attempt to step in the in-store payment by making use of NFC or other proximity payments technologies. Thus, companies such as Google, PayPal, and A Handset Manufacturer might find themselves in a position to exploit at maximum their resources and chose suitable strategies in relation to the other actors to gain support for initiatives and so reach success, by giving a high value for the network they are part of. Taking into account this problem, the research question to be answered is the following: What kind of network strategies should new-coming players in the mobile proximity payment market Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer deploy in relation to the most relevant actors in their networks, in order to ensure their successfulness in the international market? For answering the research question, the author has created a theoretical framework that is applied to reach the research objective. It is important to emphasize that when referring to strategies, the researcher refers to certain manners the owners of the three disruptive ecosystems should treat the relation with the most important actors in their network in order to obtain support and obtain “multiple sourcing” for their models (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 41). That is why he names them “network strategies”. For this, {{it should be noted that}} the researcher considers that the more support in the network an owner of a certain value proposition has, the higher the chances for reaching success are. That is because he views success mainly from the perspective of the value delivered inside the value network. That means that certain “blocking parties” or parties with “diffuse power position” (Bruijn & Ten Heuvelhof, 2008, p. 40 - 41) should be dealt with in such a manner that more support is built with them and blockage is avoided. On the other hand, parties with “production power” should be kept close to the value proposition and involved in key decisions and benefits sharing. In order to measure the potential success of the disruptors and, based on that, derive the degree of successfulness of the strategies, the researcher has created a successfulness indicator, based on a network approach. This indicator measures success by taking into account the roles of the most important actors in the network (ex. how many supporters, blockers). The research approach taken to solve the problem is that of comparative analysis, between the roles that the most important actors (ex. banks, MNOs, card payment scheme) have in the new entrants’ ecosystems (Google, PayPal and A Handset Manufacturer) vis-à-vis their considered, static roles in the collaborative, traditional, operator-centric model. The latter is used as a reference, because it is considered in this research as the traditional, established model of performing mobile payments, as being based on the already standardized four corners model. In addition, all the critical parties seem to align their interests and thus increase the value for the all network in this case, thus labeling this model as Highly successful. As this latter model is considered a reference, it is the change in roles for the most important actors in the three disruptive networks compared to it that is relevant for giving insights regarding successfulness and then right network strategies that should be recommended. In order to be able to gather information about the case studies analyzed and then clarify the roles of the parties and then also quantify success, the researcher makes use of a business model based on platform theory called VISOR. For the collaborative model, the researcher uses a simple stakeholder analysis. As a manner of gathering data, the researcher has performed two sets of interviews. The first set was focused on gathering information about the business models of the disruptors and of the collaborative case. For this, he retrieved information from 7 consultants working for THE CLIENT, as well as consulting specialized materials about mobile payments. The second set of interviews was used in order to clarify the roles of the most important actors (ex. banks, card payment schemes and banks), by involving 7 experienced experts belonging to the entire mobile payments field. This set of interviews was recorded, transcribed and coded. The conclusions of the research are that Google scores “Low” as successfulness potential, PayPal “Low towards Medium”, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s model is labeled as “High”. This is placed in the context where the reference, the collaborative model, is also labeled as High. That justification of these results is given by the fact that whereas Google has 3 major blockers and no supporters in its network on its Google Wallet’s product and PayPal has only 2, but still no major supporters, A Handset Manufacturer’s model is backed by 3 strong parties and 2 that seem possible to be activated. Thus, the researcher argues that the network strategies of A Handset Manufacturer’s are potentially more successful than Google’s and PayPal’s. Google is advised to bring banks and card payments schemes closer to the Google Wallet initiative, PayPal to strengthen the relationship with the banks for its close loop mobile in-store payment model, whereas A Handset Manufacturer’s should continue to focus on the relationship with the banks and build scale.
