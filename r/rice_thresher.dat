40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>threshing</b> in Nigeria {{remains a}} problem to the average peasant farmer. The {{techniques}} for <b>threshing</b> <b>rice</b> are still the traditional method of hand beating.

Physical properties of Faro 51 rice such as length and breadth of grain, grain/straw ratio and moisture content were studied. The thresher was evaluated in terms of threshing efficiency, cleaning efficiency and percentage grain loss. At an average moisture content of 13. 83 % (wet basis), and design cylinder speed of 556 rpm, test results reveal that the thresher has a threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 98. 01 and 99. 32 % respectively and total percent losses of 4. 78 %.

In the process of variable-mass and constant-mass <b>rice</b> <b>threshing,</b> when the feeding rates were 5, 6, and 7 kg s- 1 in the test-bed, the flow rates from the tangential-flow device were 4. 07, 5. 01, and 5. 95 kg s- 1, respectively. The average power consumption of the tangential-flow drum in variable mass threshing process was higher than that in the constant mass threshing process by 2. 16, 2. 73, and 3. 09 kW, respectively.
