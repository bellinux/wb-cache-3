50|$|The <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>antwren</b> often feeds {{in pairs}} or small groups, often joining mixed flocks of small birds flitting through the lower {{parts of the}} canopy, often {{foraging}} higher in the trees than other related species. The diet consists of insects and spiders, {{most of which are}} found by probing into rolled-up leaves. The nest is a dome-shaped construction with a side-entrance; breeding takes place in February in Ecuador.|$|E
50|$|The Napo {{stipple-throated antwren}} is about 11 cm long. The male has mainly brown upper parts with a reddish-brown back and rump, and black wing coverts with white speckling and two white bars. The male's throat is black spotted with white, and {{the sides of}} the head, the breast and belly are grey. The female is similar to the male but the wing coverts are tipped with buff and {{the sides of the}} face and the throat are ochre, the throat {{sometimes}} being tinged with red. In both sexes, the colour of the iris is variable and can be orange, dark or whitish, and the tail is brown which distinguishes this species from the <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>antwren</b> (Epinecrophylla erythrura). The song is a trill of short, staccato notes, first rising in pitch and then descending.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rufous-tailed</b> <b>antwren</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 11.5 cm and has a {{slightly}} longer tail than {{other members of the}} genus. The male has olive-brown upper parts with a chestnut back and tail, and pale tips to the wing coverts. The throat and breast are grey, sometimes with a dark [...] "scaled" [...] effect, and the belly is olive brown. The female is similar but the throat and breast are buff-ochre and the belly dull brown. In both sexes, the iris is red or orange and the bill is dark. The male is {{the only member of the}} genus without a contrasting throat patch. The female is similar in appearance to the stipple-throated antwren (Epinecrophylla haematonota), but that has no chestnut on its back. The song is a high-pitched, rather squeaky series of notes.|$|E
