It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E

500|$|I {{wanted the}} words to reflect the {{architecture}} of the building. Its copper dome <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. —Gwyneth Lewis ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{was among}} those who {{strongly}} supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for [...] "its heedless energy and joy, it <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> how I felt the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way".|$|E

500|$|The {{composer}} Granville Bantock was enlisted as musical {{director in}} 1897 at the ballroom to provide music each weekday {{for six hours}} of ballroom dancing. To begin with, as the tower was being erected, {{he was in charge}} of a [...] "semi-military band" [...] that played outdoors with the fear that the tower might fall upon him and his players. Bantock is quoted as saying, [...] "The noise of the riveting of the tower while we were playing... <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the anvil music in Das Rheingold". Bantock often played for the workmen during their lunch breaks, when they could frequently be heard saying, [...] "play it again, guv'nor".|$|E

500|$|Flaming Pie is {{the tenth}} solo studio album by Paul McCartney {{under his own}} name, first {{released}} in 1997. His first studio album in over four years, it was mostly recorded following McCartney's involvement in the highly successful Beatles Anthology project. The album was recorded in several locations over two years, 1995 and 1997, featuring two songs dating from 1992. The album featured several of McCartney's family members and friends, most notably McCartney's son, James McCartney. In Flaming Pies liner notes, McCartney said: [...] " [...] <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> The Beatles' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So {{in a way it}} was a refresher course that set the framework for this album." ...|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish. It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> growing up in Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the album}} credits for the {{instruments}} have fanciful names that describe the sound they make. The [...] "Castanet Guitars" [...] are electric guitars played with mallets and are electronically treated to sound something like castanets. The [...] "Leslie piano" [...] is an acoustic piano miked and fed through a Leslie speaker with a built-in revolving horn speaker. Eno described the [...] "snake guitar" [...] and [...] "digital guitar" [...] by stating [...] "the kind of lines I was playing <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the way a snake moves through the brush, a sort of speedy, forceful, liquid quality. Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound." ...|$|E

500|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel {{called the}} LP [...] "probably the most {{valuable}} contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver", praising it for being completely dissimilar from anything the Beatles had done. The magazine Cheetah gave the album a rave review, observing that [...] "the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its Rousseau-like animals and forest, and {{the smoke from the}} cabin chimney spelling out the title.... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood." [...] Journalist Richard Goldstein remembers his review for The New York Times: [...] "I was struck by its fragile melodies and their relationship to sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now 'hushed with wonder,' <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Fauré Requiem, but they were utterly American." ...|$|E
500|$|At the post-race podium interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula 1 driver David Coulthard, Nico Rosberg hailed an [...] "awesome weekend" [...] {{and said that}} the start had been the key factor to his victory. Kimi Räikkönen and Ferrari in turn lamented their dismal start, saying that it might have cost him the victory. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene lauded Räikkönen's drive as [...] "absolutely spectacular", adding: [...] "If you look at the overtake around the outside of [...] Ricciardo, he <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the driver from the old times. It was very, very good for me." [...] Lewis Hamilton rued his second unfortunate start incident in a row, which he described as [...] "perhaps [...] more painful" [...] than the incident at the previous race. He stressed the fact that with the damage to his car from the first-turn contact he was unable to keep up Räikkönen's speed ahead of him.|$|E
500|$|Tung's men charged {{forward in}} a V-shaped riot formation. According to Halberstam, [...] "they pranced into the pagoda, looking {{something}} like a smart football team coming up {{to the line of}} scrimmage". In the end, it took around two hours to complete the raids because many of the occupants had entrenched themselves inside the various rooms in anticipation of the attacks and doors had to be unhinged to reach them. According to journalist Neil Sheehan, who was at the scene, [...] "The raid on Xá Lợi, like those on the pagodas elsewhere in South Vietnam, was flawlessly executed. It <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a scene from a movie of the French Resistance—the scene when the Gestapo arrive at the Resistance hideout in Paris." [...] William Prochnau said that [...] "Using the elite guard against the Buddhists was analogous to using Green Berets to put down Negro protests at home. It was outrageous." ...|$|E

500|$|While the {{hurricane}} was passing nearby, Grand Turk reported winds of 120mph (193km/h). According to a ship {{report in the}} region, [...] "The force of the wind... could only {{be judged by the}} noise made by the storm, which <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the New York subway going full speed passing switches." [...] Winds approached 120mph (193km/h) at Nassau before the anemometer failed. In addition to the winds, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, totaling 9in (228mm) in Nassau. As in Puerto Rico, authorities in the Bahamas had ample warning of {{the hurricane}}'s approach, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. Two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in Grand Turk, although the crews were saved. A sloop traversing from Ambergris Caye to Grand Turk was lost, killing all 18people on board. The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Bahamas, mostly to property and crops.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Open Salon.com enjoyed the episode, writing [...] "While I enjoyed {{the last eight}} weeks of {{alternate}} universe hijinks, this week's episode <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what I had been missing from the earlier seasons... It's nice to know we'll {{be back with our}} good old regular Earth-1 team for the foreseeable future. Overall, this week was really well done - very effectively creepy, well directed and plotted with just the right about of gore to make you jump". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Marionette" [...] the eleventh best episode of the series, calling it [...] "a strong, disturbing outing that was part of Fringes mid-series peak, in which the show found its best storytelling voice by crafting strange, emotionally resonant case-of-the-week plots that thematically paralleled the ongoing character arcs in ways that felt organic, not contrived." [...] In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the third best of the entire series.|$|E
