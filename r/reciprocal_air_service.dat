40|$|International air {{services}} are regulated by a complex web of bilateral and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Service</b> Agreements (ASAs), which {{were designed to}} protect national carriers, but now limit {{the ways in which}} carriers can provide air services. 2 Some countries have begun to liberalise ASAs, creating opportunities for carriers and users of air services to benefit through improvements in productivity and wellbeing. ASAs are in part based on Freedoms of the air (Box 1). They can also (WTO 2006) : • restrict the number of airlines servicing a particular route • limit the number of airports to which foreign carriers have access to • set quotas on the number of seats that carriers may provide — sometimes by specifying the aircraft type allowed to service a route • limit the frequency of flights on a weekly or monthly basis • require the carriers to agree on uniform airfares • enable governments to veto proposed changes in airfares • require carriers to be substantially owned and effectively controlled by the country or the nationals of that country • limit the operation of non-scheduled services, such as chartered flights...|$|E
