50|$|One type of {{regulatory}} signs are traffic signs intended to instruct road users {{on what they}} must or should do (or not do) under a given set of circumstances. Other types may be signs located on streets and in parking lots {{having to do with}} parking, signs in public parks and on beaches or on or in architectural facilities prohibiting specific types of activities. The term <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> describes a range of signs that are used to indicate or reinforce traffic laws, regulations or requirements which apply either at all times or at specified times or places upon a street or highway, the disregard of which may constitute a violation, or signs in general that regulate public behavior in places open to the public.|$|E
50|$|Mandatory {{signs are}} {{a subset of the}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> group as defined by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968, and are often seen not just on their own, but used in {{conjunction}} with other signs, traffic lights and bollards as a form of visual shorthand within these objects. In Vienna Convention signatories, the mandatory sign is either a light blue circle with a white border (Type A) or a white circle with a red border (Type B). The sign must be at least 60 cm (1.96 ft) across on rural roads, or 40 cm (1.31 ft) in built-up areas, although mandatory signs incorporated in traffic lights, bollards or larger road signs can be as little as 30 cm (0.98 ft) in diameter.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, {{most notably}} the Southeastern, there often is a [...] "continuous-flow" [...] lane. This lane is {{protected}} by a single, constant-green arrow pointing down at the lane(s) permitting the continuous flow of traffic, {{without regard to the}} condition of signals for other lanes or cross streets. Continuous lanes are restricted in that vehicles turning from a side street may not cross over the double white line to enter the continuous lane, and no lane changes are permitted to the continuous lane from an adjacent lane or from the continuous lane to an adjacent lane, until the double white line has been passed. Some continuous lanes are protected by a raised curb located between the continuous lane and a normal traffic lane, with white and/or yellow reflective paint or tape, prohibiting turning or adjacent traffic from entering the lane. Continuous-flow traffic lanes are found only at [...] "T" [...] intersections where there is no side street or driveway entrance {{on the right side of}} the main thoroughfare; additionally, no pedestrians are permitted to cross the main thoroughfare at intersections with a continuous-flow lane, although crossing at the side street may be permitted. Intersections with continuous-flow lanes will be posted with a white <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> approximately [...] before the intersection with the phrase, [...] "right lane continuous traffic," [...] or other, similar, wording. If the arrow is extinguished for any reason, whether by malfunction or design, traffic through the continuous lane will revert to the normal traffic pattern for adjacent lanes, except that turning or moving into or out of the restricted lane is still prohibited.|$|E
40|$|Intersections pose {{a risk to}} drivers, as {{they are}} {{the point at which}} {{different}} directions of traffic converge. Indeed a large proportion of serious and fatal crashes on Australian road occur in these circumstances. While some intersections provide less opportunity for crashes than others, unsignalised T-intersections on rural roads have the combined danger of reliance upon appropriate gap-judgments of minor road drivers turning on to the major road and the regulated high-speeds of the major road drivers. The current study investigated a strategy to mitigate high-speed crashes on rural roads by reducing the speed of major road drivers on approach to an intersecting minor road. Using a fixed-based medium-fidelity driving simulator, drivers’ speeds on major roads with intersecting minor roads were compared across three different types of warning signs. These were, a standard static side-road warning sign and two dynamic, two-state warning signs that activated when vehicles were present on the minor road. A further aim was to compare whether a <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign,</b> which when activated, mandated a speed of 80 km/h (reduced from 100 km/h), or an advisory sign, recommending a speed of 80 km/h when activated was the most effective in reducing speed. Results indicated that when compared to the standard warning sign, dynamic regulatory and advisory signs were effective in reducing speed. However, while drivers largely complied with the regulated speed decrease of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign,</b> selected speeds were reliably higher than recommended by the advisory sign...|$|E
40|$|In this report, we {{show that}} gap genes encode exactly one set of pair-rule stripes, which occur in the native even-skipped position. The core of this work is a {{detailed}} analysis that shows how this conclusion follows from the arrangement of gap domains in the embryo. This analysis shows that: (1) pattern forming information is transmitted from gap to pair-rule genes {{by means of a}} nonredundant set of morphogenetic gradients, and (2) the stripe forming capability of the gap genes is constrained by the arrangement of these gradients and by the fact that each gap domain consists of a pair of correlated gradients. We also show that in the blastoderm, the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> of a transcriptional regulator is unlikely to change in a concentration dependent manner. The principal analytic tool used to establish these results is the gene circuit method. Here, this method is applied to examine hybrid data sets consisting of real gene expression data for four gap genes and hypothetica [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{shortage}} of highway funds precludes the immediate replacement {{of most of}} the bridges that have been evaluated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete or both. A low water stream crossing (LWSC) affords an economical alternative to the replacement of a bridge with another bridge in many instances. However, the potential liability that might be incurred from the use of LWSCs has served as a deterrent to their use. Nor have guidelines for traffic control devices been developed for specific application to LWSCs. This research addressed the problems of liability and traffic control {{associated with the use of}} LWSCs. Input to the findings from this research was provided by several persons contacted by telephone plus 189 persons who responded to a questionnaire concerning their experience with LWSCs. It was concluded from this research that a significant potential for accidents and liability claims could result from the use of LWSCs. However, it was also concluded that this liability could be reduced to within acceptable limits if adequate warning of the presence of an LWSC were afforded to road users. The potential for accidents and liability could further be reduced if vehicular passage over an LWSC were precluded during periods when the road was flooded. Under these conditions, it is believed, the potential for liability from the use of an LWSC on an unpaved, rural road would be even less than that resulting from the continuing use of an inadequate bridge. The signs recommended for use in advance of an LWSC include two warning signs and one <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> with legends as follows: FLOOD AREA AHEAD, IMPASSABLE DURING HIGH WATER, DO NOT ENTER WHEN FLOODED. Use of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign</b> would require an appropriate resolution by the Board of Supervisors having responsibility for a county road. Other recommendations include the optional use of either a supple mental distance advisory plate or an advisory speed plate, or both, under circumstances where these may be needed. It was also recommended HR- 218 Liability & Traffic Control Considerations for Low Water Stream Crossings that LWSCs be used only on unpaved roads and that they not be used in locations where flooding of an LWSC would deprive dwelling places of emergency ground access...|$|E
40|$|Reconstructing biomolecular {{networks}} {{from time}} series mRNA or protein abundance measurements {{is a central}} challenge in computational systems biology. The regulatory processes behind cellular responses are coupled and nonlinear, leading to rich dynamical behavior. One class of reconstruction algorithms uses regression and penalized regression to impose sparseness on the solution, as requested biologically. Motivated by the five-gene challenge in the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods 2 (DREAM 2) contest, we extend and test penalized regression schemes both on data from simulations and real qPCR measurements. The methods showing best performance are the Adaptive Ridge (AR) regression and a new extension thereof, in which we impose a biological constraint to the reconstructed network. Specifically, we request from the solutions that the outgoing links have the same <b>regulatory</b> <b>sign,</b> which is a reasonable approximation for most prokaryotic transcriptional networks. In other words, a given regulator must be either an activator or a repressor but not both. The constraints can be implemented with quadratic programming, and we show that this improves the reconstruction performance significantly. While linear models are not sufficiently general to encompass most complex behaviors, they offer powerful tools for network reconstruction, particularly for systems operating near a steady state. In particular, the optimization problems are well behaved and methodologies allow finding global optima efficiently. Adding constraints reflecting biological circuit designs {{is one of the}} most important aspects of network inference. We propose one such constraint, namely the consistency in the signs of outgoing links, which will facilitate the inference of transcriptional regulatory networks.
