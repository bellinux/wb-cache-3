40|$|The various {{problems}} in regional spatial planning in Waropen District Papua {{shows that the}} Spatial Planning RTRW of Waropen District Papua drafted in 2010 {{has not had a}} positive contribution to the settlement of spatial planning problems. This is most likely caused by the inconsistency in the spatial planning. This study tried to observe the consistency of spatial planning as well as its relation to the <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> performance. The method used to observe the consistency of the preparation of guided Spatial Planning RTRW is the analysis of comparative table followed by analysis of verbal logic. In order to determine if the preparation of Spatial Planning RTRW has already paid attention on the synergy with the surrounding regions Inter-Regional Context a map overlay was conducted followed by analysis of verbal logic. To determine the performance of the <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> a Principal <b>Components</b> Analysis PCA was done.

I highlight the interactions of the Chinese state, transnational corporations (TNCs), and regional assets in shaping the trajectories of <b>regional</b> <b>development.</b> I argue that Kunshan’s pathway to globalizing <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> is state centered and heavily dependent on global forces, which has made Kunshan a TNC satellite district and a dual city segmented between TNCs and domestic firms.
