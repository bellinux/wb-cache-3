2500|$|Delbarton {{operates}} an 8:10a.m. to 2:41p.m. schedule, {{including six}} class periods and lunch. The schedule is a six-day <b>rotating</b> <b>block</b> schedule ("A day" [...] through [...] "F day") with one class {{dropping out of}} the schedule each of the six days. The blocks are named each school year in keeping with the year's academic theme, which honors figures of heroism, social justice, promoters of worldwide peace, or historically important people. All students have a thirty-minute free period ("M block") from 10 to 10:35 AM. Teachers, guidance, and college counseling are available during M block and after school for extra assistance as needed. Although the school day ends at 2:35 PM, the first buses do not leave campus until 4:00 PM, which encourages students to pursue extracurricular activities, work with faculty on homework and special projects, and volunteer on one of the many community service projects the school sponsors. Late bus service is also offered at 6:00 PM.|$|E
2500|$|The {{school is}} unique from other {{high schools in}} the {{district}} in that it offers a different range of classes. The core classes of English, social studies/Human Geography, and environmental science offered at SES are wrapped together in an interdisciplinary learning block of 180 minutes called house. During the balance of the day the school offers elective classes such as art, chemistry, physics, and mentorship. SES offers math classes from Algebra II to Advanced Placement Calculus. SES also has a language program, currently teaching French and Spanish. [...] SES has a <b>rotating</b> <b>block</b> schedule in that there are two schedules that alternate day to day: Sky and Earth days. This allows students to take four electives, and also experience a class schedule closer to that of most colleges. Career Courses, such as Animal Care and Music Production, are also offered at school. These are a step above elective classes, and are designed for upperclassmen who are searching for a career to look into.|$|E

3000|$|Interpolated {{reference}} frames {{exist in}} all codecs which implement fractional-pixel accuracy MCP. The rotation coordinates can be precomputed. Therefore the only computation complexity increase in our proposed method is the additional number of block matching between the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> {{and the current}} block. Another overhead will be the number of bits required to code the best matched rotation angle. However, if we control the number of rotation angles to be used, we can use a few bits to represent the angles {{and at the same}} time reduce the computation complexity required. Experiments show that up to 37 % of the blocks can be better predicted with rotational MCP. The angle of rotation is usually small, especially for static video sequences like Akiyo. This is reasonable as objects between frames usually will not rotate a lot. We define search angle interval and search angle range so that the number of block matching between the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> and the current block is fixed.

40|$|The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) {{is widely}} used in lossy image and video {{compression}} schemes, e. g., JPEG and MPEG.

In particular, higher compression ratios are achieved when edges are aligned with the image axes. To maximize compression for general images, we propose a <b>rotated</b> <b>block</b> DCT method. It consists of <b>rotating</b> each <b>block,</b> before applying the DCT, by an angle that aligns the edges, and <b>rotating</b> back the <b>block</b> in the decompression stage.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method called <b>rotate</b> intra <b>block</b> copy, which extends the intra block copy {{technique}} {{by making the}} block matching process invariant to rotation. HEVC intra prediction plus <b>rotate</b> intra <b>block</b> copy gives an average of 20 % reduction in residual energy (i. e. prediction error) compared to HEVC intra prediction plus intra block copy. As the motion vector correlation in <b>rotate</b> intra <b>block</b> copy {{is different from the}} intra block copy, a new method of motion vector coding is presented. The impact of angular resolution on residual energy reduction is also evaluated.

September 4, 1903, the large bell suspended above the new wooden four-story building rang for the first time, indicating the beginning of school and the onset of a school legacy.In 2016, Benedictine Hall was transformed into a STEM Building, to configure new science and math classrooms.For the 2017-2018 school year SSA will no longer operate on a 4x4 block schedule, but a <b>rotating</b> <b>block</b> schedule. The new SSA <b>rotating</b> <b>block</b> schedule is structured with five courses meeting for 75 minutes each day. Math and Science courses are paired to ensure connection-making between the two subjects. Meeting for a 75 minute block ensures enough time for in-depth, rigorous, hands-on teaching resulting in increased achievement, comprehension and enjoyment of learning. Additionally, because students earn eight credits per year, they are able to select more electives giving them a stronger educational background with a total of 32 credits in only four years, compared to the typical 28 that most schools offer.|$|E
40|$|Continental rifting is a {{fundamental}} component of the plate tectonic cycle. The West Iberia passive margin {{is a classic example}} of a nonvolcanic rifted margin. The West Iberia margin contains an enigmatic north-south ridge of serpentinized peridotite located within the ocean-continent transition. Interpretation of multichannel seismic data and tectonic subsidence analyses suggests that the ridge is located within a broad zone of exhumed mantle that has been serpentinized. This implies that seafloor spreading does not immediately follow continental breakup. Where the peridotite ridge is well-developed, it parallels a deeply-penetrating, west-dipping normal fault. Hydrodynamic circulation drove seawater down this fault close to the beginning of seafloor spreading and caused a concentration of serpentinization at its base. This water-driven process of formation accounts for the variability of the ridge along strike. Prestack depth migration of a 340 km long seismic reflection profile across the margin served as the basis for stratigraphic interpretation. The proximal margin displays horsts and grabens, with 1 [...] 2 km thick synrift deposits from Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) rifting. The deep water margin displays <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks</b> with distinct internal seismic patterns. These blocks formed during the final Cretaceous rifting event that led to continental breakup, and contain earlier Valanginian synrift deposits as part of the <b>rotated</b> <b>blocks,</b> thus providing evidence of two separate rifting stages along this profile. A large mantle-penetrating fault located seaward of the last <b>rotated</b> <b>block</b> of continental crust provides evidence for a third and final Cretaceous rifting event that may have been coeval with early seafloor spreading. Two independent estimates of crustal thickness along this line indicate stretching factors of 50 % on the proximal margin (corresponding to a continental crustal thickness of ∼ 16 km), increasing to 100 % in the deep water. Plate tectonics is one of the most important concepts that Earth Scientists can convey to the public. While this concept is often presented at the middle school level in Texas, the appropriateness of teaching plate tectonics to middle school students has been questioned. We present data that suggest that middle school students grasp the abstract concepts of plate tectonics as well as college students...|$|R

40|$|Pressure and {{performance}} requirements of axial piston pumps {{and the proportion}} of churning losses in axial piston pumps increase significantly with increasing speed. To investigate the primary distribution of churning losses in axial piston pumps at various ranges of speed, a test rig was set up in which other friction losses can be eliminated, thus making it possible to investigate the net churning losses in an axial piston pump. The influence of the <b>rotating</b> cylinder <b>block</b> and pistons on churning losses is analyzed based on a qualitative evaluation of the various fluid flow regimes at different test speeds in an axial piston pump. The analytical results indicate that pistons have less influence on churning losses than the <b>rotating</b> cylinder <b>block</b> beyond the critical speed in axial piston pumps, because the total energy dissipation transforms laminar viscous friction losses into turbulent shear stress losses. It is concluded that more attention should be given to the effect of the <b>rotating</b> cylinder <b>block</b> on churning losses in axial piston pumps at high rotation speed...|$|R
