50|$|The USLE was {{developed}} from erosion plot and <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulator</b> experiments. The USLE {{is composed of}} six factors to predict the long-term average annual soil loss (A). The equation includes the rainfall erosivity factor (R), the soil erodibility factor (K), the topographic factors (L and S) and the cropping management factors (C and P). The equation takes the simple product form:The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept. The unit plot {{is defined as the}} standard plot condition to determine the soil's erodibility. These conditions are when the LS factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 72.6 feet) where the plot is fallow and tillage is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1). In this state:A simpler method to predict K was presented by Wischmeier et al. which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability. The soil erodibility factor K can be approximated from a nomograph if this information is known. The LS factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope. The cropping management factor (C) and conservation practices factor (P) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data. They are described in soil loss ratios (C or P with / C or P without).|$|E

The use of rainfall simulators has become more widespread with the development of automated instrumentation and control systems which offer a physically based system of predicting soil erosion.

The goal was to identify initially fast growing vegetation that demonstrates long-term erosion control effectiveness. Native plant species common to District 5, along the California Central Coast, were used. Treatments were conducted in 0. 6 by 2 m by 30 cm soil test boxes set at a 2 : 1 (H:V) slope. Boxes were filled with a medium sandy loam soil (USDA), typical of District 5 fill slopes, compacted to 90 percent. Erosion control treatments included combinations of imprinted straw and hydroseeding of fiber, fertilizer, and tackifier. All boxes were planted with the same native seed mix that included shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Norton Ladder <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulators</b> were used to simulate natural rainfall patterns found in the area. The rainfall regimes applied were natural precipitation, 53. 3 cm (21 in/yr during the study period) and uniform rainfall at the mean annual rate, 56 cm (22 in/yr), half the mean annual rate, 28 cm(11 in/yr) and double the mean annual rate, 111 cm (44 in/yr).

40|$|Rainfall {{simulators}} {{represent a}} widespread tool for studying hydrologic processes involving interactions of rainwater with soils, such as soil erosion, overland flow generation, and infiltration. Nevertheless, researchers must often develop devices suiting their particular needs, {{due to a}} lack of a standard design. In this case, a <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulator</b> was needed for the production of heavy rainfall, to be applied for the study of infiltration dynamics and landslide triggering on an artificial hillslope with a planar size of 2 m by 6 m. Therefore, the goal of this study was to design and test a <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulator</b> characterized by the following main properties: i) range of rainfall intensity varying from 50 to 150 mm/h, ii) spatial uniformity of the produced rain of at least 80 %, and iii) limited impact energy on the soil in order to avoid surface erosion, which can alter the infiltration processes responsible for the landslide triggering. To achieve these objectives, three nozzles were first individually tested, in order to identify the main variables affecting their functioning and performance. Further investigations were then carried out to find the best configuration of nozzles for the final version of the full-scale <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulator</b> and test its performance. Depending on the desired rainfall range, four different configurations of nozzles, distinguished by the number of active nozzles and their location, were chosen to cover the required intensity interval. The simulator performance was assessed via the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU), which resulted in values larger than 80 %. The drop size distribution was assessed by means of the oil method and used for the calibration of a numerical model aimed at estimating the impact energy of the drops falling onto the soil. This allowed for the assessment of the rainfall potential erosion and its spatial distribution, highlighting that the surface erosion generated by the proposed <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulator</b> is limited, corresponding to the kinetic energy exerted by natural rainfall rates of no more than 10 mm/h...|$|E

30|$|Previous studies rarely {{discussed}} probabilistic {{analyses of}} pluvial floods. Natural parameters {{are the most}} effective contributing factors associated with pluvial flood probability; these factors include land use (LU) types, magnitude of intensity precipitation, geomorphology, altitude, surface slope, and hydrological characteristics {{and should not be}} overlooked [3]. Though understanding PFF risk in urban is highly on demand, to date, a few studies struggled to model the potential area of PFFs in urban infrastructures. This difficulty may be due to lack of sufficient observations and precise data, struggle in systematic PFF modeling dynamics, and complexity of quantifying inundation model by spatial heterogeneity caused by rainfalls [19]. Basically, flood modeling mostly relies on water-level gauging and meteorological station historical data, which feature some drawbacks. Stations are not well distributed among study areas and are placed on river sites which cannot record the amount of surface water outside rivers; lack of sufficient number of stations used as historical inventory data also limits PFF probability and surface runoff simulation studies [20]. Intensityâ€“durationâ€“frequency curves are one of the gauging station-based traditional approaches for quantifying probability of rainfall events. However, stochastic, probabilistic, and spatial <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulators</b> were also established to accurately define possible precipitation spatial coverage and intensity and probability of pluvial occurrence instead of traditional approaches [21, 22, 23].|$|R
40|$|Nozzle-type <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulators</b> are {{commonly}} used in hydrologic and soil erosion research. Simulated rainfall intensity, originating from the nozzle, increases as {{the distance between the}} point of measurement and the source is decreased. Hence, rainfall measured using rain gauges would systematically overestimate the rainfall received at the ground level. A simple model was developed to adjust rainfall measured anywhere under the simulator to plot-wide average rainfall at the ground level. Nozzle height, plot width, gauge diameter and height, and gauge location are required to compute this adjustment factor. Results from 15 runs at different rain intensities and durations, and with different rain gauge layouts, showed that a simple average of measured rain would overestimate the plot-wide rain by about 20 per cent. Using the adjustment factor to convert measured rainfall for individual gauges before averaging improved the estimate of plot-wide rainfall considerably. For the 15 runs considered, overall discrepancy between actual and measured rain is reduced to less than 1 per cent with a standard error of 0 ç¹· mm. This model can be easily tested in the field by comparing rainfall depths of different sized gauges. With the adjustment factor they should all give very similar values.

40|$|In the past, <b>rainfall</b> <b>simulators</b> {{have been}} {{designed}} for high intensity events; however {{there is a lack}} of studies on the simulation of low rainfall intensities. This research presents a system capable of performing rainfall simulations over large areas with intensities as low as 15. 5 mm/h (0. 6 in/h) and a Coefficient of Variation greater than 0. 8. The system consists of towers distributed spatially in the corners of hypothetical equilateral triangles with varying sizes. The simulation area should be inside the triangles to ensure adequate coverage and minimize wind effects. Thus, the minimum configuration for the system is three towers. Each tower consists of three aluminum legs that are 2. 5 m (8 ft) high and support a 1 / 4 GG - SS 10 nozzle, manufactured by Spraying Systems Corporation. A pressure gauge is incorporated in each tower to monitor the flow. The water supply is pumped from a tank into a main hose that has a flow control and pressure gauge. The water is subdivided into individual hoses that supply water to each tower. The hose diameters vary according to the number of towers used in each simulation. This configuration is capable of simulating a wide range of rainfall intensities over small and large regions. The collection of the runoff is accomplished with a 1 1 / 2 in semicircular PVC Pipe. This system is applied to a research project that evaluates the impacts of dust suppressants on disturbed lands...|$|R
