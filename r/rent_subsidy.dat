25|$|In {{the field}} of housing, various {{measures}} were carried out to benefit householders, such as in improving the rights of tenants and increasing rental assistance. According to the <b>Rent</b> <b>Subsidies</b> Act (Wohngeldgestz) of 1970, “low-income tenants and owners of accommodations are supported with rents and burdens subsidies.” The determination of the income of families taken into consideration for housing allowances was simplified, and increased levels of protection and support for low-income tenants and householders were introduced {{which led to a}} drop in the number of eviction notices. By 1974, three times as much was paid out in <b>rent</b> <b>subsidies</b> as in 1969, and nearly one and a half million households received rental assistance. Increases were made in public housing subsidies, as characterised by a 36% increase in the social housing budget in 1970 and by the introduction of a programme for the construction of 200,000 public housing units (1971). From 1970 to 1971, an 18.1% increase in building permits for social housing units was made. Other reforms aimed at improving tenants' rights included protection against conversion of rental housing into condominiums, the prohibition of the misappropriation of living space, new regulation of the apartment broker system, and a fee scale for engineers and architects. In addition, the income limits for eligibility for social housing were raised and adapted in order of general income trends.|$|R
5000|$|Another form of Intermediate Rent {{is known}} as [...] "Rent to HomeBuy". This is where an {{applicant}} {{will be able to}} live in a property at a discounted rent for a period of three to five years at a subsidised rent, whilst keeping an option to purchase a percentage of the property at any point during the tenancy (typically 25%). This allows the household to live in the property of their choice, whilst using the money they save through the <b>rent</b> <b>subsidy</b> to save for a deposit.|$|E

In addition to its major programs, PHFA conducts housing studies, promotes counseling and education for renters and homebuyers, encourages supportive services at apartments it has financed, administers <b>rent</b> <b>subsidy</b> contracts for the Federal government of the United States, and acts as an advocate to promote the benefits of decent, affordable shelter for those who need it most.|$|E
50|$|Three to five {{young adults}} turn their home into a Moishe House with the {{financial}} assistance and guidance of the organization. In exchange for a <b>rent</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the residents agree to host a specific number of programs per month (typically 5-7) such as holiday celebrations, community service and social events. Moishe House aims to promote new Jewish leadership by providing young adults the opportunity to create and develop their own communities.Moishe House focuses on creating community for Jewish young adults by allowing residents to design and lead programs and activities that they deem relevant and interesting, without regard to a specific branch of Judaism. These programs include Shabbat dinners, social action activities, social events and more.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{relative}} cost-effectiveness of subsidies in incentivizing energy efficiency investment using a real option framework. I generalize a model of a sequential investment project involving two stages, design and construction stage, and investment lags and incorporate explicit consideration of dynamic subsidies. I apply this model to green construction projects and study how design <b>subsidies</b> and <b>rent</b> <b>subsidies</b> incentivizes investment in green buildings. My research questions address the impact of subsidies on the trigger prices for the two stages as well as that on the instantaneous project value. Although both design and <b>rent</b> <b>subsidies</b> can reduce trigger prices and enhance project value, design subsidies cost less both in reducing the first-stage trigger to a certain threshold and in inducing firms to switch from inefficient projects to efficient ones. Lastly, I evaluate the comparative statics of investment, showing how the patterns of lags and demand uncertainty affect the effectiveness of both subsidies. A noteworthy result is that quality switching from an inefficient project to an green alternative is more likely to occur when the uncertainty is smaller or the length of the construction stage is shorter. by Yue Pan.

50|$|The {{government}} {{increased the}} total number of houses built (especially lower-cost houses), sustained the building industry, increased government involvement in housing, and achieved stabilised property prices by the 3rd quarter of 1975. 31,000 houses completed in 1973-74, compared with 27,400 in 1972-73 and 22,400 in 1971-72. State Housing construction was also encouraged, with nearly 4,000 State Houses completed in 1975-76, compared with 700 constructed in 1972-73. The criteria for allocating State Housing was also changed, which led to more people being offered such houses. Income limits for 3% housing loans were also increased, and <b>rent</b> <b>subsidies</b> for pensioners were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|A {{regulation}} {{was introduced}} in September 1973 providing for the employment of persons “for whom {{it is difficult to}} find employment and who have been in prolonged unemployment.” In January 1974, a statutory minimum wage for young people between the ages of 15 and 22 was introduced, and in March 1974 the insurance scheme for wage and salary earners was extended to cover the costs of physiotherapy treatment “where this has been prescribed by a doctor.” In September 1975, a regulation on the promotion of vocational training for young people was introduced, aimed at “a great number of young people who, {{as a result of the}} present educational system, depend on on-the-job training within the framework of the Apprenticeship Law.” The chances of obtaining an individual <b>rent</b> <b>subsidy</b> were also significantly increased, while an Act of June 1975 amended a number of existing Acts “with a view to introducing changes regarding the organization and the districts of factory inspection and the inspection of ports and dangerous machinery,” and also conferred legislative powers on the Minister of Social Affairs under the Act “concerning the loading and unloading of ocean-going vessels and extended the scope of the Silicosis Act.” ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Rapid Re-Housing is {{a subset of the}} Housing First approach to end homelessness. Rapid Re-Housing programs are based upon the [...] "Housing First" [...] approach and the strong evidence base that stable housing promotes improved social and/or economic well-being. Experienced practitioners know that outcomes of services interventions are most successful from a stable permanent housing base. While many Housing First programs provide rental assistance, or help clients to access rent subsidies, the key difference between Rapid Re-Housing and Housing First programs is that Rapid Re-Housing always provides a short-term <b>rent</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the subsidy is time-limited and ends within 3-6 months generally, and services end when the subsidy ends. As with the Housing First approach, the goals are to help people obtain housing quickly, increase self-sufficiency, and remain housed. The Core Components of rapid re-housing — housing identification, rent and move-in assistance, and case management and services - are based upon Housing First principles. While Housing First programs often serve many different target populations, including youth, families with children, and the chronically homeless, Rapid Re-Housing programs generally target people with low to moderate services needs. Housing First is much broader in its approach, with program designs developed to be flexible and responsive to the complexity of human needs.|$|E
