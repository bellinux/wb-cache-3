5|$|Its {{early life}} was fraught with {{technical}} difficulties, but {{the size of}} the maintenance team has been reduced from 30 in 1989 to 12 in 2010. Maintenance of the penstocks, which formerly required them to be drained, is now done using a <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> underwater vehicle.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E
5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, {{and the ability to}} carry an integrated targeting pod such as the Northrop Grumman LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP).

5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> underwater vehicles (ROVs) {{can carry}} out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discovery}} of the wreck site, Ballard returned to Titanic in July 1986 aboard the research vessel RV Atlantis II. Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended the ruined Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, and photographed remarkably well preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 {{new steel}} O stock trains, with doors <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> by the guard, {{replaced}} the wooden-bodied trains dating from 1906. It had been intended {{to operate the}} new trains with four or six cars, but after initial problems with the traction current only six-car formations were used. Services to Kensington (Olympia) via the curve at Latimer Road were suspended in 1940 after bomb damage to the West London line and not restarted after the war. When the similar trains running on the Circle line were lengthened to six cars in 1959 and 1960, the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance at Hammersmith depot. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trade unions was not introduced until 1984.|$|E
40|$|In {{planning}} for future exploration missions, architecture and study teams have made numerous assumptions about how crew can be telepresent on a planetary surface by <b>remotely</b> <b>operating</b> surface robots from space (i. e. from a flight vehicle or deep space habitat). These assumptions include estimates of technology maturity, existing technology gaps, and operational risks. These assumptions, however, {{have not been}} grounded by experimental data. Moreover, to date, no crew-controlled surface telerobot has been fully tested in a high-fidelity manner. To address these issues, we developed the "Surface Telerobotics" tests to do three things: 1) Demonstrate interactive crew control of a mobile surface telerobot {{in the presence of}} short communications delay. 2) Characterize a concept of operations for a single astronaut <b>remotely</b> <b>operating</b> a planetary rover with limited support from ground control. 3) Characterize system utilization and operator work-load for a single astronaut <b>remotely</b> <b>operating</b> a planetary rover with limited support from ground control...|$|R

5|$|Geologists have dated and {{documented}} dozens of major eruptions over the volcano's long history, bridging the long gap between Kīlauea's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation. Historical lava {{flows from the}} volcano are generally recovered by scientists {{in one of three}} ways. The oldest flows, dating back 275,000 to 225,000 years, have been recovered from Kīlauea's submerged southern slope by ship-towed <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> vehicles. These lavas exhibit forms characteristic of early, submerged preshield-stage eruptive episodes, from when the volcano was still a rising seamount that had not yet breached the ocean surface, and their surface exposure is unusual, as in most other volcanoes such lavas would have since been buried by more recent flows.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> vehicle, KAIKO, {{collected}} sediment core {{from the}} Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera {{were identified in}} the sediment samples. Foraminifera are single-celled protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, {{the overwhelming majority of}} the sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, {{following}} the successful discovery of HMAS Sydney, several parties began {{calling for a}} dedicated search for Centaur. By the end of 2008, the Australian Federal and Queensland State governments had formed a joint committee and contributed A$2 million each towards a search, and tenders to supply equipment (including the search vessel, side-scan sonar systems, and a <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> inspection submersible) were opened in February 2009, and awarded during the year. The search, conducted from the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Spirit and overseen by shipwreck hunter David Mearns, commenced during the weekend of 12–13 December 2009. The initial search area off Cape Moreton covered , with the search team given 35 days to locate and film the wreck before funding was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|Kronprinz Wilhelm {{was never}} raised for scrapping, {{unlike most of}} the other capital ships that were scuttled. Kronprinz Wilhelm and two of her sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made a salvage attempt more difficult. The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wreck were sold to Britain in 1962. The depth in which the three battleships sank insulated them from the radiation released by the use of atomic weapons. As a result, Kronprinz Wilhelm and her sisters {{are one of the few}} remaining sources of radiation-free steel. The ships have occasionally had steel removed for use in scientific devices. Kronprinz Wilhelm and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Kronprinz Wilhelm and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships.

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E
