40|$|We build {{a simple}} two-period general {{equilibrium}} model with incomplete markets which incorporates <b>reverse</b> <b>market</b> mortgages without appealing to the complicated framework required by the infinite horizon models. Two types of agents are considered: elderly agents and investors. The former are owners of physical assets (for instance housing) who will want to sell them to investors. For that end the elderly agents, who are assumed to not have any bequest motive, issue claims against physical assets they own. One of the claims issued will be interpreted as reverse mortgage (loan for seniors) {{and the other one}} as a call option written on the value of housing equity. By assuming that both the elderly agents and the investors are price takers, and by applying the generalized game approach, we show that the equilibrium in this economy always exists, providing the usual conditions on utilities and initial endowments are satisfied. We end with a remark on efficiency of the quilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} possibilities of the intermarket analysis for the investment portfolio formation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze how to adapt various financial market relations in order to assess the attraction of the different asset classes and taking into account it to form the investment portfolio. In the paper three different investment portfolio construction strategies have been analyzed. The first investment portfolio is formed from the decreasing financial markets, the second - from the rising financial markets, and the third portfolio includes all the financial markets. The study results showed that investing in equal proportions into stocks, bonds and commodities is more effective solution than investing in the market or in the <b>reverse</b> <b>market.</b> Including the currency into the basic portfolio has reduced the risk, but due to the declined returns the efficiency also decreased. The study results showed that the ‘permanent portfolio’ formation of the three asset classes is sufficiently effective in order to reduce investment portfolio risk and to achieve a reasonable return...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the discourse {{and practice of}} friendship among a network of English {{men and women of}} ages between 25 and 30 years old, who are residents in London and most of who consider themselves to be middle class. This study aims at analysing concepts of the person prevalent in the discourse on friendship examined here. The definition of friendship is based on elements of sociability and of personal disclosure. 'Being oneself' with friends is the defining feature of close friendships and the aim of friendship in general. The person is perceived to have a 'true' self, which is emotive and revealed only to some people, and a controlled self, which is presented most of the time. The process of personal disclosure is gradual and requires trust. People with similar ways of thinking and behaving, which in turn reveal similar upbringing and class background, are better able to synchronize personal disclosure. But the notion that the person is influenced by class background conflicts with the belief in having freedom of choice, which is also significant for the people studied. Hence, the general dislike for class labelling. The value placed on friendship goes against the transience, impersonality, and predominance of market values in modern English society and especially in London. The sphere of work is associated with money making, hierarchy, and self-control. There is great emphasis on reversing these characteristics when not at work. Whether at the pub or at home, sociability with friends stresses values which are opposed to those found at work. Thus, {{in the context of the}} life in London, friendship appears to establish fixity, by keeping the familiarity of shared class backgrounds, and to <b>reverse</b> <b>market</b> and work values, by stressing sociability and personal disclosure...|$|E
40|$|Unlike many {{existing}} research studies that explain <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> from a purchasing perspective, this study recognizes {{it as an}} honest effort made by managers aiming to promote sustainability by purposefully managing waste and discusses the spillover effect of their initiatives on brand equity. It argues that efficient recycling of products through <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> by a brand demonstrates its sincere intent to adopt sustainable business practices and enhances its equity in the marketplace. A business-to-business viewpoint {{has been used to}} combine knowledge about waste recycling and management through <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> based on the unpretentious operations and management practices. The propositions reflect on the criticality of engaging business customer firms in a procedural mechanism of recycling for increase in brand equity as the success of <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing.</b> A comprehensive adoption of an initiative like waste management through <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> by a brand highlights how sustainability initiatives can create value for the customers of the brand and ultimately drive brand equity...|$|R
5000|$|Aside from {{traditional}} methods of <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing,</b> this technique is also used in B2B markets. In this instance the buyer (business) will take the initiative to approach the supplier (manufacturer) with its needs. This tactic is often used by large companies in order to decrease redundancies in their supply chain and decrease costs. The concept of <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> also corresponds with Supply Chain Management. The strategy of reversing roles in some cases, has been very successful. In 2001 Richard Plank and Deborah Francis published an article studying the impact <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> has on the buyer-seller relationship. They pinpointed what the motivation was behind the reversal of roles: [...] The relationship of conflict and <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> activity is of interest to researchers and practicing managers alike as it suggests that by taking a <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> stance affective conflict can be reduced and cognitive conflict may be enhanced. This {{is important in the}} emerging strategic orientation of supply chain management, which suggests that the focus of competitive advantage should be the supply chain rather than the individual organization. In order to forge strategic advantage, the purchasing function must develop relationships with suppliers that have limited affective conflict.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>{{marketing}}</b> is {{the concept}} of marketing in which the customer seeks the firm rather than marketers seeking the customer. Usually, this is done through traditional means of advertising, such as television advertisements, print magazine advertisements and online media.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{reference}} price formation under <b>reverse</b> <b>market</b> conditions, {{determined by the}} prevailing bull and bear sentiment trends. I investigate the turnover changes after initial public offering (IPO), which forms a natural reference point for the investors, to which they compare all forthcoming price movements. The results imply that a stock is traded more when its market price exceeds the offer price, that the investor has initially paid to obtain the asset. Additionally, the IPO stocks that begin trading at a gain, tend to be traded more, as they fall below their initial purchase price for the first time. However, the initially losing stocks are {{not found to be}} traded more when their market price surpasses the initial offer price, which is not consistent with previous research. Regarding the effect of the market trends, investors seem to be more optimistic in the formation of their reference prices during bull markets, than during bear conditions. Moreover, new stock price maximums and minimums seem to strongly influence the reference point formation across different market conditions. Under bull circumstances, investors are also more quicker in reacting to new price maximums and minimums, when compared to the bear conditions, under which the reference prices {{do not seem to be}} updated as strongly, if at all, to new price crossings. Therefore, it can be interpreted that investors do adapt their notions on winnings and losses based on new information gained from the stock's current market performance, as they tend to wait longer to sell a losing stock and are also more eager to sell the winning stock before it rises any further. Finally, investors seeming to react faster during bull trends can be due to more frequent follow-up of their assets, which has been found characteristic for bull market investors...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability-driven Entrepreneurship (SE) has {{recently}} received considerable attention in entrepreneurship and sustainability literature in mainstream journals. It is topical {{in the literature}} because scholars believe that SE practices can <b>reverse</b> <b>market</b> imperfections created by conventional entrepreneurial practices into sustainable opportunity to drive the world into the next industrial revolution. While {{much has been written}} about this, how it relates to family-owned businesses has not been extensively studied. Even though family business scholars have studied the incremental aspect of the concept but on a more radical perspective, there is a gap in the literature. This study has been conducted from a critical realist perspective to fill this gap on how the concept relates to family business. Family business was defined as business governed and/or managed by a dominant coalition controlled by members of the same with the intention to shape and pursue the vision of the business in a manner that is potentially sustainable across generations of the family or families. Methodologically, the study used the descriptive method of the Interpretative Study of Concepts. In this study, 303 articles were assessed. After rigorous vetting the articles were refined to 200 for analysis. The dialectical process of intuition and reflective thinking, informed by the chosen methodology, were used to analyse the data. The study examined sustainability and entrepreneurship concepts in family business literature to uncover how those concepts relate to the concepts of SE in family business context. Results clearly showed that, none of the existing concepts found in this study is synonymous with SE in family business context, not even the dominant Trans-generational Entrepreneurship concept. This gap in the family business literature provided avenue for new concept to emerge. To fill this gap, this study developed a new framework with Socio-emotional wealth theory as its main underlying theory. This is how the study proposed that Sustainability Entrepreneurship relates to family business. Within this, the study discovered that the hullabaloo of the fight against saving the planet is between people, planet and profit. In family business, it is a tug-of-war between people, planet, profit and emotion. These findings have implications for theory and practic...|$|E

40|$|Several {{scholars}} have proposed personalization models based on product variety breadth {{and the intensity}} of customer-firm interaction with a focus on marketing strategies ranging from basic product versioning to customerization and <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing.</b> However, some {{studies have shown that the}} explosion of product variety may generate information overload. Moreover, customers are highly heterogeneous in willingness and ability to interact with firms in personalization processes. This often results in consumer confusion and wasteful investments. To address this problem, we propose a conceptual framework of e-customer profiling for interactive personalization by distinguishing content (that is, expected customer benefits) and process (that is, expected degree of interaction) issues. The framework focuses on four general dimensions suggested by previous research as significant drivers of online customer heterogeneity: VALUE, KNOWLEDGE, ORIENTATION, and RELATIONSHIP QUALITY. We also present a preliminary test of the framework and derive directions for customer relationship management and future research...|$|R

40|$|New product {{development}} occurs nowadays mostly in joint buyer–supplier projects, which require closer {{ties between the}} partners in order to mobilize their resources. One issue arising from this collaborative model is that the buyer tends to become more dependent on the supplier. Multiple cases of supplier obstructionism have been reported. To mitigate this dilemma, this paper analyzes the relevance of customer attractiveness as an enabler of collaboration. Testing this hypothesis on a sample of 218 buyer–supplier relationships, we show that dependency as such {{is not the issue}} in the presence of close ties. Buyers who are a preferred customer of their suppliers can accept the risk of becoming dependent on them. The managerial implications of this finding is that firms should apply a <b>reverse</b> <b>marketing</b> approach and thus attempt to become the preferred customers of their important suppliers. From a conceptual perspective, our findings indicate the need to consider dependency not as an isolated variable, but in conjunction with attractiveness...|$|R

Reverse mortgages allow elderly homeowners to consume housing wealth without having to sell or move out of their homes. However, very few eligible homeowners used reverse mortgages to achieve consumption smoothing until recent years when the <b>reverse</b> mortgage <b>market</b> in the U.

This paper examines all Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) loans that were originated between 1989 and 2007 and insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). We show how characteristics of HECM loans and HECM borrowers have evolved over time, we compare borrowers with non-borrowers, and we analyze loan outcomes using a hazard model. In addition, we conduct numerical simulations on HECM loans that were originated in 2007 to illustrate how the profitability of the FHA insurance program depends on factors such as termination rates, housing price appreciation, and the payment schedule. The analysis performed in this paper serves {{as the first step}} to understand the implication of recent growth in the <b>reverse</b> mortgage <b>market.</b> Our results also suggest policy makers who are evaluating the current HECM program should practice caution in predicting future profitability...|$|R

Thus, in comparison to MDA_CRBs, and due to relinquishing utility a little more in each negotiation and covering the difference between counter-prices and received prices, FNSSA_CRBs spent less time in the market for making successful agreements. As an example and by considering Fig.  7 a, the average values of making agreement time under CRPA_favorable market type are 8.5 and 11.17 for FNSSA_CRB and MDA_CRB, respectively. Consequently, the speed of making agreements by the agents of type FNSSA_CRB was 31.41 % faster than those agents of type MDA_CRB. But, with <b>reversed</b> <b>market</b> conditions when market type tends to CRBA_favorable, the negotiator agents of type FNSSA_CRB {{are more likely to}} adopt Pressuring negotiation strategy and thus, more time is spent by FNSSA_CRBs (in comparison to MDA_CRBs) in the market for making successful agreements.

40|$|This article investigates firm {{growth by}} {{considering}} the laws of motion of marketing and R&D stocks. We use the concept of balanced growth to specify a production function where the rates {{of growth in the}} production factors and revenues are directly proportional. We test this specification with a dataset of 64 randomly selected firms that underwent an initial public offering (IPO), and a matched set of 64 established public firms sampled between 1992 - 2006 from the electronic, energy, medical devices and software industries. Our results show that during the growth of post-IPO firms, R&D stock plays a negligible role in building up the revenue. However, marketing stock plays a key role as a complement to cost of goods sold (COGS) with, given a fixed level of revenue, more marketing stock augmenting COGS. During the growth of established firms, the role of these stocks is <b>reversed.</b> <b>Marketing</b> stock plays a negligible role in generating revenue, but R&D stock is a substitute to COGS with more stock resulting in lower COGS. We explore managerial and policy implications of this asymmetry between marketing and R&D expense decisions by young and comparable established firms in terms of balancing the revenue and its growth.
