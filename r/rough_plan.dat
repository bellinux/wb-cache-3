This window on the left is the one which opens into Oldacre's room. You can look into it from the road, you see. That is about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was not there, but his head constable did the honours. They had just found a great treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them with care, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. I even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of 'Hyams,' who was Oldacres tailor. I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron. Nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. All that, of course, fits in with the official theory.

6000|$|My dear Brothers--I am safe at Southampton--after having ridden {{three stages}} outside {{and the rest}} in for it began to be very cold. I {{did not know the}} Names of any of the Towns I passed through--all I {{can tell you is that}} {{sometimes}} I saw dusty Hedges--sometimes Ponds--then nothing--then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce's Sister [...] "as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand"--then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns--then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered--"long heath broom furze"--Hurdles here and there half a Mile--Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by reflection--One Nymph of Fountain--N.B. Stone--lopped Trees--Cow ruminating--ditto Donkey--Man and Woman going gingerly along--William seeing his Sisters over the Heath--John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress--Barber's Pole--Doctor's Shop--However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn--N.B. this Tuesday Morn saw the Sun rise--of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox'd a Shakspeare--"There's my Comfort."[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle--it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long--tolerably broad--has bye streets--two or three Churches--a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country--some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations--it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon's Picture--you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday--tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away--you need only aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all--when you have said Rum-ti-ti--you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends--give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all--and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson's plan. What could I have done without my Plaid?

40|$|To explain complex {{forms of}} human {{behaviour}} {{it is necessary}} {{to take into account the}} interaction of cognition, emotion and motivation. In this article we show that it is possible to predict why and how crowding alters cognition, emotion, and motivation. An artificial population of autonomous agents (the “mice”), lives and grows on an island, explores and conquers it. When the population grows above a certain limit, all symptoms of crowding emerge, which can be found in human groups too. The rate of aggression increases, but the tendencies to tighten the network of social relations as well. Fear arises and this produces a specific form of cognition, namely <b>rough</b> perceiving, <b>rough</b> <b>planning</b> and a loss of persistence of behaviour (“behavioural oscillation”).

40|$|Abstract: The {{production}} of steel normally constitutes {{the inception of}} many Supply Chains in different areas of industry. Therefore, steel manufacturing companies are strongly affected by bull whip effects and other unpredictable influences along their production chains. In the course of these integrated operations, making the right decision at a certain stage can {{be the difference between}} earning or losing a great benefit. Improving their operational efficiency is required to keep a competitive position on the market. Therefore, flexible planning and scheduling systems are needed to support these processes, which are based on considerable amounts of data, hardly processable manually anymore. MasDISPO xt is an agent-based generic online planning and scheduling system for the observation on MES-level of the complete Supply Chain of Saarstahl AG, a globally respected steel manufacturer. This paper concentrates on the planning of the annealing furnaces as a representative example of the <b>rough</b> and detailed <b>planning</b> required in such an environment. The allocation of available capacities of annealing furnaces including alternatives to accepted orders is based on Simulated Trading to produce an evenly distributed <b>rough</b> <b>planning</b> regarding flexibility. As representative for the detailed planning, the solution for the batch-type annealing furnace is explained in detail...|$|R

It was important that he should do so, but although he sat for an hour, drawing <b>rough</b> <b>plans</b> of the spot, he was not satisfied. Unluckily, he could not go back to the sands in the morning and study the ground, because he had promised to join some friends in town for a week.

6000|$|... "I lie well, thank God," [...] Mrs. Lowder almost snorted, [...] "when, as {{sometimes}} will happen, there's {{nothing else}} so good. One must always do the best. But without lies then," [...] she went on, [...] "perhaps {{we can work}} it out." [...] Her interest had risen; her friend saw her, as within some minutes, more enrolled and inflamed--presently felt in her what had made the difference. Mrs. Stringham, it was true, descried this at the time but dimly; she only made out at first that Maud had found a reason for helping her. The reason was that, strangely, she might help Maud too, for which she now desired to profess herself ready even to lying. What really perhaps most came out for her was that her hostess was a little disappointed at her doubt of the social solidity of this appliance; and that in turn {{was to become a}} steadier light. The truth about Kate's delusion, as her aunt presented it, the delusion about the state of her affections, which might be removed--this was apparently the ground on which they now might more intimately meet. Mrs. Stringham saw herself recruited for the removal of Kate's delusion--by arts, however, in truth, that she as yet quite failed to compass. Or was it perhaps to be only for the removal of Mr. Densher's?--success in which indeed might entail other successes. Before that job, unfortunately, her heart had already failed. She felt that she believed in her bones what Milly believed, and what would now make working for Milly such a dreadful upward tug. All this within her was confusedly present--a cloud of questions out of which Maud Manningham's large seated self loomed, however, as a mass more and more definite, taking in fact for the consultative relation something of the form of an oracle. From the oracle the sound did come--or at any rate the sense did, a sense all accordant with the insufflation she had just seen working. [...] "Yes," [...] the sense was, [...] "I'll help you for Milly, because if that comes off I shall be helped, by its doing so, for Kate"--a view into which Mrs. Stringham could now sufficiently enter. She found herself of a sudden, strange to say, quite willing to operate to Kate's harm, or at least to Kate's good as Mrs. Lowder with a noble anxiety measured it. She found herself in short not caring what became of Kate--only convinced at bottom of the predominance of Kate's star. Kate wasn't in danger, Kate wasn't pathetic; Kate Croy, whatever happened, would take care of Kate Croy. She saw moreover by this time that her friend was travelling even beyond her own speed. Mrs. Lowder had already, in mind, drafted a <b>rough</b> <b>plan</b> of action, a plan vividly enough thrown off as she said: [...] "You must stay on a few days, and you must immediately, both of you, meet him at dinner." [...] In addition to which Maud claimed the merit of having by an instinct of pity, of prescient wisdom, done much, two nights before, to prepare that ground. [...] "The poor child, when I was with her there while you were getting your shawl, quite gave herself away to me." ...|$|E

A module library is proposed as a mechanism for automatic translation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a non-uniform layered <b>rough</b> cut <b>plan</b> for B-spline surfaces using convex hull boxes. The tool path plan generated by this method will rapidly remove most redundant material from stock material without overcutting. First, a B-spline surface is decomposed into piecewise Bezier surfaces, of which the convex hull boxes form an approximate model for rough cutting. Then, according to the top planes of those convex hull boxes, the stock material is divided into layers of different thickness. The cavity contour for each layer is obtained using a simplified union Boolean operation on convex hull boxes. Finally, from the top down, each layer is processed like a 2 D pocket die cavity. The algorithm is implemented on a personal computer. It is shown that the <b>rough</b> cut <b>plan</b> is very efficient since no computation for solving nonlinear equations is needed, and no overcutting occurs since B-spline surfaces are protected by the convex hull property of Bezier surfaces...|$|R
