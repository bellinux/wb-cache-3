In the proposed framework a hybrid language model combining words and sub-word units is incorporated during ASR decoding then three different OOV words recognition methods are applied to generate OOV word hypotheses.

50|$|A gap {{in reading}} growth exists between low SES and high SES {{children}}, which widens as children {{move on to}} higher grades. Reading assessments that test reading growth include measures on basic reading skills (i.e., print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming sounds, word <b>recognition),</b> <b>vocabulary</b> (receptive vocabulary), and reading comprehension skills (i.e., listening comprehension, words in context). The reading growth gap is apparent between the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first-grade, the time when children rely more on the school for reading growth and less on their parents. Initially, high SES children begin as better readers than their low SES counterparts. As children get older, high SES children progress more rapidly in reading growth rates than low SES children. These early reading outcomes affect later academic success. The further children fall behind, {{the more difficult it}} is to catch up and the more likely they will continue to fall behind. By the time students enter high school in the United States, low SES children are considerably behind their high SES peers in reading growth.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{concurrent}} validity of an online Yes/No test of <b>recognition</b> <b>vocabulary</b> as a placement tool at an Australian English language school. Newly entering students (n= 88) completed a Yes/No test, which measured accuracy {{and speed of}} response, and a school placement battery consisting of grammar, writing, speaking and listening measures. Yes/No test accuracy performance approximated that of the listening and grammar placement tests, discriminating between placement levels and correlating with overall placement decisions. Placement level decisions correlated with Yes/No accuracy (r =. 6) and the discrete-point placement measures listening (. 7) and grammar (. 8). Yes/No test accuracy showed a consistently strong correlation (. 6) across all test measures, indicating that <b>recognition</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge is a fundamental element in all tests. Response time as an independent measure followed the same pattern as the accuracy results but was less sensitive to differences in placement levels.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} written academic English proficiency and academic achievement in an undergraduate English-medium university program in the Sultanate of Oman. The study aims to identify reliable measures for screening academically at-risk students in a time- and cost-effective manner. Three established measures of written English proficiency (academic writing, academic reading and <b>recognition</b> <b>vocabulary)</b> are examined as predictors of academic achievement as reflected in student grade-point average (GPA). Performance on the three tests by Year 1 (N = 174) Omani students in an English-as-a-Lingua-Franca (ELF) university program was correlated with their end of semester GPAs. The accuracy of the tests in classifying at-risk students was assessed with logit regression analyses and ROC curves using GPA cutscores. The best predictors of GPA were the academic writing and <b>recognition</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge measures. The suitability of the latter as a screening tool in ELF higher-education settings is discussed.

Analysis of the data, based on interviews with family members, students' reading scores, and in-class observations of student behavior, indicated that word <b>recognition</b> and <b>vocabulary</b> were influenced by the cognitively enriching activities some homes provide, and related strongly with children's time with adults rather than with other children or watching television.
