2500|$|Java 1.4 {{and higher}} support both 32-bit and 64-bit {{operation}} on z9. The System z9 also supports the zAAP processor, which allows {{most of the}} Java workload to be offloaded from the normal instruction processors. Java workloads executed by the zAAP processor do not count towards the IBM-rated capacity of the z9. [...] This reduces the z9's {{total cost of ownership}} compared with other IBM platforms, as otherwise IBM would raise a customer's (software) license fees after installing an additional (hardware) processor. [...] The zAAP also enables integration of new Java based Web applications with core z/OS backend database environment for high performance, <b>reliability,</b> <b>availability,</b> and security.|$|E

They are <b>Reliability</b> & <b>Availability.</b> These two parameters are the most important measures for evaluating the quality of the software system and represents user-oriented view of software quality. <b>Reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> must be engineered into software from the onset of its development, andpotential problems must be detected in the early stages,when it is easier and less expensive to implement modifications. For this reason, a method is needed for analyzing software architecture with respect to <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability.</b> In this paper, we survey and examine different methods of <b>reliability</b> & <b>availability</b> analysis based on software architecture.

Chemical production equipment system is consisted of many single devices. Due to special dangerous, the reliability analysis to whole equipment system {{is very important to}} keeping the safety of production process. In this article, to chemical process equipment system, the reliability calculation method, basic principles, basic assumptions and calculation program are described. To a aromatic semi-renewable dehydration process system, by using the reliability calculated method above, the fault tree and reliability block diagram are derived, the system <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> are accounted, the corresponding <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> curves are obtained and the main factors influencing the reliability of the system are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|System level <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> {{estimates}} {{are required to}} facilitate cost tradeoff studies associated with competing photovoltaic systems. Estimates of reliability are necessary in developing maintenance cost projections over the system lifetime. Availability estimates provide an input into annual energy generation projections. This paper describes a comprehensive approach to developing <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> estimates for a large photovoltaic system. System <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> were defined based on the operator’s expectations and a Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) was developed to model system behavior. The RBD developed is a hierarchical reliability model. Larger functional elements are decomposed into smaller functional elements. The granularity of the model {{is determined by the}} level that failure data are collected. Field data, failure times and repair times, were collected and analyzed for a five year time period from a 4. 6 MWdc photovoltaic system operated by Tucson Electric Power (TEP) at Springerville, Arizona. Failure and repair distributions were fitted to these field data. These results were then used to populate the RBD and produce system level estimates of <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability.</b> The results of these analyses are: 1. a summary of failures for each main component of the system, 2. a summary of failure distributions/rates and repair times for each main component, 3. system <b>reliability</b> and <b>availability</b> versus time projections, and 4. an estimate of the number of failures for each main component over the system’s life...|$|R
