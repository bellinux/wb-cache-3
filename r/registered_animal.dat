5|$|In 1933 {{the first}} Welsh Corgis {{were brought to}} the United States by American breeder Mrs Lewis Roesler, for her Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had {{previously}} been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke bitch, Little Madam, at London's Paddington Station for £12. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first <b>registered</b> <b>animal</b> of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada.|$|E

5000|$|These cattle {{were kept}} in the Park of Whalley Abbey, in the Forest of Bowland near Clitheroe. After that time the major portion of the herd was moved to Norfolk, in the early 19th century. This herd was sold off in small lots, largely to nobility in the {{surrounding}} countryside, and {{formed the basis of}} the British White breed. By the early 20th century these cattle had declined to about 130 <b>registered</b> <b>animals,</b> mainly in the eastern counties of England. By the end of the 20th century numbers had grown to over 1,500 <b>registered</b> <b>animals</b> in the UK and perhaps 2,500 in the US, as well as many {{in other parts of the}} world such as Australia, where the breed was first imported by Mrs A Horden in 1958.

50|$|A stud {{animal is}} a <b>registered</b> <b>animal</b> {{retained}} for breeding. The terms {{for the male}} of a given animal species (stallion, bull, rooster, etc.) usually imply that the animal is intact—that is, not castrated—and therefore capable of siring offspring. A specialized vocabulary exists for de-sexed animals (gelding, steer, etc.) and those animals used in grading up to a purebred status.|$|E
50|$|In the {{practice}} of selective breeding of animals, particularly in animal fancy and livestock, including horses, pedigree charts are used to track the ancestry of animals and assist in the planning of suitable breeding programs to enhance desirable traits. Breed registries are formed and are dedicated to the accurate tracking of pedigrees and maintaining accurate records of birth, death and identifying characteristics of each <b>registered</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While these genetic {{expansion}} {{programs have}} been embraced, national breed associations have been instrumental in ensuring that the breed works to retain the characteristics that make it an efficient alternative in the dairy industry. Some national breed associations have been active in either approving sires for use or directly selling semen {{on a range of}} sires of varying purity percentages. All countries have different herd book mechanisms for tracking the percentage of purity of each <b>registered</b> <b>animal</b> but some are more rigorous than others. The breed has largely ensured that breeders are able to follow whatever breeding program suits their needs, resulting in both herds of [...] "blended" [...] Shorthorns with many animals at less than 50% purity, as well as herds in several countries were most animals are purebred.|$|E

40|$|In {{question}} and answer format this NebGuide addresses changes in genetic evaluations of both dairy cows and sores. Why is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) changing the dairy sire and cow evaluation system? The answer is simple. The Animal Model for genetic evaluations is more accurate than the old Modified Contemporary Comparison Method (M. C. C.). Previously the major limiting factors to implementing the Animal Model were computing costs and memory requirements. With the advent of new Super Computers, the computations are feasible on a national scale. What is the Animal Model? The Animal Model simultaneously evaluates cows and sires using all their ancestor relationships. This means that every animal known in a given pedigree is used to evaluate both the cow and sire. This increases the accuracy of evaluation and should be a major step in breeder acceptance of the new evaluation system. Not only are all <b>registered</b> <b>animal</b> pedigrees included in the evaluation process, but all non-registered cattle pedigrees that have been identified properly on Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) testing are included...|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, farmers were more {{interested}} in protecting or preserving the breed, with the establishment of a 1996 technical specification for the pure breed. With the establishment of a registered endemic breed, there was a resurging interest in the preservation of the Azorean breed, especially in locations within the archipelago where common dairy/meat cattle could not survive.

500|$|The {{autosomal}} {{recessive genetic disease}} junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) {{has been found in}} some American Cream Drafts.

It is most commonly associated with Belgian horses, but is also found in other draft breeds. A DNA test was developed in 2002, and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another.

500|$|As an island, Hog Island had {{open space}} and lacked predators, {{therefore}} the colonists allowed their livestock to roam free, rounding them up only to mark them or to use them for meat or wool. In 1933 a hurricane destroyed most of the island; the inhabitants abandoned the settled areas and many sheep were left to fend for themselves, reverting to a feral state. The Nature Conservancy bought the island in the 1970s, rounded up the sheep, and removed them to prevent overgrazing.
