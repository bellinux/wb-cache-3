A two wheel desiccant system using solar heat for desiccant regeneration is typically discussed. The two wheel system uses a desiccant wheel that is “matched ” with a heat exchanger wheel. The heat exchanger recycles heat for the desiccant regeneration and improves system efficiency.

NaCl concentrations optimized for chemical regeneration in batch experiments did not match those in continuous column tests. Instead, the mass ratio of Na+ to Zeolite-NH 4 +-N was significant for improving regeneration efficiency in column experiments; this mass ratio was 750 g Na+/g Zeolite-NH 4 +-N required for regeneration efficiency over 90 % in 2 hours at pH 9. 　To decrease the NaCl dose in <b>regeneration</b> of <b>exhausted</b> zeolite, a high pH regeneration method was developed using an NaCl concentration of 10 g/L at pH 12 (the mass of Na+ to Zeolite-NH 4 +-N of 4. 2) which achieved a regeneration efficiency about 85 %. The recovery of ammonium nitrogen from the exhausted zeolite was assessed with air stripping followed by ammonia collection in an acid scrubber. The effects of shaking and air stripping were investigated in batch tests and the results showed the superiority of air stripping over shaking. Liquid circulation and air flow rates were varied for optimization of ammonia recovery in a continuous zeolite-packed column combined with a regeneration chamber and a stripping column. The liquid circulation rate had no significant effect on either the regeneration efficiency or the ammonia transfer efficiency from ammonium nitrogen to ammonia gas, while the ammonia transfer efficiency significantly increased with the air flow rate. 　 Furthermore, the effect of pH on ammonia recovery was tested. Both the regeneration efficiency and the ammonia transfer efficiency were significantly improved with increasing pH. When the pH was increased from 9. 5 to 12, the regeneration efficiency increased from 9. 2 % to 84 % and the ammonia transfer efficiency increased from 54 % to 92 %. The nitrogen recovery process that combines zeolite ammonium exchange and air stripping can decrease chemical costs for <b>regeneration</b> of <b>exhausted</b> zeolite and efficiently collect ammonium nitrogen to be reused as fertilizers.

40|$|EN] The {{purpose of}} this work was to explore the {{application}} of microwaves for the low temperature regeneration of activated carbons saturated with a pharmaceutical compound (promethazine). Contrary to expectations, microwave-assisted regeneration {{did not lead to}} better results than those obtained under conventional electric heating. At low temperatures the regeneration was incomplete either under microwave and conventional heating, being this attributed to the insufficient input energy. At mild temperatures, a fall in the adsorption capacity upon cycling was obtained in both devices, although this was much more pronounced for the microwave. These results contrast with previous studies on the benefits of microwaves for the regeneration of carbon materials. The fall in the adsorption capacity after regeneration was due to the thermal cracking of the adsorbed molecules inside the carbon porous network, although this effect applies to both devices. When microwaves are used, along with the thermal heating of the carbon bed, a fraction of the microwave energy seemed to be directly used in the decomposition of promethazine through the excitation of the molecular bonds by microwaves (microwave-lysis).

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} of particulate material (soot) measurement in a Diesel particulate filter using Electrical Capacitance Tomography. Modern Diesel Engines are equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), as well as on-board technologies to evaluate the status of DPF because complete knowledge of DPF soot loading is very critical for robust efficient operation of the engine exhaust after treatment system. Emission regulations imposed upon all internal combustion engines including Diesel engines on gaseous as well as particulates (soot) emissions by Environment Regulatory Agencies. In course of time, soot will be deposited inside the DPFs which tend to clog the filter and hence generate a back pressure in the exhaust system, negatively impacting the fuel efficiency. To remove the soot build-up, regeneration of the DPF must be done as an engine exhaust after treatment process at pre-determined time intervals. Passive <b>regeneration</b> use <b>exhaust</b> heat and catalyst to burn the deposited soot but active regeneration use external energy in such as injection of diesel into an upstream DOC to burn the soot.

Here the adsorption/desorption of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) sulfonamide on a HS zeolite Y was investigated in the presence of two humic monomers: vanillin (VNL) and caffeic acid (CA). VNL competed with SMX for the zeolite adsorption sites, conversely to what observed for CA, according to their solubility and pKa values. As SMX-VNL co-adsorption was revealed, FTIR spectroscopy combined to Rietveld analysis of XRPD data allowed to define the guest-guest interactions inside the zeolite pores. DFT calculations in vacuo confirmed the stabilization of the complex (see figure) with respect to the isolated compounds. Finally, both thermal treatment and solvent extraction succeeded in the <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>exhausted</b> zeolite. [Ref] Leardini et al., Martucci et al., 2014 Min.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{for the removal}} and recycling of hexavalent chromium from electroplating industries was developed. It involves a two-phase process which consists of (1) {{the use of an}} activated carbon bed for the accumulation of chromium onto the surface of activated carbon followed by (2) the regeneration of the carbon leading to a concentrated chromium solution with potential for reclamation or reuse within the plating operation. Results from continuous flow experiments showed that in excess of 99 % chromium removal efficiency can be achieved. It was also revealed that <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>exhausted</b> carbon under acidic conditions recovered chromium in the trivalent state with concentrations as high as 3 g dm− 3, more than 12 times the influent concentration. The adsorption capacity of the activated carbon was found to increase with successive cycles of adsorption/regeneration. However, when regeneration was achieved under alkaline conditions, the chromium was recovered in the hexavalent state with concentrations as high as 8 · 4 g dm− 3, in excess of 33 times the chromium influent concentration. In addition, under caustic regeneration conditions, the data showed that the adsorption capacity in this case decreases with the increased number of exhaustion cycles. Mass balance calculation for both acid and caustic regeneration indicated that in both cases the regeneration process was incomplete with a recovery efficiency averaging around 50 %. In an attempt to maximise the recovery efficiency, a combination of caustic followed by acid regeneration was applied to the exhausted activated carbon and the results led to a drastic improvement in the total recovery process (85 – 98 %). These results clearly show that activated carbon is a viable candidate for the removal and recovery of chromium from electroplating industries. The critical advantage in the use of activated carbon is (1) the ability to regenerate and thus prepare a concentrated chromium solution for potential reclamation or recycle to the plating operation, and (2) the potential of avoiding the generation of hazardous sludge for land disposal...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{potential}} of using PEBA as a sorbent for removing phenolic compounds from wastewater. The sorption isotherms of phenol, 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP), 4 -methylphenol (4 -MP) and catechol from their respective single solute solutions were studied based on the Linear, Langmuir and Freundlich models. The Freundlich model was shown to be suitable to represent the equilibrium sorption of all the phenolic compounds in the PEBA sorbent, and the sorption capacity of these phenolic compounds in PEBA is in the order: catechol<phenol< 4 -MP< 4 -NP< 4 -CP. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that phenol sorption in PEBA was a spontaneous exothermic process. The sorption kinetics was studied using PEBA sorbent {{in the form of}} a flat membrane with well-defined dimensions to help identify the mechanism and rate controlling step of the sorption process. The kinetic data were fitted with the pseudo-first and -second order models as well as the diffusion model. The pseudo-second order model was shown to fit the experimental data better than the pseudo-first order model, and an oversight in the model fitting with regard to equilibrium sorption capacity in prior work was discussed and corrected. Sorption of phenol, 4 -CP, 4 -NP, 4 -MP and catechol in PEBA was represented by the pseudo-second order model, while mass diffusion inside the sorbent was not negligible for thick membranes. Multi-solute sorption isotherms and kinetics were determined for binary and quinary solute systems. The competitive Freundlich model and the IAST model were fitted to the equilibrium data. It was found that the competitive Freundlich model was adequate to represent isotherms for all binary solute systems studied; however, there was a considerable deviation between the model predictions and the experimental data in the quinary solute system. Strongly sorbed solutes tended to inhibit the sorption of weakly sorbed solutes. The sorption competition was shown to affect the sorption kinetics of individual solutes, and such effect was found to be related to the molecular size of the sorbate component and its affinity to the sorbent. Chemical elution, thermal regeneration and vacuum-assisted thermal regeneration were proposed and studied for regeneration of PEBA sorbent exhausted with the phenolic compounds. Ethanol, methanol and NaOH solution were all effective regenerants for the sorbent, and no significant change in the sorption characteristics was observed for a number of sorption-regeneration cycles. Thermal regeneration (90 °C for 2 h) was also effective for regenerating PEBA exhausted with phenol and 4 -MP. When exhausted with 4 -MP, the PEBA sorbent could be regenerated using vacuum-assisted thermal regeneration (80 °C for 3 h at a vacuum pressure of 5 kPa), and highly concentrated solutions (≈ 70, 000 ppm) of 4 -MP were collected. PEBA fibres were prepared and immobilized in a packed-bed for column sorption studies. The effects of inlet feed concentration, flow rate, fibre diameter and flow interruption on the breakthrough were evaluated. The BDST, Clark and Yoon-Nelson models were fitted to the experimental data. It was shown that the BDST model described the breakthrough curve adequately when the solute in the effluent was at lower concentrations (0 <C/C 0 < 0. 15); while over a broader range of effluent concentration (0 <C/C 0 < 0. 90), the Clark model fitted the breakthrough curve better than Yoon-Nelson model. The sorption capacities of phenolic compounds in the column were found to be comparable to those determined in batch sorption studies. Complete <b>regeneration</b> of the <b>exhausted</b> column was achieved using NaOH and there was no change in breakthrough characteristics after column regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{large amount}} of non-biodegradable sulfonamide {{antibiotics}} used in hospitals, feedstocks and in fish farming cause their occurrence in the aquatic environment resulting in the dramatic emergence of antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens and in the transfer of these resistance determinants to bacteria in land animals and to human pathogens [1]. Permeable Reactive Barrier (PRB) is an innovative technology for the remediation of aquifers based on reactive materials which capture and remove or break down the contaminants, releasing uncontaminated water. Recently, a cheap and environmentally friendly material with excellent sorbent properties for sulfonamides has been proposed: an hydrophobic high-silica zeolite Y [2, 3]. At maximal solubility, {{it is able to}} almost completely (> 90 %) and quickly (t< 1 min) remove sulfonamide antibiotics from water media [2, 3]. Other advantage of zeolites as permeable barrier is their stability towards radiative and thermal treatments necessary to induce complete degradation of adsorbates and therefore to regenerate exhausted sorbents. In this work, the regeneration capacity of an hydrophobic high-silica zeolite Y after sulfamethoxazole antibiotic adsorption [3] was investigated by in situ high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction to monitor the structural modifications induced by the regeneration treatment. This kind of information is crucial to design and optimize the regeneration treatment of zeolites with a very high potential for application in water remediation technologies. Experimental A powder sample of hydrophobic high-silica (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ~ 200) zeolite Y (a= 24. 248 (1) and V= 14256. 7 (1), s. g. Fd- 3) loaded at room temperature in aqueous solution with sulfamethoxazole sulfonamide antibiotic (C 10 H 11 N 3 O 3 S, SMX hereafter) [3] was used for this study. The in situ high-temperature X-ray powder diffraction experiments were performed at the GILDA beamline at ESRF (Grenoble), using a fixed wavelength of 0. 653 Å. The powder sample was packed in a 0. 3 mm diameter quartz glass capillary, open at both ends, and heated in situ using a hot air stream. 45 diffraction patterns were recorded on a flat image-plate detector while heating the sample up to 575 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) (temperature ramp) and then keeping this temperature for 120 minutes (isotherm mode). A further powder pattern was collected after cooling down the sample up to room conditions for 2 h (reverse). The evolution of the structural features was followed by full profile Rietveld refinements. An ex situ regeneration was also performed on the sample heated up to 550 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) and kept at this temperature for 4 hours. The corresponding powder pattern was then compared to those collected in situ at the same temperature. Results and discussion 576 Figure 1 shows selected XRPD patterns collected in situ and the reverse and ex-situ patterns. It is evident that the thermal treatment necessary to regenerate the exhausted sorbent does not affect the crystallinity of zeolite Y. Figure. 1. Selected XRPD patterns collected in situ (in black). The reverse and ex situ powder patterns are also reported (grey lines). Figure 2. Normalized unit-cell parameters as a function of time (minutes) /temperature (°C). Figure 3. Number of SMX molecules/u. c. as a function of time (minutes) /temperature (°C). The evolution of the unit-cell parameters upon heating are shown in Figure 2. Between 25 - 200 °C, the unit-cell parameters slightly increase with increasing T. In this temperature range, the relaxation of the H-bonding interactions between SMX and the framework oxygen atoms induces a slight ditrigonal 6 -membered rings (6 MRs) regularization and a 12 -membered rings (12 MR) ellipticity decreasing. Above 200 °C, the degradation and expulsion of SMZ molecules cause a double-six rings (D 6 Rs) tetrahedra cooperative anti-rotation which results in the flattening of the D 6 R itself and in a consequent cell volume contraction. At the same time, a regularization of the ditrigonal 6 MRs and of the elliptical 12 MRs is also observed. Around 400 - 450 °C, in correspondence with the final degradation of SMX, the unit cell volume is still contracting and no further changes in D 6 R and 12 MR are observed until the isotherm is reached. During the heating in the isotherm mode, the unit-cell parameters evolution reaches a plateaux and the SMX content is reduced to zero. After the complete regeneration, the unit-cell volume increases again. This process is followed by an increase in the D 6 R thickness, a ditrigonalization of the 6 MR and by an expansion of the 12 MR which keeps its circular shape. All the features of the pattern and the unit-cell parameters of the starting material [4] are well recovered after cooling down the sample up to room conditions (reverse) and after heating the sample ex situ (ex situ). Conclusions The in situ high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction allowed us to demonstrate that the thermal treatment at 575 °C assures a complete <b>regeneration</b> of <b>exhausted</b> Y zeolite. The removal of SMX induces deformations of the framework which do not affect the crystallinity of the sorbing material. These results indicate that high-silica zeolite Y is an affordable material for water clean-up and drug delivery. References [1] B. Hileman, Chem. Eng. News 79 (2001) 31 - 33. [2] I. Braschi, S.

40|$|Introduction Sulfa drugs {{belong to}} the class of {{synthetic}} antibiotic sulfonamides, massively used {{for the treatment of}} infections in human therapy, livestock production and aquaculture [1]. Owing to their environmental diffusion, sulfa drugs are known to induce high level of resistance in bacteria through by-pass mechanism [2]. In order to limit the diffusion of resistance determinants, it is of utmost importance to identify adsorbents for this antibiotic family to be used for water clean up purpose. In this study, high silica zeolites have been tested for their capability to extract sulfa drugs from water. Kinetics, capacity, and reversibility of the adsorption process have been studied along with the localization of the sulfa drugs into zeolite porosity systems. The main host-guest (& guest-guest, when existing) interactions along with the tautomeric form embedded into sorbents have been defined. When present, reaction products have been identified and the transformation mechanism proposed. Regeneration procedures were finally investigated. Experimental Adsorption kinetics and capacity of zeolites Y, mordenite (MOR), and ZSM- 5 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 200, 200, and 500, respectively) towards ten sulfa drugs (sulfonamide, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfadoxine, and sulfamethoxazole) were defined by thermogravimetric and HPLC analyses. The location of sulfonamides into zeolite channel systems has been obtained by Rietveld refinements from X-ray powder diffraction data (XRPD). The zeolite-sulfonamide host-guest interactions have been investigated by IR analysis performed on zeolites at the highest adsorption capacity and augmented by computational analysis at the DFT level. Regeneration (extraction with solvents, thermal, photolysis, Fenton, photo-Fenton, thermal treatments) have been performed on exhausted zeolites. In situ HT XRPD experiments were performed at GILDA beamline at ESRF (Grenoble), to test the regeneration capacity of zeolites Y and ZSM- 5. Results and Discussion The adsorption of sulfamethoxazole by high silica zeolites was in the order: zeolite Y (24 % zeolite dry weight - DW) > ZSM- 5 (8 %) > MOR (6 %). With the exception of sulfanilamide, which showed scarce affinity for zeolite Y (3 % zeolite DW), the other sulfa drugs irreversibly adsorbed at ca. 26 % on average and with the process equilibrium reached in less than 1 min [3]. As shown by IR analysis, weak H-bonds and van der Waals type interactions between single molecules of sulfamethazine, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamerazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfadoxine, or sulfamethoxazole and zeolite Y were responsible for the irreversible extraction of sulfa drugs from water [4, 5]. The occurrence of intramolecular medium strength H-bond in sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, or sulfapyridine upon adsorption revealed the formation of dimeric species inside zeolite cage [4, 5]. The energy associated to the imide-amide tautomeric forms of monomer and dimer sulfa drugs and their occurrence into zeolite Y cage have been elucidated by a combined DFT computational modelling and IR study: the imide form for dimer sulfathiazole and amide form for both momomer and dimer species for the other sulfonamides [5]. Among the regeneration strategies approached, the thermal treatment and the solvent extraction gave the best results. As far as zeolite MOR is concerned, Rietveld structure refinement revealed that sulfachloropyridazine or sulfamethoxazole incorporation of caused a remarkable change in the channels' dimension when compared to the parent zeolite and a close vicinity of the heterocycle ring to the MOR side pocket oxygens [6] (See Figure). Sulfachloropyridazine locatization in MOR	It is proposed that the H-bond between mordenite silanols and sulfachloropyridazine heterocycle nitrogen atom induces partial positive charges in the heterocycle ring favouring at 65 °C the displacement of the chlorine leaving group by an OH- via nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism with the formation of the reaction product with 100 % selectivity [6]. In situ HT synchrotron XRPD experiments demonstrated that the treatment at 575 °C assures a complete <b>regeneration</b> of both <b>exhausted</b> Y and ZSM- 5 zeolites. The removal of sulfamethoxazole induces framework deformations which do not affect the crystallinity of sorbent materials. Conclusions The notable and irreversible adsorption capacity for sulfa drugs shown by high silica zeolites Y, MOR, and ZSM- 5, {{selected on the basis of}} their high hydrophobicity and peculiar pore architectures, along with their regenerability, clearly indicates these sorbents as affordable and recyclable materials for clean up waters polluted with this antibiotic class. The arrangement of sulfa drugs inside zeolite porosities, the zeolite-antibiotic host-guest interactions, the tautomeric form involved of embedded monomeric and dimeric species could be defined by a multidisciplinary structural, spectroscopic and computational approach. These materials are very interesting also for drug delivery issues.
