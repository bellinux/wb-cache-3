Different restructuring measures have different effects. Bank closures are economically justified, but mergers show short-term efficiency losses. Recapitalization and reprivatization of badly performing banks lead to efficiency improvement, but also increase government ownership. Ease of entry that has allowed for more foreign bank participation results in slightly improved performance of badly performing banks...|$|R

Fixed effect estimates reveal that both firm’s innovations increase the wage of skilled and white collars, and also relative wages.

Thus, these two activities are more substitute than complement: the former used in <b>restructuring</b> <b>periods,</b> the latter during expansions...|$|R

Hunedoara city, a mono-industrial city by excellence, evolved a little bit different from most of the country’s industrial cities, meaning that, when the urban systematization process began, this city had already a certain industrial tradition and a high urban development. Therefore, we can correlate the evolution of the industrial platform with the gradually urban growth. “The explosion” in Hunedoara, between 1956 and 1977, dictated the actual model of functional and spatial organization, during these times the population had a growth rate of 116. 2 %, and the built space expanded 60 %.

40|$|Abstract: The State aid {{constitutes}} one of {{the instruments}} o f the state policy in the economic market. The State aid means winning financial benefits from the state resources in the way which might distort competition. Depending on the object it is earmarked, the State aid can be distinguished as horizontal, sectoral, regional. The Agenda in respect o f State aid assumes phasing out this aid for enterprises, let alone aid distorting competition, and its closer scrutiny. In the period 2000 - 2005 {{the total value of}} State aid in Poland amounted to € 14. 8 billion (79 billion PLN), which gives an average at the level o f € 2. 5 billion (13. 2 billion PLN) per annum. The value ol State aid granted for rescue and <b>restructuring</b> in the <b>period</b> 2000 - 2005 in Poland accounted for € 35. 8 billion PLN which means 45. 3 % of the total value of State aid.

40|$|We {{study the}} process of {{corporate}} restructuring for a sample of 298 firms during the 1989 - 98 period that announce that they are considering restructuring alternatives.

Only 70 percent of the firms that initially propose restructuring later make a definitive proposal to sell either {{all or part of the}} firm, with other firms taking themselves out of play or declaring bankruptcy. Hence, the market reaction to the initial restructuring announcement underestimates the full wealth effects of completed restructurings. The estimate of the full value of restructuring across the sample firms averages 7. 5 percent, with the greatest gains of 30 percent accruing to firms that are acquired.

Globalization has not emerged as the natural result of capitalism but it has been actively promoted and the appropriate conditions for the functioning of global capitalism have been created by certain actors. Many scholars argue that it is a newly emerging transnational capitalist class which transformed capitalism into a globalizing project. Although the members of this class are located {{in different parts of the}} world, they have a common interest in supporting globalization. They are aware of their common interests and they have a certain class consciousness. Moreover, their habits, tastes, and lifestyles are becoming increasingly similar. Considering these debates on transnational capitalist class, in a case study of the Turkish top managers working in the ?stanbul branch of a multinational corporation, this paper looks at the lifestyle characteristics of this group of managers, comparing them with those aspects of the lifestyle of the transnational capitalist class that are indicated by the scholars. A second question that has been considered is to what extent these managers feel themselves as part of a transnational class that has common goals and interests. This study shows that for this group of managers the primary identification is with the people who have the same position with them, regardless of their country or corporation, not with their fellow nationals...|$|R
