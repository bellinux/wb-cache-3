25|$|Route 32 {{begins at}} a partial {{interchange}} with U.S. Route 130 in South Brunswick Township. The route heads eastward, running along access ramps from Route 130 {{and the local}} park and <b>ride.</b> <b>Heading</b> onto the mainline Route 32, the highway receives the moniker of Forsgate Drive. Intersecting with a U-turn ramp from the westbound lanes, the highway serves the area as a four-lane industrial arterial. Route 32 heads further east, passing through industrial areas and local commercial headquarters. A short distance later, the highway intersects with Herrod Drive and Commerce Drive, both of which serve the local industry. Forsgate Drive continues eastward as the arterial, intersecting with County Route 535 (Cranbury-South River Road). From here, Route 32 enters Monroe Township and begins serving Interchange 8A on the New Jersey Turnpike. A partial trumpet interchange, Interchange 8A serves access to County Route 535 (for drivers heading to Route 32 westbound) and Route 32 eastbound. After serving another local industry, Route 32 crosses over the four-sectioned mainline of the Turnpike, where the designation ends. The road continues east as CR 612.|$|E
5000|$|Late {{into the}} night of Thursday, 12 June, {{teenagers}} Yifrach, Fraenkel, and Shaer were waiting at Geva’ot Intersection, west of the settlement of Alon Shvut in the Etzion Bloc south of Jerusalem, soon after 22:15, looking to catch a <b>ride</b> <b>heading</b> west on Route 367 toward Beit Shemesh {{and from there to}} locations in central Israel where each of them lived. The kidnappers intended to kidnap one Israeli. Apparently Yifrach, after accepting a ride, waved to the other two to join him. The Palestinians, afraid of giving their identity away if they spoke Hebrew, didn't dare object. After the car veered off from the declared direction of Ashkelon, the three realized they had been kidnapped and Shaer telephoned the police at 22:25, whispering, [...] "I’ve been kidnapped." [...] Eight attempts were made to page the caller's cellphone, without checking its ownership, and his whispered remark was taken {{to be one of the}} many pranks that night. No check was made to find out the phone's owner, or whether he was missing. Later, analysis of the tape revealed what the police failed to realize at the time, that the murders had occurred while the hotline operator was listening.|$|E
60|$|Another moment, and the {{rattling}} chain {{caused a}} tremor through the vessel, which ceased when the anchor touched bottom, and they <b>rode</b> <b>head</b> to wind.|$|R
60|$|The Sirdar, by {{whose side}} General Hunter <b>rode,</b> <b>headed</b> the procession, {{followed}} by his staff. Then, leading his brigade, came Macdonald--stern and hard of face, burnt almost black {{with years of}} campaigning in the desert--and his staff, followed by the black battalions, erect and proud, maintaining their soldierly bearing amid the loud quavering cries of welcome from the women.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain of}} the Bonito had lashed {{together}} some heavy spars and thrown them overboard, having fastened a strong rope to them, and was <b>riding</b> <b>head</b> to the waves by means of this sea anchor, {{at a distance of}} about half a mile from the conflict. A cry of grief and rage had arisen when the crew saw that one of their galleys was disabled, and their excitement became intense when they saw the unequal struggle which Pisani was maintaining.|$|R
60|$|Vincent {{had read}} that the best plan, when caught in an open boat in a gale, was to tie the oars and mast, if she had one, together, and to throw them {{overboard}} with the head rope tied to them, as by this means the boat would <b>ride</b> <b>head</b> to sea. The oars, sculls, mast, and sail were firmly tied together and launched overboard, the rope being first taken off the anchor and tied round {{the middle of the}} clump of spars.|$|R

5000|$|In March 1996, {{voters in}} Horry County {{defeated}} {{a measure that}} would have levied a 1 percent sales tax countywide to pay for future road infrastructure in the Myrtle Beach area, including {{what would be a}} bypass to alleviate traffic problems in Myrtle Beach and the future Carolina Forest development. South Carolina Governor David Beasley created a local task force in May 1996 to determine short-term and long-term goals for the greater Grand Strand. The concept {{that came out of the}} rejection of the sales tax increase would be called [...] "Plan B." [...] The commission set up became what is currently known as the Road Improvement and Development Effort, or <b>RIDE,</b> <b>headed</b> by Gary Loftus, a former highway commissioner.|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{it was one}} of our frigates the French admiral {{must have}} made up his mind to fight them. They have got a great advantage, covered as they are by those two land batteries. Besides, I {{know that there is a}} spit of sand running out there which will make it very awkward for an enemy, not knowing its position, to attack them. There is one thing, the French will find it {{difficult}} to sail out if they want to. You see the wind is on shore, and they are all <b>riding</b> <b>head</b> to it. There can't be much water inside them. No doubt they could get out all right if they had plenty of time and no one to interfere with them, but it would be a difficult business to manage if the British fleet were upon them." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the York and North Midland Railway on 6 October 1846, {{at the same}} time as the line from Hull to Bridlington. The {{independent}} Malton & Driffield Railway company obtained parliamentary approval to build a branch line between there and Malton in the same year, but more than six years would pass before it was ready for traffic, the first train running in May 1853. This was never more than a rural branch line, but the final route into the town, from Selby via Market Weighton (opened on 1 May 1890), proved rather more important as it soon became busy with holiday traffic from the West <b>Riding</b> <b>heading</b> for the resorts further up the coast. Today, though only the original coast line remains in use, the Malton line having succumbed to road competition as long ago as June 1950, the Selby line falling victim to the Beeching Axe almost exactly fifteen years later (closing on 14 June 1965).|$|R

The nearer we haul to the rocks, the greater {{will be our}} command of them, while the more the chances of the Arabs' throwing their bullets on our decks will be diminished. Indeed, {{so long as we}} <b>ride</b> <b>head</b> to wind, they cannot fire low enough to effect their object from the northern reef, and on the southern they will not venture very near, for want of cover. It is true it will be impossible for us to bend our sails or to send out a boat in the face of so heavy a fire, while our assailants are so effectually covered; but we may possibly dislodge them with the gun, or with our small-arms, from the decks. If not, I will head a party into the tops, from which I will undertake to drive them {{out of the reach of}} our muskets in five minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|And [...] "Have faith," [...] {{said the}} {{commercial}} traveller {{as he walked}} into water heavy as quicksilver. [...] "Walk!" [...] I walked, and I walked till my legs flew up and I had to walk as one struggling with a high wind, but still I <b>rode</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders above the water. It was a horrible feeling, this inability to sink. Swimming was not much use. You couldn't get a grip of the water, so I e'en sat me down and drifted like a luxurious anemone among the hundreds that were bathing in that place. You could wallow for three-quarters of an hour in that warm, sticky brine and fear no evil consequences; but when you came out you were coated with white salt from top to toe. And if you accidentally swallowed a mouthful of the water, you died. This is true, because I swallowed half a mouthful and was half-dead in consequence.|$|R
