5000|$|In the 1990s, {{aircraft}} manufacturers {{were planning}} to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the [...] "80-metre box" [...] was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m wingspan and length to be accommodated. Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines, and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 m loadbearing width. The US FAA initially opposed this, then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m runways without restrictions. The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400. Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, <b>runway</b> <b>shoulders</b> and taxiway shoulders {{may be required to}} be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than 25 m from the centre line of the aircraft, compared to 21 m for the 747-400, and 747-8.|$|E
50|$|In September 2006 {{reconstruction}} {{started on}} the main runway and taxiways. This {{was the first time}} the runway had been reconstructed (as opposed to resurfaced) since it was opened in 1966. This work was completed in 2007. In addition to <b>runway</b> and <b>shoulder</b> work was the upgrade of the 40-year-old airfield group lighting with a new system, intended to upgrade the runway to ILS Category III standards.|$|R
40|$|On April 11, 2005 {{have been}} {{implemented}} examination Civil Aviation facilities Dipangkalan TNI Air Force Abdul Rachman Saleh Malang, East Java Province Affair, Government of Malang Regency, PT. Sriwijaya Air and other related agencies. {{within the framework of}} the operation back Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport, for flight services can run well until 2022, hence the need for the physical development of both sides of the Air and Land sides. Planning the development of air side Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport in Malang to the dimensions using the FAA (Federal Adviation Administration) with Boeing 737 - 200 aircraft plans, and for thick layers of pavement using the methods of CBR (California Bearing ration). The study plan Boeing 737 - 200 aircraft: the dimensions required runway length of 2730 m, minimum width 30 m, the minimum <b>runway</b> <b>shoulder</b> width 6 m, width blastpad 42 m, 60 m long and 150 m wide safe areas; taxiway width dimension of at least 18 m; minimum shoulder width of 6 m; safe area 36 m wide, while the width dimension Apron is 105 m long and 93. 3 m. For Runway pavement thickness: upper layer perkerasan 15. 24 cm layer of foundation over 22. 86 cm, and the base layer 25. 83 cm 63. 18 cm total thickness of pavement, while for the thick pavement taxiway, and Apron: 12. 70 cm layer of pavement; layer of foundation over 20 : 32 cm base layer 30. 14 cm 63. 18 cm total thickness of pavement...|$|R
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Guadalcanal Campaign it was planned that the area would be developed into a major air base. In November 1942 the 6th Naval Construction Battalion began work on a fighter strip at Lunga Point, the 6th Battalion was later replaced by the First Marine Aviation Engineers who completed the coral-surfaced runway by 1 January 1943. In June–July 1943 the 46th and 61st Battalions built a second coral-surfaced [...] by [...] <b>runway</b> with [...] <b>shoulders,</b> coral taxiways [...] wide, and 121 hardstands. The 26th Battalion built a tank farm providing storage for [...] of aviation gasoline, [...] of motor gasoline, and [...] of diesel oil.|$|R
2500|$|The airport has {{a single}} [...] runway {{numbered}} 17–35 (roughly north–south). The <b>runway</b> has [...] <b>shoulders</b> on each side and has [...] between the touchdown points. The runway has a parallel taxiway (Y), with nine intersections. There is also a taxiway further in along between the terminal and technical area (W). There are six intersections between W and Y, one of {{which leads to the}} military area. There is instrument landing system (ILS) category I on both directions. The airport has an airport surveillance radar; there are both a surveillance radar and a backup radar located on Sotra. The runway has a capacity of maximum twenty landings and twenty departures per hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{land was}} cleared {{and the site}} {{prepared}} for construction. There were eight homes, seven barns, and some other buildings to be razed. The airfield consisted of three concrete <b>runways</b> with bituminous <b>shoulders,</b> 6230x148(NE/SW), 6300x148(NW/SE), 6000x175(N/S) including three large parking ramps, several hangars, a control tower and other auxiliary support aircraft buildings. The ground station, located {{to the north of}} the airfield, consisted of more than one hundred buildings, all intended to be temporary. Station buildings and streets were also constructed, the buildings consisting primarily of wood, tar paper, and non-masonry siding. The use of concrete and steel was limited because of the critical need elsewhere. Most buildings were hot and dusty in the summer and very cold in the winter. Water, sewer and electrical services were also constructed. Initially there was no paving to the streets, compressed earth served immediate needs.|$|R
