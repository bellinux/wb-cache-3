40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> (response variable) during CNC plasma-arc cutting of St 37 mild steel plates. The four (4) input parameters (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, and torch standoff distance) of the ANN was selected following the results (relative importance) of the Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) performed based on seven (7) factors (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, arc voltage, air pressure, pierce height, and torch standoff distance) in a previous study. A multi-parameter optimization was carried out using the robust design. An L 18 (21 × 37) Taguchi orthogonal array experiment was conducted and the <b>right</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> was measured, aiming at the investigation of the influence of plasma-arc cut process parameters on <b>right</b> side <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> of St 37 mild steel cut surface. The selection of quality characteristics, material, plate thickness and other process parameter levels and experimental limits was based on the experience and current needs of the Greek machining industry. A feed-forward backpropagation (FFBP) neural network was fitted on the experimental data. The results show that accurate predictions of the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> can be achieved inside the experimental region, through the trained FFBP-ANN. The developed ANN model could be further used for the optimization of the cutting parameters during CNC plasma-arc cutting. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

The blade 450 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> required 23. 74 per cent more cutting energy than the blade with 300 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> for 30 mm diameter stem. Whereas the blade with 450 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> required 16. 05 percent more cutting force than the blade with 300 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle.</b> There was 21. 65 % higher blade velocity required for 450 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> as compared to 300 <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> blade.

40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} of plasma arc cutting {{has been carried}} out using AISI 4140 and AISI 304 stainless steel as work-piece. The process parameters were considered as follows: feed rate, cutting current, cutting speed, gas pressure, voltage and torch height. The response parameters were chosen as follows: material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness (SR), <b>right</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> (RBA), chamfer, dross, kerf width and heat affected zone (HAZ) which are the main cut quality characteristics of plasma arc cutting operation. The optimization of the process parameters have been carried out using desirability function, grey based principal component analysis (PCA) hybrid approach, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA) and teaching-learning-based-optimization (TLBO) algorithm coupled with response surface methodology (RSM). A regression model was developed that represents the relationship between independent and dependent variables based on RSM. This type of novel approach has been proposed to evaluate and estimate the influence of plasma arc machining parameters on the quality of cut. This user-friendly mathematical approach is straight forward and the results thus obtained have also been validated by running confirmatory tests. The premise attributes provide beneficial knowledge for managing the machining parameters to enhance the preciseness of machined parts by plasma arc cutting. The obtained results indicate that the TLBO approach was significantly affected by the machining parameters directly with easy operability and economically...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: Achieving {{appropriate}} seal in canal obturation is {{the main}} goal of endodontic therapy. However, in some cases, {{it can not be}} obtained by non-surgical procedures alone. Retrograde surgery {{is one of the most}} common procedures in endodontics. Apical seal improvement can be obtained by root end filling and decreasing the root end resection <b>angle</b> (<b>bevel</b> <b>angle).</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the role of <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> on apical microleakage following the use of amalgam and MTA as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 128 extracted human teeth were instrumented and obturated by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into two groups and the apical root resection was performed by high speed fissure bur (one group perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth and the other 45 &# 61616; to the long axis. The 3 mm root end cavity was prepared by ultrasonic device. Each group was divided into two subgroups: One filled with amalgam and the other with MTA. Teeth were incubated for 72 h, covered by two layers of nail polish (except for apical 3 mm) and submerged in methylene blue for 48 h. Teeth were washed under tap water and mesiodistally dissected by low speed disc. Dye penetration was evaluated by stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by two way ANOVA and Tukey tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The results showed that retrofill material type had a significant effect on microleakage and MTA was superior to amalgam in this respect. <b>Bevel</b> <b>angle</b> failed to show any significant effect on apical microleakage. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of MTA instead of amalgam in clinical practice can improve the success rate of endodontic surgery whereas the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> can be determined based on the status of each individual case; However, increasing the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> seems to increase microleakage due to exposure of more dentinal tubules...|$|R
