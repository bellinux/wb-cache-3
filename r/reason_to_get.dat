When asked why they were leaving, Lennon replied [...] "If you're so cosmic, you'll know why". Paul Mason, a biographer of the Maharishi, later interpreted Lennon's statement as a challenge to the Maharishi's claim of cosmic consciousness. Lennon said that his mind was made up when the Maharishi gave him a murderous look in response. According to Mardas: [...] "John Lennon and I went to the Maharishi about what had happened... he asked the Maharishi to explain himself"; and the Maharishi answered Lennon's accusation by saying, [...] "I am only human".

IGN (U.S.) scored it 9.5/10 and said the game was an [...] "instant classic".

40|$|Background: Health Authorities {{recommend}} {{influenza vaccination}} of healthcare personnel (HCP) {{to decrease the}} transmission of influenza to vulnerable patients. Recent studies have almost exclusively used quantitative questionnaires {{in order to identify}} determinants of vaccination behaviour. Interviews enable HCP to express freely why they think they are (not) willing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> vaccinated against influenza. Methods: By means of semi-structured one-on-one interviews with 123 Belgian, Dutch and German HCP, reasons for and against vaccination, experiences with influenza vaccination, intention <b>to</b> <b>get</b> vaccinated and possible barriers, as well as willingness to advice influenza vaccination to patients were investigated. Data were processed with QSR NVivo 8. 0 and analysed using a combination of a deductive and a general inductive approach. Results: Across countries, self-protection, patient protection, and protection of family members were reported as most important <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> vaccinated against influenza. <b>Reasons</b> <b>to</b> not <b>get</b> vaccinated against influenza were fear of side effects caused by the vaccine, a low risk-perception, the disbelief in the effectiveness of influenza vaccination, organizational barriers, misconceptions, and undefined negative emotions. Conclusions: The social cognitive variables underlying the decision of HCP <b>to</b> <b>get</b> vaccinated against influenza (or not) seem to be similar in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, even though some differences surfaced. A quantitative investigation of those social cognitive variables is needed {{in order to determine the}} importance of the social cognitive variables in explaining the intention <b>to</b> <b>get</b> vaccinated and the importance of the similarities and differences between countries that have been found in this study...|$|R
