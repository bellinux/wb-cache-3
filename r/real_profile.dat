40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of road roughness {{and its effects on}} vehicles response in terms of ride quality, loads induced on pavement, drivers’ comfort, etc., it is very common to generate road profiles based on the equation provided by ISO 8608 standard, according to which it is possible to group road surface profiles into eight different classes. However, <b>real</b> <b>profiles</b> are significantly different from the artificial ones because of the non-stationary feature of the first ones and the not full capability of the ISO 8608 equation to correctly describe the frequency content of <b>real</b> road <b>profiles.</b> In this paper, the international roughness index, the frequency-weighted vertical acceleration awz according to ISO 2631, and the dynamic load index are applied both on artificial and <b>real</b> <b>profiles,</b> highlighting the different results obtained.

30|$|The {{present study}} was a {{numerical}} investigation aiming at identifying the key parameters controlling 1 D site response, starting with the linear domain as the first stage. For 858 soil columns corresponding to measured, <b>real</b> sites <b>profiles</b> from Japan, the USA, and Europe, the 1 D linear (viscoelastic) response was computed for vertically incident plane waves and a representative set of real input accelerograms spanning {{a wide range of}} peak frequencies. The geometric averages of the corresponding amplifications were derived from the ratio of surface to input acceleration response spectra, both in terms of frequency-dependent amplification factors AF(f) and in terms of “summary” short- and mid-period amplification factors F_a and F_v, averaged over period ranges [0.1  s, 0.2  s] and [0.75  s, 1.5  s], respectively. Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models were used to investigate the relationships between these amplification factors and several “usual” site proxies, i.e., V_S 30, f_ 0, sediment thickness, corresponding harmonic average sediment velocity, maximum velocity contrast, and bedrock velocity. Since <b>real</b> <b>profiles</b> exhibit a large site-to-site variability in bedrock velocity, two other sets of profiles with a constant bedrock velocity set to 800  m/s were considered. A common scaling was first applied to velocity and thickness values to normalize the <b>real</b> <b>profiles</b> to a uniform bedrock velocity of 800  m/s (without changing the transfer functions). The same <b>real</b> <b>profiles</b> were also truncated at the depth where their S-wave velocity first exceeded 800  m/s. GRNN models were then developed for these two additional sets of profiles. Many GRNN models were considered in each case, with all possible combinations of site proxies. This provided a mechanism for comparing the performances of every proxy to explain (and predict) site amplification.|$|R

The direct and inverse approaches were used. The MINUIT program from the packets of CERN's library was used to solve direct problems. Tikhonov's regularization method was also applied to solve the same problems in an inverse manner. Model functions were introduced to check the applicability limitation of these methods and make a comparison between them as well. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches were shown. The procedures were applied to the measured profiles of He II's spectral lines in a pulsed low-pressure arc. The chosen lines are He II Paschen-alpha (468. 6 nm) in the visible region and Balmer-beta (121. 5 nm) in the VUV spectral region. The range of experimental errors was determined where both approaches have given reliable results. It was found that we can obtain the <b>real</b> <b>profile</b> of He II 468. 6 nm and He II 121. 5 nm spectral lines, using the regularization method, when the estimates of errors are less than 15 % and 10 %, respectively.

Privacy threats and disclosing personal information {{are the most important}} concerns of OSNs users. Recently, a new attack which is named Identity Cloned Attack is detected on OSNs. In this attack the attacker tries to make a fake identity of a real user in order to access to private information of the users friends which they do not publish on the public profiles. In today OSNs, there are some verification services, but they are not active services and they are useful for users who are familiar with online identity issues. In this paper, Identity cloned attacks are explained in more details and a new and precise method to detect profile cloning in online social networks is proposed. In this method, first, the social network is shown in a form of graph, then, according to similarities among users, this graph is divided into smaller communities.
