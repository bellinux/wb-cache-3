25|$|The crew, {{after finding}} the plane controllable, decided {{to fly a}} <b>racetrack</b> <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> close to Changi airport while {{assessing}} {{the status of the}} aircraft. It took 50 minutes to complete this initial assessment. The first officer and supervising check captain (SCC) then input the plane's status to the landing distance performance application (LDPA) for a landing 50 tonnes over maximum landing weight at Changi. Based on these inputs the LDPA could not calculate a landing distance. After discussion the crew elected to remove inputs related to a wet runway, in the knowledge that the runway was dry. The LDPA then returned the information that the landing was feasible with 100 metres of runway remaining. The flight then returned to Singapore Changi Airport, landing safely after the crew extended the landing gear by a gravity drop emergency extension system, at 11:45a.m. Singapore time. As a result of the aircraft landing 35 knots faster than normal, four tyres were blown.|$|E

5000|$|Hold {{in lieu of}} {{procedure}} turn: It is established over a final or intermediate fix when an approach {{can be made from}} a properly aligned <b>holding</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is a required maneuver, as is a PT, unless the aircraft is being radar vectored to the final approach course, when 'NoPT' is shown on the approach chart, or when the pilot requests or the controller advises the pilot to make a 'straight-in' approach. This maneuver is commonly referred to as the racetrack pattern. It is another method of course reversal, {{but it can also be}} used for losing altitude within protected airspace. A <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> used for this purpose is depicted in U.S. government publications as the [...] "hold-in-lieu-of-PT" [...] <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> symbol.

40|$|Conflict Alerts for {{aircraft}} in <b>holding</b> <b>patterns</b> are often missed or in error due to fact that holding trajectories are not modeled in Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe logic. In addition, a controller in one sector {{may not know}} when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in <b>holding</b> <b>patterns.</b> A <b>holding</b> function for conflict probe applications has been developed and tested with air traffic data from Fort Worth Center. The holding function automatically determines when an aircraft enters a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern,</b> builds a <b>holding</b> region around the pattern and then probes the region for conflict with other traffic. The operational concept of use assumes that air traffic controllers are very busy during periods when aircraft are in holding and therefore don't have time to manually enter information which defines a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> and activates conflict probing. For this reason, it is important the holding function automatically detect aircraft in holding and compute a holding region for conflict analysis. The controller is then alerted if other aircraft are predicted to fly through the holding region at the holding altitude...|$|R
50|$|The {{entry to}} a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is often the}} hardest part for a novice pilot to grasp, and {{determining}} and executing the proper entry while simultaneously controlling the aircraft, navigating and communicating with ATC requires practice. There are three standard types of entries: direct, parallel, and offset (teardrop). The proper entry procedure {{is determined by the}} angle difference between the direction the aircraft flies to arrive at the beacon and the direction of the inbound leg of the <b>holding</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|R

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} intending to land must be delayed, {{the air traffic}} control (ATC) may decide to place it in a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> until the airport is prepared to permit the landing.

5000|$|A <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> for {{instrument}} flight rules (IFR) aircraft {{is usually a}} racetrack pattern based on a holding fix. This fix can be a radio beacon such as a non-directional beacon (NDB) or VHF omnidirectional range (VOR). The fix {{is the start of}} the first turn of the racetrack pattern. Aircraft will fly towards the fix, and once there will enter a predefined <b>racetrack</b> <b>pattern.</b> A standard <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> uses right-hand turns and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete (one minute for each 180 degree turn, and two one-minute straight ahead sections). [...] Deviations from this pattern can happen if long delays are expected; longer legs (usually two or three minutes) may be used, or aircraft with distance measuring equipment (DME) may be assigned patterns with legs defined in nautical miles rather than minutes. Less frequent turns are more comfortable for passengers and crew. Additionally, left-hand turns may be assigned to some <b>holding</b> <b>patterns</b> if there are airspace or traffic restrictions nearby.|$|R
