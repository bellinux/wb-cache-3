25|$|Very {{recently}} the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that L-DOPA is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor. L-DOPA is {{a by-product of}} melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, L-DOPA is released to the retina in the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> and is necessary for specific stages of retinal development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by L-DOPA leads to the secretion of a neurotropic factor by the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> that helps in normal retinal development.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} alternative splicing in the retina, we sequenced and analyzed a total of 115, 706 clones from normalized cDNA libraries from mouse neural retina (66, 217) and rat <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> (49, 489). Based upon clustering the cDNAs and mapping them with their respective genomes, the estimated numbers of genes were 9, 134 for the mouse neural retina and 12, 050 for the rat <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> libraries. This unique collection of retinal of messenger RNAs is maintained and accessible through a web-base server to the whole community of retinal biologists for further functional characterization. The analysis revealed 3, 248 and 3, 202 alternative splice events for mouse neural retina and rat <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> respectively. We focused on transcription factors involved in vision. Among the six candidates suitable for functional analysis, we selected Otx 2 S, a novel variant of the Otx 2 gene with a deletion within the homeodomain sequence. Otx 2 S is expressed in both the neural retina and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> and encodes a protein that is targeted to the nucleus. OTX 2 S exerts transdominant activity on the tyrosinase promoter when tested in the physiological environment of primary RPE cells. By overexpressing OTX 2 S in primary RPE cells using an adeno associated viral vector, we identified 10 genes whose expression is positively regulated by OTX 2 S. We find that OTX 2 S is able to bind to the chromatin at the promoter of the retinal dehydrogenase 10 (RDH 10) gene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies of}} mouse embryos {{concluded}} {{that after the}} optic vesicle evaginates from the ventral forebrain and contacts the surface ectoderm, signals from the ectoderm specify the distal region of the optic vesicle to become retina and signals from the optic vesicle induce the lens. Germline deletion of Bmp 4 resulted in failure of lens formation. We performed conditional deletion of Bmp 4 from the optic vesicle to test the function of Bmp 4 in murine eye development. The optic vesicle evaginated normally and contacted the surface ectoderm. Lens induction did not occur. The optic cup failed to form and the expression of retina-specific genes decreased markedly in the distal optic vesicle. Instead, cells in the prospective retina expressed genes characteristic of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> We conclude that Bmp 4 is required for retina specification in mice. In the absence of Bmp 4, formation of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> is the default differentiation pathway of the optic vesicle. Differences in the signaling pathways required for specification of the retina and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> in chicken and mouse embryos suggest major changes in signaling during {{the evolution of the}} vertebrate eye...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} understanding of pigment cell biology, we developed a method to concomitantly purify melanocytes, iridophores, and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> from zebrafish, and analyzed their transcriptomes. Comparing expression data from these cell types and whole embryos allowed us to reveal gene expression co-enrichment in melanocytes and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> {{as well as in}} melanocytes and iridophores. We found 214 genes co-enriched in melanocytes and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> indicating the shared functions of melanin-producing cells. We found 62 genes significantly co-enriched in melanocytes and iridophores, illustrative of their shared developmental origins from the neural crest. This is also the first analysis of the iridophore transcriptome. Gene expression analysis for iridophores revealed extensive enrichment of specific enzymes to coordinate production of their guanine-based reflective pigment. We speculate the coordinated upregulation of specific enzymes from several metabolic pathways recycles the rate-limiting substrate for purine synthesis, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, thus constituting a guanine cycle. The purification procedure and expression analysis described here, along with the accompanying transcriptome-wide expression data, provide the first mRNA sequencing data for multiple purified zebrafish pigment cell types, and will be a useful resource for further studies of pigment cell biology...|$|R
25|$|CSCR is {{a disease}} in which a serous {{detachment}} of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE).

40|$|International audienceInherited retinal degenerations are {{blinding}} diseases {{characterized by}} the loss of photoreceptors. Their extreme genetic heterogeneity complicates treatment by gene therapy. This has motivated broader strategies for transplantation of healthy <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> to protect photoreceptors independently of the gene causing the disease. The limited clinical benefit for visual function reported up to now is mainly due to dedifferentiation of the transplanted cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We have studied this mechanism in vitro and revealed the role of the homeogene OTX 2 in preventing dedifferentiation through the regulation of target genes. We have overexpressed OTX 2 in <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> epithelial cells. OTX 2 increases significantly the protection of photoreceptors as seen by histological and functional analyses. We observed that the beneficial effect of OTX 2 is non-cell autonomous, and it is at least partly mediated by unidentified trophic factors.

25|$|Ocular {{albinism}} type 1 (OA1), {{also called}} Nettleship–Falls syndrome, {{is the most}} common type of ocular albinism, with a prevalence rate of 1:50,000. It is an inheritable classical Mendelian type X-linked recessive disorder wherein the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> lacks pigment while hair and skin appear normal. Since it is usually an X-linked disorder, it occurs mostly in males, while females are carriers unless they are homozygous. About 60 missense and nonsense mutations, insertions, and deletions have been identified in Oa1. Mutations in OA1 have been linked to defective glycosylation and thus improper intracellular transportation.|$|E
40|$|Nucleotides {{present an}} {{important}} role in ocular physiology which has been demonstrated by recent works that indicate their involvement in many ocular processes. P 2 Y are important among P 2 receptors since they can control tear production, corneal wound healing, aqueous humour dynamics and retinal physiology. Commercial antibodies have allowed us to investigate the distribution of P 2 Y receptors in the cornea, anterior and posterior chamber of the eye and retina. The P 2 Y 1 receptor was present mainly in cornea, ciliary processes, and trabecular meshwork. The P 2 Y 2 receptors were present in cornea, ciliary processes and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> P 2 Y 4 was present in cornea, ciliary processes, photoreceptors, outer plexiform layer and ganglion cell layer. The P 2 Y 6 presented almost an identical distribution as the P 2 Y 4 receptor. The P 2 Y 11 was also detectable in the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> The detailed distribution of the receptors clearly supports the recent findings indicating the relevant role of nucleotides in the ocular function...|$|R
40|$|Congenital hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> is an {{ocular lesion}} found in {{patients}} harboring mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. We report that Apc-deficient zebrafish display developmental abnormalities {{of both the}} lens and retina. Injection of dominant-negative Lef reduced Wnt signaling in the lens but did not rescue retinal differentiation defects. In contrast, treatment of apc mutants with all-trans retinoic acid rescued retinal differentiation defects but had no apparent effect on the lens. We identified Rdh 5 as a retina-specific retinol dehydrogenase controlled by APC. Morpholino knockdown of Rdh 5 phenocopied the apc mutant retinal differentiation defects and was rescued by treatment with exogenous all-trans retinoic acid. Microarray analyses of apc mutants and Rdh 5 morphants revealed a profound overlap in the transcriptional profile of these embryos. These findings support a model wherein Apc serves a dual role in regulating Wnt and retinoic acid signaling within the eye and suggest retinoic acid deficiency as an explanation for APC mutation-associated retinal defects such as congenital hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium...</b>|$|R

25|$|Microscopic {{examination}} of <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> and skin pigment cells (melanocytes) of people affected by ocular albinism type 1 reveal {{the presence of}} characteristic macromelanosomes, even though skin appears normal. Studies from Oa1 knock-out mice reveal that these giant melanosomes appear due to abnormal growth of a single melanosome and not due to aggregation or fusion of many melanosomes. These melanin macroglobules are probably formed due to failure of melanosomes to separate from the ER-golgi system with the accumulation of enzymes and other secretory proteins leading to an increase organelle size. However, Incerti, et al. contradict the above theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as photophobia, which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E

A variety of signaling pathways have been implicated in {{the maintenance of the}} optic dorsoventral axis, including, but not limited to, bone morphogenetic protein 4, Sonic Hedgehog and retinoic acid. Here, we investigated the possible contribution of Wnt ligands to the establishment or maintenance of the optic axis by analyzing their expression pattern during early chick optic development. We performed in situ hybridization of Wnt- 1, Wnt- 3 a, Wnt- 4, and Wnt- 5 a during the optic vesicle, early optic cup and established optic cup stages and focused our analysis on the optic region. Our data showed that Wnt- 5 a, but none of the others, is expressed in the dorsal region of the eye starting from the Hamburger and Hamilton stage 14 (HH 14). These results are supported by cryosections of the labeled optic region, which further reveal that Wnt- 5 a is expressed only in the dorsal <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Thus, we propose that Wnt- 5 a is a marker for dorsal <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> in chick embryos from HH 14 to HH 19...|$|R

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is a leading}} cause of irreversible vision loss in older individuals worldwide. The disease is characterized by abnormal extracellular deposits, known as drusen, that accumulate along the basal surface of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium.</b> Although drusen deposition is common in older individuals, large numbers of drusen and/or extensive areas of confluent drusen represent a significant risk factor for AMD. Widespread drusen deposition is associated with <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> epithelial cell dysfunction and degeneration of the photoreceptor cells of the neural retina. Recent studies have shown that drusen contain a variety of immunomodulatory molecules, suggesting that the process of drusen formation involves local inflammatory events, including activation of the complement cascade. Similar observations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have lead to the hypothesis that chronic localized inflammation is an important element of AD pathogenesis, with significant neurodegenerative consequences. Accordingly, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, a major constituent of neuritic plaques in AD, has been implicated as a primary activator of complement in AD. Here we show that Aβ is associated with a substructural vesicular component within drusen. Aβ colocalizes with activated complement components in these “amyloid vesicles,” thereby identifying them as potential primary sites of complement activation. Thus, Aβ deposition could be {{an important component of the}} local inflammatory events that contribute to atrophy of the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium,</b> drusen biogenesis, and the pathogenesis of AMD...|$|R
50|$|A further {{difference}} between albinism and leucism is in eye colour. Due {{to the lack}} of melanin production in both the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigmented</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE) and iris, those affected by albinism typically have red eyes due to the underlying blood vessels showing through. In contrast, most leucistic animals have normally coloured eyes. This is because the melanocytes of the RPE are not derived from the neural crest, instead an outpouching of the neural tube generates the optic cup which, in turn, forms the retina. As these cells are from an independent developmental origin, they are typically unaffected by the genetic cause of leucism.|$|R

This cycle begins with 11-cis retinal absorbing light and isomerizing into all-trans retinal. The change in shape of the molecule after absorbing light in turn changes {{the configuration of the}} complex protein rhodopsin, the visual pigment used in low light levels. [...] This represents the first step of the visual cycle. This is why eating foods rich in vitamin A is often said to allow an individual to see in the dark, although the effect they have on one's vision is negligible. In fact, excess vitamin A intake can cause toxicity to the optic nerve and permanent vision loss.|$|E

The posterior part of the retina, called the <b>retinal</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>epithelium</b> (RPE) is responsible for, among many other things, absorbing light that crosses the retina so it cannot bounce {{to other parts of the}} retina. Interestingly, in many vertebrates, such as cats, where high visual acuity is not a priority, there is a reflecting tapetum layer that gives the photoreceptors a [...] "second chance" [...] to absorb the light, thus improving the ability to see in the dark.

We have now identified basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or an immunologically related protein from the FGF family, within the IPM. The IPM is labeled on sections of primate retinas by a battery of polyclonal antibodies (Abs) directed against various peptide sequences of bFGF and by an Ab to bovine brain bFGF. bFGF Abs also bind to purified preparations of aqueous-insoluble IPM.
