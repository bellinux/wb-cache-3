40|$|This paper studies {{a public}} firm's {{incentive}} {{to raise its}} productive efficiency by undertaking cost-reducing R&D investment when it competes against a foreign private firm. Our focus is <b>to</b> <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> how a decrease in an importing tariff levied on foreign goods affects this investment level inter alia. We show that when the government imposes non-negative tariffs, a tariff reduction lowers the R&D investment, irrespective of whether the public firm has downward or upward sloping reaction curve. Namely, R&D investment conducted by the public firm is substitutable to an importing tariff. Furthermore, under a linear demand assumption, it is concluded that a tariff reduction necessarily enhances world welfare if both R&D investment and tariffs are set to domestic welfare-maximizing levels. More strict assumptions on marginal cost and R&D cost function make complete trade liberalization desirable {{from the viewpoint of}} world welfare. ...|$|R

A certain drunken, rather brutal Phantasm of a Prince Radzivil, who hates the Czartoryskis, and is dreadfully given to drink, to wasteful ambitions and debaucheries, figures much in these businesses; is got banished and confiscated, by some Confederation formed; then, by new Confederations, is recalled and reinstated,--worse if possible than ever.

40|$|Abstract: <b>To</b> <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> the {{difficulty}} in the expression and measurement of Non-subjected Information in earthquake emergency decision-making under fuzzy environmental conditions, a ranking method was put forward for earthquake emergency events on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets. Via the explanation about the concept of Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets, intuitionistic fuzzy matrix and its interval estimation was established for {{the set of the}} earthquake emergency events, and the positive and negative ideal intuitionistic fuzzy earthquake emergency was determined; Through defining the distance calculation about subjected, non-subjected and hesitated degree, and respectively comparing the distance from the emergency to the positive and negative ideal event, the superiority degree model was established for the earthquake emergency events, which further gained the sequence of the emergency event collection. Case showed that model effectively solved the ranking problem about earthquake emergency events, which provided one theory and method for scientific decision-making practice in shock resistance and disaster relief. Bursting, diversity, spatial and temporal coupling, and chain distribution characteristics in earthquake disaster, required systematic shock resistance and disaster relief [1], namely to systematicall...|$|R
40|$|Post Second World War liberal {{economic}} order and its institutions have been challenged with {{the rapidly growing}} powerful economies of some Asian and Latin American countries in the last decade. Yet, there is ambiguity in international political economy field with regard to conceptualizing and categorizing these emerging economies. This study mainly aims <b>to</b> <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> this obstacle by offering a new quantitative benchmarking framework. In other words, this study proposes a new evaluation criteria set for assessing emerging economies with combining testable domestic and systematic factors. Accordingly, this study presents the cross-country comparison by using quantitative benchmarking analysis between IBSA -India, Brazil and South Africa- and MIST -Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey- countries over the period 2008 - 2012. We compare these countries based on the criteria of economic growth, human development index, foreign direct investment, and official development assistance. This study also aims to evaluate the group performance of these newly emerging economies- namely the rise of IBSA and MIST countries-in a comparative perspective. In conclusion, the performance of these countries -from both group-of-country and individual-country perspectives- are discussed {{in light of the}} result...|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{infrastructure}} {{is involved with}} ecological security and health of cities. At present {{there are so many}} studies about it. However, quantitative study is muchindetermination and imperfection. In this paper in order <b>to</b> <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> this problem, the evaluation indexes system are established on the basis of air system, greenbelt system and water system from the conception and connotation of ecological infrastructure. They do not only consult inside and outside of Chinese ecological cities and garden cities but also consult with internal and international related index standard. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the method of comprehensive index evaluation are applied to establish the evaluation model. Then it studies the quality and evolvement characteristics of ecolocal infrastructure in the case of main town of Chongqing, Yichang, Fulin, Wanzhou——the four pivot cities of Three Gorges Reservoir Region from 2002 to 2005. Finally, the paper draws a conclusion by qulitative and quantitative analysis showing that the quality of ecological infrastructure of four cities is in rise. At present, the quality of ecological infrastructure of Yichang and Fulin remains with better grade; Wanzhou and the main town of Chongqin belongs to common grade. The integrated quality conditins of ecological infrstructure of these four cities follow the sequence (from high to low) : Yichang> Fulin> Wanzhou> main town of Chongqing. The quality of ecological infrastructure of four cities is known through evaluation analysis, which has provided a scientific basis for the cities Three Gorges Reseveoir Region in programming...|$|R
40|$|The 3 -dimensional {{structure}} of the fibrous cytoskeleton of 3 T 3 cells was examined by scanning electron microscopy of cells extracted with the non-ionic detergent Triton X- 100. Detergent-extracted cells consist of the nucleus and an extensive system of fibres, the largest of which correspond to stress fibres visible by phase-contrast microscopy. The system of fibres, which is coterminous with {{the borders of the}} native cell, remains firmly adherent to the sub-stratum. The major fibres branch into smaller fibrils which appear <b>to</b> end by <b>ravelling</b> <b>out</b> into fine filaments that constitute a matted network in a plane very close to that of the substratum. In the nuclear region all the major fibres pass {{over the top of the}} nucleus, where they may also branch into a system of fine fibrils. Thin-section transmission electron microscopy in con-junction with heavy meromyosin treatment of extracted cells shows the fibres to be composed of native F-actin. Intermediate filaments are also present, and are prominent in the matted network, together with actin filaments. The major proteins of the residue are identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as actin, a 56000 Dalton peptide, and histones. Also present are myosin heavy chain, peptides of 225000 and 250000, and minor bands at 60000 and 94000 Daltons. The non-ionic detergent extracts 70 % of the cellular protein, including 50 % of the actin and 75 % of the myosin. The Triton-insoluble fraction of 3 T 3 cells appears to constitute, in addition to the nucleus, a stable cytoskeletal system, composed largely of contractile proteins and 10 -nm filaments, which functions in maintenance of cell shape, in substratum adhesion, and in positioning the nucleus within the cell...|$|R

60|$|As my pen {{finishes}} these passages, I can but be amused {{to think}} what a terrible hubbub would have been made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of opinion {{a quarter of a}} century ago. In fact, the contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the Darwinian question; between the estimation in which Darwin's views are now held in the scientific world; between the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of the self-respecting order at the present day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new theory respecting the origin of species first became known to the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes inclined to think my memories dreams. I have a great respect for the younger generation myself (they can write our lives, and <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> all our follies, if they choose to take the trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that the feeling is reciprocal; but I am afraid that the story of our dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that veneration for our wisdom which I should like them to display. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago, Mr. Darwin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and geological investigations had long given him an assured position among the most eminent and original investigators of the day; while his charming 'Voyage of a Naturalist' had justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had a better right to expect that anything he might choose to say on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened to with profound attention, and discussed with respect; and there was certainly no man whose personal character should have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences.|$|R

6000|$|But it is {{affirmed that}} there is {{something}} innately vulgar in the Yankee dialect. M. Sainte-Beuve says, with his usual neatness: 'Je définis un patois une ancienne langue qui a eu des malheurs, ou encore une langue toute jeune st qui n'a pas fait fortune.' The first part of his definition applies to a dialect like the Provençal, the last to the Tuscan before Dante had lifted it into a classic, and neither, it seems to me, will quite fit a patois/, which is not properly a dialect, but rather certain archaisms, proverbial phrases, and modes of pronunciation, which maintain themselves among the uneducated {{side by side with the}} finished and universally accepted language. Norman French, for example, or Scotch down to the time of James VI., could hardly be called patois, while I should be half inclined to name the Yankee a lingo rather than a dialect. It has retained a few words now fallen into disuse in the mother country, like to tarry, to progress, fleshy, fall, and some others; it has changed the meaning of some, as in freshet; and it has clung to what I suspect to have been the broad Norman pronunciation of e (which Molière puts into the mouth of his rustics) in such words as sarvant, parfect, vartoo, and the like. It maintains something of the French sound of a also in words like ch[)a]mber, d[)a]nger (though the latter had certainly begun to take its present sound so early as 1636, when I find it sometimes spelt dainger). But in general it may be said that nothing can be found in it which does not still survive in some one or other of the English provincial dialects. There is, perhaps, a single exception in the verb to sleeve. To sleeve silk means <b>to</b> divide or <b>ravel</b> <b>out</b> a thread of silk with the point of a needle till it becomes floss. (A.S. sléfan, to cleave=divide.) This, I think, explains the 'sleeveless errand' in 'Troilus and Cressida' so inadequately, sometimes so ludicrously darkened by the commentators. Is not a 'sleeveless errand' one that cannot be unravelled, incomprehensible, and therefore bootless? ...|$|R
