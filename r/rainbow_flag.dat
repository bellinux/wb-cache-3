5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag,</b> which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|LGBT rights activists, {{human rights}} activists, {{and other critics}} stated that the broad and vague wording of the law, which was {{characterized}} as a ban on gay propaganda by the media, made {{it a crime to}} publicly make statements or distribute materials in support of LGBT rights, hold pride parades or similar demonstrations, state that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships, or according to Human Rights Campaign (HRC) president Chad Griffin, even display LGBT symbols such as the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag</b> or kiss a same-sex partner in public. The first arrest made under the law involved a person who publicly protested with a sign containing a pro-LGBT message.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Rainbow</b> <b>Flag</b> {{identified}} with the LGBT community was originally created by Gilbert Baker for the 1978 San Francisco Pride Parade.

500|$|After gaining independence, the First Republic of Armenia {{adopted the}} modern Armenian tricolor. Upon Stepan Malkhasyants's {{appearance}} in the Armenian National Council, the independent Armenian government selected the colors used during the Lusignan period: red, blue and yellow. An earlier prototype, which was eventually rejected, was the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag.</b> This prototype {{can be seen at}} the Martiros Saryan House Museum in Yerevan, Armenia. They chose to replace the yellow with orange [...] "because it merged better with the other two colors, presenting a more pleasing composition". The flag of independent Armenia then had a ratio of 2:3, but on August 24, 1990, when the Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted it as the flag of the Republic of Armenia, the ratio was changed to 1:2.|$|E

500|$|Capitol Hill station houses {{three pieces}} of public art as part of Sound Transit's {{system-wide}} art program. Mike Ross's Jet Kiss consists {{of a pair of}} disassembled, pink and yellow fighter jets that hang suspended above the platform. The piece, initially met with public backlash over its use of war planes, references both the city's aviation industry and the city bird, the Blue heron. Capitol Hill cartoonist Ellen Forney has two murals in the station's north and west entrances, Crossed Pinkies and Walking Fingers, which consist of simple, large hands outlined against a bright red background. The murals, which consist of porcelain enamel on steel panels, are meant to evoke a sense of [...] "coming together [...] pulling apart" [...] and playfully leading passengers from street level into the station, respectively. Forney designed Crossed Pinkies to echo Ross's Jet Kiss, sharing a common theme of [...] "coming together". The station also has a pictogram that identifies it on maps and signage, featuring the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag</b> to honor the neighborhood's longtime gay and lesbian community.|$|E
500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag</b> [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E
500|$|Action was {{leveraged}} directly against Olympic {{sponsors and}} partners as well; in late-August 2013, the Human Rights Campaign sent {{letters to the}} ten Worldwide Olympic Partner companies, urging them to show opposition towards anti-LGBT laws, denounce homophobic violence, ask the IOC to obtain written commitments {{for the safety of}} LGBT athletes and attendees, and oppose future Olympic bids from countries that outlaw support for LGBT equality. In February 2014, prior to the games, a group of 40 human rights organizations (including Athlete Ally, Freedom House, Human Rights Campaign, Human Rights Watch and Russian LGBT network among others) also sent a joint letter to the Worldwide Olympic Partners, urging them to use their prominence to support the rights of LGBT athletes under the Olympic Charter, and pressure the IOC to show greater scrutiny towards the human rights abuses of future host countries. On 3 February 2014, USOC sponsor AT issued a statement in support of LGBT rights at the Games, becoming the first major Olympic advertiser to condemn the laws. Several major non-sponsors also made pro-LGBT statements to coincide {{with the opening of the}} Games; Google placed a quotation from the Olympic Charter and an Olympic-themed logo in the colours of the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag</b> on its home page worldwide, while Channel 4 (who serves as the official British broadcaster of the Paralympics) adopted a rainbow-coloured logo and broadcast a [...] "celebratory", pro-LGBT advert entitled [...] "Gay Mountain" [...] on 7 February 2014, alongside an interview with former rugby union player and anti-homophobia activist Ben Cohen. As part of its Dispatches series, Channel 4 had also broadcast a documentary during the week of the Opening Ceremony entitled Hunted, which documented the violence and abuse against LGBT people in Russia in the wake of the law.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 a <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag</b> {{was added}} to the Rising Sun badge which was said to be, [...] "symbolic of Army as an {{inclusive}} organisation that respects diversity".

2500|$|Another {{connection}} is the <b>rainbow</b> <b>flag,</b> {{symbol of the}} LGBT communities {{which may have been}} inspired, in part, by Garland's song [...] "Over the Rainbow."
