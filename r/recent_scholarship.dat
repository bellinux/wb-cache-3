40|$|The article {{initially}} discusses recent {{approaches to}} ecclesiastical {{reform and the}} Investiture Contest. In particular, it discusses {{the extent to which}} <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship's</b> concern with “power,” “local units,” “social aspects,” “discourse,” and “gender” has undermined earlier master narratives – accentuating as these did the unity of reform. The last part of the article argues for the need to establish new master narratives and puts forward a few suggestions in that respect...|$|R

5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I.

5|$|Traditionally, Chesney's {{predecessor}} Alexander {{has been}} credited with commissioning the baptismal font in Lincoln Cathedral, made of Tournai marble. <b>Recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has cast doubt upon this idea, and suggests that the font was instead carved on Chesney's orders, and commissioned after 1150.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E

5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|Michael Francis Egan {{was born}} in Ireland on September 29, 1761. The exact {{location}} of his birth is disputed. Early biographers believed Egan was possibly born in Galway; more <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> suggests it was Limerick. He joined the Order of Friars Minor (commonly known as the Franciscans) and studied at the Old University of Leuven and Charles University in Prague. Egan received minor orders, subdiaconate, and diaconate at Mechelen, in modern-day Belgium. He was ordained a priest, probably in Prague, in 1785 or 1786. While studying on the continent, Egan became fluent in German.|$|E
5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. <b>Recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{her later}} vida, Castelloza was {{the wife of}} Turc de Mairona, {{probably}} the lord of Meyronne. Turc's ancestors had participated in a Crusade around 1210 or 1220, which was the origin of his name (meaning [...] "Turk"). She was reputed {{to have been in}} love with Arman de Brion, {{a member of the house}} of Bréon and of greater social rank than her, about whom she wrote several songs. Her vida records her to have been [...] "very gay", [...] "very learned", and [...] "very beautiful". Only three - perhaps four if <b>recents</b> <b>scholarship</b> is accepted - of her songs (all cansos) survive, all without music. This, however, makes her at least the second most prolific of trobairitz in terms of surviving works: only Beatriz de Dia certainly has more, with four cansos to her name. The subject of all her poems is courtly love.|$|R
5|$|Rabearivelo {{struggled}} {{throughout his}} life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a martyr figure {{as a result of}} his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. <b>Recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> contends that the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|In Epiphanius' polemic {{against the}} Ebionites found in Panarion 30, a complex picture emerges of {{the beliefs and}} {{practices}} of the 4th century Ebionites that cannot easily be separated from his method of combining together disparate sources. While scholars such as Hans-Joachim Schoeps literally interpreted Epiphanius' account as describing a later syncretic development of Ebionism, more <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has {{found it difficult to}} reconcile his report with those of the earlier Church Fathers, leading to a conjecture by scholar Petri Luomanen that a second group of Hellenistic-Samaritan Ebionites may also have been present. The rejection of the Jewish sacrifices and the implication of an end-time prophet Christology {{due to the lack of}} a birth narrative lend support for the association of the Gospel of the Ebionites with a group or groups different from the Ebionites known to Irenaeus.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{reflection}} on the relevance of Nietzsche to <b>recent</b> geographical <b>scholarship.</b> It starts by questioning the more general relationship between geography and philosophy/theory and interrogates what we might mean by theoretically sophisticated geographies.

5|$|In the {{official}} records of another Bronze Age empire, {{that of the}} Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa. <b>Recent</b> <b>scholarship,</b> based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, {{as well as on}} recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean-Anatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control. Another similar ethnonym Ekwesh in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions, has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|The Dorset Ooser {{was first}} brought to public {{attention}} in 1891, {{at which time}} it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to Somerset, the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various folklorists and historians have debated {{the origins of the}} head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English Mummers plays. The folklorists Frederick Thomas Elworthy and H. S. L. Dewar believed that the head was a representation of the Devil and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist Margaret Murray suggested that it represented a pre-Christian god of fertility whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of Ooser is also disputed, with various possibilities available.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to give a}} {{preliminary}} draft to formulate an innovative concept in the Qur 2 ̆ 7 anic studies world {{in the age of}} post-consumerism Muslim. Recent studies on tug of war between globalization and religion have been identifying salient social transformation in some parts of Muslim world, such as the rise of new (media) religious authority, religious commodification trends, varieties of Islamic consumption, the emergence of public Islam and so forth. Apart from these <b>recent</b> <b>scholarships,</b> which successfully grasp the globalization 2 ̆ 7 s influence toward religion (Islam), this paper offers the concept of everyday Qur 2 ̆ 7 an as an alternative basic approach of understanding the cultures of Qur 2 ̆ 7 an in this changing (Muslim) world and at the same time, seeking to briefly explain its emerging issues.

5|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica was copied {{often in}} the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts {{containing}} it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, {{rather than on the}} British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's Historia come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg, France. Modern historians have studied the Historia extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the Historia, but <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the Historia was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland {{was one of}} the Allied Powers {{during the}} First World War of 1914–1918, {{fighting}} against the Central Powers (the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Bulgaria). The state's armed forces were reorganised—the war marked the creation of the Royal Air Force, for example—and increased in size because of the introduction, in January 1916, of conscription {{for the first time in}} the kingdom's history as well as the raising of what was, at the time, the largest all-volunteer army in history, known as Kitchener's Army, of more than two million men. The outbreak of war has generally been regarded as a socially unifying event, although this view has been challenged by more <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship.</b> In any case, responses in Great Britain in 1914 were similar to those amongst populations across Europe.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, <b>recent</b> <b>scholarship</b> has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E
