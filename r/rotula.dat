5|$|Marasmius <b>rotula</b> is {{a common}} species of agaric fungus in the family Marasmiaceae. Widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, it is {{commonly}} known variously as the pinwheel mushroom, the pinwheel marasmius, the little wheel, the collared parachute, or the horse hair fungus. The type species of the genus Marasmius, M.rotula was first described scientifically in 1772 by mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and assigned its current name in 1838 by Elias Fries.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli as Agaricus <b>rotula</b> in 1772. In 1821 Elias Magnus Fries redescribed the mushroom in Systema Mycologicum, and later transferred it to Marasmius in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. Synonyms include names derived from generic transfers to Androsaceus by Narcisse Théophile Patouillard in 1887, and to Chamaeceras by Otto Kuntze in 1898; {{both of these}} genera are now obsolete and have since been sunk back into Marasmius.|$|E

5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius <b>rotula</b> aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of Marasmius <b>rotula</b> appear white or pale yellow. Under an optical microscope, they are hyaline (translucent), teardrop- or pip-shaped, and have {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-producing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped or nearly so, and 21–21 by 4–17µm. Along {{the edge of the}} gill, interspersed among the basidia, are non-reproductive cells, the cheilocystidia; these are club-shaped with rough wart-like protuberances on the surface. The gill edges further feature broom cells, which are variably shaped, thin-walled, and measure 7–32 by 2.5–20µm. Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish, blunt, and conical warts or incrustations 0.2–1.5 by 0.1–1µm.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius <b>rotula</b> is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
40|$|Assessment of the {{effectiveness}} of protected areas requires information on population characteristics of the target species. This study used a mark-and-recapture approach to examine the population structure, individual growth, and mortality of the commercially harvested short-spined sea urchin Anthocidaris crassispina in a small (18 ha) no-take marine reserve and two nearby non-protected sites. Sea urchins were tagged with fluorochrome and recaptured 1 year later. The size-at-age relationship was modelled using the Tanaka function, and mortality estimated using an exponential decay function coupled with the Tanaka growth parameters. The urchin population in the reserve consisted of a higher proportion of older individuals than populations in the two non-protected areas, however, large sea urchins (> 50 mm) were absent in the reserve. Sea urchins occurring at high densities (> 15 ind. m - 2) in the reserve grew much slower than those outside the reserve, suggesting a density-dependant effect on growth. Growth ring analysis from the <b>rotulae</b> supported the mark-and-recapture results with the maximum number of rings being higher in the reserve than in non-protected sites. Urchins with the same number of growth rings inside the reserve were smaller than those outside the reserve. Within the reserve, urchins with the same number of growth rings were smaller at locations with higher urchin density. Annual mortality rate was lower in the reserve population than in the non-protected populations. These results illustrate {{the effectiveness}} of this small reserve in protecting A. crassispina from fishing. However, further study is required to examine whether a high density of small/old individuals is better than a medium density of large individuals in order to maximize the potential spillover of larvae by such small urchin refugia to the surrounding overfished areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

500|$|Marasmius <b>rotula</b> is {{commonly}} known as the [...] "pinwheel mushroom", the [...] "pinwheel Marasmius", the [...] "collared parachute", or the [...] "horse hair fungus". This latter name is shared with other Marasmius species, including M.androsaceus and M.crinis-equi. Gray called it the [...] "collared dimple-stool".

50|$|M. <b>rotula</b> is {{distinguished}} from M. bulliardii by its larger size, and {{greater number of}} gills. M. limosus is found in marshes, where it fruits on the dead stems of reeds and rushes. Tetrapyrgos nigripes (formerly treated in Marasmius) has white caps that are 5 to 10 mm in diameter, attached gills that are sometimes slightly decurrent, a dark stem covered with tiny white hairs that give it a powdered appearance, and triangular to star-shaped spores. M. neorotula, described from Brazil, was considered by its discoverer Rolf Singer to be closely related to M. <b>rotula.</b> In addition to its tropical distribution, it can distinguished from M. <b>rotula</b> by its smaller size and more widely spaced gills. M. rotuloides, known only from montane forests of Trinidad, can only be reliably distinguished from M. <b>rotula</b> by microscopic characteristics: it has smaller, ovoid spores measuring 5 by 2.5 µm.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{mushrooms}} {{known to}} release spores {{in response to}} a circadian rhythm, spore release in M. <b>rotula</b> is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M. <b>rotula</b> might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M. <b>rotula</b> mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E
