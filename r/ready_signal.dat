500|$|In a {{sequence}} of 20 mock games of Jeopardy, human participants {{were able to use}} the average six to seven seconds that Watson needed to hear the clue and decide whether to signal for responding. During that time, Watson also has to evaluate the response and determine whether it is sufficiently confident in the result to signal. Part of the system used to win the Jeopardy! contest was the electronic circuitry that receives the [...] "ready" [...] signal and then examined whether Watson's confidence level was great enough to activate the buzzer. Given the speed of this circuitry compared to the speed of human reaction times, Watson's reaction time was faster than the human contestants except when the human anticipated (instead of reacted to) the <b>ready</b> <b>signal.</b> After signaling, Watson speaks with an electronic voice and gives the responses in Jeopardy! question format. Watson's voice was synthesized from recordings that actor Jeff Woodman made for an IBM text-to-speech program in 2004.|$|E

50|$|DECserver 300The DECserver 300 Terminal Server was an Ethernet Communications Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{providing}} a convenient method to logically connect up to sixteen digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or}} more service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 300 used MMJs (Modified Modular Jacks) for the attachment of asynchronous devices. The MMJ segregated a Data from a Voice connection. The DECserver 300 utilized the EIA 423-A electrical interface standard for local connections. EIA 423-A is compatible with the EIA 232-D interface and supports DTR/DSR (Data Terminal Ready/Data Set <b>Ready)</b> <b>signals.</b> EIA 423-A supports longer cable runs and higher signaling speeds. The DECserver 300 implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet.

50|$|In Belgium and The Netherlands, train {{conductors}} {{have multiple}} tasks involving train safety and customer services. Belgian/Dutch train conductors {{are responsible for}} the departure of the train. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a <b>ready</b> <b>signal</b> to the train driver. Therefore, train conductors in Belgium and The Netherlands always close (and in some scenarios also open) the doors. They are also responsible for performing safety tasks {{in case of an emergency}} or accident, such as fire, evacuation, etc. Because of these tasks, there has to be at least one conductor on each passenger train; a train without a conductor is uncommon, but still appears on some regional Dutch trains. The departure trains always have one conductor who is conductor-in-chief. He is responsible for the entire train, the on-board crew and the passengers. Some longer trains may have additional conductors who are under command of the conductor-in-chief. Besides the safety tasks, conductors also collect and punch tickets, fine people for not having a valid fare and make announcements to the passengers.|$|E

50|$|Bacterial Leucine Transporter imports leucine {{from the}} outside of the cell to the inside with the aid of two sodium ions. It is a {{homologue}} of the proteins that remove chemical transmitters from the synapse and assist neurotransmission such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, glycine or GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporters in neurons.

30|$|Finally, {{in stage}} 3, a clear {{operation}} is performed {{to clear the}} FIFO, which occurs {{at the end of}} vector multiplication by SVM_v 2 module. This ensures that invalid data is not incorporated in any computations.

30|$|The CU also {{internally}} communicates {{with every}} module in sequence for efficient data transfer with the card. The common signals {{for all the}} modules are Reset, CS, and clock signal. The CS and clock signals are also supplied to the card via multiplexer. Once Reset signal is received by CU, it issues a START signal to the CINM along with the clock signal. CU also issues START and clock signal for the other modules when {{they are about to}} initiate their action. In idle state, no clock is received by the modules and thus they work in power saving mode. Once a module receives a START signal, it acknowledges so by issuing a <b>READY</b> <b>signal</b> to the CU and starts working. After every successful completion of the work, the module intimates CU with DONE signal.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} {{a role for}} the {{amygdala}} central nucleus (CN) in attentional processing during the acquisition of Pavlovian associations. Both the acquisition of conditioned orienting responses and the surprise-induced enhancement {{in the ability of}} conditioned stimuli to enter into new associations depend on the integrity of CN. In this experiment, the role of CN in the performance of a well-learned selective attention task was examined. Rats with ibotenic acid lesions of CN and control rats first learned a discrete-trial, multiple-choice reaction time task. On each trial, after a constant-duration <b>ready</b> <b>signal,</b> the rats were required to poke their noses into one of three ports, guided by the brief illumination of one of those ports.

50|$|An iron post, {{incorporating}} {{a red and}} white disc and bell signal, was positioned between the running tracks {{at the bottom of}} the plane and when everything was <b>ready</b> a <b>signal</b> was given to the brakeman, the bell being used when it was misty or dark. When the brakeman was also satisfied that everything was ready at the top, he released the brake and the descending waggons were pushed onto the plane. As the descending waggons approached the bottom the reduced gradient slowed them down and simultaneously this action was assisted by the increased gradient encountered by ascending waggons as they approached the top. When the brakeman was assured that the waggons had completed the full traverse of the plane, he stopped them by fully applying the brake.|$|R
