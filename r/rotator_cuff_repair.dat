40|$|A high {{proportion}} of clinically successful <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs</b> are left with residual deficiencies in the cuff itself. 8, 9 Suture anchor fixation for <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs</b> has gained popularity in the recent past. Several studies have investigated the biomechanical characteristics of <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs</b> {{in an effort to}} identify possible sites of failure. These sites have included failure via suture cutting through bone tunnels, suture breakage, knot slippage, suture anchor pullout, and soft tissue failure at the suture-tendon junction. Meyer et al 11 recently detailed that suture breakage at the anchor eyelet may in fact be a significant concern for the strength of soft tissue repairs using suture anchors. They tested 22 different metallic suture anchors loaded with No. 2 braided nonabsorbable suture material. In every case, the suture broke at the anchor eyelet at up to 73 % lower loads than when the suture was tested on a smooth hook. We hypothesized that a previously unrecognized phenomenon {{may play a role in}} the failure mode of <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> repairs: varying the depth of suture anchor insertion.

The potential advantages of the arthroscopic method include glenohumeral joint inspection and treatment of intra-articular lesions, avoidance of deltoid avulsions and necrosis, decreased perioperative pain, easier restoration of motion, smaller incisions with improved cosmesis, and shorter rehabilitation time.

30|$|The {{biomimetic}} scaffold of {{this study}} enveloped the tear site and was secured {{as part of the}} double horizontal suture repair. This approach, inspired by the application of scaffold sheets to augment <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs</b> (Ratcliffe et al. 2015), stands in contrast to a previous clinical study in which autologous fascia was used to wrap surgical repairs of complex meniscal tears (Henning et al. 1991). Namely, the fascia sheath was not intended to provide any mechanical support to the suture repair and therefore was attached to the meniscus only along the peripheral rim. In this study, suture breakage was the mode of failure for all repairs, obviating any possible benefit of including a mechanically robust scaffold. If improvements in surgical materials or techniques were sufficient to alter the mechanism of failure to suture pull-through (as seen with <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs),</b> augmentation with mechanically robust scaffolds could further enhance repair strength.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background and Objectives: <b>Rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> {{injuries}} are problems commonly encountered in athletic and non-athletic patients. Its definite diagnosis is also important. Accordingly, {{this study was}} performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultra-sonography (US) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cases with suspicion of <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> injuries. Methods and materials: In this prospective comparative study, 130 patients who had undergone shoulder arthroscopy and open <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairing</b> and confirm <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> tears have been enrolled and evaluated with both ultrasonography and MRI methods. Results: The overall sensitivity (95 % confidence interval[CI]) of US was 87. 64 % (78. 55 - 93. 37), the specificity (95 %CI) was 89. 02 % (61. 24 - 95. 45). The overall sensitivity (95 % confidence interval) of MRI was 91. 31 % (75. 47 - 94. 4) and the specificity (95 %CI) of MRI was 83. 02 % (61. 23 - 91. 45).

50|$|Regional {{and general}} {{anesthesia}} are two methods {{that can be}} utilized when performing shoulder replacement. One example of a commonly used regional anesthetic is an interscalene brachial plexus block {{and it has been}} used in a number of shoulder procedures including instability repairs, proximal humeral prosthetic replacements, total shoulder arthroplasties, anterior acromioplasties, <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repairs,</b> and operative treatment of humeral fractures. The benefits of utilizing regional anesthesia over general anesthesia include less intraoperative bleeding, more muscle relaxation, shorter recovery room and hospital stays, decreased use of opioids, and avoiding the side effects of general anesthesia. In addition, regional anesthesia may be more cost-effective because it reduces operating room turnover time and procedure time due to the patients waking up sooner after surgery.|$|R
50|$|Subacromial {{impingement}} is {{not free}} of criticism. First, the identification of acromion type shows poor intra- and inter-observer reliability. Second, a computerized three-dimensional study failed to support impingement by any portion of the acromion on the rotator cuff tendons in different shoulder positions. Third, most partial-thickness cuff tears do not occur on bursal surface fibers, where mechanical abrasion from the acromion does occur. Fourth, {{it has been suggested}} that bursal surface cuff tears could be responsible for subacromial spurs and not the opposite. And finally, there is growing evidence that routine acromioplasty may not be required for successful <b>rotator</b> <b>cuff</b> <b>repair,</b> which would be an unexpected finding if acromial shape had a major role in generating tendon lesions. In summary, despite being a popular theory, the bulk of evidence suggest that subacromial impingement probably does not play a dominant role in many cases of rotator cuff disease.|$|E
