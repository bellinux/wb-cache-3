40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodological approach for rapidly obtaining spatial and structural {{information from a}} single high-resolution satellite image, using rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) as a camera replacement model. Geometric information defining the sensor’s orientation is {{used in conjunction with}} the RPC projection model to generate an accurate digital elevation model (DEM). This paper describes how the location (longitude and latitude) and height of individual structures are extracted by measuring the image coordinates for the corner of a building at ground level and its corresponding <b>roof-point</b> coordinates, and using the relationship between image-space and object-space together with the sensor’s orientation. The paper proceeds to describe the implementation of this algorithm in the software package MIHEA (Mono-Image Height Extraction Algorithm), and presents the validation results for a QuickBird image of London using LiDAR coverage and independently derived survey data...|$|E
