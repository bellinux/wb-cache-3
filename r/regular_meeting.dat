In addition to Harris and Loehr (a mining engineer and freemason), Silvester Schiele (a coal merchant), and Hiram E. Shorey (a tailor) were the other two who attended this first meeting.

While in Paris, both as a visitor and later as ambassador, he visited the famous Café de la Régence, which France's strongest players made their <b>regular</b> <b>meeting</b> place.

500|$|Very little {{information}} was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts. Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police {{once a month}} on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have {{a safe place to}} dance. When they decided to make it a <b>regular</b> <b>meeting,</b> they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled The Ladder in 1956; inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was [...] "Education of the variant". It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality—specifically relating to women, and famous lesbians in history. However, by 1956 the term [...] "lesbian" [...] had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused {{to use it as a}} descriptor, choosing [...] "variant" [...] instead.|$|E
