5|$|After {{escaping}} from custody, Roger uses Billy {{to communicate and}} send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E
5|$|Hugh's {{family was}} from Cressy, in Normandy, {{and his parents}} were named <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Eustacia. Nothing further is known about his parents, {{but he had a}} brother Berengar, who married Isabel of Gressenhall, {{daughter}} of Wimar the Sewer. Hugh served William fitzEmpress, the brother of King Henry II of England from the mid 1150s. William gave Hugh the manor of Harrietsham in Kent.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Alexander's arrests Nigel {{defied the}} king. The bishops' castles refused to {{surrender}} to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support {{in his efforts to}} recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.|$|E

5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, {{there is no evidence}} that he held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, he seems to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|Because Roger {{unfortunately}} {{appears at}} every {{scene of crime}} just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1957, family tragedy {{struck a}} third time {{when one of the}} nieces she had cared for in the 1940s {{died at the age of}} 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on that responsibility, {{adopting}} the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, to care for <b>Roger,</b> <b>and</b> much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket. This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While it was later recalled that <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Becket did not get along, {{there is no evidence}} of hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{eventually}} {{negotiated a}} deal to produce Radioland Murders for Universal shortly after the successful release of American Graffiti in late 1973. Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 film treatment, and Universal was confident enough to announce pre-production soon after. Lucas was set to direct with Gary Kurtz producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Penny were not a married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a love-hate relationship. Their script also included {{the controversy over the}} invention of radio.|$|E

5|$|Roger was consecrated Archbishop of York on 10 October 1154. When he went {{north to}} York, the legal scholar Vacarius, {{who had been}} part of Theobald's household, {{followed}} <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> spent the next 50 years in the north. Vacarius was responsible for introducing Roman civil law into England, and did so under the patronage of Roger. He wrote a standard textbook on the civil law, the Liber pauperum, and was an important advisor for Roger.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{took steps}} to remove a group of bishops he {{regarded}} {{as a threat to}} his rule. The royal administration under Henry I had been headed by Roger, the Bishop of Salisbury, supported by Roger's nephews, Alexander and Nigel, the Bishops of Lincoln and Ely respectively, and Roger's son, Roger le Poer, who was the Lord Chancellor. These bishops were powerful landowners as well as ecclesiastical rulers, and they had begun to build new castles and increase the size of their military forces, leading Stephen to suspect that they were about to defect to the Empress Matilda. <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> his family were also enemies of Waleran, who disliked their control of the royal administration. In June 1139, Stephen held his court in Oxford, where a fight between Alan of Brittany and Roger's men broke out, an incident probably deliberately created by Stephen. Stephen responded by demanding that <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> the other bishops surrender all of their castles in England. This threat was backed up by the arrest of the bishops, with the exception of Nigel who had taken refuge in Devizes Castle; the bishop only surrendered after Stephen besieged the castle and threatened to execute Roger le Poer. The remaining castles were then surrendered to the King.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} {{impact of}} <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Larry's deaths left the band stranded, halting production. Without Roger {{serving as the}} creative source, they effectively disbanded, and quietly left the music industry altogether. Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label, bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close. A few years later, Zapp resurfaced {{for a short period}} after the establishment of its own independent label, Zapp Town Records, managed by the Troutman family. The label released its only album, , in 2003. Zapp returned to performing only in live concert, touring across the U.S. at various venues.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{reconcile}} some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in The Englishman that Orton's mother was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne's grandfather. An alternative story has Orton's mother seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> assuming his identity. The Claimant's daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.|$|E
5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} <b>Roger</b> <b>and</b> Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were brought to the attention of King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E
