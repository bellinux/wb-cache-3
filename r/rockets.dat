While the <b>Rockets</b> had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took it upon himself to keep the <b>Rockets</b> near the top of the conference, turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season.

50|$|When a <b>rocket</b> launches, {{it sends}} out {{large amounts of}} gas called a <b>rocket</b> plume.

There are two main types of <b>rocket</b> engine fuels: solid <b>rocket</b> motor fuels and liquid <b>rocket</b> engine fuels. Solid <b>rocket</b> fuels are considered to be more harmful to ozone than liquid <b>rocket</b> fuels. It is estimated that global ozone depletion results from a mixture of solid and liquid <b>rocket</b> fuel emissions. Solid <b>rocket</b> fuels are more durable and {{do not have to be}} stored under certain conditions. Liquid <b>rocket</b> fuel is better in use because the <b>rocket</b> thrust can be adjusted mid-flight unlike solid <b>rocket</b> fuel that burns at a fixed rate without any mechanism to alter it.|$|R
