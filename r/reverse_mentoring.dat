40|$|Many {{companies}} {{today have}} {{parts of their}} organizational activity abroad. By having subsidiaries in a foreign country, employees prepared to transfer abroad are required. Transferring employees abroad {{is not a new}} phenomenon; however, it is done more extensively today. Even though expatriation has been around quite some time, companies are still struggling with parts of the process, especially the last part of it, repatriation. In this study, an evaluation of Company X’s repatriation process is conducted, and from our findings, recommendations are made. The study is based on relevant theories that we feel support the empirical data collection. The data collection is made through interviews and is further analyzed and discussed in order to support our findings. The main areas discussed related to repatriation in this thesis are: <b>reverse</b> culture shock, <b>mentors,</b> career development, proactive behavior, communication, and finally evaluation. A more general conclusion is provided as well as recommendations for Company X {{on how to deal with}} the process of repatriation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to give a {{detailed}} description of how <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring</b> is applied in practice. <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring</b> is the mentoring of a senior executive person in a company by a younger employee in topics like Web 2. 0 and new technologies. Considering current trends like the demographic change, the multi-generational workforce, the digital transformation and the current demands on knowledge management, it becomes obvious that a new form of learning is required for an organization to stay competitive. Nine people that have experienced <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring</b> in their company served as subjects for a study to further investigate about the practical application of <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring.</b> The study was carried out via telephone interviews. The subjects responded to questions regarding the implementation of the program, the formal structure of the programs, the procedure of matching tandem partners, the characteristics of the program’s participants, the challenges they experienced, the positive and negative experiences and the factors they consider vital for a successful implementation. In a next stage the main aspects of the study’s results were compared to findings in literature in order to verify their generalizability and to develop those findings further in theory. The thesis concludes that <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring</b> can be a tool that helps companies to face current trends, and the reader gets a detailed view on how <b>Reverse</b> <b>Mentoring</b> can be applied in a company...|$|E

40|$|A current {{topic of}} {{interest}} in management and organization research is the phenomenon of a generation shift in the workforce and how this shift will affect organizations in the near future.   Millennials represent the largest generational cohort in the American workforce.   Organizations find themselves challenged with retention efforts as Millennials tend to leave an organization after short tenures.   The problem this study addressed is the high turnover rates among millennial employees. Specifically, it was unknown whether Millennials who received <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> evidenced greater affective commitment to the organization as compared to Millennials who received standard mentoring.   The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the hypothesis that Millennials who received <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> evidenced greater affective commitment to the organization as compared to Millennials who received standard mentoring.   A two group post-test only quasi-experimental design was conducted.   A total of 90 participants (45 per group) completed the survey.   The survey was conducted by Qualtrics, an online survey company.   The sample population included male and female individuals, born between 1982 and 1998, employed by all types of organizations in the United States and participating in a mentoring program at the time the survey was taken.   Affective commitment was greater in the <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> group (M = 36. 683, SE =. 959) compared to the traditional mentoring group (M = 34. 984, SE =. 959).   However, after adjustment for quality of relationship (LMX) and length and frequency of mentoring (LFM) there was no statistically significant difference (p <. 05) between traditional mentoring and <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> on affective commitment to the organization indicated by F(1, 86) = 1. 569, p =. 214.   Additional results of this study showed that two-thirds of the surveyed millennial employees had already exceeded the average length of employment of 12 to 18 months with the organization they were employed with at the time of the survey.   This finding indicated the importance of investing in workplace relationships, such as mentoring, regardless of traditional or reverse...|$|E
40|$|Mentoring {{is often}} {{situated}} in leadership and coaching literature as a formal, strategic and a beneficial experience. Additional, {{studies indicate that}} mentor/mentee relationships can cause tension and even workplace harassment. Most of these studies focus on the power, whether negative or positive, of the leader versus the mentored. This study synthesizes stories lived and stories told using narrative analysis to balance how <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> simultaneously assists mentors and mentees in making sense of complex communication environments. Highlighting teachability as a chief characteristic of leading, <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> co-constructs new narratives for both mentor and mentee to cope with crisis situations. Reciprocal openness to divergent perspectives lends itself to moments in which stories merge and cross to influence both organizational leader and mentee.

ABSTRACT: Youths, aged between 15 and 24 years, in secondary schools in Kenya, have been facing challenges such as drugs and substance abuse; negative peer pressure; unemployment and societal negative perceptions among others. This {{has led to the}} youth being labeled as source of society’s problems rather than its potential asset. Various interventions have been established such as talent nurturing programs, revival of youth polytechnics, entrepreneurship trainings and youth mentoring programs. In Kenya, mentoring is a relatively new concept though studies done in developed countries have shown that mentoring has resulted to youth empowerment. However, little has been documented about mentoring relationships in Kenya; hence this study established the influence of type of mentoring relationship on youth empowerment. A sample of 107 youth was randomly sampled from the purposively selected secondary schools with mentoring programs. Majority of the respondents were involved in more than one type of mentoring relationship at any given time. Those involved in traditional mentoring which is an informal type of mentoring relationship were 98. 1 %; they were also in formal type of mentoring relationships; peer and <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> were common at 91. 6 %; team mentoring (78. 5 %); situational mentoring (69. 2 %); group mentoring (57. 0 %); flash mentoring (56. 1 %) and E/tele mentoring (44. 9 %).

40|$|The {{emergence}} of mobile technologies and social media applications {{has led to}} a shift in the emergency/disaster related communication environment. Citizens are playing an increasingly important role in providing real time information to emergency organizations. This shift has resulted in an expectation by the public that emergency management (EM) organizations monitor and respond to calls for help disseminated via these applications. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the extent to which Florida EM agencies have incorporated the monitoring of social media into their organizational processes. The state of social media use in Florida is under researched. In this explanatory sequential design study, Florida EM personnel was surveyed using the CNA Analyst/National Emergency Management Association (NEMA) survey (Su et. al, 2012) on the use of social media in EM. Subsequently, a subset of respondents was interviewed to determine to what extent they have incorporated the monitoring of social media into their organizational processes. Several recommendations can be made related to the use of social media in emergency management in Florida. Each of these is discussed in detail: 1.) <b>Reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> programs; 2.) Development of social media policies; 3.) Continue to attend trainings and conferences; 4.) Explore promising practices; and 5.) Social marketing campaigns for citizens. Overall, it appears that Florida has an immature yet evolving system for use of social media in emergency management. While Florida EM agencies are knowledgeable about social media in general, they lack policies, systems, and staff to take full advantage of social media as a tool in emergency management. As more training is offered, and promising practices are shared, systems will likely continue to evolve. The evolution of systems within agencies will depend largely on leadership attitudes, organizational policies, and staffing resources...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} establish what teacher mentoring stakeholders might learn from successful and effective practice in other sectors – in the UK and internationally. The research team thus {{set out to}} identify: 1. effective employee mentoring and coaching practice in private and public sector organisations (excluding teacher mentoring schemes); 2. the impact of those employee mentoring and coaching schemes identified; 3. the various factors contributing to the effectiveness and success of the selected mentoring and coaching schemes. 1 On the other hand, research into the relatively rare phenomenon of ‘external mentoring’ for teachers in secondary schools found this to have significant benefits for the (predominantly early career) teachers supported (Hobson et al., 2012; Hobson & McIntyre, 2013; McIntyre & Hobson, 2016). 2 THE MENTORING ACROSS PROFESSIONS PROJECT We use the term teacher to refer to those formally tasked to facilitate learning in early years, primary, secondary and further education (FE) 2 settings. We use the term mentoring to describe ‘the support given by one (usually more experienced) person for the growth and learning of another, and for their integration into and acceptance by a specific community’ (Malderez, 2001, p. 57). We take coaching to refer to {{one of a number}} of (potential) aspects of mentoring, and as having a narrower focus, notably relating to specific support for an individual’s skill development (Finn, 1993; Malderez & Bodoczky, 1999; Hopkins-Thompson, 2000). Given this, we normally use the term mentoring, in this report, to encompass mentors’ potential use of coaching. Nonetheless, we recognise that other scholars and practitioners use the terms mentoring and coaching differently. We thus use the term coaching, in this report, when it relates to a particular programme (notably the Sussex Police Leadership Coaching Programme – Chapter 9) or where it is used, by others, in a different way. With respect to the scope and contextual boundaries of the study, we did not seek to explore (for example) cross-cultural mentoring, cross-national mentoring, or the concept of <b>reverse</b> <b>mentoring</b> (Marcinkus Murphy, 2012) ...|$|E
