Prior to the implementation of the online service, the open care employees had taken care of grocery shopping for all those customers who were not able to do it themselves.

The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a coventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity.

40|$|Views on {{industrial}} service have conceptually progressed from {{the output of}} the provider’s production process to the result of an interaction process in which the customer also is involved. Although there are attempts to be customer-oriented, especially when the focus is on solutions, an industrial company’s offering combining goods and services is inherently seller-oriented. There is, however, a need to go beyond the current literature and company practices. We propose that what is needed is a genuinely customer-based parallel concept to offering that takes the customer’s view and put forward a new concept labelled customer needing. A needing is based on the customer’s mental model of their business and strategies which will affect priorities, decisions, and actions. A needing can be modelled as a configuration of three dimensions containing six functions that create <b>realised</b> <b>value</b> for the customer. These dimensions and functions can be used to describe needings which represent starting points for sellers’ creation of successful offerings. When offerings match needings over time the seller should have the potential to form and sustain successful buyer relationships. industrial service; customer needing; realised value; customer understanding...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of {{pluralism}} by evaluating different stakeholder views on the expected and <b>realised</b> <b>value</b> of strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The research followed a single embedded case study approach (of a national-level SEA for renewable energy planning in South Africa) and engaged with four different stakeholder groups, namely government, industry, conservation groups, and interested and affected parties (IAPs). A total of 21 different value expectations (VEs) across all four stakeholder groups were identified. However, stakeholder groups contrast significantly in terms of VEs, with government concerned more with process and mandate; industry with cost, efficiency and certainty; conservation groups with data and technical aspects; and the IAPs with local scale issues. In terms of realisation of VEs {{the results suggest that}} SEA does provide opportunities for learning; focussing project level EIA and providing spatial guidance on the location of projects. However, SEA was less successful in realising integration of decision making and alignment of policy within government. Recognition and better understanding of the pluralistic nature of expected and realised VEs could potentially improve the legitimacy of SEA processes and methodologies if they are designed and implemented to accommodate pluralism...|$|E
40|$|Inference of the {{evolutionary}} {{history of a}} group of organisms from molecular data is commonly performed by assuming that {{the evolutionary}} process is homogeneous along the DNA sequence. This assumption may not be necessarily realistic. Different codon positions within a protein-coding region undergo substitutions at different rates. Likewise, portions of DNA that have been acquired from a foreign genome by recombination will be expected to follow a different evolutionary pattern {{than the rest of the}} DNA sequence. Methods have been developed to account for such heterogeneity. One of them considers each site in the sequence to evolve according to a rate matrix scaled by the <b>realised</b> <b>value</b> of a random variable (see Yang, 1996, for a review). By far the most commonly used probability distribution for that variable is the gamma distribution. Under this approach the substitution process still conforms to a single, though site-independently scaled, evolutionary pattern, and the heterogeneity in evolution is captured quantitatively rather than qualitatively. In order to account for the qualitative evolutionary heterogeneity among sites, we assume the molecular data have been generated from a mixture of k evolutionary patterns, each of which may obey very different configurations. Pagel and Meade (2004) first proposed such a mixture of patterns. The observed characters at each site were supposed to have arisen from a mixture of densitie...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Liquidation {{strategies}} {{consider the}} problem of minimising transaction costs occurring in a portfolio liquidation. Transaction costs are the difference between current market value and the <b>realised</b> <b>value</b> after the liquidation. A strategy to follow to perform a liquidation is especially important to institutional investors due the large size of their trades. Large trades can {{have a significant effect}} on the price of a security which can impact the realised returns of the liquidation. These models solve for trading trajectories that maximise this. The models investigated do this in a mean-variance framework where the expected return of the strategy is constrained by its variance and the investors risk preference. Parameters used in liquidity functions are estimated for securities on the South African JSE Securities Exchange. The effects of security liquidity, volatility, stock correlation and length of liquidation horizon on the optimal strategy are investigated. There is little or no existing literature that attempts to model these functions in the South African market. Due to the smaller size of the South African market as well as the number of thinly traded shares compared to most markets studied in the literature, many securities are highly illiquid. We investigate relationships between firm size and daily traded value and these liquidity parameters. General rules are presented to help traders improve a liquidation strategy without the need to estimate all parameters needed to calculate an optimal strategy using one of these models...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea is {{referred}} {{as the most}} polluted sea in the world. The most serious problem is the eutrophication that {{is a consequence of}} nutrient loading through human based activities. Nutrient enrichment has led to growth of phytoplankton that has induced increased algal blooms and oxygen depletion in the sea bed that have resulted to changes in ecosystem balance. Conservation needs of the Baltic Sea are directed by HELCOM, the intergovernmental body on protecting Baltic Sea. The HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan objective is to restore the good ecological status of the Baltic marine environment by 2021. The agreement set up country-wise annual reduction targets for phosphorus and nitrogen loadings. Every member state should define their abatement measures in a cost efficient manner. The cost estimates for nutrient abatement varies significantly depending on the measures taken. Apart from abatement measures fisheries have a significant role in nutrient dynamics in the Baltic Sea. It is estimated that the phosphorus removal of fisheries accounts for 18 % of anthropogenic load; corresponding share in nitrogen is 2. 4 %. Using the cost estimates of different abatement measures it is possible to estimate the shadow value of the positive environmental impact of fisheries. We estimated the real social value for the Finnish trawler fleet and compare that to <b>realised</b> <b>value.</b> Accounting for the positive value of the environmental externality increases the profits of the fisheries significantly. The increased profitability increased the potential resource rent and consequently the value of resources. The results show that the real social value of fisheries is considerably higher than realised...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study explores {{customer}} perceived {{value in}} the context of emerging technology-intensive business service, in particular a mobile advertising service that is at the application phase of development. The purpose of the study is to conceptualise customer perceived value as a multidimensional concept by exploring 1) the complex interaction between benefits and sacrifices 2) temporality and 3) learning. This way the study contributes to the existing research within services marketing and business relationships. The empirical part of the study is conducted {{in the form of a}} qualitative single-case study. The empirical setting organised to acquire data is qualitative real-life experiment. It consists of three field experiments that were organised by the research project to simulate real-life situations and to gain understanding of developing technological services that are not yet in commercial use. Interviews, observations and personal experiences form the main sources of information and are complemented by secondary documental data. In this study the sources of value are first identified, which enhances understanding of what kind of value customers perceive from emerging technological service. In addition, value sub-elements have a complex interaction in service value co-creation, since certain sacrifices made by users may increase the benefits they perceive, whereas some benefits can increase the sacrifices and thus reduce the customer perceived net value. Second, the concepts of expected value, <b>realised</b> <b>value</b> and potential value are identified which enables deeper understanding of the temporality of customer perceived value. Third, learning has an important role in customer perceived value. When looking at learning at the process level, it is a sacrifice, but at the outcome level it turns into a benefit and thus also amplifies the customer perceived net value. Learning is needed from the customer to be able to use the new technological service and utilise it effectively, which in turn leads the customer to perceive higher value from the service. Moreover, the temporal dimensions of value are connected to each other through the customer’s learning that varies according to its type and object at different points of time. For the service providers of new technological services understanding value related to the service and its production is essential. The future success and viability of these kinds of services requires that service providers know what kind of value their customers perceive from the service and especially what kind of future expectations they have for it. This study provides implications for the service providers on how to co-create value with their business customers and thus make technology-intensive business service a profitable business in the future...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at finding out how {{integration}} of IT systems creates value for companies and is conducted as a qualitative case study, where six companies are interviewed about their integration solutions. The interviewees were five CIOs and one Managing Director. Four of the companies interviewed have genuine Application Integration solutions, where a middleware platform is {{the hub of the}} integration system, while the remaining two used solutions based around a system of point-to-point integrations. The value of an integration solution will be considered a combination of the benefits an integration solution provides, openness aspects, and the price models used to pay for the system. Value is defined as what the company gains, in monetary terms, in exchange for what it pays for an offering (Anderson, Kumar, & Narus, 2007). This definition further defines the attractiveness of an offering as the value minus the price. When discussing the value of an IT system, {{it is important to consider}} the difference between the potential value, which is the maximum the system can deliver with an ideal environment and usage, and the <b>realised</b> <b>value,</b> which is some fraction of the potential value that a company actually gains, of the system (Davern & Kauffman, 2000; Smith & Nagle, 2005). Affecting the realisation of potential value are certain factors, called conversion contingencies, which are things like preparation of implementation projects or efforts at using all aspects of a system. Benefits are analysed according to a framework that divides IT systems benefits into five categories: operational, managerial, strategic, IT infrastructure, and organisational benefits (Shang & Seddon, 2000). These categories are focused around, respectively, productivity gains, enhanced planning capabilities, new strategic capabilities, better IT administration, and process improvements. We conclude that most companies gain several large benefits in the operational and managerial types, while the other three types have fewer reported benefits. We conclude that there seems to be quite a lot of unrealised potential value in the integration solutions, if the view of the potential of integration from the technological side is used. We also conclude that companies in certain environments and with more complex organisational structures seem to have a larger value potential than others, meaning they have more to potentially gain from an integration solution. For openness, five aspects of open source software are studied: lock-in, cost, security, flexibility/modifiability, and community. These aspects are mainly derived from literature on open source. The first conclusion we make regarding openness is that most of the CIOs seems not to be fully aware of what the term truly entails. Companies’ opinions regarding open source can be seen on a range between two extremes: those who want to modify or develop software and those who only want to use standard systems. The former category has more to gain from the aspects of cost and modifiability than the latter, but both categories can gain from the lock-in, security, and community aspects. The combination of factors that creates the price of an offering can be described as a price model. To study the value of price models of integration solutions, the SBIFT model (Iveroth, et al., 2013) is used, where the price model is divided into five dimensions, scope, base, influence, formula and temporal rights. None of the interviewed companies were satisfied with the alternatives for price models currently on the market. It was concluded that the dissatisfaction mostly stemmed from the facts that the companies had little opportunity to affect the price model, meaning they could not adapt it to better fit their internal conditions, the complexity of the license agreements, and that it was hard to get vendors to cite a price for a system. Price models that would be more attractive are e. g. models with a larger variable part, like transaction-based ones, or models that affect the time scale of the contract, even though no single model seemed more attractive to all companies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} assessing alignment between corporate strategy, procurement strategy and purchasing tools. The framework is built on generation of rents as its common denominator for assessing alignment between the levels. Three types of rents are identified, monopoly rents (utilising market power, squeezing out cost), Ricardian rents (<b>realising</b> <b>value</b> from scarce intrafirm resources or constellation of interfirm resources), and entrepreneurial rents (seizing opportunities that arise from innovations). The framework is then used for assessing the strategic origin of the following e-procurement applications: e-sourcing, e-tendering, e-informing, e-reversed auctions, e-MRO, web-based ERP, and e-collaboration. The {{results indicate that the}} e-procurement tools are fully viable for creating monopoly rents, moderately viable for creating Ricardian rents and only somewhat viable for creating entrepreneurial rents. Therefore, it is necessary to first understand how the firm generates rents before procurement strategy and e-procurement tools are implemented in order to avoid misalignment...|$|R
