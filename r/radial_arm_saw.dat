25|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> has a {{circular}} saw {{mounted on a}} sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw.</b> A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|E

50|$|A {{stop block}} {{is a simple}} {{reusable}} jig used in metalworking and woodworking to locate a common edge of a workpiece so that multiple workpieces can get the same operation performed quickly. Common applications are table saws and manual milling machines, {{but they are also}} used on miter <b>saws,</b> band <b>saws,</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws,</b> and abrasive saws.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw,</b> but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the {{compound miter saw}}, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|E
50|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is {{a cutting}} machine {{consisting}} of a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. Invented by Raymond DeWalt in 1922, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> was the primary tool used for cutting long pieces of stock to length until {{the introduction of the}} power miter saw in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The {{demise of}} the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can be {{observed}} in the products for sale by tool retailers. As of May, 2014, Sears showed only one <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> in its online catalog, Amazon listed only two (one of which was the Sears model), and Grizzly, Jet, and Tool Zone listed none.|$|E

5000|$|DeWalt was {{acquired}} in 1960 {{and continued to}} produce <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws</b> and other large, stationary, power equipment, Black & Decker expanded the DeWalt name and used this to replace their [...] "Construction Grade" [...] trademark in 1992. In a US-wide market survey done by Black & Decker before its reintroduction, the name DeWalt was recognized by 70 percent of tradesmen. The black and yellow DeWalt design, often associated with safety equipment and advertised on display, helped propel Black & Decker's profits to new heights.|$|R
50|$|Raymond Elmer DeWalt (October 9, 1885 - May 8, 1961) was an American {{inventor}} and entrepreneur, {{he invented}} the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> in 1922. In 1924, he founded DeWALT Products Company in Leola, Pennsylvania, to manufacture {{and sell the}} “Wonder-Worker” (his name for the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw).</b> He was born in Oakland, Pennsylvania and died in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw,</b> table saws and hand saws were most {{commonly}} used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws can easily rip stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade. In contrast, when a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is used for crosscutting, the stock remains stationary on the saw's table, and the blade is pulled through it.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is more {{expensive}} than a typical contractor-type table saw and takes up the same footprint on the shop floor, yet isn't as versatile.|$|E
5000|$|Power miter saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws.</b> Simple miter saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be cut. Miter saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
50|$|Powell v. The Home Depot USA, Inc. (2008cv61862) (2011) was a {{decision}} by the Florida Southern District Court on the issue of patent infringement on a “safe hands” device that Michael Powell, an independent contractor for Home Depot, created in response to injuries to the hands of associates using in-store <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws.</b> Powell invented and patented a device that eliminated the risk of injury. The Home Depot refused to pay Powell for the device and began installing the safety device on its saws without permission. In 2007, Mr. Powell sued The Home Depot for patent infringement. After a jury trial Powell was awarded damages totaling $20.8 million.|$|R
40|$|A cross axis {{wind turbine}} is disclosed, which {{comprises}} of cross axis arrangement. The wind turbine {{consists of three}} vertical blades and six horizontal blades arranged in cross axis orientation. The six horizontal blades serve as the <b>radial</b> <b>arms</b> that link the three vertical blades and the hubs through connectors to form the cross axis wind turbine (CAWT). Three horizontal axis blades that make up as the upper <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> connects the top part of the vertical blades to the hub through the top connectors. The other three horizontal axis blades that make up as the lower <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> connects the bottom part of the vertical axis blades to the hub through the bottom connectors. To avoid air flow blockage or interference between the top <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> and the bottom <b>radial</b> <b>arm,</b> the horizontal axis blade <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> at the top part of the turbine is offset at an angle of 30 Â° {{with respect to the}} bottom <b>radial</b> <b>arm.</b> In the present invention, the air stream can be channeled {{from the bottom of the}} turbine through the bottom <b>radial</b> <b>arm,</b> and the air streams that did not interact with the bottom <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> will eventually interact with the top <b>radial</b> <b>arm.</b> The air streams channeled from the bottom of the wind turbine and moving upwards will interact with the horizontal blades and this will eventually improve the self-starting capability of the CAWT.

50|$|The device {{consisted}} of three primary components, an index <b>arm,</b> a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> and a graduated chord. The three were arranged in a triangle as in {{the image on the}} right. A telescopic sight was mounted on the index arm. At the point of rotation of the <b>radial</b> <b>arm,</b> a single mirror was mounted. This point of rotation allowed the angle between the index <b>arm</b> and the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> to be changed. The graduated chord was connected to {{the opposite end of the}} <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> and the chord was permitted to rotate about the end. The chord was held against the distant end of the index arm and slid against it. The graduations on the chord were uniform and, by using it to measure the distance between the ends of the index <b>arm</b> and the <b>radial</b> <b>arm,</b> the angle between those arms could be determined. A table of chords was used to convert a measurement of distance to a measurement of angle. The use of the mirror resulted in the measured angle being twice the angle included by the index and the radius arm.|$|R

50|$|A {{riving knife}} is a safety device {{installed}} {{on a table}} saw, circular saw, or <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> used for woodworking. Attached to the saw's arbor, it is fixed relative to the blade and moves with it as blade depth is adjusted.|$|E

50|$|In {{the home}} shop the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is an {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> {{drill press}} {{is a large}} geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the <b>arm.</b> The biggest <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. <b>Radial</b> <b>arm</b> drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The <b>Radial</b> <b>Arm</b> Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R

50|$|If {{machining}} depth cuts, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> {{allows one to}} see the progress. With the (wood) clamped and using the arm (not hand feeding, which is also possible), the cuts are better machined and require no jig setup; the advantage is not widely needed however. Cutting full depth is less convenient, as the saw lowers into the table, cutting the table (often a wood table for that reason).|$|E
5000|$|Sliding compound-miter saw - Sliding {{adds the}} <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> feature {{of being able}} to move the saw head back and forth {{increasing}} the board size that can be cross cut. Without the sliding feature the cut is a straight pull down feature (like chop saws). With the sliding feature engaged the user pulls the head forward, turns on the saw and pushes the blade back across the lumber.|$|E
