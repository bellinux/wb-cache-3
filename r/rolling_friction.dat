25|$|Roller die Drawing (also {{referred}} as Roll drawing): roller dies are {{used instead of}} fixed dies to convert shear friction to <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> with dramatic reduction in the drawing forces as reported by Lambiase. When roller dies are adopted, the drawing stages are composed by 2-4 idle rolls and the wire is pulled within the rolls clearance. This type of solution can be easily adopted also to produce flat or profiled drawn wires.|$|E
25|$|Coins {{can also}} be spun {{on a flat surface}} such as a table. This results in the {{following}} phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity – the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately −1/3.|$|E

However many numerical simulations operate with periodic boundary conditions for convenience, or with static grain boundaries that do not reproduce the <b>rolling</b> and <b>friction</b> effects expected at the interface.

50|$|There are two {{conspicuous}} dissipative effects: <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> {{when the}} coin slips along the surface, and air drag from {{the resistance of}} air. Experiments show that <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> is mainly responsible for the dissipation and behavior—experiments in a vacuum show {{that the absence of}} air affects behavior only slightly, while the behavior (precession rate) depends systematically on coefficient of friction. In the limit of small angle (i.e. immediately before the disk stops spinning), air drag (specifically, viscous dissipation) is the dominant factor, but prior to this end stage, <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> is the dominant effect.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of hot rolling {{parameters}} on the friction coefficient was studied by inverse calculation on the experimental roll loads where the hot rolling experiments were carried out at 7. 5 - 45. 0 % reductions, 0. 12 - 0. 72 m/s speeds and temperature of 850 - 1025 °C. Dry rolling, water, oil/water mixture emulsion and pure oil were used as lubricants in the experiments.

The effects of the friction variation in the roll bite on the calculated rolling pressure, rolling force, spread and forward slip are discussed, and the effects of the initial strip thickness and tension on rolling pressure, spread and forward slip are also presented.

One {{of the most common}} examples of <b>rolling</b> <b>friction</b> is the movement of motor vehicle tires on a roadway, a process which generates sound as a by-product.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{granular}} materials is presented that describes both the internal deformation of each granule and {{the interactions between}} grains. The model, {{which is based on}} the FLIP-material point, particle-in-cell method, solves continuum constitutive models for each grain. Interactions between grains are calculated with a contact algorithm that forbids interpenetration, but allows separation and sliding and <b>rolling</b> with <b>friction.</b> The particle-in-cell method eliminates the need for a separate contact detection step. The use of a common rest frame in the contact model yields a linear scaling of the computational cost with the number of grains. The properties of the model are illustrated by numerical solutions of sliding and rolling contacts, and for granular materials by a shear calculation. The results of numerical calculations demonstrate that contacts are modeled accurately for smooth granules whose shape is resolved by the computation mesh. Ó 2000 Elsevier Science S. A.
