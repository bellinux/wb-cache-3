25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012 it was {{reported}} that Aston had left Time Team. He explained his position to the Western Daily Press, stating that the show's producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process Time Team had been [...] "dumbed down", something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about." [...] In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology Aston said: [...] "The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> about it." ...|$|E

500|$|In a late 1989 {{interview}} with John Robb in Sounds, Cobain {{noted that the}} band's music was changing. He said, [...] "The early songs were <b>really</b> <b>angry...</b> But {{as time goes on}} the songs are getting poppier and poppier as I get happier and happier. The songs are now about conflicts in relationships, emotional things with other human beings". In April 1990, the band began working with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin on recordings for the follow-up to Bleach. During the sessions, Cobain and Novoselic became disenchanted with Channing's drumming, and Channing expressed frustration at not being actively involved in songwriting. As bootlegs of Nirvana's demos with Vig began to circulate in the music industry and draw attention from major labels, Channing left the band. That July, the band recorded the single [...] "Sliver" [...] with Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters. Nirvana asked Dale Crover to fill in on drums for a seven-date American West Coast tour with Sonic Youth that August.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> album." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Yield {{continued}} {{with the more}} contemplative type of writing found on No Code. Vedder said that while [...] "in the past we got <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> and we cried out against many things in our songs", he considered that when [...] "you become an adult you have to express your energy in a different way, more calm." [...] This led to songs that while not eschewing [...] "the bad side of life", ended up [...] "facing it from a more positive point of view, {{looking for a way}} to solve it. In the past we said: what a shit, this stinks, that sucks, everything sucks... Now it's time to say: stop, let's look for a solution, let's be positive." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by literary works, including Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita ("Pilate"), Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael ("Do the Evolution"), and the writings of Charles Bukowski ("In Hiding"). Gossard wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "No Way" [...] and [...] "All Those Yesterdays", and Ament, making his first lyrical contributions to a Pearl Jam album, wrote the lyrics for the songs [...] "Pilate" [...] and [...] "Low Light". Ament said, [...] " [...] watch Eddie put his heart into singing lyrics that I wrote, was an experience I can't put into words." ...|$|E

500|$|Nina was in {{her first}} {{relationship}} with fellow student Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne), when, during a trip away to the beach, Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan) realised he was attracted to her. When Nina was cast in Harold's play, Mission Erinsborough, alongside Jack, she realised that she liked him too and they begin an affair. Peter Mattessi of The Age said their love [...] "bubbled until it almost erupted". Nina broke up with Taj so she could be with Jack, but before Jack could break up with his girlfriend Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), she was paralysed during an accident. Jack became torn over whether to leave Lori and be with Nina. Both Lori and Taj found out about Nina and Jack, so Nina decided to remain single, but eventually she and Jack began their relationship properly. When Nina told Jack {{that she was not}} ready to consummate their relationship, Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk). Taj told Nina about Jack's cheating and she broke up with him. She later kissed Connor in front of Jack to make him jealous. Jay Bunyan commented, [...] "Jack gets <b>really</b> <b>angry,</b> especially with Connor, who is supposed to be his mate. He threatens to tell Nina about Connor getting Lori pregnant, as a way of getting back at him." [...] Nina became confused about her love life and was unsure whether she still had feelings for Jack. She then decided to depart Erinsborough to go to India.|$|E

2500|$|He {{had been}} a big Beatles fan who idolized Lennon. Chapman played the guitar himself but turned against Lennon after he became a Christian, angry about Lennon's comment that the Beatles were [...] "more popular than Jesus." [...] In the South, there were demonstrations, album burnings, boycotts and {{projectiles}} were thrown. Some members of Chapman's prayer group made a joke in reference to Lennon's song [...] "Imagine". [...] "It went, 'Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead.'" [...] Chapman's childhood friend Miles McManushe recalls his referring to the song as [...] "communist." [...] Jan Reeves, sister of one of Chapman's best friends, reports that Chapman [...] "seemed <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> toward John Lennon and he kept saying he could not understand why John Lennon had said it [...] According to Mark, there should be nobody more popular than the Lord Jesus Christ.

2500|$|This embittered letter {{remained}} a closely guarded secret, although a former high {{official of the}} CIA told me about it. Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: [...] "A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz's true love. The problem for the CIA wasn't just {{that she was a}} foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> about it, and she found a way to bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a very, very, very senior Republican foreign policy operative, 'I don't think so.' [...] " [...] The Daily Mail of London also reported on his wife's letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} July 2016 whether Ministry {{was going to}} release another album after From Beer to Eternity, Jourgensen stated, [...] "When I was asked, it was after Mikey passed and the entire media {{immediately}} starts asking me {{what is going to}} happen to Ministry. He wasn't even buried yet. I thought, 'Fuck you.' I was really pissed and <b>really</b> <b>angry.</b> I said, 'Fuck Ministry and fuck you for asking.' They want to comment on Ministry when my best friend had died. It's been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It's time to get another record out. I have a bunch of songs written in my head. I wanted to have time to mourn before people start asking me about touring dates. It was sick. I was bombarded and email boxes were overloaded with 'what are you going to do now?' It was kind of creepy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{does not}} tell Darren that she is helping Mitzeee, which Fox told a {{reporter}} from What's on TV is because [...] "Darren is so focused on the baby that if she told him he'd be <b>really</b> <b>angry.</b> Nancy feels he doesn't understand the relationship she has with Mitzeee and he hasn't been terribly supportive". When questioned if Nancy feels her involvement with Mitzeee may place strain on the baby, Fox answered: [...] "At the moment she feels incredibly tired, but she's sure that everything's fine and all she {{needs to do is}} focus on her friend". Darren discovers Nancy is helping Mitzeee, making him [...] "absolutely furious" [...] as he can not believe Nancy is [...] "going against the law, is running around and getting stressed - especially while she's heavily pregnant". When urged to put their child first by Darren, Nancy dismisses him as she believes he is [...] "just being silly". Fox said that [...] "Nancy thinks she knows best, as Nancy always does", adding that Nancy is [...] "a bit like a dog with a bone. If she's decided that she's going to do something, it's very difficult to change her mind".|$|E
2500|$|Enemies of Reality {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{during a time}} of personal and professional tumult for the members of Nevermore.

2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were <b>really</b> <b>angry</b> with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E
