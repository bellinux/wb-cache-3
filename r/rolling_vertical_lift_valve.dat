40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas <b>lift</b> <b>valves.</b> This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become more difficult. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> and oil well systems have been modeled but system failure modes are not well understood. In this paper a quasi-steady-state fluid-mechanical model is constructed to study failure modes and sensitivities of a gas-lifted well system including the reservoir, two-phase flow within the tubing, and gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> geometry. A set of three differential algebraic equations of the system is solved to determine the system state. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve,</b> two-phase flow, and reservoir models are validated with well and experimental data. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the model and sensitive parameters are identified. Failure modes of the system and parameter values that lead to failure modes are identified using Monte Carlo simulation. In particular, we find that the failure mode of backflow through the gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> with a leaky check valve is sensitive to small variations in several design parameters.

In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach {{for the next generation}} <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. It indicates that 80 percent of decision points for the DoD <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> fleet to either extend the life, retire, or replace with a new solution occurring in the next eight-ten years. Implementation of the FVL Strategic Plan which will impact <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aviation operations for the next 50+ years. The U.S. Navy is a partner to the Army on the effort, so a derivative of FVL may be used in the Navy's MH-XX program to replace the service's MH-60S/R helicopters.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study {{complete}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>lifts</b> of tensor fields from a smooth manifold $M$ to its Weil bundle $T^A M$ {{defined by a}} Frobenius Weil algebra $A$. For a Poisson manifold $(M,w) $, we show that the complete lift $w^C$ and the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> $w^V$ of the Poisson tensor $w$ are Poisson tensors on $T^A M$ and establish their properties. We prove that the complete and the <b>vertical</b> <b>lifts</b> induce homomorphisms of the Poisson cohomology spaces. We compute the modular classes of the lifts of Poisson structures.
