5000|$|Off-line {{programming}} (OLP) is a {{robot programming}} method where the robot program is created independent {{from the actual}} <b>robot</b> <b>cell.</b> The robot program is then uploaded to the real industrial robot for execution. In off-line programming, the <b>robot</b> <b>cell</b> is represented through a graphical 3D model in a simulator. Nowadays OLP and robotics simulator tools help robot integrators create the optimal program paths for the robot to perform a specific task.

These differ from conventional PLC types as being suitable for use in safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired safety relays. For example, a safety PLC {{might be used to}} control access to a <b>robot</b> <b>cell</b> with trapped-key access, or perhaps to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stops, light screens, and so forth. The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.|$|E

The company in this case claims that their invested <b>robot</b> <b>cell,</b> with CNC machine isn't used enough. The questions here are: How can we improve {{the use of the}} <b>robot</b> <b>cell?</b> Which products are appropriate for the production in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell?</b>   As a method to come to a conclusion, an analysis has been made over the manufactured products. And also interviews with machine operators and the production management. Our work has also been based on literature studies,   because the production moment has been compared with models from Lean Production theories.       The analysis shows that there are some limitations in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell,</b> which means that there are several demands that have to be fulfilled. From the investigated material our conclusion is that many products don't keep up with following demands: length, surface, tolerance dimensions, and shape. As a result of this, there are some products that can´t be manufactured in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell,</b> and therefore has to be produced in the ordinary CNC machine group.   Interviews have declared that there doesn't exist any documentation from the production in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell,</b> which causes stop in the production. The data collection shows that an inner setting in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell</b> varies a lot, because the article supply is vast. Therefore it's hard to estimate average time for inner settings. The total time for inner settings could be reduced by shorten time for cleaning the CNC machine, pre-programming the robot and using fixtures which can be attached easily. This should increase the ability to run more articles in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell.</b>   The conclusion is that the company could improve the production, by upgrading and investing in equipment for the <b>robot</b> <b>cell.</b> Improvements can also be achieved by reduce the time for inner settings, and also by collect statistics from the production in the <b>robot</b> <b>cell.</b> This should make it easier to find reasons that keep the utilization rate low. ...|$|E

Based on literature review, it gives the concept of layout design and logic for slow down and resume of robot motion. The speed will be first reduced to manual speed and then zero speed depending on the distance between the human and the robot.
