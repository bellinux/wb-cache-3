40|$|Whey {{proteins}} may be fractionated by isoelectric precipitation {{followed by}} centrifugal {{recovery of the}} precipitate phase. Transport and processing of protein precipitates may alter the precipitate particle properties, which may affect how they behave in subsequent processes. For example, the transport of precipitate solution through pumps, pipes and valves and into a centrifugal separator may cause changes in particle size and density, which may affect {{the performance of the}} separator. This work investigates the effect of fluid flow intensity, flow geometry and exposure time on the breakage of whey protein precipitates: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to quantify the flow intensity in different geometries. Flow geometry can have a critical impact on particle breakage. Sharp geometrical transitions induce large increases in turbulence that can result in substantial particle breakage. As protein precipitate particles break, they tend to form denser more compact structures. The reduction in particle size and increase in compaction is due <b>to</b> <b>breakage.</b> This makes the particles become more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> further <b>breakage</b> as particle compactness increases. The effect of flow intensity on particle <b>breakage</b> is coupled <b>to</b> exposure time, with greater exposure time producing more breakage. However, it is expected that the particles will attain an equilibrium particle size and density after prolonged exposure in a constant flow field where no further breakage will occur with exposure time...|$|R

However, there are few studies of genotoxicity in Arctic avian wildlife. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to quantify DNA damage in lymphocytes of selected seabird species and to examine whether accumulation of organohalogen contaminants (OHCs) affects DNA damage. Blood was sampled from common eider (Somateria mollissima), black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), and great skua (Stercorarius skua) in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Contaminant concentrations found in the six species differed presumably due to foraging ecology and biomagnification. Despite large differences in contaminant concentrations, ranging from ΣOHCs 3. 3 ng/g ww in the common eider to ΣOHCs 895 ng/g ww in the great skua, there was no strong difference among the species in baseline DNA damage or sensitivity to a genotoxic stressor (i. e. hydrogen peroxide). Baseline levels of DNA damage were low, with median values ranging from 1. 7 % in the common eider to 8. 6 % in the great skua. There were no associations between DNA damage and contaminants in the investigated species, suggesting that contaminant concentrations in Kongsfjorden are too low to evoke genotoxic effects, or possibly that lymphocytes are <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> strand <b>breakage.</b> Clearly, genotoxicity is a topic for future studies of Arctic seabird...|$|R

Human intervention trials with clinical endpoints have failed to confirm their protective effects, and mechanistic studies have given inconsistent results. Our aim was to investigate antioxidant/ pro-oxidant effects of vitamin C at the cellular level. Experimental approach: We have used the comet assay to investigate effects of vitamin C on DNA damage, antioxidant status, and DNA repair, in HeLa (human tumor) cells, and HPLC to measure uptake of vitamin C into cells. Results: Even at concentrations in the medium as high as 200 μM, vitamin C did not increase the background level of strand breaks or of oxidized purines in nuclear DNA. Vitamin C is taken up by HeLa cells and accumulates to mM levels. Preincubation of cells with vitamin C did not render them <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> strand <b>breakage</b> induced by H 2 O 2 or to purine oxidation by photosensitizer plus light. Vitamin C {{had no effect on}} the rate of repair of strand breaks or oxidized bases by HeLa cells. However, vitamin C at a concentration of less than 1 μM, or extract from cells preincubated for 6 h with vitamin C, was able to induce damage (strand breaks) in lysed, histone-depleted nuclei (nucleoids). Conclusion: In these cultured human cells, vitamin C displays neither antioxidant nor pro-oxidant properties; nor does it affect DNA strand break or base excision repair...|$|R
40|$|Ore {{breakage}} characterisation is {{a methodology}} {{that is used}} to determine the ore hardness, or resistance <b>to</b> <b>breakage</b> which can be compared across a database of different rock types. It thus develops a relationship between specific energy input and degree of breakage which can be applied <b>to</b> impact <b>breakage</b> in comminution devices. The present study is focussed on investigating the breakage properties of UG 2 chromitite, pyroxenite, spotted anorthosite and mottled anorthosite grab samples from run-of-mine (RoM) ore stockpile (particle selection method) and cut drill core particles (cut core method). A mineralogical analysis of UG 2 chromitite, pyroxenite, spotted anorthosite and mottled anorthosite was performed using Leica EZ 4 D optical microscope and QEMSCAN 650 F to determine their mineral composition and texture. The presence of cracks in chromitite stockpile and cut drill core samples was also explored using a Nikon XTH 225 ST micro-focus X-ray system. RoM ore stockpile and cut drill core particles of each of these rock types were subjected <b>to</b> impact <b>breakage</b> in the JK Rotary Breakage Tester (RBT). The progeny particle size distributions and degrees of breakage of UG 2 rock types obtained via the particle selection and cut core methods were compared. Standard breakage characterization models were fitted <b>to</b> the <b>breakage</b> data of different rock types and the relative hardness parameters compared. It was found that UG 2 chromitite comprised mainly fine, isolated, round chromite grains in a plagioclase matrix. Pyroxenite samples were found to be made up of granular orthopyroxene, interstitial plagioclase and clinopyroxene. The mineralogical analysis also revealed that spotted anorthosite primarily contains plagioclase with orthopyroxene crystals forming isolated "spots" creating a poikilitic texture. Mottled anorthosite is made up of mainly plagioclase. Results from breakage tests showed that the progeny particle size distributions and the degrees of breakage for particles sourced from the RoM ore stockpile breaks into a finer product compared to cut drill core samples. This was attributed to the presence of cracks in the RoM ore particles as revealed by the tomographic scans. No visible cracks were found in the cut core particle. The ore hardness parameters were determined from fitting the <b>breakage</b> data <b>to</b> standard impact <b>breakage</b> characterisation models (t 10 breakage and size dependent breakage model). Samples obtained via the particle selection method were consistently found to offer less resistance <b>to</b> impact <b>breakage</b> as shown by the higher Axb values compared to the cut drill core samples. Using the ore hardness classes presented by Napier-Munn et al (1999), UG 2 chromitite, spotted anorthosite, mottled anorthosite and pyroxenite were thus classified as very soft, soft to very soft, soft to very soft and medium to soft respectively. The hardness indicator, 3600. M. fmat. x, for each size class determined using the parameters obtained from the size dependent breakage model decrease with an increase in the parent particle size. This shows that particles become more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> impact <b>breakage</b> as the initial particle size increases. However, for pyroxenite, spotted and mottled anorthosite, the indicator decreases between the particle sizes 14 to 28. 6 mm but then increases for 41. 1 mm...|$|R
