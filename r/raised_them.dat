5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} and <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> strictly, {{seeking to}} influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is {{introduced}} as a devoted Methodist minister, who {{is supported by}} his sister Iris. On a self-discovery trip {{in the middle of}} the first season, Brother Justin has an elaborate vision of two Russian immigrant children, Irina and her younger brother Alexei; Irina talks of her evil father. As revealed shortly afterwards, this vision is a repressed memory of Brother Justin of him and Iris as the only survivors of a train accident which also cost their mother's life. Reverend Norman Balthus later saved Irina and Alexei and <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> in a church orphanage. A vision prompts Brother Justin to get his chest tattooed early in the second season.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} before {{the raising of}} the legio and {{the early years of}} the Roman Kingdom and the Republic, forces are {{described}} as being organized into centuries of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or <b>raised</b> <b>them.</b> Such independent organization persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalised as a centurion), second in command and standard bearer are referenced in this early period.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{that made}} her significant {{to the development of}} Minimalism were aggressively plain and painted structures, often large. The recessional platform under her sculpture <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> just enough off the ground that they appeared to float on a thin line of shadow. The boundary between sculpture and ground, between gravity and verticality, was made illusory. This formal ambivalence is mirrored by her insistence that color itself, contained a psychological vibration which when purified, as it is on a work of art, isolates the event it refers to as a thing rather than a feeling. The event becomes a work of art, a visual sensation delivered by color.|$|E
25|$|Andreas Hug {{was born}} in Zurich, Switzerland on September 7, 1964. His father, Arthur, was a Swiss of French descent and was in French Foreign Legionnaire. He died in Thailand under mysterious {{circumstances}} without ever seeing his son. Hug's mother, Madelaine Hug-Baumann, was German. She was forced to pursue gainful employment. Unable to care for Andy, she immediately put him up for adoption and he spent {{the first three years}} of his life in an orphanage until his care was taken over by his grandparents along with his brother, Charly, and sister, Fabienne. His grandmother, Fridy, and grandfather, Herrmann Baumann, a bricklayer, <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> in Wohlen in the Canton of Aargau.|$|E

The slabs type of burial was a typical kind of burial of the West Mediterranean world in the 14-15th century, but which had special method of production and ornamentation in the Balkan, customized according to the stonemasonry skills and microenvironment. The dated monuments indicate they were initially made by/for the feudal nobility, while later this tradition was embraced and adopted by the indigenous Vlachs who have almost exclusively <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> from the mid-15th century.|$|E
25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have been}} farmed in South Africa {{since the beginning}} of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> successfully on their property, and were able to obtain a crop of feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron. Uncooked, it is dark red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.|$|E
25|$|Not {{being an}} economist, Louis resented the preponderant {{share in the}} French market, taken by the Dutch, on {{basically}} emotional grounds, but his new Superintendent of Finances, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, gave focused impetus to this resentment by a well-organised complex of economic policies, of a mercantilist nature. The first of these was his tariff list of 1664, which was calculated to just wrest away important French markets from the Dutch, without completely closing down trade (except for the trade in refined sugar, which {{was hit with a}} prohibitive tariff). However, in 1667 this was followed with a much more draconian list that doubled tariffs on Dutch fine cloth, linen, and Delftware; quadrupled them on whale products (for which France was Holland's biggest customer); and <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> sevenfold for tobacco products.|$|E

25|$|In 457BC Sparta, {{needing a}} {{counterpoise}} against Athens in central Greece, reversed her policy and reinstated Thebes {{as the dominant}} power in Boeotia. The great citadel of Cadmea served this purpose well by holding out as a base of resistance when the Athenians overran and occupied {{the rest of the}} country (457–447BC). In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by the support that Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427BC. In 424BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the effects of that firm military organization that eventually <b>raised</b> <b>them</b> to predominant power in Greece.|$|E
25|$|Raziel is {{introduced}} in Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver as a vampire sired by the spiritually-corrupted despot Kain—the first of Kain's six lieutenants, and his second-in-command. He surpasses Kain, who—ostensibly motivated by jealously—condemns Raziel to death. Raziel is resurrected by The Elder God, and traverses Nosgoth (the fictional {{setting of the}} series), embarking on a quest for vengeance. He confronts Kain, who attacks him with his legendary blade, the Soul Reaver; the Reaver mysteriously shatters when it strikes Raziel. The spirit formerly captive within the sword binds itself to Raziel, becoming his symbiotic weapon—the wraith-blade. Raziel discovers that, when they were human, {{he and the other}} lieutenants were the leaders of the ancient vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood; Kain found their corpses and <b>raised</b> <b>them,</b> unwitting, as vampires, in a calculated act of blasphemous irony. Raziel kills Kain's remaining lieutenants and tracks him down again, but is cheated of revenge when Kain activates a time machine and slips into Nosgoth's past.|$|E
25|$|Lu Mao was {{a younger}} brother of Lu Xun. His ancestral home was in Wu County, Wu Commandery (吳郡), which is in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. At a young age, he was already known for being a keen learner and for valuing righteousness. Some of his friends – Chen Rong (陳融), Puyang Yi (濮陽逸), Jiang Zuan (蔣纂) and Yuan Di (袁迪) – were from humble {{backgrounds}} but had great ambitions. Lu Mao, who was from a more affluent family, often shared his wealth with them. Xu Yuan (徐原), who was also from Wu Commandery, moved to Kuaiji Commandery. He had never met Lu Mao before, but before his death, he wrote to Lu Mao and requested Lu to help him {{take care of his}} young son. Lu Mao obliged, had a proper tomb constructed for Xu Yuan, and adopted Xu's son. Lu Mao's second cousin-uncle, Lu Ji, died early, leaving behind two sons and one daughter who were still very young then. Lu Mao adopted Lu Ji's children and <b>raised</b> <b>them.</b> They left him only after they reached adulthood. The commandery officials wanted to recruit Lu Mao to join the civil service but he refused.|$|E
