6000|$|Yon path of greensward [...] Winds round by sparry grot and gay pavilion; [...] There is no flint to gall thy tender foot, [...] There's <b>ready</b> <b>shelter</b> {{from each}} breeze, or shower.-- [...] But duty guides not that way--see her stand, [...] With wand entwined with amaranth, near yon cliffs. [...] Oft where she leads thy blood must mark thy footsteps, [...] Oft where she leads thy head must bear the storm. [...] And thy shrunk form endure heat, cold, and hunger; [...] But she will guide thee up to noble heights, [...] Which he who gains seems {{native of the}} sky, [...] While earthly things lie stretch'd beneath his feet, [...] Diminish'd, shrunk, and valueless-- [...] ANONYMOUS.|$|E
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of salt beneath the City of Wyandotte, the Michigan Alkali Company was established in 1891. Captain J.B. Ford created an industry the eventually provided employment for over 1200 workers. Large apartment style company houses were built {{at the north end}} of Wyandotte in what was then Ford City. These double story frame houses were originally built as duplex units without basements. These apartments provided <b>ready</b> <b>shelter</b> for the immigrant laborers seeking work at the chemical plants. Many of these large structures stood along Biddle Avenue, north of Northline Road. During the widening of the main thoroughfare in 1917, this group of company homes was moved. Today, several outstanding examples of this early Alkali Company home can be seen. The largest group is on Fifth Street, between Goddard and St. John Streets. The Alkali Company homes date back to the early 1890s and many still remain as a prominent architectural style residence in the community.|$|E

5|$|In Brunswick and New Hanover counties, North Carolina, {{officials}} <b>readied</b> <b>shelters</b> on September 29 {{to accommodate}} stranded residents unable to access their homes. Multiple schools in New Hanover and Pender County remained closed {{the next morning}} due to worsening storm conditions from the disturbance succeeding Nicole. At the threat of prolonged rainfall, a flood watch was issued for Kent County, Maryland, from September 30 to October 1. Also in the area, the National Weather Service declared both a coastal flood advisory and wind advisory for September 30.|$|R
50|$|In late November 2008, around 100 people {{perished in}} floods {{due to the}} long lasting showers that fell in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. 90% {{of the city was}} {{underwater}} and the port was partially destroyed. Many lost their homes and other possessions and had no <b>ready</b> <b>shelters</b> to turn to, for the rain combined with river waters invaded every section of the city and most of Central and Coastal Santa Catarina State. President Lula da Silva and other officials flew over the area to evaluate the damage and offer help. The state was declared a disaster area by the State and Federal governments.|$|R
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, and Ciego de Ávila on September28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and <b>readied</b> <b>shelters.</b> Thunderstorms in Grand Cayman forced Cayman Airways to cancel all express flights to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman on October29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions.|$|R
60|$|Having {{lingered on}} the shore till we were well-nigh chilled to death by the wind, and were <b>ready</b> to take <b>shelter</b> in a Charity-house, we turned our weather-beaten faces toward Provincetown and the Bay again, having now more than doubled the Cape.|$|R
60|$|At Cannon Street they inquired for Mr. Brown's piano, {{which had}} duly arrived, drove thence to a {{neighbouring}} mews, where they contracted for a cart, {{and while that}} was being got <b>ready,</b> took <b>shelter</b> in the harness-room beside the stove. Here the lawyer presently toppled {{against the wall and}} fell into a gentle slumber; so that Pitman found himself launched on his own resources in the midst of several staring loafers, such as love to spend unprofitable days about a stable.|$|R
60|$|He ran as {{he spoke}} to the spot where the {{lifeboat}} lay <b>ready</b> under the <b>shelter</b> of the pier, but Jo was on board before him. Almost simultaneously did a dozen strong and fearless men leap into the noble craft and don their cork life-belts. A few seconds sufficed. Every man knew well his place and his duty. The short, powerful oars were shipped.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Dean's {{smooth and}} well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning {{to all of}} the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storm's impact. Because of the advance warning and Dean's {{extraordinary}} strength, the nations of Central America and the Caribbean set up hundreds of <b>shelters,</b> <b>readied</b> thousands of disaster recovery experts, evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents, and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplies.|$|R
500|$|Due to its mild nature, Isidore was {{described}} as a [...] "safety test". Gale warnings were issued from as far south as Key West, Florida, to as far north as Virginia, including parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. A private meteorological service stated that Isidore was to intensify to hurricane status, leading to some confusion regarding preparations. Along the Treasure Coast of Florida, citrus farmers burned seedlings potentially infected with canker to prevent heavy rains from spreading the disease. Red Cross volunteers <b>readied</b> a <b>shelter</b> with supplies such as cots and sheets, though it remained unused. In Martin County, hundreds of firefighters were on standby. In Miami, rain from the storm led to the cancellation of horse races at the Calder Race Course. State parks in Monroe County were temporarily closed.|$|R
50|$|Roads allowed quick {{movement}} (on foot) for the Inca {{army and}} shelters called tambo and storage silos called qullqas were built one day's travelling distance from each other, so that an army on campaign could always be fed and rested. This {{can be seen}} in names of ruins such as Ollantay Tambo, or My Lord's Storehouse. These were set up so the Inca and his entourage would always have supplies (and possibly <b>shelter)</b> <b>ready</b> as they traveled.|$|R
50|$|It is {{traditional}} for Finnish families to light two candles in each window {{of their home}} in the evening. This custom dates to the 1920s; but even earlier, candles {{had been placed in}} Finnish windows on poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday as a silent protest against Russian oppression. A popular legend has it that two candles were used as a sign to inform young Finnish men on their way to Sweden and Germany to become jägers that the house was <b>ready</b> to offer <b>shelter</b> and keep them hidden from the Russians.|$|R
6000|$|Chet had {{calculated}} {{to spend some}} time hunting, and had with him a hatchet, with which to cut firewood. In a very few minutes he had cut out some of the brushwood, leaving a cleared space about eight feet square. Over the top of the cleared space he threw some saplings and pine branches, and then [...] "wove in" [...] pine branches around the sides. By this means he soon had a <b>shelter</b> <b>ready,</b> which, while it was by no means air-tight, was a great deal better than nothing. On the floor of the shelter he placed other pine branches, and there he and Andy made the suffering man as comfortable as possible. As soon as they had reached the spot, Andy had started up a fire, {{right in front of the}} opening, and this now gave out a warmth that was much appreciated.|$|R
500|$|Owing to {{the abrupt}} nature of Abby's {{development}} on August7, residents {{had little time}} to prepare for the storm. According to Irvin Velbrecht, [...] "in the absence of aircraft reconnaissance and radar information, two reasonably new tools in storm detection, Abby could well have formed and approached the shore before knowledge of a tropical storm was gained." [...] Gale warnings were raised from Galveston to San Antonio immediately following the storm's formation and were kept in place through the morning of August8. Evacuation orders were issued for Matagorda Island and most complied, with some deciding to remain at their homes. Personnel at Matagorda Island Air Force Base were evacuated to Victoria. Red Cross facilities were <b>readied</b> and public <b>shelters</b> were opened in the area. At the mouth of the Colorado River, seagoing vessels were tied down with extra rope. Within the Weather Bureau, members of the Galveston office were the first to notice the system and relayed to the other offices in the area to attune their radars to follow the system.|$|R
5000|$|On August 21, the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan {{issued a}} sea warning for Typhoon Tembin, {{predicting}} strong winds, heavy rains and storm surge. The residents of Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung {{were asked to}} stay alert regarding the storm system. By August 22, the Ministry of National Defense of Taiwan helped evacuate several residents in the typhoon-prone areas and provided accommodation to some in their own military camps. More than 49,000 soldiers were on standby to provide relief and rescue to those in need when the typhoon strikes. About 107 military bases {{in and around the}} typhoon-prone regions were <b>ready</b> to provide <b>shelter</b> to well over 53,000 evacuees. The next day, Taiwanese authorities evacuated another 3000 residents from mountainous areas anticipating torrential rain that could cause landslides. Later that day, the outer rainbands of Tembin started brushing Taiwan. The system unexpected sped up towards land and started re-intensifying. Late that night numerous cities and counties across the island shut down schools and offices for up to two days. Farmers also immediately harvested their crops like they earlier did in 2010 anticipating Fanapi's arrival. People in eastern Taiwan boarded up their windows to try to minimize structural damage. Valentine's Day celebrations across Taiwan were also cancelled.|$|R
60|$|But Passion {{also had}} her arguments, which she {{addressed}} to a temper rendered irritable by recent distress and mortification. In the first place, {{if he was}} a prince, he was also a gentleman, entitled to resent as such, and obliged to give or claim the satisfaction expected on occasion of differences among gentlemen. With Englishmen, she urged, he could never lose interest by showing himself <b>ready,</b> instead of <b>sheltering</b> himself under his royal birth and pretensions, to come frankly forward and maintain what he had done or said on his own responsibility. In a free nation, it seemed as if he would rather gain than lose in the public estimation by a conduct which could not but seem gallant and generous. Then a character for courage was far more necessary to support his pretensions than any other kind of reputation; and the lying under a challenge, without replying to it, might bring his spirit into question. What would Villiers and Wilmot say of an intrigue, in which he had allowed himself to be shamefully baffled by a country girl, and had failed to revenge himself on his rival? The pasquinades which they would compose, the witty sarcasms which they would circulate on the occasion, would be harder to endure than the grave rebukes of Hertford, Hyde, and Nicholas. This reflection, added to the stings of youthful and awakened courage, at length fixed his resolution, and he returned to Woodstock determined to keep his appointment, come of it what might.|$|R
