40|$|AbstractTwo {{methods for}} calculating the wake {{geometry}} and blade loads for a hovering helicopter rotor are presented. One approach {{assumes that the}} wake trailed from the <b>rotor</b> <b>rolls</b> up into discrete vortices according to the Betz criterion for conservation of momentum. A simplified model is used to represent the vortex system. These vortices are then tracked according to the cortex transport law as they move {{under the influence of}} the velocities induced by the complete wake and rotor. Induced velocities are determined from the kinematic relationships (Biot-Savart law). The other approach incorporates the same simplified free wake model of the rotor in a finite difference calculation of the flow field. A variation of the “cloud-in-cell” technique, modified to eliminate self-induced velocity errors for curved vortex filaments, is used. Calculations showing the effect of vortex core size and the number of vortex filaments representing the wake are presented. For large numbers of vortices it is seen that the wake geometry fails to converge. However, only a few vortices are needed to adequately represent the wake. Comparisons with experimental results are presented for both methods. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a recently developed method for computing blade airloads in forward flight...|$|R
40|$|With their highly robust {{nature and}} simple design, {{switched}} reluctance machines are {{finding their way}} into numerous modern day applications. However, they produce oscillatory torque that generates torque ripple and mechanical vibrations. A double rotor structure to maximize the flux linkage and thereby increase the torque generating capability is proposed. As the machine operates close to saturation, the torque computation depends heavily on the energy conversion as the <b>rotor</b> <b>rolls</b> over the stator for a fixed pole pitch. The flux linkage characteristics are highly non-linear, hence estimation of the magnetic and mechanical parameters is extremely cumbersome. Magnetic circuit analysis by interpretation {{of the number of}} flux tubes using integration techniques at different positions of the machine to develop the flux linkage characteristics of the double rotor structure is presented. Computation of the inductances during the movement of rotor from unaligned to aligned is crucial in determining the generated torque. Relevant equations of calculations for inductance and flux linkages in the aligned, partially aligned and unaligned positions are computed. The partially aligned computation is based on the average on two intermediate positions, namely the 1 / 4 th aligned and 3 / 4 th aligned conditions. The static torque characteristics based on the energy conversion principles are used to compute the torque value. Results from simulation and experiments used for performance evaluation of the proposed flux tube analysis for computation of the electro-magnetic torque are presented...|$|R
50|$|A {{helicopter}} is {{susceptible to}} a rolling tendency,called dynamic rollover, when close to the ground,especially when taking off or landing.For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to firstcause the helicopter to roll or pivot around a skid, orlanding gear wheel, until its critical rollover angle isreached. Then, beyond this point, main <b>rotor</b> thrust continuesthe <b>roll</b> and recovery is impossible. If the criticalrollover angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on itsside regardless of the cyclic control corrections made.|$|R
40|$|The Advancing Blade Concept (ABC) uses two rigid counterrotating rotors in a coaxial {{arrangement}} {{to provide}} advancing blades {{on both sides}} of the aircraft. This makes use of the high dynamic pressure on the advancing side of the rotors at high forward speed, virtually ignoring the low dynamic pressure on the retreating side, while still keeping the <b>rotor</b> system in <b>roll</b> trim. Theoretically such a rotor system will maintain its lift potential as speed increases. The XH- 59 A was designed to investigate this theory. A description is provided of the flight test program from May, 1980 to January, 1981. A summary is presented of the knowledge gained throughout the entire program, and current pitfalls are reviewed. It is concluded that the ABC has been verified, with the XH- 59 A envelope of blade lift coefficient as a function of advance ratio greatly exceeding that of conventional helicopter rotor systems...|$|R

The stress and displacement {{analysis of the}} rotor blade of any turbo machine {{in the field of}} design played a very important <b>roll.</b> <b>Rotor</b> blade is the very critical component in the field of turbo machines. The major cause of break down is due to different loadings such as fluid or gas forces and centrifugal forces are acting on the rotor blades. In this study, the first stage rotor blade of the gas turbine is created in SolidWorks software. The material of the blade is structural steel. This rotor blade has been analyzed by using ANSYS 14. 5. The gas forces namely tangential, axial were determined by constructing velocity triangles at inlet and exist of rotor blades. Three different models with different number of holes (5, 9 and 13) were analyzed to find out the optimum number of holes for good performance.

40|$|The {{electrical}} actuation of a <b>Rolling</b> <b>Rotor</b> Switched Reluctance Motor (RRSRM) {{depends on}} the application and {{the properties of the}} motor. The RRSRM is applied as a direct drive, because its rotation speed is rather slow [1]. These characteristics must be considered at the design of the electrical actuation. Reluctance motors are controlled with direct current choppers [2]. The behavior and the properties of RRSRM are different from those of general reluctance motors. Very important aspects are the variable inductance, the characteristic torque curve and the degree of efficiency [3]. For this reason the interactions between these factors must be regarded. Therefore, this work describes the specific characteristics of the RRSRM and the design of the power electronics. Furthermore, the interactions between the motor and the power electronics are investigated. A specific feature is the magnetic field of the RRRSM [1]. Therefore, the magnetic properties and their influence o n the electrical actuation are also shown. The implementations of the power electronics and the RRSRM are realized in one shared simulation environment. Thus the interdisciplinary effects can be investigated very well...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to enable the measurement of the velocity field {{in the vicinity of}} a lifting rotor. This involved the use of a triaxial hot-wire probe coupled to a mini-computer. Using this technique extensive flow measurements in one plane (z/R = - 0. 075) under the rotor were made at advance ratios of 0. 1 and 0. 067. In addition the rotor thrust, torque and blade bending moments were also measured. The results of the analysis of the time averaged flow show clear evidence that the wake of the <b>rotor</b> rapidly <b>rolls</b> up into 2 `fixed-wing' type vortices. Also indicated is that the value of K in Glauert's induced velocity equation is underestimated by about 50 %. It is also shown that results obtained from tests carried out at the same advance ratio, but different tip speeds, do not produce the same non-dimensionalised velocities at all positions. Analysis of the time varying results has shown that the roll-up of the tip vortex is completed within approximately 1 chord length of the blade and that the strength of the tip vortex is equal to the maximum value of the blade bound vorticity. The time varying data also reveals the influence of the turbulent blade wake and this has been used to obtain estimates of the blade profile drag. It is believed {{that this is the first}} time this has been observed in helicopter wake measurements and is potentially of great use in investigating the reductions in drag from using advanced blade sections and tip planforms. Aft of the rotor velocity traces showing the intersection of the tip vortex by the probe has been analysed to provide estimates of the vortex core size. These results also show evidence of axial flow in the vortex core...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rolling</b> <b>rotor</b> {{switched}} reluctance motors (RRSRM) {{are known}} as exceptional drive systems. Their fundamental operation {{is characterized by the}} coupling of electrical, magnetic and mechanical components and the especial operating mode [1]. The rotor is moved eccentrically in the stator. Due to this property an investigation with conventional mode of description is possible only on limited scale. Therefore, this work describes a new approach on the basis of magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) method. This method allows the user more possibilities that the finite element method. These investigations on RRSRM are executed on the basis of descriptions which based on the Ohm's and Kirchhoff's law. This modeling method is supported by the object-oriented modeling language Modelica and the simulation environment Dymola [2] [3]. By means of this approach the investigations of heterogeneous physical properties of the motor and a possible area of application will be presented in this paper. This method of description offers the possibility to implement each different physical domain inside the same simulation environment, where the coupling between the different physical domains can be well investigated. This approach will show that there are physical interconnections between the miscellaneous domains that have strong influences on the mode of operation...|$|R
40|$|Permanent magnet motors {{have been}} {{extensively}} adopted {{for years as}} power drives due to their attractive performances. However, the increasing cost of rare earth materials {{has led to the}} implementation of alternative motor technologies. In particular, the affordable electronics, the high robustness and low-cost manufacturing are appealing features of the Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM). The employment of a reduction mechanism is a common solution in drive systems when high torque at low speed is demanded. In such cases, the adoption of a gearing system involves further mechanical complexity and increased bulkiness. In this context, the <b>Rolling</b> <b>Rotor</b> Switched Reluctance Machine (RRSRM) is a reasonable solution, since it shares the main characteristics of a SRM while performing speed reduction due to the rolling motion of the rotor. Despite these advantages, the diffusion of such machine is hampered by the limited research results. The literature review reveals the lack of a generalised design procedure. These aspects motivate the work exposed in the present dissertation. In this fashion, a lumped parameter approach is used for the modelling of the motor. A design procedure is proposed and the validity of the results is enforced through Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Furthermore, the defined model is used to compute the torque-speed characteristic. Different analyses are accomplished aiming to the maximisation of the machine performance. Common control strategies used on the SRM for torque enhancement and control are extended to this case. Finally, a prototype is realised {{on the basis of the}} proposed methodology and used for validation purposes. The conduced experiments evidence the validity of the model and highlight the possibility of improvement...|$|R

The rotor system introduced aluminium alloy blades pressurised with nitrogen for crack detection, lubricated hinges, hydraulic powered controls, alcohol de-icing and automatic blade folding. Power was supplied by two free-turbine engines sat atop the cabin, with electrically de-iced inlets, plain lateral exhausts with no Infra-Red countermeasures, driving the main gearbox directly and a cooling fan for the gearbox and hydraulic oil coolers aft of the main gearbox. Construction was of stressed skin duralumin throughout with flush-riveting, {{as well as some}} bonding and honeycomb sandwich panels. The 1.5m × 1,25m × 3.94m cabin had a sliding door to port flight deck forward of the cabin and fuel tanks underfloor filled using a pressure refueling nozzle on the port side. A short boom {{at the rear of the}} cabin had a central fin and twin toed in fins at the ends of the tailplane mainly for use during auto-rotation. The undercarriage consisted of two noncastoring mainwheels with sprag brakes attached to the fuselage by parallel 'V' struts with a single angled shock absorber to dissipate landing loads, and two castoring nosewheels on straight shock absorbing legs attached directly to the fuselage either side of the cockpit which folded rearwards to reduce interference with the RADAR, all wheels were fitted with emergency rapid inflation flotation collars. Flying controls all act on the co-axial <b>rotors</b> with pitch, <b>roll</b> and collective similar to a conventional single rotor helicopter. Yaw was through differential collective which has a secondary effect of torque, an automatic mixer box ensured that total lift on the rotors remained constant during yaw maneuvers, to improve handling during deck landings. Optional extras included fold up seats for 12 passengers, rescue hoist, external auxiliary fuel tanks or containers for cameras, flares, smoke floats or beacons.|$|R
40|$|Electric {{machines}} {{are widely used}} in modern automotive technologies. Generally, automotive applications require robust and low cost electric motors for the reason of their mass production and operation in different environments. Permanent magnet motors {{have been used in}} automotive applications for their high power density when compared to other existing types of motors. Recent years, the price of permanent magnets is sharply increasing and this trend is expected to continue in future. Moreover, brittle nature of permanent magnets make this type of motor less reliable in high vibration applications. Therefore, interest in switched reluctance motors (SRM) for automotive applications are increasing. These machines have number of advantages like: windings are placed only in stator and hence brushes can be excluded, permanent magnets are replaced with electromagnets. All these leads to lower cost in production and higher robustness of the motor. For high torque, low speed applications SRM must be used together with speed reduction mechanisms, resulting in larger dimensions. Even though high efficiency of the speed reduction system is a main design goal in many application, for some applications irreversibility of the speed reducer might be necessary. <b>Rolling</b> <b>rotor</b> switched reluctance motors (RRSRM) comprise all advantages of switched reluctance motors and due to rolling motion of the motor covers also the function of speed reduction mechanism. Wide range of analyzed literature on RRSRM studies, showed that there is no generalized method which allows dimensioning of this type of motor to achieve required specifications. To fill this gap the analytical model based on magnetic circuit analysis and numerical model based on finite element nonlinear analysis to study the performance of motor have been developed. The validation of the developed models was performed on a prototype of rolling rotor motor that was designed and built within the scope of the present study. Furthermore, main parameters to achieve the system irreversibility are defined by considering toothed wheels of RRSRM as an one stage cycloidal speed reduce...|$|R
