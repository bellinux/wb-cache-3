5|$|Although the <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones</b> {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones</b> as an outdated band.|$|E
5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones,</b> and floats {{an idea about}} getting The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones</b> to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones</b> concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The <b>Rolling</b> <b>Stones,</b> but Don is indifferent.|$|E
