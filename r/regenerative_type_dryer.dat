40|$|The rough-rice-drying {{process in}} a mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> was {{analysed}} by the theory of thin layer drying. The drying period of rough rice in the dryer {{is assumed to be}} a pre-heating period, and a heat balance equation is introduced as one of the basic equations. The Becker 2 ̆ 7 s equation of moisture content, the Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s equation of equilibrium moisture content, and the equations of air and vapour characteristics are used for the analysis with a slight modification. The drying process in mixing <b>type</b> <b>dryer</b> is assumed to be as folloes; 1 ） Drying air increase its humidity and reduces its temperature by absorbing the moisture of the products through the mixing layer from the inlet to the outlet. This means that the state of air changes with drying time and grain position as in deep stationary bed. 2) The state of grains is independent of their position, but dependent on drying time. This is due to constant mixing. 3) The drying rate of grains, averaged by constant mixing, is independent of their position although the local drying rate varies with their position. 4 ） The heating rate of grains is also independent of their position. This is the same situation as in the drying rate. The equations on the misture content, the temperature of grains, the absolute humidity, and the enthalpy of drying air are being derived. The numerical method of solving these equations is given together with its computer program. Results computed with this theory agree well with the measured values with the practical apparatus, L. S.

Drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process in producing a good quality of rosella tea. The study was aimed to evaluate the drying efficiency of rosella tea by using a cabinet dryer. The source of energy for the dryer was from the burning of charcoal. The charcoal was prepared from the coconut shell since it was abundant biomass product. About 7. 5 kg of fresh rosella flower was dried for 17 hours. The total of charcoal consumed was 17 kg. The moisture content of rosella flower was reduced from 90 to 12 %. The analysis showed that the total of energy produced from the burning of 17 kg charcoal was 309. 4 MJ, whilst the total energy needed to dry the flower was 15, 72 MJ. Therefore, the drying efficiency was still low about 4. 58 %.

Recent {{developments in the}} field of high Tc superconductors spawned a wide range of applications such as terahertz sensors, SQUIDS, low noise amplifiers, filters for microwave applications and many more. These devices are typically, nondissipating and require a cryocooler delivering refrigeration power of about 10 mW operating at 80 K.

The spindle speed is taken to be harmonically varying about a constant mean speed. Approximate analytical solutions are sought using the method of strained parameters, a perturbation technique. The amplitude of speed fluctuations (ε) is assumed to be small, and solutions are constructed using this parameter as the perturbation parameter. The stability lobes for constant spindle speeds are calculated exactly. By using the approximate perturbation analysis, the gain in stability is calculated for variable spindle speeds. The analysis is valid for (ε) values up to 0. 02 (i. e., 2 % of the constant mean speed). Solutions are verified using numerical simulations of the original equation...|$|R

To save energy and reduce the drying time, the distribution of temperature between layers should be fast and uniform with minimum difference; otherwise the difference of MC gradient between layers will be high and will induce grain breakage. The difference of final MC between layers in the two methods was 48 - 73 %.
