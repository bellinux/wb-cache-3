50|$|Conversely, {{the turbine}} meter {{operation}} is not rooted deeply in fundamentals of thermodynamics. This {{is not to}} say that the turbine meter is in any way an inferior device. There are sound engineering principles providing theoretical background. It is essentially an extremely repeatable device that is then assured accuracy via calibration. The calibration provides the accuracy. It is carried out in good flow conditions (flow conditions free of swirl and a uniform velocity flow profile) this is carried out for every meter manufactured. Deviations from the as-calibrated conditions would be considered installation effects, and the sensitivity of the turbine meter to these installation effects is of interest. The need for flow conditioning is driven from the sensitivity of the meter to deviations from as calibrated conditions of swirl and velocity profile.Generally, recent research indicates that turbine meters are sensitive to swirl but not to the shape of the velocity profile. A uniform velocity profile is recommended, but no strict requirements for fully developed flow profiles are indicated. Also, no significant errors are evident when installing single or dual <b>rotor</b> <b>turbine</b> meters downstream of two elbows out-of-plane without flow conditioning devices.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a Mach number {{correction}} on a model for predicting the length of transition was investigated. The transition length decreases as the turbulent spot production rate increases. Much of the data for predicting the spot production rate comes from low speed flow experiments. Recent data and analysis showed that the spot production rate is affected by Mach number. The degree of agreement between analysis and data for turbine blade heat transfer without film cooling is strongly dependent of accurately predicting the length of transition. Consequently, turbine blade heat transfer data sets were used to validate a transition length turbulence model. A method for modifying models {{for the length of}} transition to account for Mach number effects is presented. The modification was made to two transition length models.

40|$|A {{large and}} growing portion of {{electricity}} is being produced by aging thermal power plants, and although steam turbines are being constructed with excellent high quality materials such as CrMoNiV steel, varying forms of metallurgical degradation due to creep and/or fatigue could still affect the parts and components during long-term operation at high temperatures [1]. Moreover, the de-regulated electricity market, which has existed for approximately 15 years, has led to energy companies operating their power plants in a flexible manner, as opposed to continuous operation, {{in order to maintain}} profitability in a very competitive commercial environment [2]. This paper investigates the <b>rotor</b> <b>turbine</b> failure of a 60 MW unit of a thermal power plant. The rotor was made of CrMoNiV steel, and the failure occurred after approximately 10 years in operation.

The fracture of the shaft was located at the first stage [2] and the fatigue fracture extended over roughly 75 % of the initial cross section.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} proposal (quantitative determination) of any {{combustion turbine}} engine operation has been presented, wherein the impact energy occurs {{at a given}} time due to Energy conversion. The fact has been taken into account that in this type of internal combustion engines the energy conversion occurs first in the combustion chambers and in the spaces between the blade of the turbine engine. It was assumed that in the combustion chambers occurs a conversion of chemical energy contained in the fuel-air mixture to the internal energy of the produced exhaust gases. This form of energy conversion has been called heat. It was also assumed that in the spaces between the blades of the <b>rotor</b> <b>turbine,</b> a replacement occurs of part of the internal energy of the exhaust gas, which is their thermal energy into kinetic energy conversion of its rotation. This form of energy conversion has been called the work. Operation of the combustion engine has been thus interpreted as a transmission of power receivers in a predetermined time when there the processing and transfer in the form (means) of work and heat occurs. Valuing the operation of this type of internal combustion engines, proposed by the authors of this article, is to determine their operation using physical size, which has a numerical value and a unit of measurement called joule-second [joule x second]. Operation of the combustion turbine engine resulting in the performance of the turbine rotor work has been presented, taking into account the fact that the impeller shaft is connected to the receiver, which may be a generator (in the case of one-shaft engine) or a propeller of the ship (in the case of two or three shaft engine) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{investigates the}} effects of wakes and {{stratification}} {{on the performance of}} turbines operating in the Bessaker wind farm. The wind farm is located in a highly complex terrain. Most dominant wind directions recorded close to the site are westerly and south easterly and the average wind speed is recorded in the range of 10 – 15 m/s implying that the turbines are rarely idle. However, the power production data of individual turbines revealed that a few turbines were almost always under-performing. This matter was earlier investigated using a multi-scale model ([1]) involving meso-scale weather forecasting model providing input to a nested micro-scale CFD code. This previous study hinted at strong thermal stratification as the culprit which causes a channeling effect thus reducing the wind potential available uphill. However, wake effects were completely ignored in those studies. The current work includes an actuator line (AL) model to enable simulation of wake effects along with stratification and terrain effects on turbine behavior. As a result, the model is able to capture the delay in wake recovery during stable stratified conditions and the resultant turbine-turbine interactions leads to the reduced power production at wind-farm. The inclusion of wake effects showed that the current inter-turbine distance of 4 <b>rotor</b> <b>turbine</b> diameter at some locations is not good for wind-farm operation. This effect was not captured by the earlier multi-scale model which lacked the AL model. Further, the work shows some differences in results arising out of two models (current and previous multi-scale model) related to channeling effect. This difference is attributed to difference in thermal stratification level (Froude number) as the current model uses standard atmospheric inlet profiles/initial profiles, while the multi-scale model used inputs from the higher meso-scale weather forecasting model. The overall work indicates the importance of including wake and stratification effects and the importance of downscaling (using inputs from weather-forecasting models) in improving predictions. According to the authors this is the first work of its kind which accounts for stratification, complex terrain and wakes in a single simulation...|$|E
