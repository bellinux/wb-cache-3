40|$|A {{modified}} Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti {{model of}} measurement apparatus that satisfies both the probability <b>reproducibility</b> <b>condition</b> and the objectification requirement is constructed. Only measurements on microsystems are considered. The cluster separability forms {{a basis for}} the first working hypothesis: the current version of quantum mechanics leaves open what happens to systems when they change their separation status. New rules that close this gap can therefore be added without disturbing the logic of quantum mechanics. The second working hypothesis is that registration apparatuses for microsystems must contain detectors and that their readings are signals from detectors. This implies that separation status of a microsystem changes during both preparation and registration. A new rule that specifies what happens at these changes and that guarantees the objectification is formulated and discussed.

As a consequence, the measurement and follow-up of VP is receiving more attention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Variceal pressure can be measured by the fine needle puncture technique. A close correlation with intrasplenic pressure recording and a high <b>reproducibility</b> in chronic <b>conditions</b> with this technique were confirmed in our laboratory. Using this technique, we recently demonstrated that an intravenous bolus injection of somatostatin 250 micrograms or 500 micrograms given together with a slow infusion of 250 micrograms/h yielded a rapid and transient decrease in VP. Our experience with the non-invasive pressure sensitive gauge shows that the procedure is easy to perform, well standardized and that it has a high <b>reproducibility</b> in acute <b>conditions.</b> CONCLUSION: We inferred from our study of the acute effect of somatostatin that, in the event somatostatin is used in the treatment of variceal haemorrhage, repeated bolus injection should be included to arrest the bleeding.

40|$|<b>Reproducibility</b> <b>conditions</b> of the {{replication}} of a measurement include several circumstances. In chemical measurement ‘reproducibility’ is mostly taken {{to refer to}} an interlaboratory study, either a collaborative trial (that is, with a strictly defined analytical procedure) or a proficiency test (with no prescribed procedure). At first sight, we might expect the reproducibility standard deviation of the proficiency test to be the greater for the same determination: the various procedures used by the participants will each introduce an extra uncertainty related to their specific biases. No comprehensive study of this potential disparity has been undertaken hitherto. The issue is important because reproducibility standard deviation {{is closely related to}} standard uncertainty. Here a comparison is made between the trend of collaborative trial outcomes (standard deviation as a function of concentration) and individual values from the FAPAS proficiency testing scheme in the food analysis sector. Contrary to expectations, the general tendency is for proficiency tests to provide slightly smaller standard deviations than do collaborative trials at mass fractions of the analyte greater than 10 − 7, and slightly higher at lower concentrations.

Milk samples were extracted with acetonitrile and cleaned up on strong cation-exchange solid phase extraction cartridges. Evaporated to dryness first, the extracts obtained were then reconstituted in 0. 1 % formic acid and injected onto a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The separation of analytes was achieved on gradient mode using a C 18 column and a mobile phase consisting of 0. 1 % formic acid in acetonitrile and 0. 1 % formic acid in water. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was set for the MS/MS with positive electrospray ionisation. For quantification, the isotope dilution method was used with isotopically labeled analogues of the target analytes. The method was evaluated entirely in accordance with EU Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and all validation criteria were in the required ranges.

The study was performed within EU funded project EUPIGCLASS {{as a part of the}} study of the accuracy of the on-line methods used in European countries. Therefore, the common experimental plan and ISO 5725 standard were respected. According to later, the accuracy refers to the closeness of agreement between test results under repeatability or <b>reproducibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> and is expressed as standard deviation (sd). The aim was to assess the repeatability sd and reproducibility sd of meat percentage evaluation, and to identify influence of the copy of the equipment and of the operator. For Slovenian method, repeatability sd was 0. 4 %, indicating we can expect 1 % difference for the same carcass made by the same operator with the same copy of the equipment; reproducibility sd was 0. 7 %, indicating 1. 8 % difference can be expected for the same carcass due to factors related to the abattoir.

40|$|Catalytic {{oxidative}} desulfurization (Cat-ODS) {{activities of}} thiophenic sulfur were compared using alumina supported of mono-, bi- and trimetallic oxide molybdena based catalysts, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The {{aim of this}} study was to inquire on the possibility of supported trimetallic oxide catalysts for deep Cat-ODS process. The prepared catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and tested in the ODS of model thiophene, dibenzothiophene and 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiphene, as well as on commercial and crude diesel. It was found that the addition of dopant and co-dopant toward MoO 3 /Al 2 O 3 catalysts increased significantly the selectivity of catalytic performance in the order: mono- 90 % of sulfur was removed in both commercial and crude diesel under similar reaction <b>conditions.</b> <b>Reproducibility</b> test showed that the catalyst has higher catalytic activity and could be repeatedly used with little change after five cycles...|$|R
