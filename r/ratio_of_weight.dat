40|$|Abstract—Branch {{independence}} is weaker than Savage's &quot;sure thing &quot; principle. It requires that judgments of gambles {{with a common}} outcome produced by the same probability-event must not reverse order when that common outcome is changed. Subjects judged 168 gambles from viewpoints of both buyer (highest buying price) and seller (lowest selling price). Judgments violated branch independence in both viewpoints. Violations also changed systematicallv between viewpoints, consistent with the theory that viewpoint affects configural weighting but not the utility function. Violations of branch independence were opposite those predicted by the model of cumulative prospect theory. The middle of three equally likely outcomes received the most weight in the seller's viewpoint. In the buyer's, lower outcomes received greater weights. In both viewpoints, the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> the middle outcome to the highest outcome exceeded the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> the lowest outcome to the middle outcome...|$|R

In 1923 there were nine entrants, though three were non-starters.

5000|$|In {{planning}} for the long-duration Apollo missions, NASA conducted extensive research into space food. One of the techniques developed in 1938 by Nestlé was freeze drying. In the United States, Action Products later commercialized this technique for other foods, concentrating on snack food resulting in products like Space ice cream. The foods are cooked, quickly frozen, and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process. The final product retains 98% [...] of its nutrition and weighs much less than before drying. The <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> before and after drying depends strongly on the particular food item but a typical freeze-dried weight is 20% of the original weight.

50|$|Real Measure {{gives us}} a new {{standpoint}} external to the different Measures being brought into relation with each other, this relation now designating the independent existence of an actual physical Something. This Something gains its Qualitative determination from the Quantitative (a) combination between two Measures immanent in it, i.e., volume and weight. One designates an inner Quality, in this case weight; the other designates an external Quality, in this case volume, the amount of space it takes up. Their combination gives us the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> to volume which is its specific gravity. The constant that results from this ratio is the inner characteristic Real Measure of the thing in question, but, taking the form as it does of a mere number, a Quantum, this constant is likewise subject to alteration, i.e., addition, subtraction, etc. Unlike mere Quantum, however, the Real Measure of a thing is inwardly determined, and so preserves itself somewhat in alteration. If two material things are combined, the dual Measures of the one are added {{to those of the}} other. The degree to which they exhibit self-preservation is registered in the internal Measure—weight in this case—which ends up being equal, after combination, to the sum of the original two Measures; {{the degree to which they}} exhibit Qualitative alteration is registered in the external Measure—space in this case—which does not necessarily result in a sum equal to its parts, but often in the case of material substances exhibits a diminution in overall volume.|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of treating malnourished children in different centers, the authors {{believe there is a}} need to have a simple method of adjusting mortality rates so that differences in the nutritional status of the children are taken into account. The authors compared different anthropometric indices based on weight and height to predict the risk of death among severely malnourished children. Anthropometric data from 1, 047 children who survived were compared with those of 147 children who died during treatment in therapeutic feeding centers set up in African countries in 1993. The optimal <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> to height determined by logistic regression was weight (kg) /height (m) 174 (95 % confidence interval of / 3 estimate 1. 65 - 1. 84). The receiver operating curves (sensitivity vs. specificity) showed that the body mass index (weight (kg) /height (m) 2), optimal <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> to height, and weight/height index expressed as the percentage of the median of the National Center for Health Statistics ' standard were equivalent and superior to the weight/height index expressed as the z score of the National Center for Health Statistics ' standard to predict death.

50|$|Around {{the time}} Graham did his work, the concept <b>of</b> {{molecular}} <b>weight</b> was being established largely through the measurements of gases.

Italian physicist Amedeo Avogadro also suggested in 1811 that equal volumes of different gases contain equal numbers of molecules. Thus, the relative molecular <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> two gases are equal to the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> equal volumes of the gases. Avogadro's insight together with other studies of gas behaviour provided a basis for later theoretical work by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell to explain the properties of gases as collections of small particles moving through largely empty space.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{relate the}} {{intuitive}} <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> harm by commission and harm by omission in therapeutic decisions for pulmonary tuberculosis, and {{to compare it}} with a weight based on probabilities. METHODS: Clinicians were asked for an estimation of probabilities related with the outcome of treated and nontreated pulmonary tuberculosis and for the toll of wrong decisions. Three <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> forgoing a treatment in false-negative patients against the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> treating false-positives were calculated. The first was based on intuitive estimations, whereas {{the second and third}} were based on calculated, either through intuitive estimations of probabilities or through literature data. The association between experience and the difference between the intuitive and the calculated ratios was assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-one participants from Ecuador, Laos, Nepal, and Rwanda responded. The <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> intuitive <b>weights</b> was 2. 0 (interquartile range [IQR], 1. 0 - 4. 0) and the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> calculated <b>weights</b> based on intuitive probabilities was 64 (IQR, 25. 0 - 169. 6; P < 0. 001). The <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> calculated <b>weight</b> based on literature probabilities was 30 (IQR, 17. 9 - 59. 2). No association (R(2) = 0. 03) was found between experience and accuracy in estimating the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> errors. CONCLUSION: The <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> a false negative {{is more important than the}} <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> a false positive for therapeutic decisions in pulmonary tuberculosis.
