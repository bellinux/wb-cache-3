40|$|In {{the last}} years we {{reported}} in general about the hollow-cathode activated deposition of oxides on plastic films (HAD process). This paper describes the process and its possible variations in more detail. As a first variant we investigated the horizontal hollow-cathode discharge with two different anode configurations. A row of hollow-cathode systems arranged side by side across the web creates a dense plasma shield that is located directly below the substrate. Al 2 O 3 coatings deposited via this plasma shield show a clear improvement of microstructure, hardness and abrasion resistance. A further remarkable improvement of the Al 2 O 3 properties can be attained by a vertical hollow-cathode discharge between the aforementioned plasma shield near the substrate and an anode {{in the vicinity of}} the evaporator crucible. The electrical field in this vertical plasma discharge causes additional ions to move toward the substrate. As a result, non-columnar Al 2 O 3, coatings of some micrometers thickne ss with high density and outstanding abrasion resistance have been produced. Despite of the successful deposition of Al 2 O 3 layers by plasma-activated reactive EB evaporation of Al we recommend to use EB evaporation preferably for such materials that really need this technique. This holds especially for the deposition of SiO 2, TiO 2, or ZrO 2 layers. For the deposition of Al 2 O 3 layers we recommend the reactive Al evaporation via boat evaporators in combination with the vertical HAD process.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{preservation of}} paper with the same qualities of brightness and color {{is one of the}} important requirements for certain paper products. A major problem limiting the wider use of mechanical pulp is the sensitivity of lignin-containing pulps to yellowing induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. One of the yellowing inhibitor systems contains an Ultra Violet Absorber (UVA) and a Radical Scavenger (RS). The application of this inhibitor system to paper made of mechanical pulps requires the addition of two components, UVA and RS. To Properly understand the use of a paper yellowing inhibition system; it is important to reveal the effect of adding the inhibitors on the global properties of the resulting coating mixture. We need to optimize the input factors to achieve the longest in time inhibition effect. It is essential to study the rheological properties of the resulting system and the effects provoked by each of the ingredients. Studying the microstructure of the materials sheds more light on the interaction of the additional components with the original formulation. The coating formulation and the inhibition ingredients undergo mixing and transport processes. A study of the effect of pre-shear adds {{to the understanding of the}} system. Numerical simulation of 3 D hydrodynamics with non-Newtonian rheology in the vicinity of the coating head creates a powerful tool for investigation of the coating system under these conditions. Among the operating parameters, the total concentration of inhibitors or total charge proved to have the largest effect of brightness stability or longer in time yellowing inhibition. The rheology of RS is Newtonian. The Ultra-violet absorber (tin 1130) is an extremely viscous shear-thinning thixotropic material. Water-retention studies show that inhibitors increase water loss, with more water penetrating the paper web. Zeta potential measurements revealed the repulsive forces between pigment and inhibitor particles. RS adsorbs on ground calcium carbonate GCC and disrupts interactions between kaolinite particles. UVA adsorbs on particles of kaolinite and GCC. The inhibitors increase the viscosity, thixotropy, and elasticity of the original coating formulation. A study of pre-shear reveals decrease in viscosity, while inhibitors concentration under pre-shear increases viscosity and elasticity.

Reversal with a single layer Barkhausen pulse has been observed in a thin film structure 1 mm by 50 mm by 0. 65 mu m. Closure domains have been clearly identified at the film ends. The threshold for the reversal is the coercive force. The reason for reversal with a single Barkhausen jump is that the long narrow film geometry has essentially zero demagnetizing field {{over most of the}} film.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in thin transparent oxide layers as permeation barriers for packaging applications. Nevertheless, these products are entering high volume industrial production only slowly. One main barrier to the broad introduction of thin oxide layers are the high investment costs for a new production plant. A possible way to promote the commercialization of aluminum oxide layers is to modify already existing roll coaters. This concept leads to three technological tasks: (a) reactive evaporation of aluminum from boat evaporators at high deposition rates; (b) process control for quality assurance of alumina coatings; (c) plasma-activated deposition at high deposition rates and large web width.

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} account of an {{extensive}} experimental investigation of the operation of a twin <b>roll</b> <b>coater.</b> Two distinct modes of operation are identified: Classical (fullyflooded inlet) and Meniscus (ultra-starved inlet). The former {{has been the subject}} of investigation for a number of years; the latter is less well known and would appear to have escaped the attention of the Coating Community at large prior to the research work reported here being carried out. A detailed description of how the key features of an industrial <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> can be reproduced using a piece of simple but well designed experimental apparatus, which encapsulates all the necessary elements for an in-depth study of the flow, is presented. Various methods are used to visualise the flow. These include dye injection and novel computerised particle tracking techniques, coupled with state-of-the-art image processing and High Speed Video photography. Experiments reveal that the flow associated with the Classical mode of operation is essentially one-dimensional throughout the nip; Meniscus coating flow, on the other hand, is uniquely two-dimensional, containing large vortical structures. Also the pressure distributions are found to be quite distinct. A fully-flooded nip results in a pressure profile which exhibits a characteristic maximum and minimum, while an ultra-starved nip produces one which is linear and entirely sub-ambient. The transformation of the flow from one mode of operation to the other is then considered, a key feature of which is the behaviour of the upstream free surface which movesin to a minimum point and then out again as the flux is reduced, giving a non-singular result, that is, there are two non-dimensional values of the flux for each free surface position. Finally, the subject of instability in roll coating is addressed, for both the Classical and Meniscus regimes. A number of new instabilities were observed using High Speed Video photography and tentative explanations for their occurrence are given...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with developing suitable models for the investigation of instabilities in rigid and deformable roll coating flows. Consideration is restricted to Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertia. In each coating flow analysed the steady two dimensional base state solutions of the system axe explored before the stability of the system is considered. The particular rigid roll coating flow that is studied in this thesis is the flow formed between an intermediate pair of contra-rotating rolls within a multiple <b>roll</b> <b>coater.</b> The base state is modelled using lubrication theory and the flow domain is terminated with simple boundary conditions. It is found that the form of the meniscus location solutions differ from those found in similax flows by previous workers and this motivates a detailed re-examination of the boundaxy conditions. A matched asymptotic analysis applicable for small capillaxy numbers Ca and small inter-roll gaps gives the leading order correction to the boundary conditions and it is found that the inclusion of the correction terms alter the results significantly. It is found that a critical roll speed ratio, Sc exists beyond which no steady two dimensional solutions exist. A simple stability hypothesis predicts the upstream meniscus to be neutrally stable at Sc and this point is associated with bead break. Under certain operating conditions the stability hypothesis predicts multiple steady states. The lineax stability of this multiple roll coating flow is investigated. Special attention is given to the relationship between the wavelength of the disturbance and the form of the boundary conditions. The main predictions of the stability hypothesis axe confirmed and an additional ribbing instability on the downstream meniscus is predicted. The base flow of a deformable <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> is investigated using lubrication theory for the fluid and a linear elastic plain strain model for the compliant layer. The boundary conditions developed for the multiple roll problem are extended to higher values of Ca. A finite element method is developed to numerically solve the governing equations. The effects of Youngs modulus E and layer thickness L on the steady state operation of the coater are investigated. Previous workers have used spring models to describe the compliant layer with the implicit assumption that E and L- 1 have the same affect. Here it is shown that E and L- 1 have a different effect upon the meniscus location in the negative gap regime and hence the underlying assumption of all spring models is shown to be incorrect. The plain strain model is extended to include viscoelastic terms and it is shown that these terms can account for the discrepancy between experimental results and previous steady state elastic theories. The lineax stability of the deformable <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> is investigated with the plain strain model being extended to account for lateral disturbances. The effect of E and L- 1 on the stability of the system is investigated and it is found that in keeping with the steady state results, they have a different effect on the stability of the system in the negative gap regime. It is demonstrated that perturbations to the compliant layer play a negligible role in the stability analysis and it is shown how the viscoelastic extension to the base state can be incorporated...|$|E

It represents the first such predictive model of its kind, with particular interest placed on the nature of both the pressure distribution and web-to-roll gap profile spanning the coating bead. The effect of key operating parameters, web-to-roll speed ratio, web-tension, wrap-angle, capillary number and cell-geometry, on the degree of fluid pickout from gravure cells and the coated film thickness is explored.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} that high performance solar reflective material can be produced in a roll format using vacuum deposition techniques. The material consists of a multilayer thin film stack on a substrate. The essential feature of the film stack is an alumina film several microns thick deposited over a silver film. The alumina film is deposited under high vacuum using a physical vapor deposition technique called ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD). The alumina film is optically transparent, scratch resistant, and durable. Its purpose {{is to protect the}} silver film and maintain high optical reflectance. Work on this reflective material began five years ago. Samples were produced on polyester substrates by batch coating. Those samples showed excellent durability in accelerated testing at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden Colorado. The principal limitation to commercialization of the process was a low alumina deposition rate. Over the past three years the alumina deposition rate has been increased from 1 nm/s to 20 nm/s. The next step is to produce material in a roll format. A <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> has been built to process 30. 48 -cm wide rolls of solar reflective material.

This is a huge and sophisticated detector for high energy species created by the particle collisions under test. The conversion of the particle energy into Cherenkov radiation is one of the effects used for measurements. The light impulses are measured by a system of photodetectors. It is necessary to provide the light signals to these detectors with low losses. Therefore crystals and light guides are enveloped with flexible material of high reflectivity. It was the task of FEP to provide this material. The most challenging part of was the coating of the polymer film. Polyethylenterephtalate (PET) was used as the substrate material for the layer stack. The film was coated with an adhesion promoting layer and aluminium. But the reflectivity of the metal would not have been high enough for the requirements of CERN. Therefore a four layer stack consisting of silica and niobia as materials with low and high refractive index, respectively, was applied on top of the aluminium layer.

40|$|In multiple-roll coaters thin liquid {{films are}} {{transferred}} from roll to roll {{by means of}} liquid âbeadsâ which occupy the small gaps between adjacent rolls. Double-Film-Fed (DFF) beads are those which feature two ingoing films {{instead of the usual}} one, and arise in the intermediate stages of certain types of <b>roll</b> <b>coater.</b> One of the ingoing films, h 1, is supplied from the previous inter-roll gap while the other, h 2, âreturnsâ from the subsequent gap. Such a flow is investigated here under the conditions of low flow rate, small capillary number and negligible gravity and inertia, using lubrication theory and finite element analysis. The thickness of film h 1 is fixed independently, while that of h 2 is specified as a fraction, [zeta], of the film output on the same roll. This simple approach allows a degree of feedback between the output and input of the bead, and enables one to simulate different conditions in the subsequent gap. Predictions of outgoing film thicknesses made using the two models agree extremely well and show that, for each value of [zeta] < 1, one outgoing film thickness decreases monotonically with speed ratio, S, while the other features a maximum. Good agreement is also seen in the pressure profiles, which are entirely sub-ambient in keeping with the small capillary number conditions. The finite element solutions reveal that in the âzero-fluxâ case (when [zeta] = 1) the flow structures are very similar to those seen in an idealized cavity problem. In the more general ([zeta] < 1) situation, as in single-film-fed meniscus roll coating, several liquid transfer-jets occur by which liquid is conveyed through the bead from one roll to the other. The lubrication model is used to calculate several critical flow rates at which the flow is transformed, and it is shown that when the total dimensionless flow rate through the bead exceeds 1 / 3, the downstream flow structure is independent of the relative sizes of the ingoing films...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the growth, the {{electrical}} and optical properties of thin silver films. The films are deposited on a PET web in a <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> by magnetron sputtering. In particular {{the influence of the}} process parameters on the film properties is analyzed. The film growth is analysed by SEM and AFM. The percolation threshold as well as the transition from islands to a closed film depend on the sputtering pressure and on the power density fed into the sputtering system. Also the duty cycle influences the layer properties. The influence of the process parameters on the film growth of Ag films on PET is explained by considering the energy transfer into the growing film and the resulting influence on the surface diffusion of the Ag adatoms. The refractive index of Ag films on PET is calculated with the help of transmission and reflection spectra in the visible and near infrared spectral region. For closed films the refractive index does not depend on the process parameters, whereas for Ag islands a pronounced dependence on the film thickness occurs. In this thesis the refractive index for non closed Ag films on PET and its dependence on the film thickness in the visible and near infrared spectral region is calculated for the first time. The dependence of the conductivity on the film thickness is described in the framework of the model from Mayadas and Shatzkes. With the help of this model, the influence of the scattering of electrons at grain boundaries and at the outer surfaces of the film is described. The conductivity of Ag films and its dependence on the film thickness for different process parameters is analyzed. The results correlate with the optical measurements and can also be explained by surface diffusion. For the first time the dependence of conductivity and absorption of Ag films on base layers of TiO 2 and ZnO is analyzed. It is pointed out that the surface roughness of the base layer has only a minor influence on the film growth. A major influence {{can be attributed to the}} process parameters for the deposition of the base layer. Especially non closed TiO 2 films, grown with a surplus of oxygen in the process gas, lead to a reduced conductivity of the Ag film grown on top of the TiO 2.

40|$|Tape and disc {{media have}} their own {{specific}} fields of application in magnetic, magneto-optic and optical recording. Tape media are commonly used where a large storage capacity is needed. To meet the increasing demands for larger storage capacities industry has investigated the possibility to use the method of vacuum evaporation {{for the production of}} magnetic recording tape. This has resulted in a commercial product called Metal Evaporated tape. In ME-tape production one takes advantage of the special properties of magnetic films evaporated under oblique vapour incidence, a method which has been discovered in 1959 in laboratory experiments. The difference however between industrial production of ME-tape and laboratory scale evaporation of thin film is extreme. The results obtained in the 35 years of experiments with oblique evaporation cannot be used unconditionally for the industrial production of ME-tape. Therefore the necessity for a model relating process conditions to structural and magnetic film properties is evident. In this thesis such a model is constructed using theoretical and experimental results already published in literature, combined with new theory and experiments. A number of experiments with Co 80 Ni 20 evaporated at high angles of incidence are presented, including the first results on experiments with small-scale ME-tape production. In chapter 2 the relation between process conditions and film structure is discussed. The special structure of obliquely evaporated films has its origin in shadowing phenomena during film growth. Because of shadowing the film consists of bundles of inclined columns, the bundles being aligned perpendicularly to the vapour incidence direction. The column inclination angle lies in-between the film normal and the vapour incidence direction. Different models found in literature relating process parameters and film structure are discussed. It is shown that surface diffusion plays an important role, especially the difference between random and directional surface diffusion. The latter is induced by the oblique evaporation process. An attempt is made to give a quantitative expression for the relation between process conditions and surface diffusion including the influence of substrate temperature, rate and contamination with residual gasses. Using the models found in literature and adding the new calculations the relation between surface diffusion and film structure is discussed in detail and compared with measurements found in literature. In chapter 3 the relation between film structure and magnetic properties of obliquely evaporated magnetic thin films is treated. The tilted columnar structure results in a magnetic shape anisotropy. Two methods to calculate the shape anisotropy are compared, one is especially developed for this purpose. Next to the columnar structure also the anisotropic texture orientation and stress distribution contribute to the magnetic anisotropy. All these effects lead to an easy axis of magnetisation tilted out of the film plane. To determine the magnetic anisotropy in such films a measurement method using a torque-magnetometer is presented, leading to a general formulation of the anisotropy energy in arbitrary systems. The magnetic reversal is strongly affected by the magnetic anisotropy and the exchange between spins in adjacent columns. In films where the exchange is continuous throughout the film the tilted easy axis leads to specific magnetic domain structures which are only found in obliquely evaporated magnetic films. With increasing columnar separation the magnetic reversal turns to a mechanism of rotation of magnetisation in magnetically isolated particles, accompanied by a strong increase in coercivity. Furthermore the tilted easy axis causes a dependence of the recording properties on the tape running direction. In chapter 4 and 5 several experiments performed in the CNRS and MESA laboratories are discussed. Where possible a relation with the theory of chapter 2 and 3 is given. For each evaporation set-up used an estimate of the run-to-run reproducibility is made. It is concluded that the run-to-run scatter is mainly caused by small variations in the angle of incidence. This could be prevented by using an improved substrate holder. It is shown that the structural and magnetic properties of obliquely evaporated Co 80 Ni 20 films depend on layer thickness up to a thickness of about 150 nm. Above this thickness the film properties remain constant. It was concluded that the difference is not caused by the change in substrate temperature during evaporation but by the film growth process itself. In preparation of the tape deposition set-up the rate of evaporation had to be increased. Therefore a short investigation on the effect of increase in evaporation on films prepared on Si substrates has been performed. An increase in rate from 0. 5 to 20 nms- 1 resulted in an increase in coercivity and anisotropy of the film. Since the columnar inclination and the apparent saturation magnetisation remain almost constant, it was concluded that the changes are mainly caused by an increase in crystal anisotropy. The influence of stress however should not be excluded. The observed change in film properties with increasing evaporation rate might be caused by the expected decrease in contamination with H 2 O molecules. To enable recording experiments, Co 80 Ni 20 is evaporated on tape by the method of continuously varying angle of vapour incidence. For this a special "mini roll coater" was constructed which resembles the much larger roll-coaters used in industry for the production of ME-tape. This mini <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> is used to study the effect of addition of oxygen on the film structure and its magnetic and recording properties. The recording performance of the tape prepared with this mini-roll coater are still bad in comparison with commercially available ME tape. The aim of the experiment however is not to produce commercial tape but to investigate the relation between process conditions, film structure, magnetic and recording properties. From this perspective the first results are encouraging...|$|E
40|$|After having {{introduced}} {{some aspects}} of tape recording in chapter one, chapter two deals with the magnetron sputtering process itself. The kinetic energy of the electrons which are bound to the groove region by the combined action of the B and E field, was calculated. It was found that for a magnetic target, the calculated kinetic energies are clearly too low {{to be able to}} ionise the argon gas. Since this is in contradiction with reality, it was inferred on a collective movement of the electrons, instead of the particle behaviour which was assumed in the calculation of the drift speed. This should then be accompanied by an increase in drift speed. After having established the current that is associated with the groove electrons, also the local argon gas temperature {{just in front of the}} cathode was measured to be around 330 K. Furthermore it was concluded that the collision probability of an sputtered atom with the neutral argon gas is mainly dependent upon the argon pressure. Collision with either argon ions or electrons in the plasma are much less frequent or have little effect. Finally, from a TRIM simulation, it turned out that atoms which are ejected under a larger angle with respect to the normal on the target, generally carry more energy but'are less frequent in number compared to atoms which are ejected under low angles of incidence. Furthermore it was found that the spread in energy was also larger in the case of high scattering angles. In chapter 3, the oblique growth of sputter deposited films was briefly- discussed. In contrast to evaporation, with sputtering there are even more complicating factors affecting the film growth. On average, the argon atoms are impinging on the growing film a factor of 10. 000 times more than the atoms which contribute to the growing film do. Furthermore the presence of high energy neutrals is also affecting film growth. Moreover the energy and angular distributions in the case of sputtering are not as readily calculated compared to the case of evaporation. In order to find some relief, a commercial simulation tool was purchased. Although some trends can be found, the complex interaction of all the quantities affecting the oblique growth and thus the columnar inclination angle is still far from understood. After having introduced the measurement and analysis equipment in chapter 4, chapter 5 deals with obliquely evaporated tape. Here several experimental tapes are compared with respect to microstructure, magnetic and recording properties to a commercial Hi 8 ME tape. It was concluded that although experimental ME tapes can be deposited with varying parameters, it does not seem to be possible to deposit an experimental tape which incorporates all the macroscopic properties like Hi 8 ME tape. It is however not a priori clear that such a tape could not be deposited with the mini <b>roll</b> <b>coater</b> set-up, but it seems to be highly dependent on the way in which the oxygen is supplied. Although a similar morphology is obtained, the crystal sizes in the experimental tapes are larger compared to the Hi 8 ME one. In all tapes it was found that the non- ferromagnetic oxide grains are anti-ferromagnetically coupled to the ferromagnetic Co-Ni grains. From the microstructural analysis two models could be deduced where the model with the oxide shells around the grains seems to fit best to the other measurements (see section discussion of chapter 5). Furthermore if the oxidation process is diffusion limited, then a much more plausible explanation is found as to why the oxygen incorporation process seems so inefficient with reference to sections 5. 3. 4. 2 and 5. 3. 4. 4. From pressure and impingement considerations it is concluded that the initial columnar inclination angle can indeed be affected by the oxygen. Furthermore, the Co atoms seem to scatter a lot by the oxygen on the inlet side (600 in our case). Furthermore it was concluded that a large difference in oxygen exposure and lower drum temperature might account for the more uniform and thinner oxide shells around the ferromagnetic grains in the case of the Hi 8 ME sample. Finally in chapter 6, the oblique sputtering process is discussed. The first part of the chapter deals with sputtering under fixed angles of incidence and the influence of some principle deposition parameters is studied. The influence of the effective angle of the substrate with the target, target,materials, argon pressure and input power is analysed with respect to the microstructure. It was found that the geometry in combination with the argon pressure play a vital role in the subsequent microstructure. The magnetic properties of samples prepared using a different geometry and argon pressure, could to some extend be explained from the observed microstructures. The dependence upon the input power is less clear. Furthermore it was shown that none of the analysed samples showed a pronounced texturing and in most cases the direction of the oblique magnetic anisotropy was found to coincide with the columnar inclination angle. The one exception was found for the case when high argon pressures were employed. Furthermore it seems that the main anisotropy source is found in the shape anisotropy of the columns. In tbe second part of the cbapter, some preliminary results on sputtered tape were presented. It was sbown tbat a tape witb reasonable recording properties could be deposited in a reproducible way. Tbe output versus frequency cbaracteristic was found equal to a commercial MP-pro tape. It was found tbat the wear properties of the sputtered tape were mucb better compared to the experimental evaporated tapes, since even noise aDd overwrite measurements could be performed. Moreover aD oblique morpbology was determined by cross sectional TEM, whicb could already be deduced from tbe good aDd bad recording direction. Finally from the preliminary microstructural cbaracterisation of tbe sputtered tape, some similarities witb a sample deposited under a fixed aDgle were observed. This bas also been compared witb the commercial Hi 8 ME tape of cbapter 5...|$|E
