5|$|The {{finite element}} method is an {{important}} numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions, where the pieces are chosen with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new concept of -strong conver-gence with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Orlicz function and examine some properties of the resulting sequence spaces.

40|$|AbstractWe {{prove that}} the {{category}} of modules cofinite with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ideal of dimension one in a noetherian ring is a full abelian subcategory of the category of modules. The proof {{is based on a}} criterion for cofiniteness with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ideal of dimension one. Namely for such ideals it suffices that the two first Ext-modules in the definition for cofiniteness are finitely generated. This criterion is also used to prove very simply that all local cohomology modules of a finitely generated module with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ideal of dimension one in an arbitrary noetherian ring are cofinite with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the ideal...|$|R

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may {{be allowed to go}} forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
