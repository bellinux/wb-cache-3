For half a year from March 1923 he worked on the final scroll; over eighty metres of silk were used in the process. The final forty metre scroll was first displayed at the tenth Inten exhibition, which opened on 1 September 1923. Just hours later the exhibition closed due to the Great Kantō earthquake, which struck at 11:58. The artist is said to have recovered the scroll himself. Several months later the painting went on display in Kyōto. Acclaimed a masterpiece, it has been frequently exhibited and studied ever since and a full-size facsimile edition has been published.

60|$|One {{thing is}} certain. The leper in the Settlement {{is far better}} off than the leper who lies in hiding outside. Such a leper is a lonely outcast, living in {{constant}} fear of discovery and slowly and surely rotting away. The action of leprosy is not steady. It lays hold of its victim, commits a ravage, and then lies dormant for an indeterminate period. It may not commit another ravage for five years, or ten years, or forty years, and the patient may enjoy uninterrupted good health. Rarely, however, do these first ravages cease of themselves. The skilled surgeon is required, and the skilled surgeon cannot be called in for the leper who is in hiding. For instance, the first ravage may {{take the form of}} a perforating ulcer in the sole of the foot. When the bone is reached, necrosis sets in. If the leper is in hiding, he cannot be operated upon, the necrosis will continue to eat its way up the bone of the leg, and in a brief and horrible time that leper will die of gangrene or some other terrible complication. On the other hand, if that same leper is in Molokai, the surgeon will operate upon the foot, remove the ulcer, cleanse the bone, and put a complete stop to that particular ravage of the disease. A month after the operation the leper will be out riding horseback, <b>running</b> <b>foot</b> races, swimming in the breakers, or climbing the giddy sides of the valleys for mountain apples. And as has been stated before, the disease, lying dormant, may not again attack him for five, ten, or forty years.|$|E

Inherent flame resistance means the flame retardant characteristics will not fade with washing. Booths require two different sizes of drape: 8’ long drape which hangs between 8’ high uprights and 3’ long drape which hangs between 3’ uprights and the 3’ slot on 8’ uprights.|$|E

The project was, for the time, a vast undertaking, verging on folly according to many critics. Construction of the tunnel was accompanied by very considerable loss of life and escalation of cost, arising out of the novelty of the endeavour and the most insurmountable difficulties which presented themselves. Favre bore the brunt of continued criticism, including that deflected on to him by the board of the St. Gothard Company. In spite of this, the cost of the tunnel per <b>running</b> <b>foot</b> was a third less than that of the great Mont Cenis Tunnel.|$|E

In his Journal of the Siege of Gibraltar, Captain John Spilsbury recorded: [...] "Ince's gallery has 10 embrasures and an air hole cut, and is about 600 and odd feet long; the 9th chamber or cave is large enough for a guard room, has 2 doors, and is tolerably dry."

5000|$|... 1. Temporary {{short term}} housing should be {{destroyed}} {{at the end}} of the emergency period. This was viewed as far more appropriate than attempting to plan for the long term in the midst of a crisis. Senator Kilburn stated that, [...] "It is my contention that they (defense workers) are taking advantage of the situation to feather their own nests."2. The defense housing problem could more efficiently be handled through the private market. The mutual housing program just competes with, and hurts the private developers. Senator Bell asked: [...] "I am just wondering...if people earning between $160 and $200 a month or less regularly and are permanently employed, (could have their housing needs) handled through channels of private industry? Aren't there plenty of builders and finance available for construction of homes of that character?" [...] The New Jersey Realtors' Board President wrote an editorial published in local newspapers stating, [...] " [...].The USHA no longer can attempt to justify subsidized, socialized housing... with defense activity providing new employment at good wages, and financiers alert to the rising home market, there can be no justification for another such (mutual housing) project in New Jersey."3. The residents of a mutual ownership project will simply leave the project {{at the end of}} the emergency, taking their equity with them, and selling the whole project to speculators. Senator Kirman asked a resident of one of the projects [...] "...don't you think you will take the whole thing and hock it off to the highest bidder? Every one of the emergencies in the past shows that this has been done."4. The mutual housing program is good for city dwellers, but provides no solution for the severe housing needs of rural farmers who were also working for the defense program, but often living in squalid surroundings.5. The federal government should not have to assume the risk for housing its citizens. According to Senator Johnson, [...] "The thing that alarms me is the philosophy which the entire country seems to be adopting, that if the risk is not good, let the government take it. That is nothing more than a refinement of the old thought that the world owes you a living."6. There are many hidden costs in a mutual housing project - especially related to the public works being provided by the Federal Works Administration (FWA) - which make each unit far more expensive than indicated, and far in excess of the maximum allowable dollar amount specified by the Lanham Act.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to inform therapists of the distinctions among various prosthetic devices, including their advantages and disadvantages. All foot-ankle prosthetic components support the wearer, absorb shock, and simulate toe extension passively. Articulated assemblies, such as the single-axis and multiple-axis feet, plantar flex easily after heel-strike; however, they have an unattractive gap at the ankle.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{measuring}} kinematics of elastic body {{is the subject}} of this investigation. Unlike kinematics of rigid body large elastic deformation tends to modify the dynamics of motion. In the case of amputee runner the change in kinematics of the foot depends on the stiffness, body mass and running beat frequency. Current measurement techniques, such as gait analysis assumes rigid elements. Currently there are inertia measurement unit (IMU) based systems that uses accelerometers and gyro to determine acceleration, velocities and orientations of the sensors. They are not capable of measuring changes in lengths or positions of the objects that they are attached to. For that reason predicting velocities and displacement by integrating acceleration is not always viable due to time step limits of the integrations that are necessary. Here a new optical device is developed and presented that is accurate and is practically error free to monitor Foot elastic deformation. In this paper the Dynamic elastic response of Ossur <b>Running</b> <b>foot</b> is being investigated using this device. The data generated show complete phase synchronisation with IMU but much better accuracy in terms of velocity and relative displacement of the feet due to flexure as a result of elastic response to Impulse...|$|E

There exists some evidence that cardiovascular function may be impaired following extreme prolonged exercise, but at present, only cardiac function has been specifically examined following exposure to this nature of exercise. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the acute effects of participation in an ultra-marathon on resting systemic arterial compliance. Arterial compliance and various resting cardiovascular indices were collected at rest from 26 healthy ultra-marathon competitors using applanation tonometry (HDI CR- 2000) before and after participation in a mountain trail <b>running</b> <b>foot</b> race ranging from 120 - 195 km which required between 20 - 40 continuous hours (31. 2 ± 6. 8 h) to complete.

In recent years {{there has been}} an increase in participation in timed running events. With this increase, the motivation for individuals to run their best has motivated the running shoe industry to make design changes to traditional <b>running</b> <b>foot</b> wear in an effort to improve running economy (RE) and decrease running times. One such design change has been to incorporate mechanical springs (MS) into the midsole of the running shoe. Evaluation of this technology has yet to be performed. This study recruited 17 runners (12 male) and had them run at a submaximal steady state speed for 2 bouts of five minutes at a speed of 3. 13 m·sec- 1. The order of shoe condition was randomly assigned and the subjects ran one interval in their own running shoe (OS) and one interval in MS shoes. Metabolic data and heart rate data were averaged over the last three of the five minute efforts. No significant difference was found between MS and OS with regards to shoe weight. Running in MS resulted in lower, non-significant values for steady state ventilation and steady state heart rate.
