5|$|As per the census, Zambia {{recorded}} a Total fertility rate (TFR), {{defined as the}} fertility rate of a woman throughout her life, of 5.9, with 7.0 in rural and 4.6 in urban areas. The most urbanized provinces, with higher socio-economic index like Lusaka {{recorded a}} lower TFR. Crude birth rate (CBR), the number of live births for each 1,000 births, stood at 35 in Zambia, with the Northern Province recording a maximum of 41. Child-woman ratio (CWR), the ratio of children aged 0–4 against women aged 15–49, was 738 children per thousand women and it was maximum in Northern province, where it was 880. The General fertility rate (GFR), the number of births per 1,000 child bearing women, was 147 as per the census. The Completed family Size (CF) was 6.4 in rural areas and 5.4 in urban areas. Gross <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate</b> (GRR), {{the average number of}} females births a women would have between ages 15–49, was 2.3, while the Net <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate</b> (NRR), the number of surviving female births a women would have between ages 15–49, stood at 2.1.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate</b> of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E

5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate,</b> and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, {{in the same way that}} African elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E
5|$|Mengele used Auschwitz as an {{opportunity}} to continue his anthropological studies and research on heredity, using inmates for human experimentation. The experiments had no regard for the health, safety, or physical and emotional suffering of the victims. He was particularly interested in identical twins, people with heterochromia iridum (eyes of two different colours), dwarfs, and people with physical abnormalities. A grant was provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, applied for by von Verschuer, who received regular reports and shipments of specimens from Mengele. The grant was used to build a pathology laboratory attached to Crematorium II at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli, a Hungarian Jewish pathologist who arrived in Auschwitz on 29 May 1944, performed dissections and prepared specimens for shipment in this laboratory. Mengele's twin research was in part intended to prove the supremacy of heredity over environment and thus bolster the Nazi premise of the superiority of the Aryan race. Nyiszli and others report that the twins studies may also have been motivated by a desire to improve the <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate</b> of the German race by improving the chances of racially desirable people having twins.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate.</b> Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{say that}} natural {{selection}} has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, {{in much the}} same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating. For male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate,</b> sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate,</b> sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.|$|E

40|$|Scyphistomae show {{different}} modes of propagation, occasionally allowing the sudden release of great numbers of medusae through strobilation leading to so-called jellyfish blooms. Accordingly, factors regulating asexual reproduction strategies will control scyphistoma density, which, in turn, may influence blooming potential. We studied 11 scyphistoma species in 6 combinations of temperature and food supply {{to test the}} effects of these factors on asexual reproduction strategies and <b>reproduction</b> <b>rates.</b> Temperature and food availability increased <b>reproduction</b> <b>rates</b> for all species and observed reproduction modes. In all cases, starvation was the most important factor constraining the asexual reproduction of scyphistomae. Differences in scyphistoma density were found according to the reproductive strategy adopted by each species. Different Aurelia lineages and Sanderia malayensis presented a multi-mode strategy, developing up to 5 propagation modes. These species reached the highest densities, mostly through lateral budding and stolons. Cassiopea sp., Cephea cephea, Mastigias papua and Phyllorhiza punctata adopted a mono-mode reproductive strategy, developing only free-swimming buds. Lychnorhiza lucerna, Rhizostoma pulmo and Rhopilema esculentum also presented a mono-mode strategy, but they only developed podocysts. These 3 species had the lowest <b>reproduction</b> <b>rates</b> and polyp densities; not only their <b>reproduction</b> <b>rates</b> but also the need for a 2 -fold set of environmental stimuli to produce new polyps (one for encystment, another for excystment) made this reproduction mode the slowest of those observed to be utilized for propagation. We conclude that blooms may be defined phylogenetically by the specific asexual modes each species develops, which, in turn, is regulated by environmental conditions.

500|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{there appear}} to be two {{distinct}} subspecies, B. m. intermedia, the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, B. m. brevicauda, found in Indian Ocean waters.

Estimates from a 1996 survey show that 424 pygmy blue whales were in a small area south of Madagascar (the Madagascar Plateau) alone, thus it is likely that numbers in the entire Indian Ocean are in the thousands.

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this bat is in so much danger is its slow <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate.</b> The Eastern small-footed bat usually has only one {{offspring}} a year, although a few instances of twins have been noted. Mating most often occurs in autumn and the female stores the male’s sperm throughout hibernation in the winter. Fertilization occurs in the spring once the females are active again, and gestation occurs between 50–60 days with young being born in late May and early June. Mating has also been noted to occur throughout the hibernation period if individuals awake. [...] During the time of breeding large number of bats {{come together in a}} behavior commonly known as “swarming.” All bats of this species are polyandrous, meaning they mate with multiple partners throughout the mating period. This mating behavior allows them to increase the likelihood of copulation, and therefore increase their reproductive success.|$|E
