Poor vocabulary in the upper grade of school (junior and senior high school) comes from the elementary school. If they failed learning in vocabulary in the elementary school it can also influence their mastery of vocabulary in the future. The writer chooses <b>playing</b> <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> since it emphasizes memorization. Generally, students should memorize the material {{they are going to have}} on a test, but through this <b>technique</b> they can <b>play</b> and directly can memorize the vocabulary of the dialogue of the <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> This is a quasi experimental study emphasizing the treatment of two groups and posttest design. This study has an objective to find out whether there is a significant difference between the vocabulary achievement of the students who are taught through <b>playing</b> <b>role</b> <b>play</b> and those who are taught using drilling wordlist. The other objective, that is important alike, is to decide which technique can give better vocabulary achievement. The subject of this experimental study is the fifth year students of academic year of 1998 / 1999. The subject is divided into two groups. The first group is an experimental group which is taught <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> and the second group is a control group which is taught using drilling wordlist method. All the groups are given the same posttest as the research instrument in order to collect the data. Then, the data are analyzed using t-test since the writer wants to compare two means test of the experimental group (<b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique)</b> and the control group (drilling wordlist technique) to see whether there is a significantly different effect or not. The finding of the study shows that the mean of the experimental group that was taught through <b>playing</b> <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> is higher than the control group that was taught using drilling wordlist method. In Posttest I, the mean of the experimental• group is 7. 857, while the mean of the control group is 7. 428. In Posttest II, the mean of the experimental group is 7. 845, while the mean of the control group is 7. 202. Then the two means are combined and the result for the experimental group is 7. 851, while the control group is 7. 315. It is proved that the <b>playing</b> <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> can give better vocabulary achievement. The finding of the study shows that teaching English, in this case is vocabulary, through <b>playing</b> <b>role</b> <b>play</b> is successful. However, the first posttest showed that there is no significant effect because the children never got such a technique before. Consequently, their test was not as good as expected. The second posttest showed that there is a significant effect. Then, the two posttests are combined and the result showed that this study has a significant effect. In Posttest I, t-observation is 1. 4312 whereas t(0. 05) = 1. 671. In Posttest II. t-observation is 2. 1907 whereas t(0. 05) = 1. 671 and t-observation between Posttest I and II is 2. 333 whereas t(0. 05) = 1. 671. Based on the finding of the study, it can be concluded that there is a significant difference between the vocabulary achievement of the students who are taught through <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> and those who are taught using drilling wordlist technique. Based on the finding of the study, the writer wants to give suggestion to English elementary school teachers to consider using the <b>technique</b> of <b>role</b> <b>play</b> in teaching vocabulary...|$|R

40|$|Many {{learners}} still {{assume that}} learning English is very difficult, particularly {{to master the}} speaking skill. In general, students are having a problem to speak fluently. The difficulty was also confronted by the students whom the writer observed. The students did not know and looked confused on how to respond in English when they were asked something in the English. They also did not have self-confidence to speak in the English. These factors may have affected their speaking fluency ability. This was proven by their ability while doing the dialogue practice. To encourage them to speak fluently, the writer applied two interesting and active speaking <b>techniques,</b> <b>Role</b> <b>Play</b> and Dialogue. Those techniques were believed to make {{the teaching and learning}} process alive and to avoid boredom in the classroom. Moreover, <b>role</b> <b>play</b> and dialogue can be used to improve the students' speaking fluency. Although both techniques are theoretically believed to be able to foster the students' speaking fluency, empirically the writer has been interested in finding out which technique can better help the students improve their speaking fluency. Therefore, this study was aimed at finding out whether {{there was a significant difference}} between the speaking fluency achievement of the students taught using <b>role</b> <b>play</b> and those taught using dialogue. This is a quasi-experimental study which applied matching-only pretest-posttest control group design. Two classes of the eighth grade students in one of the private junior high schools in Surabaya were randomly selected as the sample of the study. One of the classes was the experimental group and the other one was the control group. The experimental group received the <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> as the treatment, while the control group received the dialogue technique. Before the treatment was given, both groups received pre-test to see whether the two groups had equal ability and after the xii treatment they received post-test. The mean scores of the posttest of both groups were compared using T-test to see the significant difference on students' speaking fluency. The result of the statistical calculation showed that the statistical value oft-test in the posttest result is 8. 568, while the critical value of t - table with significant level of 0. 05 (two-tail) and the degree of freedom 58 is 2. 002. It means that the statistical value oft-test is higher than the critical value oft-table (8. 568 > 2. 002). Since the t-calculation is higher than the t-table, the alternative hypothesis is accepted and null hypothesis is rejected. Thus, there is a significant difference between the students' speaking fluency taught using the <b>Role</b> <b>Play</b> <b>techniques</b> and those taught using the Dialogue technique. It means that the <b>Role</b> <b>Play</b> <b>technique</b> gives better influence on the improvements of the students' speaking fluency than the Dialogue technique. Finally, based on the findings, some suggestions for further studies were given among others (1) the number of students enrolled as the subject of the study be increased, (2) encouraging the students to speak for more than five minutes for each performance and be well-prepared while performing, (3) and further researchers are suggested to apply <b>role</b> <b>play</b> and dialogue <b>technique</b> in higher level/ age groups...|$|R
40|$|Speaking is {{the primary}} skill {{compared}} to other skill, because almost all speakers of a language can orally use the language {{to carry out their}} daily activities and to communicate all events and experiences they are involved in to other speakers. In English Department of Widya Mandala, there are four speaking series that should be taken by the students. In fact, many teachers in the English Department still use simple techniques of teaching speaking, in this case is <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> Many teachers use this way of teaching method because it is practical and its preparation doesn’t take so much time and effort. On contrast, teachers have to use some technique to attract the students and create a lively atmosphere in class by using video which can be interesting for the students. Arcario (1993) emphasizes the important features of video because of its extended context, interesting content, rich visual imagery, and often exaggerated actions and gestures of video (film) that provide students with multi-sensory input that is close to what they would find in real-life communication. This in turn will make the students be more productive in oral communication. For those reasons, the writer made an experiment study that has statement of the problem: "Is there any significant difference on the speaking achievement of English Department students who are taught by means of video and those who are taught by role play?". In conducting the study, the writer compared video and <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique</b> based on communicative approach. Also, for the subject, she made use of students who take Speaking I, because the objective of Speaking I, based on 2006 Curriculum of the English Department, is that students are able to handle daily conversation. Then, there were experimental and control groups for treatments. Moreover, the writer used available mid-term test to equalize students’ speaking ability. Then, there was speaking test to test validity and reliability of the result. After the data obtained were analyzed, the writer found out that there is no significant difference on the speaking achievement of students who are taught using the video and that those who are taught using <b>role</b> <b>play</b> <b>technique.</b> Some possible causes were: (1) The number of treatments, (2) The difficulty in finding relevant videos, (3) The test form, (4) Lack of practice, and (5) Learning factors to support speaking abilities...|$|R
