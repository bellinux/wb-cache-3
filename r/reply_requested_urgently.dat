500|$|Within the Xgrid protocol, {{three types}} of {{messages}} can be passed to other computers on the same cluster: <b>requests,</b> notifications and <b>replies.</b> <b>Requests</b> must be responded to by the recipient with a reply, notifications do not require a reply, and replies are responses to sent messages. They are identified by their name, type (request/notification/reply) and contents. Each message is encapsulated in a BEEP message (BEEP MSG) and is acknowledged on receipt by an empty reply (RPY). [...] Xgrid does not leverage BEEPs message/reply infrastructure. [...] Any received message which requires a response merely generates an independent BEEP message containing the reply. [...] The Xgrid messages are encoded as dictionaries of key/value pairs which are converted to XML before being sent across the BEEP network.|$|R
