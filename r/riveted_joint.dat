Hence, {{it is interesting}} to investigate the failure modes of <b>riveted</b> <b>joints</b> when they are under tensile load. Following previous studies (Chen et al., 2011), in this work, the authors selected three sizes of <b>riveted</b> <b>joints</b> to conduct the riveting and tension processes experimentally and numerically. Three kinds of failure modes including pull through, shank breaking, and head breaking were observed. Simulations are able to give almost the same results as those from experiments. Furthermore, three formulas were proposed to calculate the maximum tensile strength of <b>riveted</b> <b>joints.</b> Though the values calculated from these three formulas are approximate, they have the same order of magnitude as real ones. Moreover, they could be utilized to estimate which kind of failure mode may take place when <b>riveted</b> <b>joints</b> were under tensile load...|$|R

The presence of a wax-based solid surface lubricant {{on the surface of the}} aluminium alloy sheet could delay the onset of fretting damage leading to longer fatigue life. Inserting PTFE tape at the interface between the two riveted sheets led to the reduction and even elimination of fretting damage in a self-piercing <b>riveted</b> <b>joint.</b> However, the presence of PTFE tape at the interface resulted in a significant reduction in the fatigue life and led to a change in the failure mode.

40|$|The {{riveting}} process {{with a solid}} rivet {{is one of the}} most applied joining processes in the aeronautic industry. New materials and new design requirements constitute challenges that drive the users to a better understanding of the installation process of riveted joints. Therefore, this study aims with the aid of FEM simulation to understand the phenomena occurring during the installation process and afterwards to predict the mechanical properties of the <b>riveted</b> <b>joint</b> depending on the installation parameters and characteristics of the adherends. The experimental installation process for the validation of the simulation model takes place in a fully automated C-frame riveting machine with all-electric drilling and riveting operations aptitude and continuous collection of process data. This paper deals with the simulation of the installation process. The simulation model consists of a solid rivet with universal head described by the standard EN 6081 and aluminum (2024 T 351) ad herends. The rivet material model has been obtained by a compression test performed on specimens prepared from fasteners. The effect of friction was studied and a suitable friction coefficient identified. The developed installati onprocess model has been validated by comparing the simulation results with different experiments regarding the geometrical characteristics of the formed rivet head, the force-displacement curves and the surface residual strain of one adherend. Afterwards, the clearance fit between the rivet shank and the borehole, the rivet grip, and the squeeze force have been numerically studied in order to determine their effect on the joint. The effect of these parameters on the <b>riveted</b> <b>joint</b> is evaluated considering the residual stress and the residual contact force. The simulation of plastic deformation and residual stress state caused by the installation process provides a basis for the prediction of the mechanical properties of the <b>riveted</b> <b>joint</b> under external forces which is subject to ongoing research...|$|E

40|$|Since the Aloha Airlines {{accident}} in 1988 damage monitoring has received specific additional attention with aircraft structures. Lap joints either riveted or bonded {{have become a}} matter of focal interest. In parallel the topic of structural health monitoring (SHM) emerged during that time, mainly triggered by upcoming smart structures activities during the late 1980 ies. Since this time a lot of research work has been done in SHM which has allowed the sensitivity of different monitoring techniques to be better understood. However there is currently still no seriously marketable SHM solution to be seen around so far. A major reason for this is possibly the fact that fundamentals in SHM having been elaborated, such as acoustic waves travelling in plates with a hole and/or a crack, are by far not sufficient to be applied for what might be considered to be a simple but real structural component such as a <b>riveted</b> <b>joint.</b> The presentation will start with those fundamentals and will then further move into gradually enhancing structural complexity by limiting the boundaries of a plate, allowing cracks to grow from the holes, filling the holes and finally ending up with a lapped <b>riveted</b> <b>joint.</b> Based on these results SHM-related procedures for reliably monitoring cracks in damage tolerant structures will then be discussed...|$|E

Friction stir welding is a robust process and capable of welding high strength aluminum alloys. Therefore {{it can lead to}} both costs and weight savings.
