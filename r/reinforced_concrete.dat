40|$|Pumice {{has been}} proven as {{substitution}} material aggregate in lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). However due to its characteristic, pumice has the disadvantages of its excessive water absorption during preparation of concrete mixture which may reduce concrete strength. Therefore in order to eliminate this additional water absorption, this study investigate the effect of coated pumice in concrete mixture to the beam flexural strength and stiffness. This study performed flexural strength test on three types of sample: 1) normal <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> beam, 2) <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> beam with uncoated pumice and 3) <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> beam with coated pumice. The result showed that the lightest weight concrete occurred on the coated pumice specimen, with the reduction of water absorption was 4 % compared to the uncoated pumice specimen. The stiffness of the reinforce beam with coated pumice was lower compared to the uncoated ones, {{this was due to}} the reduction of adhesion action between cement and aggregates. However, the use of coated pumice increased the flexural strength compare to the uncoated ones with 2. 58 %...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} <b>reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> walls. After performing a standard temperature rising fire-resistance test, the fire resistance performance and mechanic behavior of the wall sample are studied under a lateral horizontal load. <b>Reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> walls and <b>reinforced</b> normalweight <b>concrete</b> walls are given the fire-resistance test under the same conditions, then their fire resistance performance and mechanical behaviors are compared. Taking into consideration the steel spacing, aggregate type, wall size, and high temperature as the wall sample variables. The research {{results showed that the}} <b>reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> wall is superior to the <b>reinforced</b> normalweight <b>concrete</b> wall on ultimate load, yield load, cracked load, stiffness, ductility, and inter-story drift after a high-temperature fire-resistance test. In terms of failure patterns, for a <b>reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> wall after a high-temperature fire-resistance test, the smaller the steel spacing the higher the yield load and ultimate load, but the worse the ductility. This result matched the results of the <b>reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> wall without the high-temperature fire-resistance test and revealed that the <b>reinforced</b> lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> wall retained its mechanics after the fire-resistance test.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the runway must me {{good enough to make}} sure that the extreme pressure made by the aircraft when it is going to land, taxi, take-off, and the blast produce by the jet engine did not harm the runway. Steel <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> and flexible bitumen with polymer modified binder are among the materials that normally used in runway construction. Both of these materials have its own unique characteristics in term of effectiveness, maintenance record, and life span. Therefore, this study is aim to determine the effectiveness and life span of steel <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> and flexible bitumen with polymer modified binder in runway construction. The study was conducted at KLIA as it is the main airport in Malaysia and thousands of aircraft passes through the two main runways every year. KLIA uses flexible bitumen with polymer modified binder as the {{structure of}} the runway. The effectiveness and life span of the runway at KLIA are important in order {{to make sure that the}} operation at the airport become smooth and no interference will occur. Two engineers at the KLIA engineering department were the respondents that answering the close-ended questionnaire designed for this study. The questionnaire consists of certain elements on how steel <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> and flexible bitumen with polymer modified binder runway structure react on term of the materials behavior, maintenance frequency, cost and time consumes to build and maintaining the runway, and the life span of the runway. At the end of this study, the result concludes that the effectiveness and life span of both materials are bias towards the flexible bitumen with polymer modified binder rather that steel <b>reinforce</b> <b>concrete</b> because of its characteristics that is better and suit the runway construction and specification of KLIA. Hence, various types of runway structure materials and opinion from other engineer from different airport are recommended as it can evaluate more on the runway construction technology and may become beneficial for future reference in runway construction...|$|R
