2500|$|A primary {{challenge}} of all transport is reducing energy consumption and reducing [...] emissions. <b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> energy (recuperation or regeneration) helps with both. This requires components that can quickly store and release energy over long {{times with a}} high cycle rate. Supercapacitors fulfill these requirements and are therefore used {{in a lot of}} applications in all kinds of transportation.|$|R
25|$|Supercapacitors {{can be used}} to {{supplement}} batteries in starter systems in diesel railroad locomotives with diesel-electric transmission. The capacitors capture the <b>braking</b> energy <b>of</b> a full stop and deliver the peak current for starting the diesel engine and acceleration of the train and ensures the stabilization of catenary voltage. Depending on the driving mode up to 30% energy saving is possible by <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> energy. Low maintenance and environmentally friendly materials encouraged the choice of supercapacitors.|$|R

In this paper, a control for <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> energy in Electric Vehicles (EVs) with electro hydraulic brake (EHB) is proposed, which makes the recovery transfer to the electric hydraulic pump of EHB directly, rather than being stored statically in the battery. An energy flow strategy was designed for the maximum braking energy recovery based on this control. The simulation results show higher energy recovery rate in comparison to the general recycling control...|$|R

40|$|The {{engine cooling}} system in trucks {{is one of the}} main sources of {{parasite}} load. Thus fuel efficiency can be improved by optimal control of engine thermal management system considering fuel consumption minimization as the objective. Although several optimal control methods have been proposed for the {{engine cooling system}}, their main emphasize is on regulating engine and coolant temperature in an acceptable range rather than minimizing fuel consumption. In contrast, this paper investigates the fuel saving potential of predictive optimal control methods for the engine cooling system of conventional trucks. Our method exploits the idea of energy buffers in the automotive system, where the engine cooling system and the battery serve as energy buffers. The advantages of this approach are the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> energy and the balance of energy sources so that the total energy loss is minimized. A model predictive controller is used as the real time controller, and the results are compared with a simple state feedback controller and a global optimal solution obtained by dynamic programming. The results show limited but notable improvement in fuel efficiency. The results also construct a base for ongoing research on energy buffer control in conventional heavy trucks.

40|$|<b>Recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> energy during driving cycles is {{the most}} {{effective}} option to improve fuel economy and reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions. Hybrid electric vehicles suffer the disadvantages of the four efficiency reducing transformations in each regenerative braking cycle. Flywheel kinetic energy recovery systems (KERS) may boost this efficiency up to almost double values of about 70 % avoiding all four of the efficiency reducing transformations from one form of energy to another and keeping the vehicle&# 039;s energy in the same form as when the vehicle starts braking when the vehicle is back up to speed. With reference to the baseline configuration with a 1. 6 liters engine and no <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> kinetic energy, introduction of KERS reduces the fuel usage to 3. 16 liters per 100 km, corresponding to 82. 4 g of CO 2 per km. The 1. 6 liters Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) Diesel engine without KERS uses 1. 37 MJ per km of fuel energy, reducing with KERS to 1. 13 MJ per km. Downsizing the engine to 1. 2 liters as permitted by the torque assistance by KERS, the fuel consumption is further reduced to 3. 04 liters per 100 km, corresponding to 79. 2 g of CO 2 per km and 1. 09 MJ per km of fuel energy. These CO 2 and fuel usage values are 11 % and 13 % better than those of today&# 039;s highest fuel economy hybrid electric vehicle. The car equipped with a 1. 6 liter Turbo Direct Injection Jet Ignition (TDI-JI) H 2 ICE engine finally consumes 8. 3 g per km of fuel, corresponding to only 0. 99 MJ per km of fuel energy...|$|R
40|$|Empty {{container}} handling operations in inland container depots {{is a major}} economic and environmental problem today due to fossil fuel burning. This research examines reuse <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> and reverse energy to reduce fuel cost and environmental impact. The research was originated within the domain of electrical regeneration means {{as most of the}} known regeneration applications are electrical energy related. However regeneration by means of hydraulic energy was selected as Linde-II, base- equipment to the research is hydraulic based. One major innovative step taken in this project is application of discharge pressure of the accumulator to suction side of the gear pump. This is a novel concept which have not patented yet anywhere in the world. The energy saving potential of the proposed reengineering solution is estimated to be 33 %. Saving potential of the solution is substantial and lucrative. Simulation results were used to validate the reengineering solution in terms of power reduction. Actual fuel consumption of the proposed solution may depend on the way engine is controlled. Simplicity and low capital cost are two positive aspects of the solution. Even though the saving potential was impressive, it could not be implemented into a prototype mainly due to non availability of suitable gear pumps. Therefore solution is limited to a concept for this moment. It is essential to have a positive engine control with respect to accumulator action in order to obtain optimum possible fuel savings. Whilst the accumulator is charging and discharging, there is an effect on lifting and lowering speeds. Variations in lowering and lifting speeds due to the proposed solution could affect performance related to the users' needs, however it has not been considered within the scope of the research. Main research areas precede parallel to this study are: <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> energy, development <b>of</b> an engine control algorithm, a study on variations of lifting and lowering speed, and a reliability assessment of the proposed reengineering solution. This concept is novel and can be defined as a green supply chain initiative in which outcomes lead to a reduction of green house gas emissions, and also to reduce carbon footprint in the shipping industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of the energy efficiency is a key issue for electrified railway systems {{in order to reach}} an increased competitiveness compared to other transportation technologies in terms of both costs and environmental pollution. An important step towards this direction has been made with the increasing development of storage technologies. The installation of stationary or on-board storage technologies, as well known, allows the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>braking</b> energy <b>of</b> the rolling stocks for increasing the energy efficiency of the whole system as well as improving the voltage profile. In the paper an optimization procedure is proposed for choosing in the planning stage the fundamental characteristics of a stationary storage device. The optimal parameters of the storage system can be determined by taking contemporaneously into account the energy saving aspects, substation current minimization and reduction of voltage drops along the feeder. The considered storage system is based upon a bidirectional DC-DC converter with ultracapacitors. A sliding mode control is implemented for tracking the optimal trajectory determined by the previously mentioned optimal technique. Numerical applications put in evidence the effectiveness of the proposed procedure...|$|R

40|$|The major {{contribution}} of the work presented in this thesis is a thorough investigation of the constraints on regenerative braking and kinetic energy recovery enhancement for electric/hybrid electric vehicles during braking. Regenerative braking systems {{provide an opportunity to}} recycle the braking energy, which is otherwise dissipated as heat in the brake pads. However, braking energy harnessing is a relatively new concept in the automotive sector which still requires further research and development. Due to the operating constraints of the drivetrain architecture and the varying nature <b>of</b> the <b>braking</b> conditions, it is unlikely that all the stored kinetic energy of the vehicle can be recovered during braking. The research work in this thesis addresses the effect <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> conditions on kinetic energy <b>recovery</b> enhancement <b>of</b> the vehicle. The challenge in kinetic energy recovery enhancement lies in braking conditions, power/torque handling ability of the electric propulsion system, managing the dual braking systems, employed energy conversion techniques, and energy storage capacity. In this work a novel braking strategy is introduced to increase the involvement <b>of</b> the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, so as to increase the kinetic energy recovery while achieving the braking performance requirements. Initially mathematical modelling and simulation based analysis are presented to demonstrate the effects <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> power variation with respect to braking requirements. A novel braking strategy is proposed to increase the kinetic energy recovery during heavy braking events. The effectiveness <b>of</b> this <b>braking</b> strategy is analyzed using a simulation model developed in matlab- simulink environment. Anexperimental rig is developed to test various braking scenarios and their effects on kinetic energy <b>recovery.</b> A variety <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> scenarios are tested and results are presented with the analysis. At the end, suggestions are made to further continue this research in the future...|$|R
