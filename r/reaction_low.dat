50|$|When {{the body}} is exposed to the cold in {{individuals}} afflicted by the condition, hives appear and the skin in the affected area typically becomes itchy. Hives result from dilation of capillaries which allow fluid to flow out into the surrounding tissue which is the epidermis.They resolve when the body absorbs this fluid. The border of a hive is described as polycyclic, or made up of many circles, and changes as fluid leaks out and then is absorbed. Pressing on a hive causes the skin to blanch distinguishing it from a bruise or papule. Hives can last {{for a few minutes}} or a few days, and vary from person to person. Also, a burning sensation occurs. During a severe <b>reaction,</b> <b>low</b> blood pressure, which can be life-threatening, can occur. A serious reaction is most likely to occur if the hives occur with less than 3 minutes of exposure (during a cold test).|$|E
50|$|Within {{germinal}} centers, B cells proliferate and mutate {{the genetic}} region coding for their surface antibody (also known as immunoglobulin). The process is called somatic hypermutation and {{is responsible for}} introducing spontaneous mutations with a frequency of about 1 in every 1600 cell division (a relatively high frequency considering the low mutation frequency of other cells of the body being 1 in 106 cell divisions). Then after gaining a set number of mutations, germinal center B cells are subjected to a round of selection by TFH cells. B cell clones that have mutated and gained higher affinity surface immunoglobulin that better recognize antigen receive cellular contact-dependent survival signals from interacting with their cognate TFH cells {{and go on to}} one of three fates: (i) differentiate into plasma cells that have improved affinity towards antigen (therefore more efficient than their earlier the generation of plasma cells in clearing the infection), (ii) affinity matured memory B cells, or (iii) retained in the germinal center to re-enter another round of mutative replication and TFH cell-dependent selection. Therefore, as an infection proceeds, memory B cells selected in the later stages of a germinal center response are found to have accumulated the highest numbers of immunoglobulin mutation events with superior affinity towards their targeted antigen. Conversely, {{during the course of a}} germinal center <b>reaction,</b> <b>low</b> affinity or potentially auto-reactive germinal center B cell clones, or those that have gained non-functional mutations are out-competed by higher affinity clones and eventually undergo cellular apoptosis.|$|E

30|$|A {{modified}} {{method was}} developed to evaluate how much chlorine is consumed by the oxidation reaction during the chlorine bleaching process. This evaluation is, in principle, based on the sum of chloride produced during the chlorination stage (C-stage) and produced during alkali treatment of both the C-stage effluent and the chlorinated pulp. Results obtained by this method proved that about 50 %– 75 % of chlorine was consumed by the oxidation reaction during chlorine bleaching, depending on the reaction condition of chlorination. Even under a reaction condition that is not favorable to an oxidation <b>reaction</b> (<b>low</b> pH), approximately three electrons were abstracted from one lignin structural unit by chlorine bleaching.
