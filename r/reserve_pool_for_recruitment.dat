40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract The {{unprecedented}} {{accumulation of}} international reserves by emerging markets {{raises the question}} of how to best utilize these funds; in particular if they should be held as a war chest to guard against the risk of financial crisis or if they should be used to recapitalize and strengthen weak banking systems. A third issue is if the resource cost could be limited by pooling the holdings of different central banks and if so, to what objectives should this <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> be put. This paper considers these questions with reference to the countries participating in the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR). It explores two routes through which the <b>pooling</b> of <b>reserves</b> through FLAR could enhance stability and welfare in Latin America. First, the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> could be used for emergency lending in response to sudden stops. Insofar as the incidence of sudden stops differs across countries, pooling would allow the same reserves to support a larger volume of emergency lending. However, the paper discusses how such a scheme would face significant obstacles due both to the bunching of sudden stops temporally and regionally and to moral hazard problems which are stronger in the case of self-regulating entities like FLAR. The second, more promising alternative that the paper analyses, is the use of a portion of the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool,</b> along with borrowed funds, to purchase contingent debt securities issued by Latin American governments and corporations: domestic-currency inflationindexed bonds, GDP-indexed bonds, commodity-price-indexed bonds. This would help to solve the coordination/first-mover problem that limits the liquidity of markets in these instruments and hinders their acceptance by private investors. In any case, the idea is that neither initiative should be thought of in stand-alone terms. In addition to creating an expanded <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> use in emergency lending, governments could also push ahead with issuing contingent debt securities that reduce their vulnerability to disturbances...|$|R

In addition, GSH {{may serve as a}} <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> neuronal glutamate (Glu) through the γ-glutamyl cycle. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate brain [GSH] and its association with GCLC polymorphism, peripheral redox indices and brain Glu. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure [GSH] and [Glu] in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of 25 early-psychosis patients and 33 controls. GCLC polymorphism was genotyped, glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were determined in blood cells. Significantly lower [GSHmPFC] in GCLC high-risk genotype subjects were revealed as compared to low-risk genotype subjects independent of disease status. In male subjects, [GSHmPFC] and blood GPx activities correlate positively in controls (P =. 021), but negatively in patients (P =. 039). In GCLC low-risk genotypes, [GlumPFC] are lower in patients, while it is not the case for high-risk genotypes. GCLC high-risk genotypes are associated with low [GSHmPFC], highlighting that GCLC polymorphisms should be considered in pathology studies of cerebral GSH. Low brain GSH levels are related to low peripheral oxidation status in controls but with high oxidation status in patients, pointing to a dysregulated GSH homeostasis in early psychosis patients. GCLC polymorphisms and disease associated correlations between brain GSH and Glu levels may allow patients stratification...|$|R

3000|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{advantage to}} insurgency depends on several factors. The ability of insurgents {{to control the}} population and to use discriminating violence determines {{the extent to which}} they can offer enticements and coercion to the local community, as does the power of the government to employ discriminate violence. Indeed, [...] "control - regardless of the ‘true’ preferences of the population - precludes options other than collaboration by creating credible benefits for collaborators and, more importantly, sanctions for defectors" [...] [3]. Community economic factors also play a powerful role. The rate or level of economic development determines the opportunity costs of participation, where economic recession makes participation in rebellion less risky or costly in comparison to times of economic boom [46]. Natural resources vulnerable to looting or military capture present a tantalising incentive to join armed groups [47]. For example, in the developing world, [...] "conflict diamonds" [...] or the drug trade influenced the development and proliferation of militias [48] described as a class of ‘feral’ insurgent [49], since their activism is a means of survival instead of an institutional mechanism to secure popular support. High unemployment among young men produces a likely <b>pool</b> <b>for</b> insurgent <b>recruitment,</b> as it provides them with opportunities to advance economically and socially [7]. On a more micro level, a household so poor that its members have little means to sustain themselves is particularly likely to join whichever group happens to offer the best immediate chance of survival [50]. For example, while Pakistani rebels often had better education than their Afghani counterparts, both came from large, impoverished households [51].|$|R

50|$|The way {{transmitter}} release {{works is}} every terminal at every pre-synapse {{in your brain}} has a large pool of vesicles that are filled with glutamate {{and that can be}} used to release a neurotransmitter. However, in any given time, most of them are not being used. This is known as the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool.</b> The readily recyclable pool or rapidly recycling pool is 10% of what is being used all the time. When a transmitter is released, a vesicle does not just get thrown away. The vesicles are actually resealed, and they get recycled back around and stuck preferentially back into the rapidly recycling <b>pool,</b> not the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool,</b> so they can be used again. Most of the vesicles in the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> are released only when it is activated at the maximum strength, as by polarizing them with high potassium or by driving with the high frequency of action potentials. The little recycling vesicles can't keep up. Then, signals tell the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> to release what it stores in itself. The acting zone of the <b>reserve</b> <b>pool</b> has its certain length with so many docking sites. The vesicles have to dock to the sealed complex. They have to bind to the right place. When calcium comes in, it binds, releases the vesicle, and opens up to release a neurotransmitter. Therefore, how fast endocytosis occurs means how fast the vesicles get back into the recycling pool.|$|R

The time courses of both synaptic depression and endocytosis were slowed by prolonged tetanic stimulation.
