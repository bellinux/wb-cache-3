40|$|Adverse shocks to rich {{countries}} {{often have a}} large and persistent negative impact on investment and output in developing countries. This paper examines a transmission mechanism that can account for this stylized fact. The mechanism {{is based on the}} existence of international financial frictions. Specifically, if a small, developing country has to collateralize its assets to borrow funds to invest, falling asset prices caused by a negative shock in an advanced economy worsen the developing country's collateral value and reduce its ability to borrow and reinvest. Hence, investment in the developing country declines, and international investors <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital</b> <b>to</b> the advanced country. As less capital now can be pledged as collateral, the developing country's credit constraint is further tightened, which leads to another round of decline in investment. This generates a downward spiral that may cause large output losses to the developing country. The mechanism finds empirical support in the 2008 - 2009 crisis data.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium trade model to examine {{for a small}} capital-importing and a small capital-exporting country the employment and welfare effects of capital and wage taxes. The supply of capital is variable due to international mobility, while the supply of labour is variable due to endogenous supply adjustments. The paper considers the optimal policy toward one factor when the other is taxed, under three tax systems of <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> earnings - (1) tax credits, (2) tax deductions, and (3) untaxed net <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> earnings. The analysis also determines under which of these tax systems the employment and welfare effects of domestic factor taxes depend on the foreign capital tax rate, and under which ones they do not.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the scope for {{stabilizing}} Latin American economies <b>to</b> <b>repatriate</b> <b>capital</b> for the financing of long-term investments and economic recovery in the region. In particular, a simple two-period investment model is developed {{to show that a}} government seeking capital repatriation may be tempted to introduce investment subsidies on such long-term capital inflows. Typically, however, such a government will be facing the following trade off: small investment subsidies may not be sufficient to attract large-scale repatriation, and high aggregate subsidies may trigger inflationary expectations. A decreasing subsidy scheme is shown to be optimal. Such a scheme has the following properties: it provides an incentive for investors <b>to</b> <b>repatriate</b> their <b>capital</b> early, and at the same time, it keeps government spending low enough not to jeopardize stabilization programmes. A decreasing subsidy scheme could account for the success that the Chilean debt-equity-swap programmes have [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Just {{like any}} market price, the {{exchange}} rate for the dollar fluctuates based on supply and demand. By observing the constituent elements of the supply and demand for dollar assets, we can thus explain the significant appreciation of the dollar {{during the second half}} of 2008. Over this period, during which the crisis spread to the whole of the global economy, US Treasury bonds acted as a safe haven, but in net terms foreign investors ceased buying US private securities. Americans, on the other hand, <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> on a massive scale, driving up the net demand for dollars. Supply of dollar assets fell more rapidly than the global supply of assets and thus shored up the US currency. The dollar’s future movements remain one of the greatest uncertainties following the crisis, even though the forecast made before the beginning of the crisis remains valid: if the ongoing US deficit is to be resorbed, a weak dollar will continue to be required.

40|$|Before the crisis, the {{emerging}} countries (especially those in Asia) and the oil-exporting countries had enormous foreign trade surpluses they were accumulating in their {{foreign exchange reserves}} and which they used to give their sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) capital endowments. It was thus in these countries and SWFs that financing and capital investment capacities were to be found, {{which is what we}} saw {{at the beginning of the}} crisis. But the crisis then led to two developments : first of all, a significant trend towards <b>repatriating</b> <b>capital</b> from {{the emerging}} and oil-exporting countries to the main countries of the OECD, particularly to the United Stares; secondly, the decline in commodity prices. We then saw a very different situation : the emerging and oil countries suffered declines in their foreign exchange reserves. World savings was no longer concentrated in these countries, but in financing the public debts of the main OECD countries : in the United States and in Europe, governments replaced SWFs as « investors of last resort ».

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between foreign direct investment and economic growth in ECOWAS using the System-GMM panel estimation technique covering the period 1970 - 2011. The study adopted System-GMM in order to overcome the weaknesses perceived in the empirical works of earlier studies; majority of these studies failed to control for the presumed challenges of endogeneity inherent in the FDI-Growth argument. The study likewise interacted human capital and institutions indicators with other explanatory variables in explaining the variability of FDI. The results of the System-GMM appears contrary to earlier studies, as the contribution of FDI was insignificant and impacts negatively on growth in ECOWAS despite the controlling {{for the role of}} human capital and quality of institutions in the model. Following this outcome, policy makers in developing Africa needs to exercise cautions in adopting the recommendation from earlier studies; most of which advocates more openness, advancing human capital development and strengthening institutions. This might not be completely helpful considering the pattern of FDI inflow into ECOWAS, which is absolutely resource-seeking. There is need to curtail excessive openness in the extractive industries, encouraging more manufacturing FDI and domestic investment of <b>repatriated</b> <b>capital</b> by ensuring more economic stability and raising domestic interest rate. ...|$|R
