40|$|Investment {{costs for}} eight {{different}} type housing systems for dairy cows has been calculated {{in order to}} compare the building costs {{as a function of}} herd size, shelter type and automatization. A commercial calculation programme for building was used and complemented with prices of equipments specific for dairy cow building. Herd sizes were 120, 250 and 400 cows. The milking equipments were automatic milking system (AMS), parallel parlour with 32 stalls (2 x 16) and <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour</b> with 24 stalls. Shelter was either insulated equipped with automatic cable driven scrapers on solid alleys, automatic feed wagon on rails, or uninsulated with manual manure handling and a tractor driven mobile mixer wagon on a drive-through feeding table.

40|$|In {{constructing}} or rebuilding a dairy barn, it’s normally {{only the}} cost of investment for the building (climatic barrier, foundation, floor and installations) that is evaluated in the capital investment estimate. Indirect costs as labour, forage, maintenance or animal health that occur because of differences in the building function are not considered. A simple and cheap building may lead to higher operating costs. Low costs for mechanization may lead to high labour costs and that’s why it’s important to include all building related costs when comparing construction and installations alternatives. This report shows results from manual work time studies from 13 farms with dairy cows in loose housing, representing different herd sizes (80 to 450 cows) and levels of mechanization (Automatic milking system, AMS, fixed and <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour</b> and level of mechanisation of feed distribution). The farms were visited both afternoon and morning during season with no grazing. The farmers and the cattle employees answered a questionnaire about work routines and herd information. Following type of work procedures were investigated: dairy cows (milking cleaning of parlour, feeding, littering, and cleaning of cubicles and other work), heifers (feeding, littering, cleaning and other work) and calves (milk feeding, feeding, littering, cleaning and other work). All figures are given as minutes per milking cow and day. There were big time differences between equal milking systems. The AMS barns had the shortest work time for milking (0. 27 to 0. 80 min/cow and day). The various milking time in the AMS stables depended on the numbers of alarms and cows needed to be caught for milking. Work time in the milking parlours (1. 84 to 3. 96 min/cow and day) depended on use of automatic cow gate or herd dog that pushed the cows. For calves, work time varied from 0 min (suckling cows) to 0. 57 min/cow and day. Work time for the young stock varied considerable (0. 32 to 1. 05 min/cow and day). Five model farms were constructed to show the effect of number of cows {{and the level of}} mechanization on the working time. With AMS in a 140 head herd and {{with a high degree of}} mechanization, the work time became 2. 1 min/cow and day. The work time became three times higher (6. 28 min/cow and day) in a herd of the same size using 2 x 8 herringbone parlour and with a low tech mechanisation. The effect of both herd size and level of mechanization was shown in the 400 head herd with a <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour</b> and a mobile mixer wagon where the work time became 3. 87 min/cow and day...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{devices in}} parlours {{are a source}} of noise, and this noise has an effect not only on the {{operators}} of the parlour but also on dairy cows. They have more sensitive hearing than humans. The aim of this article was to analyse the sound pressure level and determine the noise exposure of dairy cows at different technological solutions of milking parlours, during their day routine. In the experiment, tandem, herringbone and <b>rotary</b> milking <b>parlours</b> were used. Noise exposure was measured during the milking process. After evaluation of noise pressure levels of different types of milking parlours, it can be concluded that in this experiment, the equivalent noise pressure level was lowest in the tandem milking parlour. Equivalent sound pressure levels in the rotary and herringbone milking parlour were almost about the same values. These values are higher than values in the tandem milking parlour, about 10 decibels. The differences within mean LAFeq values between the herringbone milking parlour and tandem milking parlour were highly statistically significant (P < 0. 001 ***) ...|$|R
40|$|The traits activity, milk yield, {{milk flow}} rate and {{electrical}} conductivity were analysed {{in preparation for}} automatic oestrus detection. Collection of data was performed on a commercial dairy farm and milking {{took place in a}} <b>rotary</b> milking <b>parlour.</b> Between February and December 1998 1, 090, 031 observations from 2, 422 Holstein Friesian cows were accumulated. Around 30 % of cows were milked thrice daily. For each trait and each cow a daily value was calculated. The fixed effects test day, parity, calving season, milking frequency, week of lactation and the random effect cow were considered in statistical analyses. With increasing number of parity, activity decreased and milk yield, milk flow rate and electrical conductivity increased. The milking frequency had significant influence on all analysed traits and for the effect calving season no consistent trend was found. All traits showed characteristic patterns during lactation. Between test days high variations were found for the trait activity. The remaining traits showed a steady level except for small fluctuations. Repeatability was 27. 4 % for activity and between 70 and 78. 7 % for the milk parameters. The repeatabilities verified the collected field data having a satisfying structure for application in automatic oestrus detection. The repeatability of the trait activity indicated high differences between and within cows. The right skewed distribution indicated the activity as a promising trait for further analyses...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the factors that affect the system performance of a threedimensional based vision system for automatic monitoring of dairy cow locomotion implemented on a commercial dairy farm. Data were gathered from a Belgian commercial dairy farm with a 40 -stand <b>rotary</b> milking <b>parlour.</b> This resulted in forced cow traffic twice a day when all Holstein cows passed through an alley on their return to the pen. The video recording system with a 3 D depth camera, positioned in top-down perspective, was installed in this alley. The entire monitoring process, including video recording, filtering and analysis and cow identification, was automated. System performance was defined as the number of analysed videos per session. To investigate how many video recordings could be used for monitoring dairy cow locomotion, videos were captured during 566 consecutive milking sessions. For each session, 224 ± 10 cows were identified on average by the RFID-antenna, and 197 ± 17 videos were recorded (88. 0 ± 6. 2 %) by the camera. After linking the cow identification to the recorded videos, 178 ± 14 cow videos (79. 5 ± 5. 7 %) were available for analysis. After all video processing, an average of 110 ± 24 recorded cow videos (49. 3 ± 11. 0 %) per session was used for analysis. The number of analysed videos per cow per week was individually variable. Cow traffic in the alley where the recordings were made had a big influence on the performance of the system. Heavy cow traffic reduced the number of recordings and the number of identified cows in each video, and more videos were filtered out due to incorrect cow segmentation in the videos. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{fieldwork}} for my {{doctoral degree}} {{was carried out}} over nineteen months, a year of which was spent working on an industrial dairy farm in Hokkaido, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s northernmost Island. As {{in much of the}} industrialised world, dairy farming in Japan is rapidly changing. Many farmers are forced by neo-liberal agricultural policies to shift from small family operated farms to high-tech, high-speed, and high overhead industrial operations. This paper focuses on the history of dairy farming in the Tokachi region; more specifically one farm and the shift over a generation to a <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour</b> milking system. It addresses the linkages this mode of production has cultivated amongst humans, dairy cows and industrialized space. The parlour system at Great Hopes Farm allows five workers (aided by three more stall staff) to milk over 1000 cows, fifty at a time, three times a day. The impetus behind moving to parlour technology is that it increases productivity through mechanically enhanced observation and control. However this recent mechanical separation of human and cow during the milking process has led to affectively shared interspecies and inter-human alienation. The technology of the parlour system sets daily rhythms for bovine and human alike, and separates both from a process formerly dependent upon, specialized knowledge, affective empathy, and embodied knowledge. Human and bovine experience the systemic violence of the machine and what remains is a complex bio-politics of interspecies affect and the separation of “bare” and “political” life...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{significant}} disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle and is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare concern. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. This study examined the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment in the prevention of mastitis and quantified the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had on the number of clinical cases of mastitis on somatic cell counts within herds. Context and background Organic dairy farming is a significant industry with milk being the largest single organic product in the UK. Organic milk is produced to defined standards which meet the Advisory Committee on Organic Standards (ACOS) criteria. These standards ‘emphasise animal welfare and, by avoiding artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other non-natural chemicals, and prohibiting the routine use of antibiotics and other conventional drugs, also ensure care for the environment, and promote the highest standards of food quality and safety’ (Omsco 2005). As part of the management of organic dairy cattle with reduced use of conventional pharmaceutical treatments, many organic farmers use homeopathic and other complementary therapies on their animals. Mastitis is recognised as the main animal health problem in organic milk production systems (Bennedsgaard et al 2003). Whilst mastitis levels appear to be similar to those found in conventional production (Hovi and Roderick, 2000) specific problem areas in mastitis control under organic management standards have been identified. One of the overall goals of organic animal husbandry is to avoid disease through management, husbandry, breeding and feeding. According to the EC-Regulation No. 1804 / 1999 governing organic livestock production, animal health management should be based on disease prevention. However, the preventive use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products like dry cow antibiotics is not permitted. In organic units, phytotherapeutic and homeopathic products and trace elements are to be used in preference to antibiotic and prolonged withdrawal periods need to be observed after conventional medicine use. As a consequence of these requirements, organic dairy farmers look for alternatives to conventional therapy and prophylaxis (Hektoen 2004). Homeopathy is widely used for the treatment of mastitis within UK organic dairy herds and prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes, either continuously or just during housing, is practised on many organic dairy farms and is thought to offer general protection against mastitis and to reduce somatic cell counts (SCC). Research into the effectiveness of homeopathic treatments {{was one of the most}} important research requirements identified in a recent MAFF review of animal health within organic herds (Hovi & Roderick 1999). The range of homeopathic treatments used on farm today is wide, with treatment practices either focussing on the needs of the individual animal, which is known as constitutional treatment and which employs individual remedies, or aimed at groups of animals using specific remedies, or ‘nosodes’, which are considered to be a very specific form of homeopathy - isopathy (iso - all the same, pathy – treatment/exposure). Unlike specific remedies, nosodes do not account for the individual needs of each animal, but create the potential for protective treatment for a herd or group, they are generally applied in drinking water, and may be used on individual animals, usually by vulval spray. Benefit for the sector and for Defra Mastitis {{is the most}} significant disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle, and management and control of mastitis is an important facet of practical dairy herd management. Mastitis is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare problem in dairy cattle. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. The Study Ninety-six farms participated in a double-blind trial to compare a homeopathic nosode and an inactive control treatment (carrier alone). Treatments were at the farm level and took place over a period of 12 months or 24 months (some farms were swapped to the opposite treatment during a second year). The treatments were randomised to each farm by a third party. During the trial, where available, records were collected of farm monthly bulk tank somatic cell count (BMSSC), a monthly cell count based on National Milk Recording data (NMR) and the annual number of cases of mastitis as recorded by the farmer. Additional farm level data were collected and their relationship to the level of mastitis on the farms investigated. Objectives of the Study The study described in this report explores the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment, a nosode, in the prevention of mastitis and quantifies the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had in reducing the number of clinical cases of mastitis and also quantifying any effect that the use of a nosode has on somatic cell counts within herds. •	To quantify the effectiveness of the prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes for the treatment of mastitis in reducing the incidence of clinical mastitis and the concentration of somatic cells in milk. •	To survey management practices on organically managed farms. •	To investigate associations between the homeopathic treatment, farm management practice and the incidence of different types of mastitis and to provide guidance for mastitis control in organic dairy herds. Materials and methods In testing the efficacy of a homeopathic nosode it was determined that the study should: •	Look at a nosode already being commonly used and commercially available. •	Not ask for new recording systems to be used for data collection but to use the existing systems which are in place. •	Not interfere in the ‘normal’ practises carried out by the farms, by, for example, repeated prompting of farmers to carry out treatments, or ask them to adopt prescribed ways for describing, recording or treating mastitis. There are three commonly used measures of the udder health of milking cows: a) 	The bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC, commonly referred to as SCC) gives a count (in 000 ’s cells / ml) of white cells and desquamated cells shed by the udder. The BMSCC is not an accurate indicator for the presence of clinical mastitis, but may give information on sub-clinical (undetected) mastitis. b) 	Somatic cell counts for individual cows from farms which subscribe to commercial milk recording services (ICSCC). c) 	The number of cases of mastitis. The incidence rate for clinical mastitis (IRCM) is the number of distinct cases of mastitis in 100 cows in a year. The response variables that were measured were: •	Farmers’ own record of mastitis cases. •	Bulk milk SCC. •	Individual cow somatic cell records (ICSCC) if the farms were on a milk recording service. •	Farmer’s opinion of his/her success in controlling mastitis. •	A large number of variables, recorded using a questionnaire at the farm visits, which could influence mastitis and the effectiveness of the treatment. After visiting a number of homeopathic pharmacies, an agreement was made with Crossgates homeopathic pharmacy 1, and Freemans Homeopathic Pharmacy 2 (Appendix D) to make the individual herd specific nosode remedies for the farms. The trial was double-blinded, with blinding carried out by the creation of a randomly generated list of A and B’s. As each new farm was recruited, it was allocated to the next A or B in the sequence, the farms being allocated to either nosode treatment or control, one by one, in chronological order. Articles were written in the organic press, Organic Farming, and The Turning Worm, inviting farms to take part in the study. It was clear that farms should only join the study voluntarily and would not be ‘cold called’ or pressurised to join. One hundred and four farms responded to the call, and 96 of these farms went on to take part in the study. The 8 farms which declined to take part either went out of milk production before the study started, or changed their minds about inclusion in the trial before the start of the study. The 96 farms were visited and the study introduced. Farmers were issued with a kit to collect milk from high cell count cows for preparation as a nosode. An 80 part questionnaire (Appendix A) was used to gather the information needed to understand the possible factors that may influence mastitis. During visits the farmers were also asked whether they were willing to fill in a self assessment of their personality type. Number of farms recruited 			= 96 Total farms completing the study period	= 88 Number of farm years followed		= 206 Average herd size			= 101 cows Number of cows followed in the study 	= 9, 680 Number of cows receiving remedy (R) 	= 4, 734 Number of cows receiving control (P) 	= 4, 946 Total cow years followed			= 21, 580 cow years (Some farms two years, some 3 years) Farms lost during study			= 8 (due to sale of the herd, or going out of milk production and into, for example, heifer rearing) Results The data collected were subject to a number of different analyses:- 1. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the cell count in milk. 2. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the annual cases of mastitis. 3. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with increased cell count in milk. 4. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with higher levels of mastitis. No effect of nosode in reducing either the incidence of cases of mastitis or the somatic cell counts in the milk were detected. The following risk factors were found to be associated with composite cell counts:- •	A decrease in cell count with increased culling of high cell count cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use complementary therapies on dry cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use dry cow therapy, including teat sealants, on dry cows •	An increased cell count for farms which did not pre-wipe before milking or pre-wiped the teats with a cloth before milking •	An increase in cell count for farms which pre-wipe only the udders of cows which are visibly dirty before milking The following risk factors were found to be associated with the number of cases of mastitis:- •	Increasing herd yield is associated with increased mastitis case numbers •	Increased calving of cows indoors in a calving box was associated with increased numbers of mastitis cases •	Use of an in line clot filer was associated with reduced numbers of mastitis cases •	Having an abreast parlour (as opposed to a herringbone or <b>rotary</b> <b>parlour)</b> was associated with a reduced numbers of mastitis cases The extent to which the objectives set have been achieved The effectiveness of homeopathic nosodes in treating mastitis and lowering cell count is quantified and described (Objective 1) and the survey results of management practices on organically managed dairy farms are described (Objective 2). Additionally, the associations between homeopathic treatment, farm management practices, mastitis incidence and cell count are quantified (Objective 4) and management controls which show a reduction in mastitis cases or cell counts are identified as risk factors and described in the report (Objective 5). Conclusions •	There was no significant effect of the herd specific nosode on either the cell count of milk or the number of cases of mastitis. •	That there were strong ‘within farm’ correlations of cell count and cases i. e. between farms, farms tend to stay at the same level of cases and average cell count from year to year. •	That there was a characteristic pattern of seasonal change in cell counts (this is already widely recognised). •	The study provides useful and interesting statistics on organic dairy farm production. •	The study identified an association between decreased cell count and culling for high cell count, the use of complementary dry cow therapy and the use of traditional dry cow therapy. •	The study identified an association between increased cell count and not pre-wiping the udder, pre-wiping using a cloth and only pre-wiping dirty cows. •	The study identified an association between higher numbers of mastitis cases and higher average yield and also with higher percentage of cows calving in a calving box. •	An association was identified between decreased numbers of mastitis cases and the use of an in-line clot filter and also with farms with an abreast parlour (rather than a herring-bone parlour). •	Eighty five per cent of farmers in the survey responded that they did believe in non-conventional remedies, and 62 per cent of farmers responded that they used non-conventional remedies on their own family. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} milking {{process is}} represented {{by means of a}} model which allows the factors affecting the capacity of an automatic milking system to be studied. The main factors investigated are the times required for cow movements, milking processes and robot motions. With one robot serving two stalls, the idle time of the robot arm was 54 %. From an analysis of the milking cycle, it is shown that the robot arm can serve up to four milking stalls in-line. The model showed also that the capacity of an automatic milking system with two stalls in-line, can be increased from 11 · 7 to nearly 15 · 4 cows h h- 1 by increasing the robot speed, by executing some milking processes simultaneously and by changing the sequence of milking processes. If the robot is available for milking for 20 h, 308 milkings could be carried out. Thus, with a milking frequency of four milkings per cow per 24 h for the whole herd, the milking robot could serve nearly 80 cows. The possibilities of alternative arrangements such as a double tandem and a <b>rotary</b> tandem milking <b>parlour,</b> are also tested with the model...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{now make}} it possible to continuously record and monitor a range of outcomes on dairy farms including individual cow milk yields, environmental temperature and rainfall. These facilities enhance the ability of herd managers to recognise deviations from what is accepted as normal, prompting timely corrective intervention. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how liveweights recorded using walkover weighing (WoW) technology can provide information {{that can be used to}} better-manage a range of activities on dairy farms, particularly reproduction and herd health. Analysis of daily WoW recorded over the first 100 days of lactation have shown that the standard deviation of daily LW measurements across parities was 17 kg on average. A near perfect association between liveweights measured statically and WoWs (concordance correlation coefficient 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 99 to 1. 0) was observed. After controlling for the effect of liveweight at calving and long term liveweight change using a mixed-effects linear regression model, the autocorrelation between WoWs recorded on successive days was 0. 21, decaying to zero by eight days. This study showed that by using a standalone automatic WoW system positioned in the exit race of a <b>rotary</b> milking <b>parlour,</b> it was possible to record LWs of individual cows on a daily basis and, with controlled cow flow over the weighing platform (allowing for sufficient succession distance to prevent congestion), results were similar to those recorded using conventional, static weighing techniques. Two observational studies were conducted to investigate the relationships between LW, LWchange (LW) and clinical lameness. In the first study, LW loss in the first 50 days in milk increased the risk of a lameness event being diagnosed after 50 days in milk by a factor of 1. 80 (95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 17). The risk of lameness was greatest for high yielding cows that lost excessive LW (risk ratio 4. 36, 95 % CI 4. 21 to 8. 19). The second study quantified LW immediately before and after the diagnosis of lameness events. For lame cows, liveweight decreased up to three weeks before the date of diagnosis and for up to four weeks after. The total liveweight loss arising from a single lameness episode was, on average, 61 kg (95 % CI 47 to 74 kg). The results of this study show how liveweight records for individual animals can be used to enhance a herd manager’s ability to detect lame cows and present them for treatment. Prompt detection and treatment of lame cows presents an opportunity to shorten recovery times, with positive follow-on effects in terms of animal welfare. LW was assessed as a means for enahancing the sensitivity and specificity of oestrus detection. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting true oestrus events using LW combined with tail paint and visual observation was 0. 86 and 0. 94, respectively. The effect of LW in the first four weeks after calving (LWlong) and LW change around the time of the Planned Start of Mating (LWshort) on the time taken for cows to conceive relative to the Planned Start of Mating was quantified. Planned Start of Mating to conception intervals were influenced by LW change during both of these periods, though LWshort had a greater effect compared with LWlong. The findings of this study better define the impact of long- and short-term liveweight change on reproductive performance, providing the opportunity to design feeding programmes in pasture fed dairy herds that have positive effects on fertility. The studies presented in this thesis contribute knowledge to the role of LWmonitoring as a tool to better-manage seasonally calving, pasture fed dairy herds. While ‘traditional’ usage of walkover scales on dairy farms has involved the recording of LWand LWchange as a means for monitoring and adapting changes to the herd feeding program, the studies presented here have shown how LW records have the potential to provide information that can be used to better manage a range of herd level activities, particularly those related to reproductive management and health...|$|R
