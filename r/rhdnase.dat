The protocol was reversed during week 4 - 6. Group II performed the reversed sequence. Patients continued their daily routine ACT Primary endpoint: MEF 25 %pred. Pulmonary functions tests were performed on days 0, 14, 21, 35 and 42. In weeks 3 and 6 children scored cough and sputum production on daily diary cards. Results: 24 patients completed the study Mean age = 12 years (range 7 - 19). Mean MEF 25 %pred was 5. 8 % higher after 3 weeks of <b>rhDNase</b> before ACT, compared to <b>rhDNase</b> after ACT (58. 3 % vs 52. 5 %, p = 0. 01). There were no significant differences for any of the other variables. Conclusion: Inhalation of <b>rhDNase</b> before ACT improves peripheral airway patency in children with cystic fibrosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Viscoelastic {{secretions}} in {{cystic fibrosis}} cause impaired mucus clearance and persistence of bacteria within the lung. The abnormal rheology is {{partly due to}} the presence of high molecular weight deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Recombinant human DNase I (<b>rhDNase)</b> has been shown to depolymerise DNA and thereby reduce the in vitro viscoelasticity of sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis. A phase II double blind placebo controlled study showed that <b>rhDNase</b> improved pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis. The object {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the in vivo effects of <b>rhDNase</b> on sputum rheology and to determine whether these were correlated with changes in pulmonary function. METHODS: Patients were randomised to receive either placebo or <b>rhDNase</b> 2. 5 mg twice daily for 10 days. Sputum samples were collected in sterile containers during screening and during treatment with the study drug. Pulmonary function and rheological analysis were the primary outcomes evaluated. Other parameters assessed were quantitative sputum bacteriology, sputum DNA concentration, and change in molecular mass of DNA polymers. RESULTS: The viscoelasticity of the sputum in untreated patients with cystic fibrosis was high and treatment with <b>rhDNase</b> reduced all the rheological parameters measured: dynamic storage modulus (a measure of elasticity), dynamic loss modulus (a measure of viscosity), and log complex modulus (a measure of mucus rigidity). The calculated cough clearance index was also improved following treatment with <b>rhDNase.</b> These rheological parameters showed a correlation with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) which was improved by a mean (SE) of 13. 3 (5. 6) % on day 10 of treatment with <b>rhDNase</b> compared with a change of 0. 2 (3. 1) % in the placebo group. There was no change in bacterial colony counts or sputum DNA concentrations following treatment with <b>rhDNase,</b> but a small decrease in high molecular weight DNA was observed.

Because of their portability, newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizers offer greater convenience for the patient, but their efficiency in deliver-ing <b>rhDNase</b> has not been determined. METHODS: We compared a newer-generation vibrating-mesh nebulizer (Omron MicroAir) to a Pari LC with the Pari ProNeb Ultra compressor (a commonly employed <b>rhDNase</b> administration system). With the Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor, we determined aerosol particle distribution. We also measured mass output efficiency, nebulization time, and mass of <b>rhDNase</b> that deposited on a filter during simulated breathing. RESULTS: The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol from the MicroAir (MMAD 4. 3 m, GSD 2. 8 m) was equivalent to that from the Pari LC (MMAD 4. 2 m, GSD 2. 7 m). During simulated breathing the MicroAir had a higher total mass output efficiency (88 %) than the Pari LC (68 %) (P<. 001), and total nebulization time was shorter with the MicroAir (6. 1 min vs 7. 2 min, P. 03). When nebulized to dryness, the mass of <b>rhDNase</b> delivered to the filter was comparable with the MicroAir (1. 30 0. 4 mg) and Pari LC (1. 21 0. 05 mg).

However, mucolytic agents have not been found effective in reversing the obstruction of acute asthma. We test the hypothesis that <b>rhDNAse,</b> an agent that reduces viscoelasticity of sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis, has a therapeutic role in acute asthma. MethodsSymptomatic asthmatics aged 18 – 55 years presenting to an Emergency Department with an FEV 1  <  60 % predicted after 2 nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments were included. Patients were randomized into one of three nebulized <b>rhDNAse</b> treatment groups of 2. 5, 5. 0 or 7. 5  mg, or placebo. Standardized bronchodilator therapy was continued throughout the protocol and the FEV 1 at 6  h was the primary study endpoint. Results 50 patients were enrolled.

40|$|BACKGROUND—After {{multiple}} studies, including clinical trials, suggested some mild clinical {{benefits from}} the use of <b>rhDNase</b> by patients with cystic fibrosis, a widespread acceptance of the drug has followed. However, long term effects, specifically on lung disease progression, have not been demonstrated. Experience with the use of this drug in a single cystic fibrosis centre is presented and compared with the trends seen in the patient population of the centre before the introduction of the drug.  METHODS—Patients with cystic fibrosis routinely followed at the University of Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center and prescribed <b>rhDNase</b> {{for at least two years}} were included in this retrospective study. Data on spirometric parameters (FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC), allometric index, and admissions to hospital were retrieved from the centre's database for the two years preceding the prescription of <b>rhDNase</b> and the two years that followed. Trends in pulmonary function and allometric index were analysed by mixed linear modelling, and hospital admission rates for both periods were calculated and compared.  RESULTS—One hundred and ninety patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. In the two years preceding the prescription of <b>rhDNase</b> the trends noted were those of a mild decline in FEV 1, a stable FEV 1 /FVC, and a mild improvement in allometric index. In the two years that followed the prescription of <b>rhDNase</b> a mild decline in all these parameters occurred which was a significant change from the previous period (all p < 0. 009). There was no difference between females and males in the trends experienced after the start of <b>rhDNase.</b> By logistic regression analysis only the presence of malnutrition at the time of prescription was associated with a positive trend after the introduction of <b>rhDNase.</b> No significant change in the hospital admission rates occurred, with rates of 0. 52 (0. 16) and 0. 56 (0. 21) admissions/patient/year for the periods before and after the prescription of <b>rhDNase,</b> respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The introduction of <b>rhDNase</b> to the regimen of patients with cystic fibrosis cared for at this centre has not been followed by a positive trend in lung function and nutritional parameters. There are some differences between this patient population and those who participated in previous studies which may help to explain the contrasting findings of this study. However, it is also possible that factors other than mucus clearance need to be improved to achieve a favourable response in disease progression. Patients on this treatment should be followed closely and the benefit judged on an individual basis. More studies are needed to define better the specific indications and use of this form of treatment. ...|$|E

Knight, M. E. Hodson. ERS Journals Ltd 1996. ABSTRACT: In cystic fibrosis (CF), neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation results in high levels of neutrophil elastase (NE). Some of these proteases are sequestered by the large amounts of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in puru-lent sputum. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (<b>rhDNase),</b> a new treatment in CF, depolymerizes DNA. Our concerns were that this might release proteases bound to DNA, which could be potentially harmful. The in vitro and in vivo effects of <b>rhDNase</b> on NE and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) were evaluated. The acute effects of <b>rhDNase</b> were evaluated in CF patients during the first 6 days of treatment. Medium-term effects were evaluated in stable CF patients observed on <b>rhDNase</b> over 6 months. Sputum samples were collected at regular intervals and NE activity was measured by a fluorimetric assay and IL- 8 with a radioimmunoassay. In vitro addition of <b>rhDNase</b> resulted in a twofold increase in protease activity and this was reflected in an acute transient rise on initiation of treatment with <b>rhDNase.</b> Medium-term treatment {{was associated with a}} decline in NE activity and IL- 8.

Results: At baseline, there were no statistical differences between groups {{in any of the}} variables used as an outcome. After 3 months of treatment, both groups had improvements in percentage of predicted FEV 1 and FEF 25 - 75 %, and total HRCT visual scores. In contrast, the <b>rhDNase</b> group had a 13 % decrease in quantitative air trapping from baseline (severe air trapping [A 3]), compared to an increase of 48 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 023). After 12 months, both groups had declines in percentage of predicted FVC and FEV 1, but the <b>rhDNase</b> group retained improvements in percentage of predicted FEF 25 - 75 % and quantitative air trapping. The mucus plugging and total HRCT visual scores were also improved in the <b>rhDNase</b> group after 12 months of treatment, with and without significant differences between groups (p = 0. 026 and p = 0. 676). Quantitative air trapping (A 3) remained improved in the <b>rhDNase</b> group (- 15. 4 %) and worsened in the placebo group (+ 61. 3 %) with nearly significant differences noted between groups (p = 0. 053) after 12 months of treatment. Conclusions: Quantitative air trapping is a more consistent sensitive outcome measure than either spirometry or total HRCT scores, and can discriminate differences in treatment effects in children with minimal CF lung disease. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Increasingly, {{proteins}} {{are delivered}} to the respiratory tract as an aerosol, and clinical efficacy is dependent on optimal delivery of the protein in an intact form. The object {{of this study was}} to compare the in vivo and in vitro results of two aerosol delivery systems for the aerosolization of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (<b>rhDNase)</b> in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Patients with CF who were to be initiated on <b>rhDNase</b> were randomized either to the Hudson nebulizer and Pulmo-Aide compressor or to the Sidestream nebulizer driven by the CR 50 air compressor. An in vitro study was performed in six sets of the two aerosol delivery systems. One hundred and seventy three patients were randomized in this open study, where <b>rhDNase</b> was administered for 7 days. Improvements in pulmonary function were observed in both groups following 1 week of therapy with <b>rhDNase.</b> Changes in the Sidestream/CR 50 and Hudson/ Pulmo-Aide groups, respectively, were: 16 and 11 % for forced expiratory volume in one second (p= 0. 14); 12 and 10 % for forced vital capacity (p= 0. 70); and 14 and 7 % for forced expiratory flow at 25 – 75 % of expiration (FEF 25 – 75) (p= 0. 18). ...|$|E
40|$|A 28 -year-old neuromuscular patient chronically {{treated with}} nocturnal noninvasive {{ventilation}} developed pulmonary lobar atelectasis and daytime hypoxemia. Twenty four-hour 5 Â L/min oxygen was begun, while mechanical cough assist aids were applied for seven days. In {{the following three}} days, treatment with nebulized Dornase alpha (<b>rhDNase)</b> b. i. d. was tested, without any significant improvement. On 11 and 13 th days <b>rhDNase</b> was instilled by flexible bronchoscopy. A rapid resolution of the atelectasis was observed with relief of hypoxemia, without significant side effects. On day 16 the patient was discharged without oxygen requirements. In non-intubated neuromuscular patients with atelectasis who do not respond successfully to non-invasive treatments intrabronchial instillation of <b>rhDNase</b> may safely help to improve airway clearance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Airway {{obstruction}} {{in acute}} asthma {{is the result}} of airway smooth muscle contraction, inflammation and mucus plugging. Case reports suggest that mucolytic therapy might be beneficial in acute asthma. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the efficacy of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (<b>rhDNase)</b> in addition to standard treatment at the emergency department in children with an asthma exacerbation. METHODS: In a multicentre randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial, 121 children brought to the emergency room for a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 5 mg nebulised <b>rhDNase</b> or placebo following the second dose of bronchodilators. An asthma score (scale 5 - 15) was assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h. The primary outcome variable was the asthma score 1 h after the study medication. RESULTS: One hour after the study medication the asthma score in the <b>rhDNase</b> group showed an adjusted mean decrease from baseline of 1. 0 (95 % CI 0. 5 to 1. 6) points compared with 0. 7 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 1. 2) points in the placebo group (mean difference 0. 4 (95 % CI - 0. 2 to 1. 0) points; p = 0. 23). The asthma score over the study period of 24 h also did not differ significantly between the <b>rhDNase</b> and placebo group (mean difference 0. 2 (95 % CI - 0. 3 to 0. 7) points, p = 0. 40). The duration of oxygen supplementation and number of bronchodilator treatments in the first 24 h were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Adding a single dose of nebulised <b>rhDNase</b> to standard treatment in the emergency room has no beneficial effects in children with moderate to severe acute asthma...|$|E

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of 12 patients with CF younger than 5 years of age, attending the University of Michigan Cystic Fibrosis Center (Ann Arbor, MI) was conducted. The changes in the HRCT and CXR score from baseline to day 100 of therapy were assessed using a previously validated scoring system.

40|$|The {{present study}} focused on {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF), who were on maintenance therapy with recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (<b>rhDNase),</b> {{with the aim of}} comparing efficacy and possible side effects of nebulisation of <b>rhDNase</b> when taken before bedtime with efficacy and side effects when taken after waking up. A randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study group was used. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) CF, 2) stable clinical condition and 3) <b>rhDNase</b> maintenance therapy. Patients in group I inhaled <b>rhDNase</b> before bedtime and a placebo after waking up in weeks 1 - 2. The protocol was reversed during weeks 3 - 4. Group II patients performed the reverse of this sequence. Patients continued with their daily routine sputum expectoration. The primary end-point was classified as the maximal instantaneous forced flow when 25 % of the forced vital capacity remained to be exhaled (MEF 25 %). Pulmonary functions tests were performed on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. At 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks arterial oxygen saturation and cough frequency were measured during the night. A total of 24 patients completed the study. The mean (range) age of the patients was 13 (6 - 19) yrs. MEF 25 %, taken to be the primary end-point, did not show a significant difference between nebulisation of <b>rhDNase</b> before bedtime compared with when taken after waking up. Nocturnal cough, oxygen saturation, and other secondary end-points were not significantly different between the two study periods. In conclusion, the present study found that it is equally effective and safe to nebulise recombinant human deoxyribonuclease before bedtime compared with when performed after waking up in children with cystic fibrosis, who are on maintenance treatment with recombinant human deoxyribonuclease.

40|$|AbstractRecombinant human DNase I (<b>rhDNase)</b> {{has been}} shown to improve {{pulmonary}} function in patients treated for up to 6 months. A cohort of 52 cystic fibrosis patients with a FVC > 40 % predicted were enrolled into an open label study in order to evaluate longer-term effects of <b>rhDNase.</b> They received 2 · 5 mg <b>rhDNase</b> twice daily for 6 months followed by a 2 -week wash-out period, and for the subsequent 18 months were treated with <b>rhDNase</b> once daily. Twenty-six male and 26 female patients with a mean FVC of 2 · 941 and FEV 1 of 1 · 471 were recruited. Thirteen patients did not complete the study; there were seven deaths, three patients withdrew consent and three patients were lost to follow-up. Improvement in pulmonary function was seen following treatment and changes were evaluated as mean percent change from baseline. The maximum improvement occurred in the first month followed by a plateau at a lower level of improvement. The mean improvement in FEV 1 over the first month was 13 · 3 % (range 12 – 14 · 1 %), followed by a plateau at around 7 · 1 % (range 4 · 6 – 11 · 0 %) for the subsequent 23 months. Mean FVC was improved by 12 · 03 % (range 9 · 0 – 14 · 3 %) over the first month and subsequently 4 · 2 % (range − 2 · 2 – 10 · 2 %). The effects on pulmonary function were similar for both treatment doses of <b>rhDNase.</b> There was also a steady improvement in weight from a mean of 54 · 2 kg to 55 · 7 kg {{at the end of the}} study. Analysis of the results of only those patients who completed the full 2 -yr treatment period show that changes in pulmonary function and weight were similar to those observed for the whole group. The death rate and adverse event profile were consistent with that seen in a cystic fibrosis population. This study confirms that longer-term treatment with <b>rhDNase</b> maintains the improvement in lung function, is associated with weight gain and has a good safety profile...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Children with airway malacia {{often have}} {{protracted}} courses of airway infections, because dynamic airway collapse during coughing results in impaired mucociliary clearance. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the effect of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (<b>rhDNase)</b> on the recovery of respiratory symptoms in children with airway malacia and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: In a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, 40 children with airway malacia and LRTI were randomly assigned to receive either 2. 5 mg nebulized <b>rhDNase</b> or placebo twice daily for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the cough diary score (CDS) (scale 0 - 5) from baseline to the second week of treatment. Secondary endpoints were VAS symptom scores for cough, dyspnea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum, need for an antibiotic course, and lung function data (FVC, FEV(1), FEF(75), R(int(e))). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean change in CDSs from baseline between the <b>rhDNase</b> group and the placebo group (mean difference for daytime 0. 19 (95 % CI - 0. 53 to 0. 90); for nighttime 0. 38 (95 % CI - 0. 30 to 1. 05).
