We apply gradient-based tessellation to magnetograms of 59 active regions to identify flux fragments. First, we find that the distribution function of flux fragments in these regions is highly consistent with lognormal form, which is the most direct evidence yet obtained that repeated <b>random</b> <b>bifurcation</b> dominates fragmentation and coalescence in all active regions. Second, we apply nonparametric statistical methods to the variance of the lognormal distribution of fragment flux, the flare X-ray energy output of the active regions, and kinetic helicity measurements in the upper convection zone to show that there is no significant statistical relationship between the amount of fragmentation of an active region's flux at photospheric levels and the amplitude of either its average kinetic helicity density in the upper convection zone or its X-ray flare energy output...|$|E
40|$|Abstmet-This paper {{addresses}} the static and centralized routing of voice and data traffic in burst switched networks. Since voice and data have markedly different traffic characteristics and performance require-ments, their interaction in a unified switching and transmission struc-ture greatly impacts their performance. Voice {{performance in a}} burst switched network is primarily measured by end-to-end freeze-out while figures-of-merit for data include end-to-end delay and stability that may be jeopardized due to the interaction with the higher priority voice traf-fic. We assume that our routing allows <b>random</b> <b>bifurcation</b> in voice and data paths and preemptive priorities for voice requirements. We first study routing of voice only, by using a multicommodity flow model with linearized link losses and average network loss as a min-imization objective. Solving the resulting linear program, we observe that optimal routing strategies prefer to freeze a requirement {{at an early stage}} of its path rather than those requirements that are close to their destinations. We then study the voicehata interaction at the link level using an available fluid-flow model, and translate the combined link performance as a maximum flow constraint on a link. This constraint may have undesirable effects on the voice, such as introducing routes with flow absorbing loops, and unfair freezing of some requirements. We include all conflicting multiple objectives and constraints in a linear programming formulation and show bow parameters can be tuned to produce desirable voice and data paths. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{geometry}} of bifurcations in natural branching systems often reflects optimization constraints during formation, leading to, for instance, a planar {{arrangement of the}} branches (segments). The present study aimed at testing whether bifurcations in 3 D neuronal branching patterns also follow this general property. A measure for the flatness of bifurcations is the apex angle of the right circular cone enwrapping the bifurcation (cone angle) and earlier applied to dendritic bifurcations [1]. Recently, the cone angle was used by Kim et al. [2] {{in an analysis of}} bifurcations in Purkinje cells and retinal ganglion cells.

40|$|Abstract. —Random {{sampling}} {{probabilities of}} evolutionary trees {{have been used}} to compare taxonomic classifications generated from different data sets, to test biogeographic hypotheses, and to study patterns of speciation. In this paper, I analyze a model in which speciation occurs by <b>random</b> <b>bifurcation</b> of existing lineages. A method of calculating the probability of an evo-lutionary tree by counting the possible arrangements of its nodes, branches, and terminal taxa is presented. Probabilities that sets of species are distinct clades are also given. The results are applicable to any number of taxa. Probabilities of trees are not altered by the absence of extinct or unstudied taxa. Applications of the results to systematics and further problems in the prob-ability of evolutionary trees are discussed. [Biogeography; consensus trees; dendrograms; evo-lutionary histories; evolutionary trees; tree comparison metrics. ] Relationships among groups of taxa are often depicted as an evolutionary tree. The random sampling probabilities of these trees have been used in systematic biology in at least three contexts. First, they {{have been used to}} compare classifications de-rived from different data sets (Rohlf, 1982). Second, biogeographers have used them to calculate the probability that two area cladograms match (Simberloff et al., 1981; Simberloff, 1987; Page, 1991); a similar {{question is whether or not}} evolutionary trees of host and parasite taxa are similar (Page, 1990).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a number of}} related topics in random {{dynamical}} systems theory are studied: local attractors and attractor-repeller pairs, the exponential dichotomy spectrum and bifurcation theory. We review two existing theories {{in the literature on}} local attractors for random dynamical systems on compact metric spaces and associated attractor-repeller pairs and Morse decompositions, namely, local weak attractors and local pullback attractors. We extend the theory of past and future attractor-repeller pairs for nonautonomous systems to the setting of random dynamical systems, and define local strong attractors, which both pullback and forward attract a random neighbourhood. Some examples are given to illustrate the nature of these different attractor concepts. For linear systems considered on the projective space, it is shown that a local strong attractor that attracts a uniform neighbourhood is an object with sufficient properties to prove an analogue of Selgrade's Theorem on the existence of a unique finest Morse decomposition. We develop the dichotomy spectrum for random dynamical systems and investigate its relationship to the Lyapunov spectrum. We demonstrate the utility of the dichotomy spectrum for <b>random</b> <b>bifurcation</b> theory in the following example. Crauel and Flandoli [Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations, 10 (2) : 259 – 274, 1998] studied the stochastic differential equation formed from the deterministic pitchfork normal form with additive noise. It was shown that for all parameter values this system possesses a unique invariant measure given by a globally attracting random fixed point with negative Lyapunov exponent, and hence the deterministic bifurcation scenario is destroyed by additive noise. Here, however, we show that one may still observe qualitative changes in the dynamics at the underlying deterministic bifurcation point, in terms of: a loss of hyperbolicity of the dichotomy spectrum; a loss of uniform attractivity; a qualitative change in the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents; and that whilst for small parameter values the systems are topologically equivalent, there is a loss of uniform topological equivalence.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of natural branching systems generally reflects functional optimization. A common property {{is that their}} bifurcations are planar and that daughter segments do not turn back {{in the direction of}} the parent segment. The present study investigates whether this also applies to bifurcations in 3 D dendritic arborizations. This question was earlier addressed in a first study of flatness of 3 D dendritic bifurcations by Uylings and Smit (1975), who used the apex angle of the right circular cone as flatness measure. The present study was inspired by recent renewed interest in this measure. Because we encountered ourselves shortcomings of this cone angle measure, the search for an optimal measure for flatness of 3 D bifurcation was the second aim of our study. Therefore, a number of measures has been developed in order to quantify flatness and orientation properties of spatial bifurcations. All these measures have been expressed mathematically in terms of the three bifurcation angles between the three pairs of segments in the bifurcation. The flatness measures have been applied and evaluated to bifurcations in rat cortical pyramidal cell basal and apical dendritic trees, and to <b>random</b> spatial <b>bifurcations.</b> Dendritic and <b>random</b> <b>bifurcations</b> show significant different flatness measure distributions, supporting the conclusion that dendritic bifurcations are significantly more flat than <b>random</b> <b>bifurcations.</b> Basal dendritic bifurcations also show the property that their parent segments are generally aligned oppositely to the bisector of the angle between their daughter segments, resulting in “symmetrical” configurations. Such geometries may arise when during neuronal development the segments at a newly formed bifurcation are subjected to elastic tensions, which force the bifurcation into an equilibrium planar shape. Apical bifurcations, however, have parent segments oppositely aligned with one of the daughter segments. These geometries arise in the case of side branching from an existing apical main stem. The aligned “apical” parent and “apical” daughter segment form together with the side branch daughter segment already geometrically a flat configuration. These properties are clearly reflected in the flatness measure distributions. Comparison of the different flatness measures made clear that they all capture flatness properties in a different way. Selection of the most appropriate measure thus depends on the question of research. For our purpose of quantifying flatness and orientation of the segments, the dihedral angle β was found to be the most discriminative and applicable single measure. Alternatively, the parent elevation and azimuth angle formed an orthogonal pair of measures most clearly demonstrating the dendritic bifurcation “symmetry” properties...|$|R
40|$|Computing cone angles {{from the}} first {{bifurcation}} segments In the main text (Figure 1) cone angles were computed for complete branches, i. e. for each branch from the bifurcation point to the next bifurcation or terminal point, because these points are morphologically well defined. In Figure S 2 we show the same analysis but for bifurcations to the closest point available in the reconstruction. These first points were selected by those who performed each neuron reconstruction and the corresponding segment lengths tend to be quite variable. Though the proportion of planar bifurcations are smaller than in Figure 1, the difference with <b>random</b> <b>bifurcations</b> remains highly significant for all (KS-test, p-value = 10 - 5).

The carbon-strip suspension of a pantograph, along which contact with the catenary occurs, is subjected to harmonic and stochastic contact-force excitations.

A single-degree-of- freedom model of the carbon-strip suspension with nonlinear stiffness is developed using parameter values of the DSA X pantograph.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the effects of turbulent flow on the random dynamics of structurally nonlinear airfoil. A secondary objective is to articulate a more comprehensive picture of {{the contribution of the}} longitudinal component of turbulence, as experienced by the airfoil, be it linear or nonlinear. In this regard, a systematic and detailed numerical analysis of the airfoil experiencing <b>random</b> flutter/Hopf <b>bifurcation</b> is presented. Some aspects of the divergence/pitchfork problem are also discussed. The airfoil is modelled as a flexibly mounted rigid flat plate with degrees-of-freedom in pitch and heave. The principal nonlinearity considered is a hardening cubic torsional spring. The aerodynamics is incompressible and linear. Unsteady aerodynamic effects due to arbitrary motion and turbulence are modelled. Both longitudinal and vertical components of the Gaussian turbulence are considered. Longitudinal turbulence acts as a parametric excitation, whereas the latter represents an external forcing. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to solve numerically the system of random differential equations. The time history solutions are then studied in terms of their mean-square, probability density function and power spectral density. The largest Lyapunov exponent is also calculated. The bifurcation, stability and response characteristics of the airfoil are examined. For the linear airfoil, it is found that the coalescence flutter speed is always advanced by the longitudinal component of turbulence, and generally dominated by the very low frequency range of the excitation. Divergence can be either advanced or postponed, but the magnitude of the shift is not significant compared with flutter. Furthermore, it is shown that in general longitudinal turbulence decreases the overall stability of the airfoil, be it linear or nonlinear. For the nonlinear airfoil, it is the vertical component of turbulence that determines the essential features of the stochastic bifurcation and the qualitative characteristics of the response. The interplay between turbulence and nonlinear stiffness has {{a significant impact on the}} probability structure of the aeroelastic response. Uni-, bi- and double bi-modal distributions are observed, and found to occur at different airspeeds depending on which state variable is considered. Furthermore, the spectral content displays noise-controlled, and noise-induced, time scales...|$|R
