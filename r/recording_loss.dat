40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{assess the}} impact of {{different}} lifestyle factors on periodontal health of adults. (2) To {{assess the impact}} of overall/combined lifestyle variable (calculated by health practice index [HPI]) on periodontal health of adults. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study consisting of a structured questionnaire on HPI, oral health-related behavior, and personal habits as well as sociodemographic variables was conducted on 800 subjects aged 20 – 50 years attending dental outreach set-ups of Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Manipal. Clinical examination for periodontal status was done by <b>recording</b> <b>loss</b> of attachment scores using community periodontal index (FDI/WHO- 1982). Statistical analysis was done by bivariate analysis using Chi-square followed by multivariate analysis to obtain adjusted odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval. Results: After adjusting for all the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression analysis, the variables that showed an independent association with periodontitis were age, location, marital status, smoking, hours of sleep per night, physical activity, and overall poor lifestyles. Conclusion: Our results support studying a combined approach using various lifestyle behaviors for controlling chronic periodontitis. Necessary public health action on conditions which determine unhealthy lifestyle behaviors across population is needed which is possible by patient's involvement in self-care by promoting healthy lifestyles...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is in progress}} on the corona loss and radio interference characteristics of standard transmission line conductors energized with high voltage direct current. Corona loss has been measured on a single "Drake" ACSR conductor (1. 108 in. dia.) and on a two-conductor Drake bundle with 18 -inch spacing between conductors. These conductor arrangements were installed, in turn, on a 370 -foot outdoor line. A special shielding circuit permits conductor corona losses to be metered separately from both insulator leakage losses and the corona losses from connecting cable and grading ring assemblies. One type of test on this installation is conducted by recording corona loss currents while varying the voltage applied to the conductor in increments during periods of constand weather. A second type of test is conducted by <b>recording</b> <b>loss</b> currents while holding constant voltage on the test line for long periods under variable weather conditions. From results obtained to date, it appears that in dry weather single-conductor losses and two-conductor losses ar eequal, but negative losses are higher than positive losses {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3. In wet weather, losses from the two-conductor bundle, and negative losses from the single conductor, are all equal. (Corona loss data in wet weather for the single conductor at positive voltage is not yet available.) At present, test station facilities are being extended by the erection of a second line to enable simultaneous comparative measurements on conductors to be made; more comprehensive corona loss measurements are under way, and an investigation of radio interference is in progress.

40|$|Process of {{imperial}} army military unit`s regimental libraries establishment {{is described in}} the article. That libraries were established or was already exist on Over Dnieper land Ukraine at XIX – beginning XX century. Author conducted short review historiography of the issue, focusing on studies of the different times researchers: O. K. Puzyrevs"koho, Z. P. Levashovoyi, S. M. Lyutova, A. M. Panchenko, M. Yu. Matveyeva. Attention draw to regulatory environment, that determined main principals of establishment and operations regimental libraries. In particular, it was analyzed: decree regarding educating of enlisted man (1859), ―Policy directive regarding Officer Assembly in regimental unit‖ (1884), «Internal Service Regulations» (1910), etc. Purpose of establishment, ways of acquisition regimental libraries based on military historian’s scientific researches XIX – beginning XX century were determined. Library’s collection analysis was conducted. During research {{it was determined that}} majority of the regimental libraries haven’t got professional and special literature, they were supplied on spontaneous way by entertaining issues. Regimental libraries operations were regulated by special rules, enforced by regimental unit Officer Assembly. Librarian were appointed for library operation purposes. Responsibilit i-es of a librarian were: store, cataloging, delivery of books, <b>recording</b> <b>loss</b> of an issue and money spend form libraries fund. Librarian operations and library stock has been controlling by special officers’ board. Also, author mentioned that one of the main disadvantages of Over Dnieper land Ukrainian Regimental libraries was their continual reestablishment. It was related to military unit relocation during which issues were resold or lost. Issues were stored in improper premises. It was determined by research that among Over Dnieper land Ukrainian Regimental libraries Sevastopol Navy Library were distinguished by its uniqueness. It has the one of the biggest book collection. Library of 11 Izyum Dragoon Guards has ukrainophone literature department, even Ukrainian language was forbidden...|$|E
