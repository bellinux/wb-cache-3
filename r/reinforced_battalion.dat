5|$|The {{third stage}} of the {{operation}} centred on the capture of Drvar, the secondary objective of the overall offensive. VRS defences around the town held until 14 September, when Gotovina detached a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> from the 7th Guards Brigade held in the reserve of OG North and deployed it against Drvar. A renewed push by OGs West and South, combined with a rapid advance by the ARBiH 5th Corps against Bosanski Petrovac threatened to isolate Drvar, and the VRS withdrew from the town.|$|E
5|$|Two events then aided {{the final}} advance. First, to lessen {{frontline}} infantry casualties, {{it was decided}} to barrage remaining German strongpoints with 155 mm guns. Secondly, to assist the 1st Infantry Division, a battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment, US 28th Infantry Division, had been moved up from the V Corps sector on 18 October to close a gap between forward 26th Infantry Regiment elements within the city. The defensive mission of this new battalion was changed on 19–20 October to closely support the urban assault, participating as the depleted regiment's missing third battalion. On 21 October, soldiers of the 26th Infantry Regiment, supported by the <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> of the 110th Infantry Regiment finally conquered central Aachen; that day also marked the surrender of the last German garrison, in the Hotel Quellenhof, ending the battle for the city.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
25|$|A {{new type}} of unit called defense team (守備隊) is being introduced. These are formed by {{elements}} of de-activated brigades under each area defense command. The strength of a defense team may vary from one or more <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalions,</b> making it roughly equal to a regiment. The team CO is usually a full colonel.|$|R

5|$|At 02:45, the Chinese began a {{sixth and}} final attack {{with a heavy}} mortar barrage which inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the remaining Rangers, including Cummings, who was killed instantly by a mortar shell and Puckett, who was severely wounded. The Chinese then sent a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> of 600 infantry at the hill, while simultaneously striking other elements of Task Force Dolvin, preventing artillery from providing effective support. Without artillery support of their own, and low on ammunition, they were overwhelmed by the subsequent Chinese attack. The Chinese forces swarmed the hill in overwhelming numbers, {{and many of the}} Rangers were shot and killed in their foxholes or stabbed with bayonets. The company was destroyed in the fighting, with the survivors retreating from the hill. Three Rangers later chased away Chinese troops as they tried to capture the severely wounded Puckett. The remaining Rangers gathered at an assembly area {{at the base of the}} hill under First Sergeant Charles L. Pitts, the highest ranking unwounded member of the company, and withdrew. The Rangers suffered over 80 percent casualties on Hill 205; of the 51 who captured the hill, 10 were killed or missing and another 31 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier-General George Wootten, {{commander}} of the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade in the 6th Australian Division, was ordered to Giarabub but a lack of transport restricted the operation to a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion,</b> which had to end the siege in ten days. Wootten Force was assembled from the 2/9th Australian Infantry Battalion, reinforced by an infantry company, a mortar platoon, a machine-gun platoon, an anti-aircraft platoon and a battery of the 4th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery (4th RHA) with twelve 25-pounder guns. Wootten Force had no air support, little ammunition and no tanks. The Australians reconnoitred the Giarabub defences on 12 and 16 March, finding a track across the southern marshes and {{a gap in the}} frontier wire large enough for vehicles. An Italian force in trucks tried to outflank the reconnaissance party and were driven off by artillery.|$|E

The U.S. troops were delivered to the landing location by a naval transport force of six landing craft tanks and one transport destroyer (...) , escorted by four other destroyers (the same destroyers that were to have joined TF18 three days earlier). A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted the naval landing force.

500|$|At 12:00 {{the next}} day, August 17, Eighth Army ordered the 27th Infantry {{to move its}} {{headquarters}} and a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> [...] "without delay" [...] to a point across the Kumho River [...] north of Taegu on the road from Tabu-dong to Sangju [...] "to secure Taegu from enemy penetration" [...] from that direction.

The 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry, a platoon of the Heavy Mortar Company, {{and most of the}} 8th Field Artillery Battalion moved north to Ch'ilgok where the ROK 1st Division command post was located. By nightfall, the entire 27th Regiment was north of Taegu on the Tabu-dong road, reinforced by C Company, 73rd Tank Battalion. US Army commanders also ordered the 37th Field Artillery Battalion to move from the area around Kyongju and P'ohang-dong, where a heavy battle had been in progress for days, for attachment to the US 27th Infantry Regiment in order to reinforce the 8th Field Artillery Battalion above Taegu. It arrived there the next day. At the front, ROK 1st Division commander Brigadier General Paik Sun-yup assumed senior command of the 27th Infantry and the other US units, to the chagrin of Michaelis.|$|E
500|$|Allied {{intelligence}} {{had identified}} the coastal defenders as a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> (800–1000 men) of the 716th Infantry Division. This was a static defensive division estimated to consist up to 50% of non-German troops, mostly Russian volunteers and German Volksdeutsche. The recently activated but capable 352nd Infantry Division {{was believed to}} be [...] inland at Saint-Lô and was regarded as the most likely force to be committed to a counter-attack. As part of Rommel's strategy to concentrate defenses at the water's edge, the 352nd had been ordered forward in March, taking over responsibility for the defense of the portion of the Normandy coast in which Omaha was located. As part of this reorganization, the 352nd also took under its command two battalions of the 726th Grenadier Regiment (part of the 716th Static Infantry Division) as well as the 439th Ost-Battalion, which had been attached to the 726th. Omaha fell mostly within 'Coast Defense Sector 2', which stretched westward from Colleville and allocated to the 916th Grenadier Regiment, with the third battalion 726th Grenadier Regiment attached. Two companies of the 726th manned strongpoints in the Vierville area while two companies of the 916th occupied the St. Laurent area strongpoints in the center of Omaha. These positions were supported by the artillery of the first and fourth battalions of the 352nd Artillery Regiment (twelve 105mm and four 150mm howitzers respectively). The two remaining companies of the 916th formed a reserve at Formigny, three kilometers (2mi) inland. East of Colleville, 'Coast Defense Sector 3' was the responsibility of the remainder of the 726th Grenadier Regiment. Two companies were deployed at the coast, one in the most easterly series of strongpoints, with artillery support provided by the third battalion of the 352nd Artillery Regiment. The area reserve, comprising the two battalions of the 915th Grenadier Regiment and known as 'Kampfgruppe Meyer', was located south-east of Bayeux outside the immediate Omaha area.|$|E

Motor patrols were immediately dispatched by Col.

As Australian forces were fighting around Mubo and Bobdubi, Allied planners determined the need to relieve some of the logistics burden on their aircraft by seizing Nassau Bay, which was about [...] south of the Allies' ultimate objective. Over {{the course of several}} days in early July, one <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> of the 162nd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Archibald MacKechnie, made an unopposed amphibious landing at Nassau Bay. They were supported by the Australian 2/6th Infantry Battalion, which created a diversion to draw Japanese troops away from the landing beach. Elements of the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) provided flank security and after the landing, the US troops established a beachhead at Nassau Bay. Following the initial landing, two more battalions of the 162nd Infantry Regiment were landed at Nassau Bay along with Australian and US artillery support.|$|E
2500|$|The 55th Division {{attacked}} at [...] on 8 August, into an easterly wind which with mist, {{dust and}} smoke from a German counter-barrage, made visual signalling impossible and delayed {{reports to the}} 55th Division headquarters until after [...] Next to the French, a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> of the 165th Brigade, advanced over the spur south of Guillemont and was then stopped by German defensive fire and driven under cover in shell-holes. Bombers had moved along Cochrane Alley, south-east into Maurepas ravine and established a trench-block and found themselves unsupported on both flanks, as the French attack had also been stopped by the Germans, south-east of Maltz Horn Farm. The right-hand battalion of the 164th Brigade was held up by uncut wire at the south-western edge of Guillemont, where the infantry tried to dig in beyond grenade range, before retiring to their jumping-off trenches. The left-hand battalion broke through, {{either side of the}} quarry at the west side of Guillemont and entered the village but reinforcements sent to hold the captured front line behind them, were bombed out by a German counter-attack from the south. German machine-guns began to sweep no-man's-land and isolated the British troops in the village.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{when the}} threat of {{invasion}} of the United Kingdom decreased, {{the decision was made}} to transfer the Australian forces there to the Middle East. The 18th Brigade arrived there in early January 1941. Around this time, the 2nd AIF was reorganised and each brigade was reduced from four battalions to three. As a result, the 2/11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade. At the same time also, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 7th Division. Following this, on 21 March 1941, the brigade took part in an attack on an Italian stronghold at Giarabub, [...] south of Bardia. Although the fortress was held by about 1,500 Italians supported by artillery, the Australian force dispatched only consisted of a <b>reinforced</b> <b>battalion</b> due to supply difficulties. Setting out on 10 March from Siwa, the assault began early on the morning of 21 March from the south over marshy ground. Led by the 2/9th Battalion with machine-gun and mortar support from the 2/12th and 2/10th Battalions, the attack was put in from the south while the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack from the north at the strongest point of the fortress. A heavy sandstorm obscured visibility, which hindered the supporting artillery and resulted in a number of casualties when one company moved beyond the barrage. Nevertheless, heavy fighting followed and resistance continued until 2:00pm in the afternoon when the Italians surrendered. About 250 Italians were killed and 1,300 captured for the loss of 17 Australians killed and 77 wounded. Following the attack, the 18th Brigade returned to Ikingi Maryut.|$|E
