The species reaches sexual maturity at around , and spawning takes place at different times, with some populations spawning year round, while others only spawn at certain times of the year. The species is a well known game fish, taken by a variety of fishing methods and is a well rated table fish. Large amounts of the species are taken as bycatch in tuna and shark fishing operations and marketed.|$|E
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. <b>Rainbow</b> <b>runners</b> (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|R
5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs.

50|$|Today, the {{productive}} reef areas in Piñas Bay, fished by boats from the famous Tropic Star Lodge, {{and the many}} other reefs and islands along the Pacific coast of Panama, particularly Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, still have probably the best fishing for black marlin in the Western Hemisphere. Black marlin averaging 200 to 500 lb hunt schools of <b>rainbow</b> <b>runners,</b> black skipjack, and other prey over these structures along with large Pacific sailfish and dorado. Occasional specimens will reach well over 600 lb. Slow trolling with bridle-rigged live skipjack is the predominant technique used to target black marlin by the Tropic Star fleet. At Coiba Island, the Hannibal Banks is among most productive areas where trolling lures is employed successfully.|$|R
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is {{the largest}} member of the genus Caranx, and the fifth-largest {{member of the family}} Carangidae (exceeded by the yellowtail amberjack, greater amberjack, leerfish and <b>rainbow</b> <b>runner),</b> with a recorded maximum length of 170cm and a weight of 80 kg. Specimens this size are very rare, with the species only occasionally seen at lengths greater than 80cm. It appears the Hawaiian Islands contain the largest fish, where individuals over 100lbs are common. Elsewhere in the world, only three individuals over 100lbs have been reported to the IGFA.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a minor}} {{recreational}} fishery for <b>rainbow</b> <b>runner</b> {{in parts of the}} world. Often they are taken while trolling for other species such as tuna and mackerel, but are often targeted inshore by anglers on the west coast of the Americas using surface 'popper' style lures. The fish are caught {{on a wide variety of}} lures and baits, with deep diving lures, surface lures and even saltwater flies used to good measure. The species takes a wide variety of baits including live and cut fish, squid, octopus, and probably other crustaceans resembling their natural food. They are renowned as gamefish, especially at larger sizes. The species themselves are also commonly used as bait, either as live bait or dead bait rigged to be trolled behind game boats for larger species such as billfish and tuna.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rainbow</b> <b>runner</b> is {{the only}} species in the {{monotypic}} genus Elagatis, {{which is one of}} thirty genera in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are Perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species Seriola bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the amberjacks. This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before it was concluded the species warranted a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera. In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir, which he used in combination with the species name of bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated. Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the amberjack genus, Seriola, being the most basal member identified of the carangid subfamily Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies.|$|E

50|$|These {{techniques}} are still often used, with one niche specialty being {{the use of}} live bait such as <b>rainbow</b> <b>runners</b> to tease dogtooth tuna within range of light tackle and fly-casting anglers. High speed jigging {{with a variety of}} metal lures has increased tremendously in popularity {{in the last several years}} as advancements in tackle technology have resulted in lightweight rods and reels that are capable of handling heavy spectra-type braided lines. Some of the more popular destinations for anglers seeking this species include Okinawa and other islands of southern Japan, Rodrigues and other Indian Ocean islands such as the Maldives, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Bali and elsewhere in Nusa Tenggara in Indonesia, the Great Barrier Reef and its outlying atolls, and many Western Pacific islands such as Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Palau.|$|R
40|$|Bycatch {{taken by}} the tuna purse-seine fishery from the Indian Ocean pelagic {{ecosystem}} was estimated from data collected by scientific observers aboard Soviet purse seiners in the western Indian Ocean (WIO) during 1986 – 92. A total of 494 sets on free-swimming schools, whale-shark-associated schools, whale-associated schools, and log-associated schools were analyzed. More than 40 fish species and other marine animals were recorded. Among them only two species, yellow-fin and skipjack tunas, were target species. Average levels of bycatch were 0. 518 metric tons (t) per set, and 27. 1 t per 1000 t of target species. The total annual purse-seine catch of yellowfin and skipjack tunas by principal fishing nations in the WIO during 1985 – 94 was 118, 000 – 277, 000 t. Nonrecorded annual bycatch for this period was estimated at 944 – 2270 t of pelagic oceanic sharks, 720 – 1877 t of <b>rainbow</b> <b>runners,</b> 705 – 1836 t of dolphinfishes, 507 – 1322 t of triggerfishes, 113 – 294 t of wahoo, 104 – 251 t of billfishes, 53 – 112 t of mobulas and mantas, 35 – 89 t of mackerel scad, 9 – 24 t of barracudas, and 67 – 174 t of other fishes. In addition, turtle bycatch and whale mortalities may have occurred. Because the bycatches were not recorded by some purse-seine vessels, {{it was not possible}} to assess the full impact of the fisheries on the pelagic ecosystem of the Indian Ocean. The first step to solving this problem is for the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to establish a pro-gram in which scientific observers are placed on board tuna purse-seine and longline vessels fishing in the WIO...|$|R
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is a schooling {{species as}} a juvenile, transitioning {{to a more}} solitary fish with well defined home ranges as an adult. Adults do school to form spawning aggregations or temporarily while hunting, with evidence from laboratory studies indicates bluefin trevally are able to coordinate these aggregations over coral reefs based on the release of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) from the reef. DMSP is a naturally occurring chemical produced by marine algae {{and to a lesser}} extent corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae. The number of fish present in an area is also influenced by tidal factors and possibly the abundance of prey and other environmental factors. Tracking studies in Hawaii have found bluefin trevally patrol back and forth along a home range of patch reef walls during the day, only stopping for variable periods where major depth changes or discontinuities in the reef were present. Several fish patrol the same reef patch, reversing direction where the others do. While most fish patrol the one reef, some have been observed to make excursions to nearby reefs, before returning to their home reef later. Night time movements are less extensive than daytime movements, with the trevally moving rapidly between several small reef sections, before slowing down and milling in one patch for around an hour. The fish living in a particular region congregate in one area at night, before returning to their individual daytime range during the day. The reason for this congregation is unclear, but may be important to the social structure of the species. Long term studies have found the fish may range up to 10.2km over several months, however is much less restricted in its movements than its relative, the giant trevally. A Hawaiian biomass study found the species to be one of the most abundant large predators in the islands, however it is less abundant in the heavily exploited Main Hawaiian Islands compared to the remote Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The main difference in these populations was the relative lack of large adult fish in the inhabited areas compared to the remote, unfished regions. A study on carangids caught during a fishing tournament in Hawaii found the bluefin trevally is the most common trevally species taken, accounting for over 80% of the carangid catch. The authors note that this may not only reflect its abundance, but also it vulnerability to specific fishing methods used in the tournament. Apart from the typical predator-prey relationship the species shows (described later), an individual of the species has been seen to rub itself against the skin of a Galapagos shark, apparently to rid itself of parasites. This behaviour is also observed in <b>rainbow</b> <b>runner</b> and is a rare example of a commensal cleaner relationship where the cleaner does not gain anything.|$|E

40|$|None supplied. From summary: Fish {{that pass}} through a {{hydroelectric}} turbine may not be killed directly, but may nonetheless experience sublethal stresses that will increase their susceptibility to predators (indirect mortality).

The most commonly used laboratory technique for assessing susceptibility to predation is the predator preference test. In this report, we evaluate the field application of a new technique that may be valuable for assessing indirect mortality, based on changes in a behavioral response to a startling stimulus (akin to perceiving an approaching predator).

The most commonly used laboratory technique for assessing susceptibility to predation is the predator preference test. In this report, we evaluate the field application of a new technique that may be valuable for assessing indirect mortality, based on changes in a behavioral response to a startling stimulus (akin to perceiving an approaching predator). The behavioral response is a rapid movement commonly referred to as a startle response, escape response, or C-shape, based on the characteristic body position assumed by the fish. When viewed from above, a startled fish bends into a C-shape, then springs back and swims away in a direction different from its original orientation. This predator avoidance (escape) behavior can be compromised by sublethal stresses that temporarily stun or disorient the fish. Initial studies demonstrated that turbulence created in a small laboratory tank can alter escape behavior. As a next step, we converted our laboratory design to a more portable unit, transported it to Alden Research Laboratory in Holden, Massachusetts, and used it to test fish that passed uninjured through a pilot-scale turbine <b>runner.</b> <b>Rainbow</b> trout were either passed through the turbine or exposed to handling stresses, and their behavior was subsequently evaluated. Groups of five fish were given a startle stimulus (a visual and pressure wave cue) and filmed with a high-speed (500 frames per s) video camera. The reactions of each group of fish to the startle stimulus were filmed at nominally 1 -, 5 -, and 15 -min post-exposure. We compared the behaviors of 70 fish passed through the turbine and another 70 under control conditions (either transferred from the holding tank or injected into the Alden loop downstream of turbine). The resulting image files were analyzed for a variety of behavioral measures including: presence of a startle response, time to first reaction, duration of reaction, time to formation of the maximum C-shape, time to completion of the C-shape, completeness of the C-shape, direction of turn, and degree of turn. The data were evaluated for statistical significance and patterns of response were identified. The most immediate measure of potential changes in fish behavior was whether test and control fish exhibited a startle response. Unlike earlier studies, {{there was no significant difference}} among the treatment group and the controls for startle response. The majority of rainbow trout in all groups responded to the startle stimulus. There were however, significant differences in some of the particular aspects of the subsequent escape behavior. The time to first reaction, the duration of the reaction, and the times associated with maximum C-shape formation were all significantly different between the tank controls and the two groups of fish injected into the Alden turbine loop. There were no significant differences in behavioral responses between the trout passed through the turbine runner and those injected downstream of the runner. Other behavioral parameters, such as C-shape completeness ratio, were not significantly affected. The effect of the Alden turbine loop on some aspects of the escape behavior suggest that the process of movement through the system is important, but that the role of the added stress, if any, of passage through the turbine runner is minimal. It may be important that statistically significant differences in timing of phases of the startle response were detected, even though the majority of stressed fish still exhibited the startle response. This is in contrast to earlier studies, where timing of phases of the startle responses were only affected when the overall startle response was impaired. This pattern suggests that the escape behavior response can be a very sensitive tool for detecting potential effects of sublethal stresses associated with turbine passage. Field studies will be needed to determine whether such subtle changes would be translated into increased vulnerability to predation. If a link between changes in escape behavior and indirect mortality can be demonstrated in the field, this technique could become a rapid and inexpensive tool for assessing the total losses of fish at hydropower plants...|$|R
