30|$|The SRCM is a {{full-scale}} underground mine facility located at NIOSH’s Bruceton Campus in Pittsburgh. It is a room-and-pillar mine approximately {{the size of}} a working section with one intake entry and one return entry. A Joy Axivane Series fan is installed at the surface above the <b>return</b> <b>shaft</b> to exhaust air from the mine. In the mine, a Conspec® AMS is equipped at eight monitoring stations to monitor mine environment conditions such as barometric pressure, temperature, airflow velocity, humidity, and oxygen, and to detect fire by way of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and smoke sensors. The locations of monitoring stations are frequently changed depending on the requirements of the experiments conducted in the mine. The air velocity sensors are mounted about 0.3  m (1 ft) below the roof at each monitoring station.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Donghai mine {{has been}} mined to - 1000 meters, three mining areas share one <b>return</b> <b>shaft,</b> some laneway {{resistance}} values are very large, and fan air pressure reach more than 3500 pa. The ventilation system {{is complex and}} difficult to manage. To solve this problem, the practical use of three-dimensional simulation software Ventsim in the Donghai mine is described in detail. Real-time air network calculation, dynamic show the direction of airflow, air quantity, velocity and other parameters are the basic use of ventsim, which can be scientific, accurate and fast simulating the ventilation status, reduction in resistance and contaminant spread. The system satisfy the requirements of Donghai mine ventilation management and provide a scientific and reliable data for decision-makers, which has improve the level of Donghai mine ventilation management...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{fractionation}} and SEM-EDX {{was used}} for characterisation of ashes and deposits from different combustion tests in a commercial 20 MW bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boiler. The fuel combusted was a mix of sorted MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) and industrial waste {{often referred to as}} RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) mostly containing combustible material as paper, plastics and wood. This fuel type often contains a lot of alkali and chlorine and is therefore considered as a risk fuel prone to cause bed agglomeration, deposit formation and corrosion. In order to investigate the impact of the bed temperature on the alkali and chlorine distribution in the boiler combustion tests were performed. The bed temperature for this boiler is designed to be in the range 850 - 900 °C. In this investigation however the bed temperature was reduced to 700 - 750 °C. Two deposit probes, each carrying two rings made of high alloy steel, were used for collection of deposits during combustion. In addition, samples taken on the bed ash, return sand, <b>return</b> <b>shaft</b> ash, cyclone ash and textile filter ash were analysed. By reducing the bed temperature the need for fresh bed sand was reduced and the fly ash flow decreased. In addition, the agglomerates found in the tests with the normal bed temperature disappeared totally when the bed temperature was reduced. The deposits formed on the bed ash and on the return sand particles were found to consist of compounds with melting temperatures between 675 and 801 °C, which could explain the difference in agglomeration tendency...|$|E
50|$|This type of cam, in {{the form}} of a {{symmetric}} heart symbol, is used to <b>return</b> a <b>shaft</b> holding the cam to a set position by pressure from a roller. They were used for example on early models of Post Office Master clocks to synchronise the clock time with Greenwich Mean Time when the activating follower was pressed onto the cam automatically via a signal from an accurate time source.|$|R
50|$|Two years later, Wade <b>returns</b> and <b>Shaft</b> rearrests him {{for leaving}} the country. During his {{temporary}} incarceration at police headquarters, Wade meets Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a Dominican drug lord. Wade relinquishes his passport and is released on bail again; in frustration Shaft resigns from the police force, promising to bring Wade to justice on his own terms. Worried that Shaft might find the missing eyewitness, Wade hires Peoples to find and kill her first.|$|R
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Neilson pushed Lesley off the ledge in the drainage shaft, strangling her. An alternative scenario is that Neilson was not present when Whittle died and that he fled {{on the night of}} the failed ransom collection without <b>returning</b> to the <b>shaft,</b> believing the police were closing in on him, leaving Whittle alive in the dark for a considerable period of time before falling to her death.|$|R
40|$|During the 20 th century, the {{increased}} emphasis on worker health and safety {{and the advent of}} new mining equipment and methods led to many changes in mine face ventilation practices. Efforts by government and private industry to improve and modify ventilation practices resulted in better health and safety conditions for workers. This article focuses on U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) research to examine factors that had a significant influence on mine face ventilation design during the past century. Several "milestone" events are discussed along with the impact they had on worker health and safety. Significant ventilation research efforts by government and private industry are presented. This brief ventilation history highlights innovative face ventilation designs and a consistent commitment to mining health and safety. Ventilation has always been a concern in underground coal mining. For many yeas, there was no appreciation of how ventilation could be used to remove harmful contaminants from the air or how to control airflow quantities. The first known problems with ventilation date back to the 14 th century, when it was recognized that lack of air was a major impediment to the expansion of mines. The common method of solving ventilation problems at that time was to abandon the existing mine and start a new one nearby. Ventilation {{in the early days of}} coal mining was accomplished by means of a natural draft, created principally by a difference in the weights of columns of air between the intake and return openings. Later, in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, a furnace was introduced underground to increase the updraft in the <b>return</b> <b>shaft.</b> This allowed for a larger quantity of air in circulation. When mines went deeper and became larger, mechanical ventilation became necessary and was first accomplished by steam-driven fans. These fans became more prevalent as furnaces were prohibited in underground mines, especially after the Avondale disaster in Pennsylvania in 1869 (Roy, 1876). Eventually, these fans were replaced by more powerful, electrically [...|$|E
40|$|A {{good design}} of {{ventilation}} {{system for a}} mine should supply adequate air flow for all workings. One of {{the objectives of the}} ventilation planning is to select optimum operating points for the fan and its combinations to achieve the required air flow rate. It will improve the safety conditions and minimise the total air power consumption. The objective {{of this study is to}} increase ventilation quantity with low operating pressure and effective utilisation of the main mechanical ventilator. Ventilation simulator and CFD modelling studies were conducted with different combinations of fans. Operating parallel fans with the same capacity and blade angle at the <b>return</b> air <b>shaft</b> is the best possible solution for achieving this objective. A detailed case study of the pressure survey of the ventilation network and the simulation results is presented...|$|R
5000|$|A new wrinkle {{was added}} for this round, called [...] "The Shaft." [...] The third place player was given The Shaft (which was a silver shaft of a {{baseball}} bat, hence the name) to start the round and could use it {{at any point in}} the round to force one of his opponents to answer one of the questions on the board. Each player could only be [...] "Shafted" [...] once, and once The <b>Shaft</b> <b>returned</b> to someone who had already used it, it was taken out of play.|$|R
50|$|The word mummu appears {{also in the}} Sumerian myth of Zu where Imdugud, {{whose name}} is {{translated}} as 'flashing wind', steals the Tablets of Destiny but in turn is defeated by Ningirsu. In their battle an arrow in midair is ordered to return to its 'mummu', {{which in this case}} meant the <b>shaft's</b> <b>return</b> to the living reed from which it was cut, the guts return to the animal's rump and finally the feathers to the bird's wings. Therefore, in a larger magnitude, mummu is detransformation, the return to chaos, demanifacturing.|$|R
50|$|Slightly more {{complicated}} was the two axis stepping switch, (also called Strowger switch or two motion selector in Britain). Typically, a single compact group of wipers could connect {{to one of}} 100 (or 200) different fixed contacts, in ten levels. When the switch was idle, the wipers were disengaged from the fixed contacts. The wipers moved {{up and down on}} a vertical shaft, and rotated into the contact bank to make a connection. A spring, internal to the vertical <b>shaft,</b> <b>returned</b> the wipers to their home position at the bottom.|$|R
40|$|Many {{longwall}} mines rely on {{methane drainage}} to supplement traditional fan-based ventilation systems. However, the surface production facilities for methane drainage systems, including gob gas ventholes, are commonly located in remote locations, sometimes without convenient access to electrical power, {{and they may}} be monitored infrequently. The first evidence that a methane drainage system may not be operating efficiently, or not operating at all, can be an increase in methane concentrations at a <b>return</b> air <b>shaft</b> or underground where the workforce is exposed to the risk of a methane explosion. A solar powered, remote gob gas venthole monitoring and cellular telephone-based real-time data transmission system has been developed and successfully field tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to address this problem. With this system, individual methane drainage boreholes can be monitored from the mine office to determine current operational performance parameters, as well as review past data to anticipate maintenance needs and troubleshoot operational problems...|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} Durham mines worked three {{production}} shifts and a maintenance shift. The fore-shift was from 03:30 to 11:07, the back-shift from 09:45 to 17:22 and night-shift from 16:00 to 23:37. The {{maintenance and repair}} shift was the stone-shift from 22:00 to 05:37. Shift timings related to going underground through to <b>returning</b> to the <b>shaft</b> top, therefore at 04:35 both the stone-shift and the fore-shift were underground at the faces. 38 men from the stone-shift and 43 from the fore-shift were killed, all but one instantly. The man who survived died of his injuries {{just a few hours}} later. As a result of the total loss of life in the vicinity there were no eye-witness accounts of the explosion or its immediate aftermath.|$|R
40|$|The Rankine {{compression}} {{gas turbine}} (RCG) {{is a new}} type of combined cycle, i. e. combined steam and gas turbine installation, that <b>returns</b> all <b>shaft</b> power on one free power turbine. The novelty of the RCG is that the steam turbine drives the compressor of the gas turbine cycle. This way, the turbine of the gas turbine acts as a free power turbine. With its free power turbine the possible field of application of the RCG is mechanical drives. The RCG can be designed with components that can all be referred to as existing technology, which makes the RCG robust and technologically feasible. Thermodynamic calculations show that a thermal efficiency of about 40 % is realistic. This is higher than simple cycle gas turbines, and equal to gas turbines with a recuperator. The calculations also show that the specific power of an RCG is up to twice as high than that of both simple cycle and recuperative cycle gas turbines. Finally, economical assessments show that the extra investments of an RCG compared to a simple cycle have an expected payback time of 2 – 4 years. This makes the RCG economically appealing, but further study is necessary to obtain more exact figures on the economical feasibility...|$|R
5000|$|Neilson {{possibly}} pushed Whittle off {{the ledge}} {{where he had}} kept her. An alternative to this scenario is that Neilson was not even there when Whittle died and that he panicked and fled {{on the night of}} the failed ransom collection without <b>returning</b> to the <b>shaft,</b> believing the police were closing in on him, leaving Whittle alive in the dark for a considerable period of time before she fell to her death. The pathologist noted that Whittle weighed only [...] when found, her stomach and intestines were completely empty, she had lost a considerable amount of weight and was emaciated. He concluded that she had not eaten for a minimum of three days, the length of time it takes for food to pass through the body, but added it could have been much longer.|$|R
60|$|If {{he could}} but get {{one end of}} his grass rope caught upon some {{projection}} {{at the top of}} that tantalizing aperture! In the instant's pause and thought an idea occurred to him. He would attempt it. Turning back to the tumbled wall, he seized one of the large, flat slabs that had composed it. Hastily making one end of his rope fast to the piece of granite, he <b>returned</b> to the <b>shaft,</b> and, coiling the balance of the rope on the floor beside him, the ape-man took the heavy slab in both hands, and, swinging it several times to get the distance and the direction fixed, he let the weight fly up at a slight angle, so that, instead of falling straight back into the shaft again, it grazed the far edge, tumbling over into the court beyond.|$|R
50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid hose reels as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the hose reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roof—one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for <b>return</b> air. These <b>shafts</b> are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{conventional}} {{metal flow}} joining method needs a specialized punch. In this study, a new metal flow joining method that enables a shaft and ring {{to be combined}} {{without the need for}} any specialized punch was examined. In this experiment, 20 -mm-diameter solid shafts and 40 -mm-outer-diameter rings having a 20 -mm-inner-diameter step at the 18. 5 -mm-inner-diameter center hole were used. The material combinations of the shaft / ring were JIS S 45 C / SKD 11, A 5056 / S 45 C, and S 45 C / A 5056. The experiment was performed as follows. The shaft was put on the ring and pressed. Then, metal plastically flowed between the joining faces. The gap between them was filled with the flowing metal, and then, they were joined by high clamping pressure. The primary results were as follows. This joining method was completed with small amounts of metal flow because of highly precise fitting between the shaft and ring. Therefore, they could be joined by small pressing strokes. In this experiment, the maximum joining efficiency (<b>shaft</b> <b>return</b> proof load / joining load) reached 25 % - 35 %. This new metal flow joining method appears to be highly useful in terms of low cost, high productivity, and non-mass production...|$|R
5000|$|Were {{the flame}} {{to go out}} in a lamp, then there was a temptation for the collier to relight it. Some opened the lamps to light tobacco pipes underground. [...] Both of these {{practices}} were strictly forbidden; they clearly negated {{the whole point of the}} safety lamp. The miner was expected to <b>return</b> to the <b>shaft</b> to perform relighting, a round trip of up to a few miles. For men on piece work, this meant a loss of income (perhaps 10% of their day's pay) and so was unpopular. From the mid-century onwards, and particularly after the 1872 act, lamps had to have a lock mechanism which prevented the miner opening the lamp. Two schemes existed; either a special tool was required which kept at the pit head or else opening the lamp extinguished the flame. The latter mechanism can be seen in the Mueseler, Landau and Yates lamps below. Such a lamp was known as a protector lamp, a term picked up and used as a company name. Only on the return to the bank could the lamp man open the lamp for refilling and service. Various different locking mechanisms were developed; miners tended to be ingenious in finding ways of circumventing them. A number of additional lamps were supposed to accompany each gang of men, but restricting the number was an obvious economy for the pit owners.|$|R
