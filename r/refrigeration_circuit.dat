The amount that is rejected can be varied and is determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed.

40|$|International audienceAir-source {{heat pumps}} loose {{performance}} during winter {{because of low}} ambient temperatures and frosting. The most common defrosting technique is to reverse the cycle. Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the defrosting energy is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> involves a piece of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out defrosting with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for defrosting. Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A supplementary amount of vapour flows out of the water evaporator and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the defrosting energy. The liquid returns back to the water evaporator by gravity. This defrosting system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as defrosting time was short. Using this defrosting technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while defrosting thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent defrosting sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients.

Low-pressure receivers {{have been shown to}} be an effective way of allowing evaporators to operate in a fully flooded mode thus enabling more efficient use of the evaporator surface for heat transfer. If a low-pressure receiver is used in a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> the control of refrigerant flow into the evaporator is less critical as the expansion device is not responsible for preventing liquid returning to the compressor.

40|$|A {{new system}} for {{defrosting}} the air coils of freezers is described - the patented Frigesco(TM) system. The {{net energy consumption}} of this system is close to zero and so it effectively reduces the overall energy consumption of a freezer system {{by the amount of}} energy normally used by electrical or hot gas defrost systems. The principal of operation is that heat available from the hot liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser (normally wasted) is stored in phase change material and then used when a defrost is needed.

40|$|In recent years, the {{air-conditioning}} {{industry has been}} focusing on alternative refrigerants for the replacement of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) due to environmental regulations. HFCs refrigerants {{have been widely used}} in the refrigeration industry since the early 1990 ’s as replacement to chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) refrigerants that were non-flammable and non-toxic, but posses a high ozone depletion potential (ODP). Despite the fact that HFCs have zero ODP, they were found to have a high global warming potential (GWP) being considered one of the green house substances to be banned by the Kyoto agreement. The interest for long term solutions has been towards natural refrigerants. Among different natural refrigerants such as water, air, and ammonia, carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) is an attractive and possibly the most viable candidate. Although, CO 2 is a non-flammable and non toxic natural refrigerant (being not the case for Hydrocarbons and Ammonia), one of the main drawbacks related to its implementation as a refrigerant in air-conditioning compressors {{has to do with the}} high operating working pressures. These working pressures can be around 5 to 6 times higher compared to HFCs systems. One of the important aspects in the design of an air-conditioning compressor is the understanding of the miscibility and solubility of the lubricant and the refrigerant. The incomplete miscibility and solubility of CO 2 with commonly used lubricants in the vapor compression cycle affects the way the lubricant is transported out of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit.</b> Also, when miscibility and solubility is incomplete, the lubricant accumulates in the system causing pressure drops (especially in the evaporator). Appropriate lubrication of the critical components of the compressor becomes important as the demands for higher efficiency increases. Control of the wear of these components has to be ensured in order to guarantee appropriate operation of the compressor over a prolonged period of time. Scuffing is another important aspect to be addressed in the design of compressors. This is considered a severe adhesive type of failure that renders the tribocontacts non functional. Interaction of the lubricant, refrigerant, and materials, plays an important role on the scuffing performance since tribochemical reactions might improve or lower the wear resistance at the sliding interfaces. Studies on CO 2 as an alternative refrigerant for air-conditioning systems has been mainly focused on the thermodynamical aspects to ensure that the efficiency and cost will make it suitable as a replacement to HFCs. However, research on the tribological aspects of CO 2 with lubricants and engineering materials is scarce. The aforementioned drawbacks related to the circulation of lubricant and refrigerant in the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> has raised the possibility of design and development of oil-less compressors. In this direction, it is imperative to design advanced materials able to withstand aggressive sliding conditions in the absence of lubricant. This research focuses on the study of the friction and wear behavior of different materials and lubricants in the presence of CO 2 for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Bare materials and soft polymeric type of coatings were studied in the presence of lubricants and environmentally friendly refrigerants to understand the role of tribochemistry by using a range of analytical tools that provide answers of the scientific aspects during the characterization of friction and wear...|$|E

However, these greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming and are likely to be banned by European directives. Some interest is now turned towards fluids with low global warming potential (GWP) like carbon dioxide. The performances of CO 2 can be interesting in transcritical cycles, particularly for domestic hot water (DHW) production. However, this cycle requires the use of devices operating under high pressures. The Heating and Cooling Plant (HCP) is intended to produce domestic hot water and to heat and cool residential and small office buildings. The HCP presents an innovative design of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> and an innovative defrosting system. It is equipped with three heat exchangers: a water condenser (or gas cooler for transcritical CO 2) and a water evaporator linked to three tanks and an air heat exchanger that can be either condenser or evaporator in order to balance productions and needs.

When the cold tank is hot enough the HCP mode changes, to work with the water evaporator while the air evaporator is being defrosted. Two HCPs (CO 2 and HFC) have been modelled using TRNSYS and EXCEL. The simulations enable to estimate the performances of both machines and to construct a frosting - defrosting sequence.

40|$|Many {{air-conditioning}} (AC) {{systems are}} designed to operate at maximum cooling capacity regardless {{of the variation in}} the daily cooling load. At low loads, the conditions can be uncomfortably cold and the overcooling is an unnecessary waste of energy. To address these two issues, a multiple <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> concept is proposed and applied to a roof-top bus AC system. A two-circuit model is proposed for a standard bus size in which each circuit has two evaporators of equal sizes arranged in parallel and installed on each passenger row, respectively. This means that each passenger row is served by two different evaporators sharing a common heat exchanger box. Depending on the cooling load, this concept allows one or both circuits (compressor motors) to be switched on and during either modes, it also allows one or more sets of evaporator blowers to be switched on. A steady-state computer model has been developed to simulate the performance of the proposed two-circuit AC system. A two-circuit air conditioner is also designed to form a roof-top bus AC system, fabricated, and installed on to an experimental rig. The experimental data are used to validate the computer model. The validation is on the system thermal performance and on the evaporator air outlet conditions (dry bulb temperature and relative humidity) at different modes of system operation, either at full or partial cooling loads. The simulated results gave satisfactory agreement with those obtained from the experimental work. Maximum absolute deviations are within the range of 19. 3 per cent, although most of the simulated results are less than a 10 per cent range from the experimental ones, which validates the computer program.

40|$|Refrigerant leakage {{associated}} with multi-temperature direct expansion (DX) systems in transport refrigeration applications has {{lead to increased}} interest in alternative refrigeration concepts. One alternative design approach aimed at reducing refrigerant charge and simplifying system control, {{involves the use of}} an indirect (IDX) <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit.</b> Recent investigations, concerned with the deployment of indirect systems for supermarket applications have shown that penalties in cooling capacity and COP can exist under certain operating conditions. These performance deficiencies are attributed to a number of factors including: additional power requirements of secondary circulation pumps, temperature glide {{associated with}} the secondary working fluid, and increased compressor pressure lift due to the additional primary to secondary heat exchanger. One design strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX system. Economiser cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the primary refrigerant in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. The net effect can result in increased refrigeration capacity, if appropriate mass flowrates of refrigerant are expanded through the economiser circuit. However, to date, there is little evidence of the use of an economiser cycle in more complex refrigeration systems, such as multi temperature transport systems, which are subject to significant variation in boundary conditions and operate frequently under transient conditions. This paper examines for a multi-temperature indirect transport refrigeration system, the influence of injection ratio on system performance under ATP conditions as well as the sensitivity of system parameters to different injection ratios. It is found that system capacity and COP can be modulated by regulation of injection ratio. An optimum injection ratio exists which allows maximisation of system capacity and COP respectively. This optimum injection ratio appears to be dependent on set-point and ambient conditions...|$|E

The objective of this project was to design a DCMD unit combined with a heat pump to generate the exact energy required from the cold water permeate to heat the thermally sensitive feed. As a result, a laboratory DCMD unit was integrated with a specially designed <b>Refrigeration</b> <b>circuit</b> as the patent pending DCMD-R (Refrigeration) system. Demonstrative trials showed its ability to carry out the concentration process with temperatures of the feed and permeate streams controlled close to their set points of 40 and 25 ºC, respectively. Electrical current and voltage were monitored to calculate the energy input. Mass flux was measured to work out the energy utilised during test runs on glucose concentration from 30 % to 60 % w/w. The laboratory DCMD-R unit delivered an average mass flux of up to 3. 6 kg. m⁻². h⁻¹ over the whole operation. The success of the tests on the laboratory prototype DCMD-R system showed a vast improvement of energy efficiency when compared to that by the DCMD process alone. Despite the use of an inefficient compressor available, the DCMD-R system was able to increase the total energy efficiency from 43 % to as high as 106 %, a level that well surpassed the efficiency of 76 % achieved by the single stage evaporation technique. Should a more efficient compressor have been used, say at a COP (coefficient of performance) of 4, an apparent energy efficiency of 160 to 200 % could be within reach of the DCMD-R system. It implies that a DCMD-R system with the above apparent energy efficiency can achieve 0. 5 - 0. 62 tons of steam equivalent per ton of water evaporated, similarly to conventional multiple effect evaporation. A well designed and optimised DCMDR system is a serious alternative to all other concentration techniques as it requires low energy input, yet achieving high final concentration with minimal thermal effect on the final products...|$|E

Assessment of {{a simple}} mathematical model for predicitng the transient behaviour of a refrigeration system. Paper presented at the XVIII International Congress of Refrigeration, Montreal, Canada. A dynamic modelling methodology has been developed for the computer simulation of industrial refrigeration systems. A computer program, RefSim, has been developed which embodies the new methodology. RefSim contains a total of 33 separate models - 11 derived from existing models, six which are substantially enhanced and 16 which are new. In general, these models were derived from thermal considerations and ignored the effect of hydrodynamic processes in the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>circuit.</b> Models can be dynamically linked together as specified by the input data in order to simulate a complete plant. The program includes a set of simulation utilities which {{reduce the amount of}} work required to develop models. The object-oriented features of inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism are used extensively. Substantial model development was carried out to achieve accurate predictions of the heat release profile during chilling and freezing of food product as product cooling makes the greatest contribution to both mean and peak heat loads in many industrial refrigeration plants. The new ordinary differential equation (ODE) model was tested against finite difference (FD) calculations for a range of product shapes and Biot numbers. The ODE model predicted to within ± 10 % of the FD calculation during almost all of the cooling process under the test conditions. The ODE model required several orders of magnitude less computation than FD while being capable of extension to shapes that could not be handled by FD. To test the new ODE model against experimental data, a differential air temperature method to measure the cooling food product heat load profile was developed. Both the FD and ODE methods predicted the heat load profile of freezing meat cartons to within the experimental margin for error (± 10 %). The ODE model also predicted the heat load profile of freezing lamb carcasses to a similar level of accuracy. Three refrigeration plants (a laboratory water chiller, a 18500 lamb per day meat processing plant, and a 6000 lamb/ 1000 beef per day meat processing plant) were surveyed to obtain data for testing the whole simulation environment. RefSim was found to predict the measured data satisfactorily in most cases. The results were superior to those from a commercial refrigeration simulation environment and comparable to an enhanced version of that environment which included the new ODE product heat load model. Differences between the measured values and those predicted by Refsim were probably more attributable to uncertainties in the simulation input data than to model deficiencies. RefSim was found to be a flexible environment which was general enough to simulate both simple and complex refrigeration systems. Unusual components could be simulated by combining existing models rather than implementing custom models. Nevertheless, the simulation results have indicated a number of areas for further model improvement. The effects of air mixing and the thermal buffering of structural materials were shown to be modelled poorly for some refrigerated rooms. There is some scope for improving the chilling stage of the ODE product heat load model...|$|E
