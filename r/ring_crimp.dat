5000|$|Although {{the gender}} of tubing and {{plumbing}} fittings is usually obvious, {{this may not be}} true of electrical connectors because of their more complex and varying constructions. Instead, connector gender is conventionalized and thus can be somewhat obscure to the uninitiated. For example, the female D-subminiature connector body projects outward from the mounting plane of the chassis, and this protrusion could be erroneously construed as male. Instead, the [...] "maleness" [...] of the D-subminiature connectors is defined by specific presence of male pins, rather than by the protrusion of the connector, which is also true for many other pin-based connectors like XLR. The male/female distinction is more obvious with <b>ring</b> <b>crimp</b> lug connectors which are placed around a screw post, but again with spade or split <b>ring</b> <b>crimp</b> lug connectors the end alone is not obviously female.|$|E

40|$|A {{spiral wound}} {{retaining}} ring with angled ends is described. The <b>ring</b> is <b>crimped</b> {{at the same}} angle as the ring ends to maintain a constant thickness dimension. The angling of {{the ends of the}} <b>ring</b> and <b>crimp</b> allow the ends to be positioned closer together while maintaining enough clearance to enable insertion and removal of the ring. By reducing the separation distance between the ends a stronger ring results since the double layer area of the ring is maximized...|$|R

5000|$|Primer pocket swages can {{be either}} standalone, bench-mounted, {{specialized}} presses, or, alternatively, a special swage anvil die that can be mounted into a standard [...] "O" [...] style reloading press, along with a special shell holder insert with either a large or a small primer pocket insert swage that is then inserted into the position on the [...] "O" [...] press where a normal shell holder is usually clicked into position. This way, both small and large primer pockets on different types of military cases can be properly processed to remove primer pocket crimps. Both types of presses {{can be used to}} remove either <b>ring</b> <b>crimps</b> or stab crimps found on military cartridges when reloading them. Reamers for removing primer pocket crimps are not associated with presses, being an alternative to using a press to remove military case primer pocket crimps.|$|R
2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of <b>crimp,</b> whether <b>ring</b> <b>crimps</b> or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|R
5000|$|PBT - {{flexible}} (usually gray or black) {{plastic pipe}} which {{is attached to}} barbed fittings and secured in place with a copper <b>crimp</b> <b>ring.</b> The primary manufacturer of PBT tubing and fittings was driven into bankruptcy by a class-action lawsuit over failures of this system. However, PB and PBT tubing has since returned to the market and codes, typically first for [...] "exposed locations" [...] such as risers.|$|R
