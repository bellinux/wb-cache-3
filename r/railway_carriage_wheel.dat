50|$|The {{relocation}} {{started in}} May 1993 and was completed just over five months later. In a remarkable feat of engineering, {{the building was}} turned into a <b>railway</b> <b>carriage,</b> and <b>wheeled</b> on 8 sets of parallel rails 100 metres alongside a busy road. The wheels were then turned 90 degrees, and the building pushed across the road on another set of rails to a point where it was joined to new foundations, and recommenced operation as a hotel.|$|R
50|$|In 1842, {{he formed}} a {{partnership}} with Matthias W. Baldwin to manufacture steam locomotives in Philadelphia. Two years later he left Baldwin, and worked for the reorganized Morris Canal Company. In 1846, he opened his own factory to manufacture <b>wheels</b> for <b>railway</b> <b>carriages.</b> In 1847, he took out patents for the corrugated-plate <b>carriage</b> <b>wheel</b> and the curved corrugated-plate <b>carriage</b> <b>wheel,</b> and the following year for the process of annealing <b>carriage</b> <b>wheels.</b> This consisted of placing the wheels, soon after they were cast, in a heated furnace, where they were subjected to a further gradual increase of temperature, and were then slowly cooled for three days. The discovery of this process of annealing, as applied to chilled cast-iron wheels, marked an era {{in the history of}} railroads. It enabled trains to safely increase both loads and speed. Previous to this discovery it was impossible to cast wheels with solid hubs, and therefore impossible to secure them rigidly to the axle. Now the whole wheel was easily cast in one piece, and capable of being forced securely upon the axle at a pressure of 40 tons. In 1850, he patented the tapered and ribbed corrugated wheel.|$|R

50|$|Original {{products}} {{included the}} manufacture of stump-jump implements, strippers, windmills, pumps, horse-rakes, wheat separators, ploughs, harrows, scarifiers, and other agricultural and general implements. The firm later produced tramcars and railway rolling stock, assembled Ford Model Ts, and manufactured a range of stationary engines. It manufactured over 600 O class trams, which were not only used in Sydney, but also Brisbane, Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo. It manufactured {{many different types of}} rolling stock such as brake vans, coal wagons, Bradfield suburban <b>carriages,</b> 12 <b>wheel</b> <b>carriages</b> for the New South Wales Government <b>Railways</b> and sleeper <b>carriages</b> for the Trans-Australian Railway in 1915. There was a large fire in 1908 that totally destroyed the carriage shop and some completed <b>railway</b> <b>carriages</b> ready for delivery, as well as many uncompleted carriages and trams. This resulted in 150 men losing their jobs. Stationary engines were made in several sizes for general use, initially copies of the Scottish Melvin. The Commonwealth Government purchased both horizontal and vertical engines for use on the Trans-Australian Railway for pumping water into overhead tanks for the steam locomotives.|$|R

Theory of a cylinder rolling on an elastic roadway also gives this same rule These contradict earlier (1785) tests by Coulomb of rolling wooden cylinders where Coulomb reported that {{rolling resistance}} was inversely proportional to {{the diameter of the}} wheel (known as [...] "Coulomb's law"). This disputed (or wrongly applied)-"Coulomb's law" [...] is still found in handbooks, however.|$|R
