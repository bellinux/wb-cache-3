The square tipped wing was straight edged, with slight sweep on the leading edge but none on the <b>rear.</b> <b>Flaps</b> stretched from the ailerons to the wing root on the trailing edge and there were hydraulically driven air brakes of the circular plate type.|$|R
5000|$|O'Brien, Scott and Rosemount all {{introduced}} versions {{similar to}} the Hanson. K2 introduced the [...] "Three", which reversed the Hanson pattern by making the <b>rear</b> <b>flap</b> much larger and bucking on the front like a conventional front-entry design. None of these had {{a major impact on}} Hanson's sales, and in the period between 1978 and 1981, the company was shipping an average of 120,000 pairs of boots a year.

5000|$|The Pagani Huayra is {{different}} from its predecessor in that it incorporates active aerodynamics. It is capable of changing {{the height of the}} front from the ground and independently operating four flaps placed at the rear and front of the car. The behavior of the flaps is managed by a dedicated control unit that is fed information from systems such as the ABS and ECU, which pass on information about the car's speed, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and throttle position. This is intended to achieve minimal drag coefficient or maximum downforce depending on the situation. The Huayra's designer Horacio Pagani states that it has a variable drag coefficient of between [...]31 and [...]37. [...] The system also prevents excess body roll in the corners by raising the [...] "inside" [...] flaps (i.e. the left ones in a left-handed corner and vice versa), increasing the downforce {{on that side of the}} car. The <b>rear</b> <b>flaps</b> also act as an airbrake. Under hard braking, both the front suspension and the two <b>rear</b> <b>flaps</b> are raised to counteract weight transfer to the front wheels and keep the whole car stable, for instance when entering a corner. Air from the radiator is extracted through an arch in the bonnet at an angle that is designed not to affect the streamline around the body. The side air intakes behind the front wheels create a low pressure zone, resulting in downforce.|$|R

5000|$|The body Bandini {{aluminum}} {{is made up}} of {{a removable}} front quickly, low and round, with a generous air-intake oval in the middle, very similar to the previous 1000/66 but here, is flanked by two fins fixed with two grids outburst in front of the passenger compartment. This part was amended in mid-1972. The space for lighthouses is exploited to increase the strength of air downward, defining more decisively the air-intake that appears even more squared and acquires a much wider outlet. The rear part receives the difference in width {{than the rest of the}} car, this creates large air-intakes for the engine side and also thanks to the panel sealing perfectly the engine compartment, door very clean flows to fixed <b>rear</b> <b>flap.</b> In a second time, were also installed screens for the rear wheels that had already been used on [...] "Saponetta" [...] from the runway.|$|E
5000|$|The body {{block that}} was used earlier to elevate the chest cavity is now used to elevate the head. To examine the brain, an {{incision}} is made from behind one ear, over the crown of the head, to a point behind the other ear. When the autopsy is completed, the incision can be neatly sewn up and is not noticed when the head is resting on a pillow in an open casket funeral. The scalp is {{pulled away from the}} skull in two flaps with the front flap going over the face and the <b>rear</b> <b>flap</b> {{over the back of the}} neck. The skull is then cut with a circular (or semicircular) bladed reciprocating saw to create a [...] "cap" [...] that can be pulled off, exposing the brain. The brain is then observed in situ. Then the brain's connection to the cranial nerves and spinal cord are severed, and the brain is lifted out of the skull for further examination. If the brain needs to be preserved before being inspected, it is contained in a large container of formalin (15 percent solution of formaldehyde gas in buffered water) for at least two, but preferably four weeks. This not only preserves the brain, but also makes it firmer, allowing easier handling without corrupting the tissue.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a postmodern}} story that {{challenges}} the formal conventions of punctuation and storytelling. The {{action in the}} story is fast-paced and provides the reader with few signals for plot progression, changes in points of view, and character dialogue. The story opens with {{a man in his}} bedroom winding {{down at the end of}} his day and getting ready for bed. When he lies down, his arm brushes against someone else. He looks over and sees a pale white-haired lady. He notices a lisp from the ladyâ€™s speech as she started speaking to him. The elderly woman tells him that all five of them were assigned to be in one bed by Social Security. She explained to him that, with the current situation, no one can afford a private beds anymore because they are now luxury items. She advises the bed owner not to kick at night because her ailing brother Albert, who wears a cloth cap and long underwear of which one pant-leg is empty and pinned up to the <b>rear</b> <b>flap,</b> is sleeping at the foot of the bed. She believes that Albert is lucky because he has his own bed in which he can sleep. The owner of the bed is surprised that Social Security has assigned that many folks. At the same time, the owner of the bed sees an Asian man whose work seems to be washing dishes. At this point, another man named Duke, who appears to be a heavy-bellied worker, shows up with a woman of similar stature. They look like they were drunk. Duke and the woman crash onto the bed, hit the night-table, and knock the dentures into the air; and, as a result, the elderly woman goes and chases after them. Duke forces his companion to have sexual relations with him while everyone is still on the bed. She argues with him at first; but she, then, becomes overpowered. Albert gets mad that Duke has a girl to himself. Duke gets so wrapped up in his sexual activity that he ends up kicking Albert in the face causing him to fall off the bed. The old lady tells her brother to get back on the bed while ordering Duke to kill the Asian person. Duke suddenly cries because he is thinking about the days of the past. Albert, then, crawled back onto the bed from the foot of the bed, and the pin that was used to hold up this empty pant-leg is now between his teeth. As the Asian personâ€”who is holding a knifeâ€”crouches tremulously on the pillow by the headboard, the old lady tells Duke to forget about killing the Asian person because she now wants no violence. Duke feels some intense pain and manages to wipe his tears away. A mother suddenly enters with three runny-nosed kids and begs to stay overnight because she and her kids are all tired. Duke tells her to stay and rest because tomorrow she will need to go to the social security office to request a new bed assignment. Duke starts to fade away wondering if he remembered the light in the bathroom and the cap on the toothpaste. At the same time, the old lady, with a lisp, suddenly shouts out in fear asking whether Albert has swallowed the pin.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of open-box micro air vehicles to deliver light, small payloads of high importance to specific ground coordinates is investigated through dynamic simulation. The open box exhibits interesting and varied flight dynamic behavior as key design parameters are changed. For example, the open box can achieve a coning behavior, a corkscrewing behavior, or glide {{much like a}} conventional aircraft to the ground by merely shifting the mass center location. The four <b>rear</b> <b>flaps</b> of the air vehicle {{can be used to}} control the box and affords the aircraft greater control authority thandispersion causedby typical atmosphericwinds.
