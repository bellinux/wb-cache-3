5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Several <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> presses to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and François Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — {{the process}} of plastic {{deformation}} of metal by passing it through the rolls called as the metal rolling. Rolling is widely used forming process, which can have high production figures and precise control of final product. Rolling is classified in two major parts the cold rolling and hot rolling. Every part has its own theory, development of rolling process and subsequently the designing of the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components, like rolls and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. The aim of the present paper is to understand the various methodologies which are used to design the cold <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> We {{have focused on the}} history of the rolling process; it is understand that the rolling process was adopted since year 1590. Although it was raw method but it initiated the slitting <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> and the actual experimentation were started from year 1670. In those days rolling was concerned with rolling of bars only after few years the rolling of bars were started. We also tried to discuss the earlier patents which were granted in 18 th century and was related to the tandem mill which were using copper and brass as the rolling materials. In year 1783, after the entry of grooved rolls the rolling production increased up to 15 times and that was the start of modern <b>rolling</b> <b>mill.</b> While reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> components our area of interest is to visit design of rollers and <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing. We have discussed the different parameters and factors that affect the roll design. The calculations for the power required for rolling operation and the roll dimensions are also discussed. In reviewing the design of <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing, we try to explain the load that comes on the rolls during the rolling operations and how it affects the bearing life. The <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing designed optimisation has achieved by using different Finite Element Analysis techniques and various experimentation for <b>rolling</b> <b>mill</b> housing structural analysis is also reviewed...|$|R
