5000|$|The device {{can be used}} as a {{component}} in a filter and in this application it is sometimes known as an inverter because it produces the mathematical inverse of an impedance. Impedance inverters are not to be confused with the more common meaning of power inverter for a device that has the inverse function of a <b>rectifier.</b> <b>Inverter</b> is a general term for the class of circuits that have the function of inverting an impedance. There are many such circuits and the term does not necessarily imply a λ/4 transformer. The most common use for inverters is to convert a 2-element-kind LC filter design such as a ladder network into a one-element-kind filter. Equally, for bandpass filters, a two-resonator-kind (resonators and anti-resonators) filter can be converted to a one-resonator-kind. Inverters are classified as K-inverters or J-inverters depending on whether they are inverting a series impedance or a shunt admittance. [...] Filters incorporating λ/4 inverters are only suitable for narrow band applications. This is because the impedance transformer line only has the correct electrical length of λ/4 at one specific frequency. The further the signal is from this frequency the less accurately the impedance transformer will be reproducing the impedance inverter function and the less accurately it will be representing the element values of the original lumped element filter design.|$|E

Therefore, in this paper, an improved PLL control, respectively, with alternative damping factors for <b>rectifier</b> and <b>inverter</b> is proposed.

Third, the optimal damping factors of the improved PLL control for <b>rectifier</b> and <b>inverter</b> are calculated. Simulations and calculations validated the following three conclusions: (1) in rectifying operation, the equivalent system resistance has a negative impact on the stability of the system and {{this is not the case}} for inverting operation; (2) adding the alternative damping factors to PLL control shows similar results compared with changing the impedance angle of AC system; (3) the proposed optimal damping factors of PLL can effectively extend the power transfer limits under both <b>rectifier</b> and <b>inverter</b> modes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- For {{low power}} wind energy or micro-hydel {{applications}} {{of the order of}} 1 - 10 KW, the lowest cost can be achieved if the generator is a simple squirrel cage induction motor used as a self excited induction generator (SEIG). The induction generator output can be rectified to produce a DC Bus from which a single phase inverter can feed the power supply grid. A SEIG requires capacitors to be connected to the three terminals to provide reactive power as it is not directly connected to the power supply grid. The aim of the paper is to check the feasibility of wind power generation with a 2 KW squirrel cage induction motor used as a generator. A single phase current hysteresis controlled IGBT inverter is proposed to supply the mains utility power supply with the generated power. The complete system has been simulated.

40|$|With the {{widespread}} use of power electronics devices such as <b>rectifier,</b> <b>inverter</b> etc. in power system causes serious problem relating to power quality. One of such problem is generation of current and voltage harmonics causing distortion of load waveform, voltage fluctuation, voltage dip, heating of equipment etc. Also presence of non-linear loads such as UPS, SMPS, speed drives etc. causes the generation of current harmonics in power system. They draw reactive power components of current from the AC mains, hence causing disturbance in supply current wave form. Thus to avoid the consequences of harmonics we have to compensate the harmonic component in power utility system. Among various method used, one of the effective method to reduce harmonic in power system is the use of Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF). This Paper gives detail performance analysis of SAPF under two current control strategy namely, instantaneous active and reactive power theory (p-q) and synchronous frame reference theory (d-q) and their comparative analysis to justify one of the method better over other. In both method a reference current is generated for the filter which compensate either reactive power or harmonic current component in power system. In this paper, a current controller known harmonic current controller is described which is used provide corrective gating sequence of the IGBT inverter and thus helps to remove harmonics component...|$|E

40|$|New power {{electronics}} devices like Fundamental Frequency Front Ends (F 3 E) reduce procurement costs by eliminating or reducing the intermediate capacitors usually {{found on the}} DC-side of modern rectifier-inverter combinations. This cost-saving measure, however, eliminates the quasi-decoupling of rectifier and inverter; whereas interactions between rectifier and inverter could be neglected in most applications. These interactions {{are relevant to the}} correct function and operation of the whole application in case of reduced intermediate capacitors. Without the decoupling of rectifier and inverter, the inverter input currents will be passed on to the rectifier, and ultimately, will be discernible on the power grid. As a result, the input currents of the appliance will deviate greatly from the idealised sinusoidal waveform. To reduce this effect, an input filter is used, which in turn might interact with other {{power electronics}} devices connected to the same power grid. To date, the scope of the <b>rectifier</b> <b>inverter</b> and the F 3 E third-party equipment interactions has not been sufficiently investigated. An examination with real devices is impractical due to the wide range of configurations possible and the potential harm to the equipment itself. In this study, the simulation models of the devices involved and the power grid connecting different appliances were developed. A theoretical analysis to identify possible areas of impaired or disturbed operation was undertaken. The areas identified were then analysed using the computer models developed. The simulation results, electrical currents, and voltages were examined with regards to their absolute values and their degree of deviation from the idealised sinusoidal form. Their harmonic spectra were likewise analysed. Finally, areas of disturbed operation and the conditions under which they occur were identified. This study, therefore, will provide the basis for the successive elimination of these areas of disturbed operation...|$|E
