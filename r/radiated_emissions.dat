40|$|Abstract—An {{electronic}} product has {{to comply with}} a myriad of EMC requirements before it can be marketed globally. <b>Radiated</b> <b>Emission</b> is one of the EMC requirements which constantly poses a challenge to many circuit designer due to the ever increasing speed of PCB clocks. Consequently, in the product it is essential to investigate, identify, model and predict the PCB <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> before compliance test is performed for cost and time saving. In this paper, a simple double layer PCB board is fabricated to investigate the PCB <b>radiated</b> <b>emission.</b> Three PCB configurations are investigated for the level of emissions and to correlate with the common-mode currents. These configurations are PCB without attached cables, with one attached cable and with two attached cables. The <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> from each configuration is measured in a semi-anechoic chamber at open circuit and 50 ohm loads. It can be shown that the cables are the major sources of <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> due to the common-mode currents flowing through it.

Good electronic radio design is notoriously complex because of the sensitivity of radio circuits and the accuracy of components and layouts required to achieve operation on a specific frequency.

Finally, radio circuits are usually subject to limits on <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions,</b> and require Conformance testing and certification by a standardization organization such as ETSI or the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

50|$|FPD-Link became {{successful}} at transmitting 18-bit RGB raw video because it reduced the cable size and improved the electromagnetic compatibility by using LVDS.

These four differential pairs are carrying {{the same information}} previously transferred over 22 wires, which is almost a 65% wire reduction. In addition, the close coupling of the twisted pair wires improves the EMC because the equal and opposite LVDS currents in the wires create equal and opposite electromagnetic fields that tend to cancel each other's effects. This reduces the <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions.</b> The reduced vulnerability to electrical noise interference {{comes from the fact}} the noise affects both signals commonly. Since the LVDS receiver senses {{the difference between the two}} commonly affected signals, it senses no impact from the common mode noise.|$|E

40|$|This {{packaging}} design approach can help heritage hardware meet a flight project's stringent EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> requirement. The approach requires only minor modifications to a hardware's chassis and mainly concentrates on its connector interfaces. The {{solution is to}} raise the surface area where the connector is mounted by a few millimeters using a pedestal, and then wrapping with conductive tape from the cable backshell down to the surface-mounted connector. This design approach {{has been applied to}} JPL flight project subsystems. The EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> requirements for flight projects can vary from benign to mission critical. If the project's EMC requirements are stringent, the best approach to meet EMC requirements would be to design an EMC control program for the project early on and implement EMC design techniques starting with the circuit board layout. This is the ideal scenario for hardware that is built from scratch. Implementation of EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> mitigation techniques can mature as the design progresses, with minimal impact to the design cycle. The real challenge exists for hardware that is planned to be flown following a built-to-print approach, in which heritage hardware from a past project with a different set of requirements is expected to perform satisfactorily for a new project. With acceptance of heritage, the design would already be established (circuit board layout and components have already been pre-determined), and hence any <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> mitigation techniques would only be applicable at the packaging level.
