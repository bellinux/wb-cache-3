5000|$|The <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>viper</b> is one {{of three}} species of puff adders. Some reasons these venomous snakes are called puff adders are that, when excited, they have the ability to enlarge their size {{considerably}} by inflating their bodies. This creates the [...] "puffed" [...] look that is approximately twice the normal size of the snake's body. These adders also make a sort of hissing noise through their nose as part of their respiratory function.|$|E

50|$|Bitis nasicornis is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dangerous snakes of Africa. Small doses of the snake's primarily hemotoxic venom can be deadly. This is unlike the Gaboon viper, the largest of the vipers, which uses a considerably larger amount of venom. Bitis nasicornis has both neurotoxic, as well as hemotoxic venom, as do most other venomous snakes. The hemotoxic venom in <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>vipers</b> is much more dominant. This venom attacks the circulatory system of the snake's victim, destroying tissue and blood vessels. Internal bleeding also occurs. When not in use, the rhino viper's fangs are folded up into the roof of the snake's mouth. The snake has the ability to control the movement of its fangs. Simply because the rhino viper may open its mouth does not mean that the fangs will flip down into place. These fangs penetrate deep into the victim and the small doses of venom flow through the hollow fangs into the wound.|$|R
40|$|The venom of the <b>rhinoceros</b> horned <b>viper</b> (Bitis nasicornis) {{has been}} studied in vitro and {{has been shown to}} be anticoagulant. This action {{appeared}} to be due to an effect on both the extrinsic and intrinsic blood thromboplastin mechanisms. The venom was also proteolytic and in purified caseinolytic systems activated plasminogen, enhanced the activation of plasminogen by streptokinase, and potentiated the action of plasmin. In the euglobulin clot lysis system high concentrations of venom produced inhibition. The crude venom increased platelet adhesiveness but in high concentrations delayed the snowstorm effect in the Chandler's tube system and inhibited platelet adenosine diphosphate reactivity. Passage through carboxymethylcellulose yielded six fractions. One possessed anticoagulant activity, inhibited plasmin, and increased the optical density of platelet-rich plasma. The other five fractions shortened the plasma recalcification time but had no effect on plasmin activity. Four fractions aggregated platelets and enhanced platelet adenosine diphosphate reactivity...|$|R

50|$|A {{majority}} of the collections within the Museum are items gathered from various tribes within Kenya such as the Luyha, Maasai and the Turkana. The museum displays their traditional Kenyan homes, weaponry, utensils and native musical instruments. The museum also includes a nature trail, which was created in 1977 and is located towards {{the back of the}} museum. This nature trail conserves various rare plants and animals. It is a serene makeshift rainforest that allows visitors of the museum to experience what itâ€™s like to be inside an actual Kenyan rainforest. The museum also holds animals such as Nile Crocodiles , Leopard Tortoises and various poisonous snakes such as the Puff Adder, Rock Python, Gaboon Viper and the <b>Rhinoceros</b> <b>Viper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The reptile {{house was}} remodeled in 2012 to include taipans, death adders, Chinese {{alligator}}, and alligator snapping turtle. With the renovations the building houses mostly reptiles. The exhibit houses {{many species of}} cobras, rattle snakes, and lizards. There are two large areas where the zoo's Komodo dragons are held. In a building located near the Reptile House the zoo's temporary home for a large adult salt water crocodile and for Slender-snouted crocodile. On {{the outside of the}} Reptile House is the new Gator Swamp Exhibit, which is a large outdoor heated pool housing several adult American alligators. The reptile house received more renovations in 2017 to improve digital interpretive signage and interactive displays. Other species on display in the true reptile house as of 2017 include: Bismark Ringed Python, Asian Water Monitor, Quince monitor, Cottonmouth, Matamata Turtle, Black Mamba, Storr's Pigmy Monitor, Green Anaconda, Jumping Viper, Western Diamondback Rattlesnake, Gila Monster, Grand Caymon Blue Iguana, <b>Rhinoceros</b> <b>Viper,</b> White Lipped Viper, Red Spitting Cobra, and Black Spitting Cobra.|$|E
50|$|Reptile House was {{refurbished}} {{and most}} of it re-built through much of 2008 through to 2010, to make the improvements required for the growth of the animal collection (from 18 species in 2008 to 46 species at the start of 2011). A wide variety of reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are housed in the reptile collection including; western diamondback rattlesnake, Gray's monitors, Cuban crocodile, dwarf crocodiles, common snapping turtles, white lipped tree <b>vipers,</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> iguanas, golden mantella frogs (for which Wingham Wildlife Park hold the ESF studbook) and many more.|$|R
40|$|The {{characters}} {{which serve}} {{to distinguish the}} Gaboon Viper (Bitis gabonica) from the <b>Rhinoceros</b> <b>Viper</b> (B. nasicornis) are examined {{in relation to a}} subadult female from Dabocrom, Ghana, which displays characters of both species. It is more like B. nasicornis than B. gabonica but the admixture of B. gabonica characters is probably the result of interbreeding...|$|E
40|$|Snake venoms {{are rich}} sources of toxic {{proteins}} and small molecules. This study {{was directed at}} molecules of molecular mass below 1 kDa. Thirty different venoms, of either neurotoxic or haemorrhagic type, were fractionated using size-exclusion chromatography. Only venoms of the Puff adder (Bitis arietans), Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica), and <b>Rhinoceros</b> <b>viper</b> (Bitis nasicornis) exhibited large absorbance peaks at gimel(280 nm) in the total volume range of the chromatographic column indicating the presence of abundant low molecular mass material. Analysis of fractions containing this material using both HPLC and capillary electrophoresis interfaced with electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometry unequivocally established that the bioactive nucleoside, adenosine, was the major component. The concentrations of adenosine found (Puff adder- 97. 7 x 10 (- 6) mol L- 1; Gaboon viper- 28. 0 x 10 (- 6) mol L- 1; and Rhinoceros viper- 56. 8 x 10 (- 6) mol L- 1) were above those required to activate all known sub-types of adenosine receptors. Adenosine may thus act {{at the site of}} envenomation causing local vasodilatation and {{may play a role in}} the subsequent systemic hypotension observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The protein {{composition}} of the venoms of the West African Gaboon viper (Bitis gabonica rhinoceros), the <b>rhinoceros</b> <b>viper</b> (Bitis nasicornis), and the horned puff adder (Bitis caudalis) were analyzed by RP-HPLC, N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting, and CID-MS/ MS. In line with previous proteomic and transcriptomic analyses showing that snake venom proteins belong to only a few major protein families, the venom proteomes of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros, Bitis nasicornis, and Bitis caudalis comprise, respectively, toxins from 11, 9, and 8 toxin families. Dimeric disintegrins, PLA 2 molecules, serine proteinases, a CRISP, C-type lectin-like proteins, L-amino acid oxidases, and snake venom metalloproteases {{are present in the}} three Bitis snake venoms, though they depart from each other in the composition and the relative abundance of their toxins. The venom composition appears to keep information on the evolutionary history of congeneric taxa. Protein similarity coefficients used to estimate the similarity of venom proteins of the Bitis taxa sampled here and in previous studies (eg. Bitis arietans and Bitis gabonica gabonica) support the monophyly of the three West African taxa (B. g. gabonica, B. g. rhinoceros, and B. nasicornis) based on genetic distance reconstructions, the lack of alliances between B. arietans and any other Bitis species, and are consistent with the taxonomic association of Bitis caudalis within the differentiated group of small Bitis species. The low level of venom toxin composition similarity between the two conventionally recognized subspecies of Bitis gabonica, B. g. gabonica and B. g. rhinoceros, supports the consideration by some authors of B. g. rhinoceros as a separate species, Bitis rhinoceros. Moreover, our proteomic data fit better to a weighted phylogram based on overall genetic distances than to an unweighted maximum-parsimony tree...|$|E
