Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> loss.|$|E

In philosophy and critical theory postmodernity refers to the state or condition of society which is said to exist after modernity, a historical condition that marks the reasons for the end of modernity. This usage is ascribed to the philosophers Jean-François Lyotard and Jean Baudrillard.|$|E

Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs.

500|$|Structurally, Devotions {{consists}} of 23 chronologically ordered sections – representing the length, in days, of Donne's illness. Each one contains a 'meditation', {{in which he}} describes a stage of his illness, an 'expostulation' containing his <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> stage, and finally a prayer in which he makes peace with the disease. In the five editions published during the 17th century, the book opens with a Latin preface, titled [...] "Stationes, sive Periodi in Morbo, ad quas referuntur Meditationes sequentes". Also 23 sections long, each line of the preface is followed by what purports to be an English translation of the Latin. Joan Webber argues that these lines constitute a poem, in dactylic hexameter; David Novarr disputes this, arguing that Stationes [...] "has none of Donne's customary wit, drama, and imagination". Instead, it represents the Stations of the Cross, or supplicatio stativa. Mary Arshagouni, writing in Modern Philology, argues that the stationes indeed constitute a poem – or, at least, {{something more than a}} mere table of contents. The Latin lines play-off the English translations, and contain nuanced meaning not found in the English that better represents the sections to which they refer.|$|E

(now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had a great sense of humor [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title."
