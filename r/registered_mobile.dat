3000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the update phase is to modify the {{existing}} authentication entities to increase the degree of unpredictability in the authentication process. This phase is triggered due to reset of the expiry period EXP assigned to each <b>registered</b> <b>mobile</b> client. During the registration phase the cloud server generates an expiry period for each mobile client. This expiry period EXP is checked at the cloud server for each authentication request made by a mobile client. The assigned EXP for a mobile client is basically a real value that decrements over time {{and if it is}} reset or reaches zero then the client is considered as an unregistered client. Apart from assigning an expiry period for a registered client, the cloud server assigns the rate of decrement r [...]...|$|E
