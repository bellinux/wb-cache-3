40|$|We study two {{reservation}} deposit {{policies for}} a service firm {{to increase its}} revenue through higher capacity utilization. First, under the "no deposit" policy, the firm requires no reservation deposit and imposes no "no show" penalty. Anticipating potential "no shows," a firm may overbook; hence, {{there is no guarantee}} that the <b>reserved</b> <b>service</b> will be provided under the no deposit policy. On the contrary, under the "guarantee deposit" policy, a guarantee deposit is required for each customer to make a non-cancelable reservation. To honor the <b>reserved</b> <b>service</b> under the guarantee deposit policy, the firm will not overbook. We analyze each deposit policy as a Stackelberg game in which the firm acts as the leader who selects the booking capacity under the no deposit policy (or the required deposit under the guarantee deposit policy), and each customer acts as the follower who decides whether to reserve or not. Our model incorporates rational customer behavior so that each customer will take other customers' behavior into consideration. Using the firm's optimal booking capacity (optimal required deposit) in equilibrium under the no deposit policy (the guarantee deposit policy), we compare the firm's expected profits under these two policies in a monopolistic environment. Our results suggest that the firm should charge a higher optimal retail price under the no deposit policy, and adopt the no deposit policy when the demand rate is below a certain threshold. By analyzing a game of duopolistic competition between two firms, we develop the conditions under which the firms will adopt a particular pair of deposit policies in equilibrium, and we show this game can lead to a Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, when both firms charge the same retail price, we show the existence of an equilibrium in which both firms adopt the no deposit policy...|$|E
40|$|With the {{projected}} growth {{in demand for}} bandwidth and telecommunications services will come the requirement for a multiservice backbone network of far greater efficiency, capacity, and flexibility than the ISDN is able to satisfy. This class of network has been termed the broadband ISDN, and {{the design of the}} switching nodes of such a network is the subject of much current research. This paper investigates one possible solution. The design and performance, for multiservice traffic, is presented of a fast packet switch based upon a nonbuffered, multistage interconnection network. It is shown that for an implementation in current CMOS technology, operating at 50 MHz, switches with a total traffic capacity of up to 150 Gbit/s may be constructed. Furthermore, if the <b>reserved</b> <b>service</b> traffic load is limited on each input port to a maximum of 80 percent of switch port saturation, then a maximum delay across the switch of the order of 100 s may be guaranteed, for 99 percent of the reserved se [...] ...|$|E
40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{decision making}} {{in the area of}} road maintenance, the Di-rectorate of Roads in France decided five years ago to use AI tech-niques and to make an expert system called Erasme available to various government agencies. Erasme was developed with SMECI, a high-level expert system shell, and integrates innovative AI concepts. During June to November 1989, Erasme was submitted to 25 sites for field testing. This experience enabled us to assess the benefits, costs, and objectives of Erasme.

40|$|WF 2 Q+ is {{a packet}} {{scheduler}} providing optimal QoS guarantees {{at a low}} computational complexity. It allows {{a fraction of the}} total link capacity to be reserved to each packet flow to transmit, and it guarantees to each flow the minimum possible deviation with respect to its <b>reserved</b> <b>service</b> over any time interval. WF 2 Q+ has been defined assuming that the set of the packet flows to transmit is fixed and known at system design time. Unfortunately, such assumption is widely violated in many systems, such as Web servers or Internet routers. In this paper we propose a general scheme for extending WF 2 Q+ to support also the case where the set of packet flows to transmit is unknown beforehand and varies over time. The scheme preserves the service guarantees provided by WF 2 Q+, and allows different tradeoffs to be realized between computational complexity and system responsiveness to changing traffic mixes. After investigating {{the pros and cons of}} the possible solutions based on such general scheme, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for enabling WF 2 Q+ to support a dynamic traffic mi...|$|E

A similar but less stringent path was set out for those enlisted into the primary or secondary reserve categories; they would also end their service on the national service list. The least rigorous path was for those enlisted into the hoju hei-eki (replenishment territorial army and naval volunteer reserve), who would end their service on the national service list.|$|R

40|$|The British Army Reserve (AR), and in {{particular}} its logistics component, is undergoing profound changes. The Future Reserves 2020 policy aims to expand the AR {{and make it more}} deployable on operations. However, to date, FR 20 has struggled to attract the recruits required to man this more deployable reserve force, despite recruitment campaigns offering increased monetary benefits. This study sampled AR logistics soldiers’ reasons for joining, remaining in service, and mobilizing when deployed. Consistent with the previous research, the study found that soldiers who joined for institutional reasons were more associated with longer career intentions and mobilizing for intrinsic reasons. Soldiers who joined for occupational reasons were less satisfied with all elements of <b>reserve</b> <b>service</b> and deployed in order to fulfil their contracts. These trends suggest that recruitment campaigns that stress the pecuniary benefits of <b>reserve</b> <b>service</b> may attract soldiers less committed to <b>reserve</b> <b>service</b> and deployments and who are harder to retai...|$|R
