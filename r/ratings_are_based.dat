As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>ratings</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on samples, it is {{possible}} for shows to get a 0.0 rating, despite having an audience; the CNBC talk show McEnroe was one notable example. Another example is The CW show, CW Now, which received two 0.0 ratings in the same season. In 2014, Nielsen reported that American viewership of live television (totaling on average four hours and 32 minutes per day) had dropped 12 minutes per day compared to the year before. Nielsen reported several reasons for the shift away from live television: increased viewership of time-shifted television (mainly through DVRs) and viewership of internet video (clips from video sharing websites and streams of full-length television shows).|$|E

There is a longer time limit where each player has a minute to move, and hayago where the players are given just 10 seconds to make a move. There is no time limit, so any given player can play 1 or 10 games in one day. The league also has a rating system. The <b>ratings</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on the players' winning percentages. There is a handicap, but one that was very different than the orthodox system of allowing the opponent to place the number of stones to the difference in rank. The stronger player gets 10 seconds less in their time for every number difference in rank. There is also a reverse komi rule. 0 komi, —3 komi, —5 komi, and —8 komi.|$|E

40|$|The load {{ratings for}} these Standard bridges were {{calculated}} {{in compliance with}} the 1978 AASHTO Manual for Maintenance Inspection of Bridges, using the appropriate allowable stresses for the materials specified by the Standard plans. Distribution of loads is {{in compliance with the}} Manual unless otherwise noted. Except for truss spans, all bridges with roadway widths of 18 ft. or less were rated for one lane of traffic. All 18 ft. roadway truss bridges were rated for both one and two lanes of traffic. All bridges with roadway widths exceeding 18 ft. were rated for two lanes of traffic. If the posting rating for two lane bridges was less than legal, then the bridges were rated for traffic restricted to one lane, or to one lane centered in the roadway, as noted on the summary sheet. The <b>ratings</b> <b>are</b> applicable to bridges built in accordance with the standard plans and which exhibit no significant deterioration or damage to the structural members, and which have no added wearing surface material in excess of that noted on the summary sheets and used in the calculations. The inventory and operating <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> <b>based</b> upon the standard AASHTO HS 20 - 44 loading. The legal load <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> <b>based</b> upon the three typical Iowa legal vehicles shown on page 5. The legal load <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> <b>based</b> upon the maximum allowable Operating Rating stresses specified in the Manual. Refer to notations on the summary sheets for additional qualifications on the load ratings for specific standard bridge series. Load ratings for standard bridges with wood floors must <b>be</b> <b>based</b> upon existing conditions of attachment of the wood flooring to the top flanges of longitudinal steel stringers. The <b>ratings</b> must <b>be</b> reevaluated if the existing lateral support conditions are not in accordance with conditions used for the rating and noted on the summary sheets. Details of most of the standard bridges are included in the three books of "Iowa State Highway Commission, Bridge Standards," issued in June, 1972. Copies of plans for those standard bridges that were rated, and that are not included in the original books of standard plans, are being furnished under separate cover with these rating summaries...|$|R

Using both laboratory-based (Study 1) and experience sampling (Study 2) methodologies, the authors found that high approach participants, as compared with low approach participants, made satisfaction <b>ratings</b> that <b>were</b> more strongly tied to PA. In contrast, avoidance-related motivations did not moderate {{the degree to which}} satisfaction <b>ratings</b> <b>were</b> <b>based</b> on either PA or NA.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the source and}} {{magnitude}} of marketing gains from selling structured debt securities at yields that reflect only their credit ratings, or specifically at yields on equivalently rated corporate bonds. We distinguish between credit <b>ratings</b> that <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on probabilities of default and <b>ratings</b> that <b>are</b> <b>based</b> on expected default losses. We show that subdividing a bond issued against given collateral into subordinated tranches can yield significant profits under the hypothesised pricing system. Increasing the systematic risk or reducing the total risk of the bond collateral increases the profits further. The marketing gain is generally increasing {{in the number of}} tranches and decreasing in the rating of the lowest rated tranche...|$|R
