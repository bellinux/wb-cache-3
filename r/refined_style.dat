The Lisbon style is the most popular, while Coimbra's is the more <b>refined</b> <b>style.</b> Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has produced many renowned musicians. According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon you clap your hands, in Coimbra you cough as if clearing your throat.|$|E
25|$|With their {{tailored}} {{suits and}} detailed choreography, the Temptations set the bar high for male soul and R {{groups of the}} period. Before the Temptations became popular, most black vocal groups were rough, high-energy acts featuring vocals that were more raw and dance movements that were more improvisational. Only a few performers, including contemporaries Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, and the Four Tops, showed the <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> that would be popularized by the Temptations.|$|E

The easy listening radio format has been generally, but not completely, superseded by the soft adult contemporary format.|$|R

25|$|Charlotte Doyle – Charlotte is the thirteen-year-old upper-class {{girl with}} a proper {{education}} and proper manners. As such, she has grown accustomed to a <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> of living. Sheltered from the harsher sides of life, she has a narrow-minded view of things and places great value in propriety. She is returning to her family from a private girls' school in England. In the end, she decides {{to run away from}} home and become a true sailor, even though she is inexperienced.|$|E
25|$|Brunelleschi, {{and others}} like him, {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} highly <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules of placement and proportion that had long been neglected. They sought to rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito. They are essays in the Classical, with rows of cylindrical columns, Corinthian capitals, entablatures, semi-circular arches and apsidal chapels.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Plantagenet era an English Gothic {{architecture}} flourished—the medieval cathedrals such as Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and York Minster {{are prime}} examples. Expanding on the Norman base {{there was also}} castles, palaces, great houses, universities and parish churches. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th century Tudor style; the four-centred arch, {{now known as the}} Tudor arch, was a defining feature as were wattle and daub houses domestically. In the aftermath of the Renaissance, the English Baroque style appeared, which architect Christopher Wren particularly championed. English Baroque is a casual term, sometimes used to refer to the developments in English architecture that were parallel to the evolution of Baroque architecture in continental Europe between the Great Fire of London (1666) and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Queen Anne Style architecture flourished in England from about 1660 to about 1720, even though the Queen's reign covered only the period 1702-1714. Buildings in the Queen Anne style are strongly influenced by Dutch domestic architecture: typically, they are simple rectilinear designs in red brick, with an undemonstrative charm. Georgian architecture followed in a more <b>refined</b> <b>style,</b> evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath {{is one of the best}} examples of this. With the emergence of romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace.

Counteracting the <b>refined</b> <b>styles</b> prominent in R showcased by Milli Vanilli and Boyz II Men, Mr. Dalvin created the group's image. Combs helped get the image thru to Andre Harrell, perpetuating hip-hop fashion, such as baseball caps and Timberland boots, to the group in order to establish a different aesthetic in the genre. The group was introduced after providing background vocals on the song [...] "Treat Them Like They Want to Be Treated", and performed live on Soul Train on June 11, 1991.|$|R
500|$|Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners for {{the seventh}} and eighth seasons, {{believed}} that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season Bob had already {{been the focus of}} four stories, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him. Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> of speaking. Despite these challenges, however, creators of The Simpsons usually look forward to [...] "Sideshow Bob episodes"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write, and former director Dominic Polcino describes them as [...] "a treat" [...] to work on.|$|E
500|$|During {{the comic}} book phase of his career, Lichtenstein often {{slightly}} altered the colorization of the original source. According to Marco Livingstone, his early comic subjects comprise a [...] "loose and improvised style clearly derived from de Kooning." [...] Art historian Jonathan Fineberg describes a Lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an [...] "...abstract expressionist picture with Mickey Mouse in it, related stylistically to the de Kooning Women". When Leo Castelli saw both Lichtenstein's and Warhol's large comic strip-based works, he elected to show only Lichtenstein's, causing Warhol to create the Campbell's Soup Cans series to avoid competing with the more <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> of comics Lichtenstein was then producing. He once said [...] "I've {{got to do something}} that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] Lichtenstein's foray into comics led to the abandonment of the topic by Warhol. Although Lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources, after 1961 he avoided the easily identified sources like Popeye and Mickey Mouse.|$|E

2500|$|The Cappella Palatina is {{the royal}} chapel of the Norman kings of Sicily in the Palazzo Reale in Palermo, and was {{commissioned}} by Roger II of Sicily in 1132. [...] Initially Greek craftsmen were imported, but later work {{appears to have been}} done, in a rather less <b>refined</b> <b>style,</b> by local craftsmen in the 1160s and 1170s.; Cefalù Cathedral was also begun by Roger with Greek artists in the 1130s, but the full scheme of mosaics was never finished. [...] The Martorana church in Palermo has mosaics from the same period, though in a slightly different style.|$|E
2500|$|By the Hellenistic period most {{terracotta}} figurines {{have lost}} their religious nature, and represent characters from everyday life. Tanagra figurines, from one of several centres of production, are mass-manufactured using moulds, and then painted after firing. Dolls, figures of fashionably-dressed ladies and of actors, some of these probably portraits, were among the new subjects, depicted with a <b>refined</b> <b>style.</b> [...] These were cheap, and initially displayed in the home much like modern ornamental figurines, but were quite often buried with their owners. At the same time, cities like Alexandria, Smyrna or Tarsus produced an abundance of grotesque figurines, representing individuals with deformed members, eyes bulging and contorting themselves. Such figurines were also made from bronze.|$|E

25|$|Evolution of {{a deeper}} skull, better jaw control and a {{reduction}} of the palatine tusks is only seen in the more advanced reptile-like forms, possibly {{in connection with the}} evolution of more effective breathing, allowing for a more <b>refined</b> hunting <b>style.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Many more pure {{landscape}} subjects survive {{from the}} 15th century onwards; several key artists are Zen Buddhist clergy, {{and worked in}} a monochrome style with greater emphasis on brush strokes in the Chinese manner. Some schools adopted a less <b>refined</b> <b>style,</b> with smaller views giving greater emphasis to the foreground. A type of image that had an enduring appeal for Japanese artists, and {{came to be called}} the [...] "Japanese style", is in fact first found in China. This combines one or more large birds, animals or trees in the foreground, typically to one side in a horizontal composition, with a wider landscape beyond, often only covering portions of the background. Later versions of this style often dispensed with a landscape background altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in England for {{the first}} time, the American writer, in Hazlitt's judgement, saw what he {{encountered}} with the eyes of one steeped {{in the writings of}} the previous century. Irving, he notes, has absorbed the <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> of the older writers and writes well: [...] "Mr. Irvine's [...] language is with great taste and felicity modeled on that of Addison, Goldsmith, Sterne, or Mackenzie"; but what he sees might have been seen with their eyes, and are such as are scarcely to be found in modern England. [...] "Instead of looking round to see what we are, he sets to work to describe us as we were—at second hand. He has Parson Adams, or Sir Roger de Coverley in his mind's eye; and he makes a village curate or a country 'squire sit to these admired models for their portraits {{in the beginning of the}} nineteenth century." [...] As such characters and customs hardly had any actual existence any more, Hazlitt even suggests that they might have been spun out of Irving's imagination, based on his reading of the English authors of the previous century.|$|E

5000|$|William Thomas Lewis (1748?-1811), {{known as}} [...] "Gentleman" [...] Lewis, {{due to his}} <b>refined</b> acting <b>style,</b> was an English actor. He {{was said to be}} [...] "the most {{complete}} fop on the stage". In later life he went into theatrical management.|$|R
6000|$|Isaac Walton (1593-1683), or Isaak, as {{he always}} wrote it, was a modest linen {{merchant}} who, {{in the midst of}} troublous times, kept his serenity of spirit by attending strictly to his own affairs, by reading good books, and by going fishing. His taste for literature is reflected with rare simplicity in his Lives of Donne, Wotton, Hooker, George Herbert and Bishop Sanderson, a series of biographies which are among the earliest and sweetest in our language. Their charm lies partly in their <b>refined</b> <b>style,</b> but more largely in their revelation of character; for Walton chose men of gentle spirit for his subjects, men who were like himself in cherishing the still depths of life rather than its noisy shallows, and wrote of them with the understanding of perfect sympathy. Wordsworth expressed his appreciation of the work in a noble sonnet beginning: ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet could I not {{surrender}} him wholly to {{the tutelage}} of the pagan (which, literally interpreted, signifies village) muse without yet a further effort for his conversion, and to this end I resolved that whatever of poetic fire yet burned in myself, aided by the assiduous bellows of correct models, should be put in requisition. Accordingly, when my ingenious young parishioner brought to my study a copy of verses which he had written touching the acquisition of territory resulting from the Mexican war, and the folly of leaving the question of slavery or freedom to the adjudication of chance, I did myself indite a short fable or apologue after the manner of Gay and Prior, to the end that he might see how easily even such subjects as he treated of were capable of a more <b>refined</b> <b>style</b> and more elegant expression.
