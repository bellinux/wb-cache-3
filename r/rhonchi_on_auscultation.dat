40|$|Objectives: Data on {{prognostic}} factors {{among children}} with severe pneumonia are scarce in middle-income countries. We investigated prognostic factors for an adverse outcome among children {{admitted to the}} Hôpital d’Enfants de Rabat, Morocco with World Health Organization-defined clinically severe pneumonia (CSP). Methods: Children aged 2 – 59 months {{admitted to the hospital}} and fulfilling the CSP definition were recruited into this 13 -month prospective study. A poor prognosis was defined as death, a need for intensive care, or a Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score ≥ 3. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent predictive factors for a poor prognosis. Results: Of the 689 children included in this analysis, 55 (8. 0 %) required intensive care and 28 died (4. 0 %). Five hundred and two (72. 8 %) children were classified as having a good prognosis and 187 (27. 2 %) as having a poor prognosis. A history of prematurity (odds ratio (OR) 2. 50, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 24 – 5. 04), of fever (OR 2. 25, 95 % CI 1. 32 – 3. 83), living in a house with smokers (OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 18 – 2. 72), impaired consciousness (OR 10. 96, 95 % CI 2. 88 – 41. 73), cyanosis (OR 2. 09, 95 % CI 1. 05 – 4. 15), pallor (OR 2. 27, 95 % CI 1. 34 – 3. 84), having <b>rhonchi</b> <b>on</b> <b>auscultation</b> (OR 2. 45, 95 % CI 1. 58 – 3. 79), and human metapneumovirus infection (OR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 13 – 4. 02) were all independent risk factors for an adverse outcome, whereas a history of asthma (OR 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 25 – 0. 84) was the only independent risk factor for a positive outcome. Conclusions: The early identification of factors associated with a poor prognosis could improve management strategies and the likelihood of survival of Moroccan children with severe pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|A 31 -year-old {{man with}} a history of AIDS with a CD 4 cell count of 200 cells/mL {{presented}} to the emergency department with dyspnea at rest, cough, night sweats, and hemoptysis. The patient was afebrile. Evaluation revealed symmetrically widespread raised purplish plaques on his back, diffuse <b>rhonchi</b> <b>on</b> chest <b>auscultation,</b> bilateral infiltrates <b>on</b> chest ra-diograph, and a CD 4 cell count of 9 cells/mL. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with no improvement. Bronchoscopy was performed and revealed erythema-tous lesions in the large airways (Image A and Image B) consistent with endobronchial Kaposi’s sarcoma (EKS). The patient was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), which resulted in significant improvement (CD 4 cell count of 100 cells/mL). Kaposi’s sarcoma is an AIDS-defining illness and is the most common malignancy affecting persons with HIV infection. 1, 2 EKS may cause radiographic infiltrates and respiratory symptoms that mimic a variety of other infectious and neoplastic processes, including pulmo-nary tuberculosis, lung malignancy, community-acquired pneumonia, and P. carinii pneumonia. 1, 3 Thus, EKS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in im-munocompromised patients with respiratory symptoms. The incidence of EKS is uncertain due to its nonspecific presentation; prior to widespread use of ART, pulmo-nary Kaposi’s sarcoma was reported in approximately 10 % of patients with AIDS. 2 Diagnosis of EKS is made by bronchoscopy, which demonstrates the erythematous lesions of Kaposi’s sarcoma in large airways. ART is asso-ciated with regression in size of existing EKS lesions. 4 H...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Postoperative {{pulmonary}} edema is a fatal adverse event after a cardiac surgery. We here report successful management using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) for severe hypoxia with {{pulmonary edema}} after a cardiac surgery. Presentation of case: A 58 -year-old man underwent an uneventful mitral valve repair. Immediately afterwards, the patient became agitated and made vigorous inspiratory efforts. His oxygen saturation dropped to 90 %. Coarse inspiratory <b>rhonchi</b> were heard <b>on</b> <b>auscultation,</b> and copious, pink, frothy sputum was obtained with suctioning. Initial chest radiograph showed right-sided patchy opacities and interstitial infiltrates. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal cardiac function. With worsening respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, APRV was attempted. His condition and blood gas was subsequently improved. Over the following 3  days, the patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged to home on postoperative day 14. Discussion: Extracorponeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) {{is the most}} effective for severe hypoxia with pulmonary edema; however, ECMO is associated with hemorrhage and infectious complications. Alteratively, APRV was required for the successful management for severe hypoxia with pulmonary edema. Conclusion: APRV could be effective for severe hypoxia with pulmonary edema after a cardiac surgery...|$|R

40|$|Background Pericarditis is an {{important}} diagnosis to consider in a patient presenting with chest pain. It is diagnosed in 5 % of patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with chest pain {{in the absence of}} a myocardial infarction. Objective This article describes the common features and management of pericarditis in the general practice setting. Discussion Characteristic clinical findings in pericarditis include pleuritic chest pain and a pericardial friction rub <b>on</b> <b>auscultation</b> of the left lower sternal border. Electrocardiography may reveal diffuse PR depressions and diffuse ST segment elevations with upward concavity. The most common aetiologies of pericarditis are idiopathic and viral, and the most common treatment for these is nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and colchicine. The complications of pericarditis include effusion, tamponade and myopericarditis. Pericardial effusion may present as a globular heart shadow on chest X-ray. The presence of effusion, constriction or tamponade can be confirmed on echocardiography. Tamponade is potentially life threatening and is diagnosed by the clinical findings of decreased blood pressure, elevated jugular venous pressure, muffled heart sounds <b>on</b> <b>auscultation</b> and pulsus paradoxus.

40|$|Background: Foreign body {{inhalation}} {{is one of}} {{the life}} threatening emergencies. It may happen at any age, however, most of these accidents occur in children especially below the age of five. Methods: This prospective study was done at Department of chest diseases from March 2008 to November 2011. A total of sixty patients, with suspicion of tracheobronchial foreign body were included in the study. Results: Sixty patients were studied. Forty (66 %) were female and twenty (34 %) were male. 45 patients (75 %) were above 15  years, 5 (8 %) were between five and fifteen years and 10 (17 %) were below fifteen years. Thirty five patients (58 %), presented mainly with chocking, while fifteenth patients (25 %) had cough at initial presentation and ten patients (17 %) presented with mild stridor. Thirty five patients (58 %) had nothing on chest examination while fifteenth patients (25 %) had wheeze <b>on</b> <b>auscultation</b> and ten patients (17 %) had decreased air entry <b>on</b> <b>auscultation.</b> Head pin was the commonest foreign body retrieved in thirty five patients (58 %).
