50|$|Riders/rowers {{are given}} a short lesson on how to paddle the canoe to power the boat {{properly}} after leaving the dock. Small children are required to wear life jackets. Life jackets are also available for adults who cannot swim in the event the boat ever capsizes. As the canoe travels 2400 ft around Tom Sawyer Island, located {{in the center of}} the man-made river, the guides point out the sights along the way, such as a settler’s cabin and the Indian chief on horseback. The <b>ride’s</b> <b>length</b> depends upon how fast the paddlers are and how much other traffic is on the river.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, {{the park}} opened a {{successor}} to The Beast, Son of Beast, which became the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. It {{was also the first}} modern-day wooden coaster to feature an inversion, a vertical loop that was removed in 2006. Son of Beast was designed to break several world records, but one it did not attempt to break was <b>ride</b> <b>length.</b> As a result, The Beast would retain its world record for longest ride time. The Son of Beast was later dismantled in 2012.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ride</b> <b>length</b> {{from the}} initial drop should {{normally}} range from one minute five seconds to one minute twenty-five seconds. Circuits times as little as 59 seconds are possible through extensive waxing of the track, and reduction in tension on the bogey wheels. This increase in speed is not permitted during public rides, as the forces on the riders becomes severe. During testing of the renovated trains in 1987, the maximum g-force of a normal run was measured on equipment bolted into the train at 5.5 G's, which occurs in the second loop.|$|E

5000|$|Horizons, in its concept phase, {{was named}} Century 3 (or Century III), to {{recognize}} the third century of American existence (1976-2076). The name was changed to Futureprobe to help appeal the attraction toward international guests who wouldn't understand or appreciate Century 3. In the end, the Futureprobe name was scrapped due to the medical connotation of the word [...] "probe". After much debate, GE and Disney officials settled on the name Horizons. Prior {{to the start of}} construction, the project's budget was slashed by $10 million (USD). The building size was reduced and the length of the ride was shrunk by 35%, shortening the <b>ride</b> <b>length</b> by 600 ft.|$|E
50|$|The surfing {{contest is}} divided into up to four dog weight classes, plus a tandem dog and a tandem dog and human contest. There are also a fetch contest and a fashion show. Dogs surf with the {{assistance}} of a human who selects the wave or waves for the dog to ride. In the non-tandem portion of the contest, first, second, and third place are awarded in each weight class based on <b>ride</b> <b>length,</b> technique, and attitude as well as wave size during a ten-minute heat, and the top two dogs in each class then compete for the Top All-Around Surfing Championship Awards. The event raises money for animal, surfing, and environmental charities.|$|E

50|$|Although the <b>ride</b> <b>length</b> {{was said}} to be fairly short (about 40 seconds in {{duration}} {{from the top of the}} lift hill), all the Giant Cyclone Safety Coasters were known for their intense and often brutal ride experience. The Lightning had already killed a rider by its second day of operation at Revere Beach. The incident occurred when a girl fell to her death from the coaster. The ride was then shut down for 20 minutes so that her body could be removed before operation resumed. The Lightning was not the only roller coaster at Revere Beach with a poor safety record, however. Derby Racer, for example, killed or critically injured at least 5 people in its 25 years of operation.|$|E
50|$|In December 2010 Bournemouth Council {{announced}} that ASR would {{return in the}} spring of 2011 to make modifications to the reef. Four bags were to be situated on the south-east corner of the reef and a further three pillow bags between existing sections of the reef. The intention is that the wave depth will be improved through the gentler slope thus created, resulting in the right-hand <b>ride</b> <b>length</b> extended to 65metres. ASR will receive £55,000 on completion of this work out of the £150,000 withheld final payment. In April 2011 one bag was removed and another repaired after what was suspected to be propeller damage from an unknown boat colliding with the reef. The reef was closed during the summer of 2011 having been closed for safety reasons in March, in July Bournemouth Councillor Rod Cooper, Cabinet Member for Economy & Tourism {{announced that}} ASR ltd would undertake the repair work and begin the improvement work in early August. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement on the repair works for the Boscombe reef and {{that we will be able}} to start the improvement works at the same time. This remains our flagship project and, as ever, we are committed to delivering a right-hand wave that Bournemouth and ourselves can be proud of.” Nick Behunin, Managing Director of ASR Ltd, July 2011 ASR Ltd began the repair work in mid August 2011. In October 2011 Bournemouth council announced that due to the autumn weather the repair and improvement work would not be completed until spring 2012. ASR went into Liquidation in September 2012. By September 2013 no further work had been undertaken and the reef remained closed.In October 2013 Mark Smith, service director for tourism at Bournemouth Council, was quoted as saying “The council has successfully reached an insurance settlement for the surf reef and so is now undertaking the necessary work to ensure the reef is safe for people to use. This is progressing well and the reef will form an integral part of the Coastal Activity Park, which is scheduled to open in Spring 2014.”. Bournemouth council received £306,531 in respect of two insurance claims for damage to the reef, the council's intention being to repair the reef to its original condition and reopen it in April 2014. The council are registered as an unsecured creditor of ASR for the sum of £14,800.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrom {{the end of}} the 19 th to {{the dawn}} of the 20 th century, {{technological}} development rendered the use of horse as source of energy and power progressively obsolete, promoting the displacement of its age-old utilitarian functions (transportation, work and war) as well as social functions as a marker of distinction. Nonetheless, the advent of leisure society encouraged a redefinition of the horse and its social representations, a process spearheaded by the popular arts, especially those meant for child and youth audiences. The {{purpose of this article is}} two-fold. The first is to understand the historical role of popular arts (literature, movies) in the evolution of the conceptualization of human-horse relationship and the concomitant entrance of horse riding into leisure society, marked by dual processes turning it into an ever-more female and youth-oriented practice. The second is to examine the actual influence of the popular equine arts and the alter ego horse paradigm that they have created on riders’ current practices; the latter are examined in relation to diverse criteria such as age, gender, type of <b>riding,</b> <b>length</b> of experience, social status and nationality...|$|R

After exiting the helix, the train makes right-hand turn, before the track levels out on the brake run. The train then makes another right had turn, which {{goes back into the}} station. The train makes 2 circuits per ride, due to the <b>ride's</b> short <b>length.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Long pasterns {{have been}} favored {{because they can}} diffuse impact, giving a more {{comfortable}} <b>ride.</b> However, excess <b>length</b> puts extreme tension on the tendons and ligaments {{of the back of}} the leg, predisposing the horse to a bowed tendon or suspensory ligament injury.
