60|$|James the wheelwright {{was busy}} with his tinder, with John the smith bending over him, ready with a <b>resin</b> <b>torch,</b> which would start the conflagration.|$|E
60|$|Quicker than a {{flash of}} {{lightning}} he turned, and once more grasping Bucephalus in the partially disabled hand he tore with the other the <b>resin</b> <b>torch</b> out of its iron socket, and shouting to his two companions to hold their ground he, with the guttering lighted torch charged straight into the crowd.|$|E
60|$|These {{different}} objects, and {{the persons}} in the cottage, who composed the only surviving members of the fisherman's family, were strangely and wildly lit up by the blaze of the fire and by the still brighter glare of a <b>resin</b> <b>torch</b> stuck into a block of wood in the chimney-corner. The red and yellow light played full on the weird face {{of the old man}} as he lay opposite to it, and glanced fitfully on the figures of the young girl, Gabriel, and the two children; the great, gloomy shadows rose and fell, and grew and lessened in bulk about the walls like visions of darkness, animated by a supernatural specter-life, while the dense obscurity outside spreading before the curtainless window seemed as a wall of solid darkness that had closed in forever around the fisherman's house. The night scene within the cottage was almost as wild and as dreary to look upon as the night scene without.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the love}} of Christ," [...] wailed the woman piteously, as her bare feet buried in the snow finally slid away from the {{protecting}} threshold, and she appeared in the full light of the <b>resin</b> <b>torches,</b> with black unkempt hair, ragged shift and kirtle and a wild terror-stricken look in her black eyes.|$|R
25|$|Known tools include adzes, {{pounding}} and smithing stones, {{and various}} finely or coarsely woven baskets for small-grained or larger goods, {{as well as}} bamboo and wooden containers. Fires are maintained as embers inside dwellings, possibly assisted by <b>resin</b> <b>torches.</b> There exist fishing nets and basic outrigger canoes used for fishing and collecting shellfish from the lagoon but not for open-sea excursions.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a low}} postern gate in {{the wall}} just below the <b>resin</b> <b>torches.</b> The gate was open and in the {{darkness}} beyond vague, moving forms could be seen huddled together in {{what looked like a}} narrow, unlighted passage. It was from this huddled mass of humanity that the wails and calls for divine protection proceeded, whilst the laughter and the threats came from the crowd.|$|R
60|$|The {{details of}} the picture which had the low postern gate for its central {{interest}} were gradually becoming more defined. Now {{the figure of a}} woman showed clearly under the flickering light of the <b>resin</b> <b>torches,</b> a woman with rough, dark hair that hung loosely round her face, and bare arms and legs, of which the flesh, blue with cold, gleamed weirdly against the dark oak panelling of the gate.|$|R
60|$|In the fog {{that hung}} thickly {{in the narrow}} street it was at first {{difficult}} to distinguish {{exactly what was going}} on. Certain it is that a fairly dense crowd, which swelled visibly every moment as idlers joined in from many sides, had congregated at the corner of Dam Straat, there where a couple of <b>resin</b> <b>torches</b> fixed in iron brackets against a tall stuccoed wall, shed a flickering and elusive light on the forms and faces of a group of men in the forefront of the throng.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} tabonuco (or gommier, also candlewood), Dacryodes excelsa is a large, {{dominant}} tree found in Puerto Rico {{and other parts}} of the Caribbean. The seeds of the tree are a source of food for birds. Like all members, the tree releases sap from the bark when wounded. The clear sap oozes from the tree and hardens to a white, aromatic waxy resin that can be used to make candles and incense. Before the arrival of the Spaniards to Puerto Rico, the native Taínos used the <b>resin</b> to make <b>torches.</b> The wood itself is useful for constructing housing, furniture, boxes, small boats, and a variety of other wood-based products; the utility of the wood is comparable to that of mahogany and birch. In addition, species like Canarium littorale, Dacryodes costata, Santiria laevigata, and Santiria tomentosa from Malaysia, as well as Aucoumea klaineana and Canarium schweinfurthii from Africa, also produce valuable wood for construction projects and carpentry.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of compatible additives for hot corrosion inhibition in high temperature application requires test methods which yield significant results {{on a short}} time scale. The present study aims at {{the evaluation of the}} effect of hot corrosion inhibiting model additives on the performance of an ablative phenolic <b>resin</b> using oxy-acetylene <b>torch</b> test which measure different properties. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) in combination with energy disperse Xray (EDX) are used. Two kinds of corrosion inhibiting additives are employed: an inorganic inhibitor based on graphene oxide sheets (GO); a ceramic nanoparticle (ZrB 2) with inhibiting properties. The results obtained show that hot corrosion inhibiting additives drastically modify the ablation and thermal stability. The experimental approach described in this paper should be useful for additive development in carbon fiber/phenolic composite because it yields a more durable product than can be obtained by neat composite of how a given additive affects the ablation performance in a hot corrosive environment...|$|R
60|$|One more cave I {{must tell}} you of, {{to show you how}} old some caves must be, and then I must stop; and that is the cave of Caripe, in Venezuela, which is the most northerly part of South America. There, {{in the face of a}} {{limestone}} cliff, crested with enormous flowering trees, and festooned with those lovely creepers of which you have seen a few small ones in hothouses, there opens an arch as big as the west front of Winchester Cathedral, and runs straight in like a cathedral nave for more than 1400 feet. Out of it runs a stream; and along the banks of that stream, as far as the sunlight strikes in, grow wild bananas, and palms, and lords and ladies (as you call them), which are not, like ours, one foot, but many feet high. Beyond that the cave goes on, with subterranean streams, cascades, and halls, no man yet knows how far. A friend of mine last year went in farther, I believe, than any one yet has gone; but, instead of taking Indian torches made of bark and <b>resin,</b> or even <b>torches</b> made of Spanish wax, such as a brave bishop of those parts used once when he went in farther than any one before him, he took with him some of that beautiful magnesium light which you have seen often here at home. And in one place, when he lighted up the magnesium, he found himself in a hall full 300 feet high--higher far, that is, than the dome of St. Paul's--and a very solemn thought it was to him, he said, that he had seen what no other human being ever had seen; and that no ray of light had ever struck on that stupendous roof in all the ages since the making of the world. But if he found out something which he did not expect, he was disappointed in something which he did expect. For the Indians warned him of a hole in the floor which (they told him) was an unfathomable abyss. And lo and behold, when he turned the magnesium light upon it, the said abyss was just about eight feet deep. But it is no wonder that the poor Indians with their little smoky torches should make such mistakes; no wonder, too, that they should be afraid to enter far into those gloomy vaults; that they should believe that the souls of their ancestors live in that dark cave; and that they should say that when they die they will go to the Guacharos, as they call the birds that fly with doleful screams out of the cave to feed at night, and in again at daylight, to roost and sleep.|$|R
