5|$|During {{the years}} of legal proceedings, {{disability}} <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability <b>rights</b> <b>groups,</b> led by Not Dead Yet, along with four other amici, filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube. They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent.|$|E

5|$|While {{the bill}} had been {{proposed}} by Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Mel Martinez, {{it also had}} the support of Democratic Senator Tom Harkin due to disability rights concerns in the Schiavo case. Harkin had worked with disability <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> for years and co-authored the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. American disability <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> traditionally tend to ally themselves with Democrats and the political left; however, in the Schiavo case they joined pro-life organizations in opposing the removal of her feeding tube and supporting the Palm Sunday Compromise. According to Marilyn Golden, Harkin's support was necessary for passage of the bill, as any voice opposition by Democrats would have delayed it.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Anti-vivisection {{groups have}} {{reported}} on abuse of animals inside testing facilities.

5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians <b>rights</b> <b>groups,</b> who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} of civil <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> began a court {{challenge of the}} bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that body upheld the State Supreme Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E
5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> and the ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E
5|$|Dissent within Uganda and Amin's {{attempt to}} annex the Kagera Region of Tanzania in 1978 {{led to the}} Uganda–Tanzania War and the demise of his eight-year regime. Amin then went into exile, first in Libya and then in Saudi Arabia, where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003. Amin's rule was {{characterized}} by rampant human rights abuses, political repression, ethnic persecution, extrajudicial killings, nepotism, corruption, and gross economic mismanagement. The number of people killed {{as a result of}} his regime is estimated by international observers and human <b>rights</b> <b>groups</b> to range from 100,000 to 500,000.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human <b>rights</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
