50|$|Etrumeus is a genus of <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> in the family, Dussumieriidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Round</b> <b>herrings</b> {{are found}} in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, from the Bay of Fundy to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It can be found inshore during the summer in the {{northern}} sections of its occurring range, but in the southern half of its range, it is found farther from the shore at around 50 to 150 m depth.|$|E
50|$|Canned {{sardines}} {{in supermarkets}} {{may actually be}} sprat (such as the “brisling sardine”) or <b>round</b> <b>herrings.</b> Fish sizes vary by species. Good quality sardines should have the head and gills removed before packing. They may also be eviscerated before packing (typically the larger varieties). If not, they should be purged of undigested or partially digested food or feces by holding the live fish in a tank long {{enough for them to}} empty their digestive systems.|$|E

50|$|Madagascar has a rich {{freshwater}} fish fauna {{with a very}} high rate of endemics. The full diversity is unclear, as new species are being described regularly and species may have disappeared before even being discovered; estimates suggest the island has between 135 and 150 native fish species that are restricted to freshwater (this number grows significantly if including widespread euryhaline species). Among these are two families entirely restricted to Madagascar, the anchariid catfish and the Madagascar rainbowfish. Additionally, several genera are endemic to Madagascar, including cichlids (Katria, Oxylapia, Paratilapia, Paretroplus, Ptychochromis and Ptychochromoides), <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (Sauvagella and Spratellomorpha), Old World silverside (Teramulus), sleeper gobies (Ratsirakia and the troglobitic Typhleotris), and aplocheilid killifish (Pachypanchax - strictly speaking near-endemic, {{as there is a}} single species from the Seychelles). There are endemic species from other genera (notably Ambassis, Arius, Eleotris, Glossogobius, Kuhlia, Mesopristes, Ophiocara, Pantanodon and Sicyopterus), but these also have other species found elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Fishes of the {{subfamily}} Dussumieriinae, {{also known}} as <b>round</b> <b>herrings,</b> are a small subgroup of the family Clupeidae inhabiting tropical and subtropical marine coastal waters. A new genus and species of round herring, Trollichthys bol-censis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the lower Eocene micritic limestone of Monte Bolca, northern Italy. This new clupeid taxon is based on seven partially complete articulated skeletons that exhibit a unique combination of features, including: two supramaxillae, edentulous jaw and palate bones, 41 – 42 preural vertebrae and 22 – 24 pleural ribs, pleural ribs-preural vertebrae ratio ranging 0. 52 – 0. 57, five or six supraneural bones, dorsal-fin origin located at about mid-length of the body, dorsal fin with about 16 rays, two postcleithra, pelvic-fin insertion slightly behind the dorsal-fin origin, and pelvic fin with eight rays. Trollichthys bolcensis shares several features with the extant round herring genus Spratelloi-des. However, because of its unique combination of features, Trollichthys bolcensis cannot be confidently assigned {{to any of the}} extant dussumieriine lineages and present evidence does not favour any particular sister-group relationship...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Black Noddy (Anous minutus) and the Brown Noddy (A. stolidus) occur sympatrically in the Southern Lagoon of New Caledonia, {{breeding}} on islets {{located at}} the edge of a wide, productive coral-reef lagoon next to oceanic waters enriched by a seasonal upwelling. The diets of the two species were determined from regurgitations from birds nesting at Kouaré Islet during two consecutive breeding seasons (2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004), and compared. The average prey load in the Brown Noddy was heavier than that of the Black Noddy, as expected from its larger body size and from a predicted longer foraging distance. Fish prey dominated the diet of both species (100 % and 81. 8 % biomass in Black and Brown Noddies, respectively), the remainder consisting of squid. Black Noddy ate small pelagic fishes inhabiting the reef and the lagoon, mainly <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (Spratelloides spp.), while Brown Noddy mainly preyed on offshore species including buccaneer anchovy (Encrasicholina punctifer) and larger pelagic fishes (Exocoetidae), and squid. The segregation in diet between Black and Brown Noddies in New Caledonia thus indicated spatial segregation in foraging zones, i. e. inshore vs. offshore, respectively, which was more pronounced than previously reported for other sites where the two species co-occur...|$|E
40|$|Molecular genetic {{surveys of}} marine fishes have {{revealed}} that some widely distributed species are actually a composite of multiple evolutionary lineages. This is apparent in the <b>round</b> <b>herrings</b> (genus Etrumeus), wherein a globally distributed taxon (Etrumeus sadina Mitchill 1814) has proven to contain at least seven valid taxa, with more likely awaiting discovery. Here, we survey evolutionary lineages of the nominal E. sadina (formerly E. teres, a junior synonym) across the southern temperate zone of Australia, a marine region divided into three biogeographic provinces based primarily {{on the distribution of}} intertidal faunas. Results from morphological and mitochondrial DNA data reveal two evolutionary lineages corresponding to eastern and southwestern provinces (d = 0. 007 for cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and d = 0. 017 for cytochrome b), possibly initiated by the Bassian Isthmus between Australia and Tasmania during low sea-level stands. The Australian round herring is also genetically distinct from the nearest congeneric forms in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a corresponding modal difference in gill-raker counts in most cases. Based on these data, we resurrect the title Etrumeus jacksoniensis for the Australian round herring. While the Bassian Isthmus may have initiated the partition of evolutionary lineages within Australia, additional oceanographic and ecological factors must reinforce this separation in order to maintain diagnostic genetic differences along a continuous temperate coastline. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 122 - 159. Three fish species, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> Etrumeus whiteheadi, co-exist {{over the}} western Agulhas Bank (W AB) in the {{southern}} Benguela upwelling ecosystem. To date, data on high-resolution distributions in ichthyoplankton {{in the region is}} lacking. To address this need, coarse and high-resolution ichthyoplankton data were collected using a California vertical egg tow (CalVET) net and a continuous, underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) for horizontal data, respectively, and plankton pump and a closing WP II net for vertical data. Simultaneous measurements of temperature were recorded during the CalVET net hauls. Eggs from vertically stratified samples were grouped into three categories based on their developmental stage using established protocols. Volumetric estimates of egg density (eggs. m- 3) from on-station CUFES samples were significantly correlated with normalized areal (eggs. m- 2) estimates of egg density from CalVET net samples at these stations for sardine (r 0. 91), <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r= 0. 80) and anchovy (r = 0. 73), demonstrating the validity of the CUFES sampling technique. Underway sample collection reduced the survey coefficient of variation for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs but not for anchovy eggs. Horizontal egg distribution patterns for anchovy showed that high egg densities were centered at two specific regions: midshelf (east of Cape Point) and offshore {{in the southern}} region of the study area, whereas those of sardines and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> were more continuously distributed above and beyond the 200 m isobath. Egg abundances for all species generally increased from inshore towards offshore. The mean egg densities for all three species were found to be spatially associated, whereas the station by station distribution patterns of anchovy eggs were spatially distinct from sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Eggs of all three species were concentrated near the surface (0 - 20 m), although proportions varied among species. All developmental stages of anchovy egg were confined close to the surface indicating that this species spawns near the surface. Sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> vertical egg profiles varied ontogenetically, even though all developmental stages were concentrated near the surface. A significant (> 50 %) proportion of early egg stages were widely distributed between 0 - 60 and 0 - 80 m for sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring,</b> respectively. These results therefore show that the spawning depths of these three c 1 upeiforms overlap to a large extent, but the intensity of spawning varied at depth for each species. In general the vertical thermal structure seemed to affect only how deeply the eggs are distributed rather than the mean egg abundance. The differences in vertical egg profiles among and within (with respect to ontogenetic variation) species were found to be statistically significant (Chi-squared test, P < 0. 05). Investigations of spawning patterns in relation to temperature, longitude and latitude were used to compare the spawning habitats of the three species. Quotient rule analysis was used to distinguish the preferred temperature ranges of all three species. <b>Round</b> <b>herring</b> spawn over a wider temperature range (16. 5 - 18. 1 °C) than anchovy (17. 4 - 17. 8 ° C and sardine (17 - 18. 1 °C). Two spawning peaks were apparent for <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (main peak at 17. 2 °C and secondary peak at 17. 8 °C), whereas only one peak at 18. 0 °C was apparent for anchovy and sardine. Anchovy spawning showed a domed-shape relationship with geographic location and the relationship was viewed to be more informative (r 2 = 0. 13 longitude, ~ = 0. 11 latitude) compared to sardine (r 2 = 0. 08 longitude, r 2 = 0. 07 latitude) and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> (r 2 = 0. 04 longitude, r 2 = 0. 06 latitude). These results indicate that anchovy were more specific in their selection of spawning habitat than sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring.</b> Generally, these results suggest that the overall spawning habitats of anchovy, sardine and <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> on the W AB overlap to a large extent, but their exact locations of the point of spawning are spatially distinct...|$|R

40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of the South African Round Herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) resource, {{commonly referred to as}} Red Eye, has been undertaken. Considering the proportion of females in different reproductive stages, Roel and Melo (1990) report that, although older <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> appear to be reproductively active throughout the year, the smaller, more abundant fish are reproductively active for just a short period in the winter, with a peak in June. Their histological analysis indicated peak spawning in May, July, August and November, with no data available for April, June, September or October. The abundance of <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> eggs and larvae per station from the CELP program (August 1977 - August 1978) indicates a very low level of spawning between January and April, with a peak in egg numbers in August and a peak in larvae in October (van der Westhuizen pers. comm.). Taking this into consideration, together with the timing of the recruit survey, the <b>round</b> <b>herring</b> will be modelled to have an annual birth date of 1 June.
