5|$|The {{telescope}} {{took part}} in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. It was first used as an interferometer with the Arecibo <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> in 1969.|$|E
5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a ground-based telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
50|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation was also first detected using <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes.</b> However, <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> have also been used to investigate objects much closer to home, including observations of the Sun and solar activity, and radar mapping of the planets.|$|R

It works together with <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> in other continents {{as well as the}} orbiting <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> HALCA (VSOP project) and Spektr-R (RadioAstron) in order to perform Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations.|$|R
40|$|National audienceRadio {{astronomy}} is {{a passive}} service and is equipped to observe extremely weak signals from outer space. The sensitivity of current state-of-the-art telescopes is over ten {{orders of magnitude}} higher than in most communications systems. Although <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> are best located in relatively remote areas, astronomical observations may be still hampered by man-made radio frequency interference (RFI). In this paper we will consider different interference mitigation options. After a quick overview of techniques already implemented in current <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes,</b> we {{will focus on the}} innovative possibilities induced by the new generation of <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes.</b> In particular, phased array architecture can lead to interesting spatial filtering approaches. Examples on real data from LOFAR and from Nançay <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> will be shown...|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, Jodrell Bank {{was named}} as the {{location}} of the control centre for the planned Square Kilometre Array, or SKA Project Office (SPO). The SKA is being planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed it is intended to be the most powerful <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> ever built. In April 2015 it was further announced that Jodrell Bank would be the permanent home of the SKA headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope (over 50 years).|$|E
5|$|As {{he tries}} to {{investigate}} further, Quatermass finds that other figures in high levels of government have gained 'the mark' after coming across meteorites. Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims {{there is no problem}} with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who has the authority to inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> that could only point {{directly}} upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
50|$|Very-long-baseline {{interferometry}} (VLBI) {{is a type}} {{of astronomical}} interferometry used in radio astronomy. In VLBI a signal from an astronomical radio source, such as a quasar, is collected at multiple <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> on Earth. The distance between the <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> is then calculated using the time difference between the arrivals of the radio signal at different telescopes. This allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many <b>radio</b> <b>telescopes</b> to be combined, emulating a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes.|$|R

5|$|Early <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> interferometers used {{a single}} {{baseline}} for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Ground-based radio {{images taken}} using the VLA {{revealed}} seven radio {{sources in the}} HDF, all of which correspond to galaxies visible in the optical images. The field has also been surveyed with the Westerbork Synthesis <b>Radio</b> <b>Telescope</b> and the MERLIN array of radio telescopes at 1.4GHz; the combination of VLA and MERLIN maps made at wavelengths of 3.5 and 20cm have located 16 radio sources in the HDF-N field, with many more in the flanking fields. Radio images of some individual sources in the field have been made with the European VLBI Network at 1.6GHz with a higher resolution than the Hubble maps.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the <b>radio</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office space {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and office space. The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color. Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> laboratory. The observatory basement and the dome housing the refractor are still in use by the astronomy department at U of I and the University of Illinois Astronomical Society, a student organization on campus.|$|E
5|$|Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, {{their light}} {{aircraft}} is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground {{search of the}} area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control centre to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. He then follows the fleeing Trevelyan {{through a series of}} flooded caverns, eventually arriving at the antenna of the control centre's <b>radio</b> <b>telescope.</b> Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye, but Bond ultimately destroys machinery vital to controlling the antenna and defeats Trevelyan in a gunfight on a platform above the dish.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing {{a man on the}} Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes <b>radio</b> <b>telescope</b> in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
