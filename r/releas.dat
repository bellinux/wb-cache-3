40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to present an {{analysis}} of articles published by the Latin American Journal of Astronomy Education (<b>RELEA)</b> since its beginning (2004) to the present. We analyzed the 59 articles available on the website of the journal ([URL] published in 15 issues. The articles were classified by: year of publication, issue, author’s institutions, grade level, focus {{of the study and}} content. The results show that the number of articles is still small - although the journal has been initially qualified as B 3 within the Journal Ranking scheme Qualis CAPES and in the latest ranking (current) advanced to the concept B 1 in the Qualis, {{it is too early to}} expect an increase in the number of articles submitted. Among the main factors for the relatively low number of articles we can mention that the initially nominated Editorial Board did not succeed in a proper dissemination of the journal and call for papers, the ongoing absence of a “critical mass” of astronomy education researchers and the lack of publishing tradition in the area. Important aspects of the writing of articles submitted are also discussed, such as refereeing, acceptance rate of articles, participation of authors from countries other than Brazil and theoretical and methodological frameworks, as well as the recent editorial restructuration of the international Editorial Board of the <b>RELEA</b> and the nomination of Associate Editors from Brazil. Concluding, it is possible to note the contribution to the field up to the moment through citations in other works in the field. However, it is necessary to advance with regard to: publishing more articles, articles from greater variety of Latin American countries, training of the community for a minimum quality of the writing of articles submitted for publication in a journal aimed at education research. In this sense, additional analyses of the published papers would be desirable. Finally, it is pointed out the need for greater dissemination of the journal to increase the number of submissions, encouraging the diversification of contents and methods and increase the participation of authors in general and from Latin America in particular, aiming to greater academic contribution for astronomy education at various levels and places.

40|$|Sediments in the {{foreland}} of {{a mountain}} chain are sometimes suited to reconstitute the conditions in these mountains {{at the time of}} deposition of the sediments. The present study gives the results of a sedimentological investigation of the Tertiary and Quaternary deposits {{in a part of the}} Duero basin, situated south of the Cordillera Cantabrica, which supplied the sediments. The aim was to determine both the conditions in the source area, and the environments in the area of deposition. The investigated area is situated in the province of Palencia, between the rivers Pisuerga and Carrión. The area being a part of the so-called Meseta, has a simple relief. Two levels at different heights can be distinguished. The higher level, páramo, is strikingly flat, the lower, campiña, is more undulating. The Tertiary basin sediments are of various types, and can have six different facies. Along the mountain foot the sediments are chiefly conglomerates with some sandstones, united into the Cuevas facies. The pebbles consist of limestones derived from the Cretaceous limestones, which in the E occupy extensive areas but in the W are only exposed in a narrow strip along the southern border of the mountain chain. At that time they must have formed the southern flank of the Cantabrian Mountains. Pebble roundness and flatness indicate for the greater part a deposition as river fans in a warm and rather dry climate. These conglomerates have been brought into an overturned position in the W of the investigated area, and were strongly tilted in the E. This tectonic deformation is thought by several authors to have occurred during the Savian orogenic phase. The younger beds, having the Cuevas facies, are nearly horizontal, and were deposited during and after this folding as appears from the presence of sandstone pebbles derived from the sandstone layers within the folded conglomerates. South of the limestone conglomerate belt a wide zone with red beds occurs. These sediments, consisting of an alternation of quartzite conglomerates and sandy layers, represent the Vega de Riacos facies. The change of deposit from a limestone conglomerate into a quartzite conglomerate may be due to changes in the supply area, the Mesozoic limestones having been eroded and having become covered with soils, and the Palaeozoic quartzites and conglomerates becoming largely exposed. A typical feature is the absence in all basin sediments of pebbles derived from the Carboniferous limestone, the so-called Brezo-limestone, which at present froms a great part of the southern flank of the Cantabrian Mountains. The sediments presenting the Vega de Riacos facies were deposited in a warm and humid monsoon climate, as appears from (1) the red colour, (2) the shape of the quartz sand grains, and (3) the clay mineral associations. The remainder of the investigated area is characterized in the N by yellow sandy and clayey deposits, covered by similar, but yellow and red, sandy and clayey deposits, and in the S by yellow clayey deposits overlain by white and grey gypseous marls, alternating with limestones. The underling yellow sandy and clayey sediments, typical for the Carrión de los Condes facies, are dated as Vindobonian on account of the fossils found near Palencia and Saldaña. The upper yellow and red, sandy and clayey layers found in the N, having the <b>Relea</b> facies, have a Pontian age, based on fossils found near Saldaña and <b>Relea.</b> In the E of the investigated area this <b>Relea</b> facies shows a local divergent aspect, called Zorita facies, characterized by an alternation of red, sandy deposits and white, marly deposits. The gypseous marls and the limestones in the S, which show the Páramos facies, overlying the yellow clayey sediments in Carrion de los Condes facies, have a cover of a very hard, bluish limestone, the Páramos-limestone, which provided some freshwater molluscs indicating also a Pontian age. The sediments in the four last-named facies represent chiefly deposits of rivers and shallow temporary lakes (lagunas). A rather regular sedimentation went on from Vindobonian into Pontian times, meanwhile influenced by changes of climate in the basin. After the warm and humid climate in which the red beds were deposited, the climate became more arid, with an increased evaporation. First the yellow sediments in Carrión de los Condes facies were deposited, in the N being still sandy, in the S becoming more clayey. They are clearly deposits of rivers which did not supply very coarse material, but some deposition in temporary lakes must also have occurred. At the end of the Vindobonian evaporation became stronger, as can be concluded from the lime crusts found in the upper layers in the area of the Carrión de los Condes facies, and more to the S, in the area of the Páramos facies, from the deposition of gypsum bearing marls, when the drainage was more or less restricted. This climate persisted during the first part of the Pontian as can be concluded from lime crusts occurring in the lower beds in <b>Relea</b> facies, the depositional environment, that is rivers and lagunas, remaining the same. Later in the Pontian the humidity of the climate increased, as appears from the increasing number of red layers in this <b>Relea</b> facies. In the S this increasing humidity caused the precipitation of gypsum to cease, and at this time the Páramos-limestones were formed. The Zorita facies, which laterally replaces the <b>Relea</b> facies, is chiefly determined by a supply from a different source area, namely the Mesozoic calcareous rocks exposed a few kilometres N of the deposits in Zorita facies. The heavy mineral associations (chapter VIII, part 1) are monotonous, practically consisting of resistant minerals. They seem to indicate a supply from NW to SE. Also the pebble supply followed this direction, as may be concluded from their size distribution within the red beds having the Vega de Riacos facies. This NW—SE direction was the main drainage direction in Pre-Rhodanian times. The clay minerals in the sediments presenting the various facies allow to draw some conclusions on the climates at the times of deposition. For instance, the rather righ percentage of kaolinite in the sediments in the Cuevas and Vega de Riacos facies, may indicate a warm and rather humid climate during and after deposition. But later alterations also influenced the clay mineral associations, causing a preponderance of illite (see chapter VIII, part 3). After the deposition of the Páramos-limestones the Duero basin became a non-depositional area. During the Rhodanian orogenic phase the bordering mountains were uplifted, and the basin was tilted towards the W. This caused a switch of the drainage pattern which before was directed towards the Mediterranean, and now became directed towards the Atlantic Ocean. During the whole of the Pliocene strong bevelling occurred, through which the páramolevel in the basin and pediments at the foot of the mountain chains were formed. Next, a warm and dry climate characterized by sheetfloods must have prevailed all over the Meseta, causing the deposition of the angular quartzitic raña pebbles, so well exposed in the investigated area on the raña of Guardo. These rañas are presumed to be of Villafranchian age. Soon the influence of Quaternary changes of climate became evident. Certainly the younger river terraces, found at five various levels, are due to these Pleistocene climatic changes. Pebble analyses could confirm the opinion of various authors who admit only two real glaciations in the Spanish mountains, namely the last and the penultimate. Indeed, the two lower terraces contain pebbles which may have been formed in a periglacial climate, whereas the deposits of the three upper terraces only contain evidences of a humid, temperate climate. The sedimentological data on which the conclusions on the depositional environments, as given above, are based can be found in the following chapters: (a) grain size distribution (chapter V), (b) pebble analyses (chapter VI), (c) morphometrical sand analysis (chapter VII), (d) mineralogy of the sands (chapter VIII, parts 1 and 2), (c) clay minerals (chapter VIII, part 3). The development of the drainage pattern (see chapter IX) was reconstituted with the help of a number of captures, which can be observed in the field. In this way a gradual adjustment of the drainage to the present direction can be demonstrated. In the investigated area this adjustment occurred rather late during the Quaternary. At that time also the campiña-level was formed. Finally, in the last chapter (X), an attempt is made to establish the palaeoclimates, and the relief in the source area, though there remain many uncertainties. The Cordillera Cantabrica, being a mountain area, must always have had a more humid climate than the basin. Even during the Upper-Vindobonian and Lower-Pontian, while the basin was arid, the climate in the mountains must have been more humid. This appears from the clastic sediments supplied into the basin (<b>Relea</b> facies). Though the drainage was restricted, it will not have been totally interrupted, because only calcite and gypsum were deposited in the basin centre, and no halite. There will have been a certain relief in the source area during the whole time. The sediments give no indications for a fully developed peneplain. During the whole of Vindobonian and Pontian times clastic sediments have been supplied by the Cantabrian Mountains...|$|R

40|$|Maximum 200 words) Modern {{offensive}} weapon {{technologies such as}} stealth and precision guided munitions have rendered Integrated Air Defense Systems increasingly vulnerable and ineffective. Stealth effectively reduces the performance of radar, but {{does not have the}} same impact on passive systems. Sensors have been the most important and vulnerable part of air defense systems throughout the history of air warfare. Research into passive sensors has been encouraging, but before passive sensor systems are produced, procured and deployed, analysis and planning must be conducted to quantify potential benefit and determine feasible system configurations. As this type of analysis encompasses extremely complex system behavior, developing reusable and flexible simulation models becomes important. This thesis develops a prototype software component architecture and component library for building simulation models for air defense analysis. Sensor and airborne weapon simulation components are demonstrated and used in an exploratory analysis of the impact of a network of Infrared Search and Track sensors. The analysis is based on a modern air defense system deployed in a realistic scenario. The component architecture and documentation methodology supports reuse, and provides model configuration flexibility with potential for growth in successive stages of analysis. 14.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper an attempt is made to approachthe problem of the upper mantle {{structure}} by studying the strain <b>relea.</b> sevariation with depth. If the method and data used in this paper are adequate,we may be allowed to say that {{although there is no}} strain releaseevidence for the depth of the upper boundary of the asthenospliere zone onaccount of lack of adequate accuracy in the determination of focal depths,nevertheless there is ample indication of a discontinuity at about 125 kmdepth. The abrupt change in the rate of decrease in the strain releasewith depth near this level clearly indicates that a sudden decrease in theyield strength of the material in the earth should occur at about this depth. I t might even be possible to think that the melting point of some kind ofcrystal grains or rocks in the earth is attained at that depth. However,this does not involve a completely molten state. This state should ratheroccur at depths where there is a complete lack of strain release. Regionallythis state is attained at different depths, but in some regions the partiallymolten state, i. e. the heterogeneity of the mantle, probably recurs or increasesdue to the pressure increase or some other reason and reaches a minormaximum beyond which {{it might be possible to}} speculate that the heterogeneityof the mantle falls off rapidly and a continuous layer of materialin molten state covers the whole earth. If data from other sources willconfirm this structure, there will be good reasons to think of redefiningthe upper boundaries of surface and intermediate shocks at depths of 125 and 425 km or thereabouts, respectively...|$|R
