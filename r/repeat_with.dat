5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman convinced she is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E

Successive inferior conjunctions of Venus <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> an orbital resonance of approximately 13:8—that is, Venus orbits the Sun approximately 13 times for every eight orbits of Earth—shifting 144° at each inferior conjunction. The tips of the five loops {{at the center of}} the figure have the same geometric relationship to one another as the five vertices, or points, of a pentagram. Groups of five intersections of curves, equidistant from the figure's center, have the same geometric relationship.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolis–Hastings {{algorithm}} {{is the most}} commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations. The algorithm first chooses selection probabilities g(μ, ν), which represent the probability that state ν is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state μ. It then uses acceptance probabilities A(μ, ν) so that detailed balance is satisfied. If the new state ν is accepted, then we move to that state and <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If ν is not accepted then we stay in μ. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes ferromagnetic, meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.|$|E

25|$|Most large studies {{recommend}} a protocol {{for the use}} of misoprostol in combination with mifepristone. Together they are effective in around 95% for early pregnancies. Misoprostol alone may be more effective in earlier gestation. WHO guidelines recommend for pregnancies up to 12 weeks to use 12 tablets of 200 mcg (micrograms).The woman should put 4 tablets of misoprostol under the tongue or far up the vagina and let them dissolve for 30 minutes.She should wait 3 hours and <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> 4 pills under the tongue or in the vagina for 30 minutes.She should wait 3 hours and repeat once more. It works in 90% after first attempt and, in case of failure, the attempt may be repeated after a minimum of 3 days.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{at first}} {{compared}} Stelmach to Harry Strom, the last Social Credit premier of the province. [...] Strom {{was regarded as}} honest but ineffective and lacking charisma; he survived only long enough as Premier to lose the 1971 election soundly. Thus ended the last long one-party rule, and observers asked if history would <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> Stelmach. After Stelmach's landslide win in the 2008 election, however, the comparisons largely ceased.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centuries}} since Le Gris' death {{the case has}} become an {{important}} cultural legend in France. The duel was the last trial by combat ever permitted by the Parlement de Paris or the French Kings and the guilt or innocence of its participants {{has been a source}} of great debate among historians and jurists. The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart harbours no question over the guilt of Le Gris, whom he considers a villain. Later writers take a different view, including the Grandes Chroniques de France and the works of Jehan de Waurin, who <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> varying details the tale of another culprit admitting his guilt on his deathbed. [...] Other famous writers who studied the case include Diderot in his Encyclopédie and Voltaire in his Histoire du Parlement de Paris. An imaginative version of the legend was repeated by the Encyclopædia Britannica until the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} is {{heavily influenced by}} van der Weyden and contains elements characteristic of his later work; it is perhaps {{the first of his}} enthroned Virgins – with angels playing musical instruments or hovering holding her crown. Mary sits in an open hall with columns leading to architectural features similar to those in the St John Altarpiece. The blend of colors, her red dress, the blue angels, and in this triptych, a dark-green silk carpet-type floor-covering, are found, repeatedly, in his later paintings. According to Blum; [...] "We have encountered triptychs that served more than one purpose before … but we have never … seen altarpieces that <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> very few changes the basic iconography of another work." ...|$|E
2500|$|The complex plainchant {{setting in}} the Roman Gradual {{requires}} {{a high degree of}} skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries. This melismatic Gregorian chant opens with the cantor singing [...] "Alleluia". The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long melisma called a jubilus. (The Liber Usualis notates the <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> the Roman numeral [...] "ij" [...] (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings {{the main part of the}} verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an ambitus of only a perfect fifth, a rather extreme example.|$|E

Both PSOE and Podemos called for each other to yield to the other's demands to avoid triggering a fresh election. On 21 April, C's leader Albert Rivera called for PP and PSOE leaders {{to step back and}} support an independent candidate as Prime Minister. Rajoy replied by suggesting Rivera to [...] "do it first himself"—in reference to him stepping back—while also announcing he would note the King on his own lack of support to be elected while censoring Sánchez for rejecting his offer for a grand coalition. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos was recorded on 22 April saying to Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem that a new election was all but certain, with the PP hoping that, even if a similar result to December was obtained, [...] "common sense would prevail" [...] and the PSOE would reluctantly agree to an alliance with them. On 24 April, Rajoy remarked that his party was [...] "ready" [...] for a new electoral campaign and blamed both PSOE and C's for an election <b>repeat,</b> <b>with</b> both [...] "having made [...] impossible".|$|E

2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when you want something to be understood, you say it at least twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (3) In machine {{engraving}} {{the pattern}} is impressed in the roller by a small cylindrical mill on which {{the pattern is}} in relief. It is an indirect process and requires the utmost care at every stage. The pattern or design is first altered in size to repeat evenly round the roller. One repeat of this pattern is then engraved by hand on a small highly polished soft steel roller, usually about 3 in. long and 1/2 in. to 3 in. in diameter; the size varies according {{to the size of}} the <b>repeat</b> <b>with</b> which it must be identical. It is then repolished, painted with a chalky mixture to prevent its surface oxidizing and exposed to a red-heat in a box filled with chalk and charcoal; then it is plunged in cold water to harden it and finally tempered to the proper degree of toughness. In this state it forms the die from which the mill is made. To produce the actual mill with the design in relief a softened steel cylinder is screwed tightly against the hardened die and the two are rotated under constantly increasing pressure until the softened cylinder or mill has received an exact replica in relief of the engraved pattern. The mill in turn is then hardened and tempered, when it is ready for use. In size it may be either exactly like the die or its circumferential measurement may be any multiple of that of the latter according to circumstances.|$|E
