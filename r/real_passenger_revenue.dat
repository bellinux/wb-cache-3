50|$|In many ways, 1982 {{represented}} the nadir of Britain's railways. That year saw the lowest number of passenger journeys {{of the second}} half of the 20th century, the lowest level of passenger-miles, and the lowest (<b>real)</b> level of <b>passenger</b> <b>revenue</b> since 1968. Although these figures were partly the result of the 1982 strike (over rostering arrangements), rail passenger numbers had been in steady decline since 1957. (Only 1978-1980 saw consecutive years of passenger growth). In 1982 terms, revenues had decreased steadily from £2,300 million in 1970 to £1,800 million in 1982, while costs had risen from £2,500 million to £2,700 million. Consequently, BR's deficit had increased by a factor of 4.5.|$|R

50|$|Measure {{of average}} fare paid per mile, per passenger, {{calculated}} by dividing <b>passenger</b> <b>revenue</b> by <b>revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> miles. Typically {{the measure is}} presented in cents per mile and is useful measure in assessing changes in fares over time. Yield is not useful for comparisons across markets and/or airlines, as it varies dramatically by stage length and does not incorporate load factor (unlike PRASM).|$|R

40|$|Transit {{properties}} increasingly provide multiple {{modes of}} transit service, creating {{a need for}} intermodal transit performance indicators. Transit performance indicators currently in use {{do not have the}} capability of comparing the performance of different modes. In addition, most indicators in current use incorporate only operating costs, while for many transit modes capital costs constitute a significant proportion of total costs. The research conducted reviewed the use of performance indicators by urban transit properties in California, and found that the most common measures in use are operating cost per revenue vehicle hour, operating cost per <b>passenger</b> boarding, farebox <b>revenue</b> per operating cost, <b>passenger</b> boardings per <b>revenue</b> vehicle mile, and <b>passenger</b> boardings per <b>revenue</b> vehicle hour. Three critical limitations to commonly used performance indicators are identified, and new intermodal performance indicators are proposed which overcome the limitations of current single mode indicators by incorporating mechanisms for comparisons of one mode to another, for rating the performance of systems which include multiple nodes, and by incorporating both capital and operating costs. The proposed comprehensive transit performance indicators are total cost per revenue capacity kilometer, total cost per revenue capacity hour, total cost per <b>passenger</b> kilometer, <b>passenger</b> <b>revenue</b> per total cost, <b>passenger</b> kilometers per <b>revenue</b> capacity kilometer, and <b>passenger</b> kilometer per <b>revenue</b> capacity hour...|$|R
