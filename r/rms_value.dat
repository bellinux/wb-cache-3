PPO specific activity {{showed a significant}} decrease in treatments (nematode + fungi) as compared with control plants. Results showed that nematode is able to change or suppress induction of this enzyme in spite of fungal induction. Nematode in all biological stages suppressed the induction of PPO activity in tomato roots but in young adult formation stage the suppression was higher than other life stages including giant cell formation, egg-laying and penetration. Native polyacrylamide gel revealed the presence of five isozymes of PPO with <b>Rm</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 26, 0. 31, 0. 44, 0. 50 and 0. 63.

Based on the results obtained in this study, nematode infection resulted in suppression of tomato defenses against the fungi (as secondary pathogen) and intensified the fungal disease. Five PPO isoforms with <b>Rm</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 26, 0. 31, 0. 44, 0. 50 and 0. 63 were shown in native polyacrylamide gel among which the isoform with <b>Rm</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 31 had a thicker band in tomato plants inoculated with nematode or fungus alone.

Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (<b>RMS)</b> <b>value</b> for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true <b>RMS</b> <b>value</b> of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid.

The research was aimed to determine retention modified (<b>Rm)</b> <b>value</b> of barbituric acid compound derivatives using RPTLC metod and mobile phase optimizing.
