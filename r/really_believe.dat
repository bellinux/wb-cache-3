25|$|If you {{are doing}} a really convincing job, then {{you should be able}} to put a bent key on the table and comment, ‘Look, it is still bending’, and have your spectators <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that it is. This may sound the height of boldness; however, the effect is astounding – and {{combined}} with suggestion, it does work.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, {{it could be}} argued, the false masks are torn off, and people {{have to stand up}} for what they really are, and what they <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E

500|$|In his 1988 memoirs, Regan {{wrote about}} Reagan's {{consultations}} with the astrologer, {{the first public}} mention of them, which resulted in embarrassment for the First Lady. Reagan later wrote, [...] "Astrology was simply {{one of the ways}} I coped with the fear I felt after my husband almost died... Was astrology one of the reasons ? I don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it was, but I don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it wasn't." ...|$|E

But his audition, and then his chemistry with Hadas were just perfect".|$|E

500|$|The {{magazine}} Cycling Weekly {{commented on}} the race by criticising the route as [...] "more attritional [...] than it is tactical", citing the lack of attacks and the teams' reluctance to send riders into break-aways. Reporter Stephen Puddicombe also criticised Niki Terpstra for not attacking Kristoff before the finish, writing: [...] "Did Terpstra <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> he had any hope of winning the two-man sprint {{against one of the}} quickest finishers in the world?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gay {{attended}} the St. John Missionary Baptist Church as a child, {{and when he}} returns home he still attends the church services.

I really do believe I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E
500|$|There's no {{chemistry}} between Astrid and the Doctor, she delivers her {{lines with}} a real lack of conviction and thus we never <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tate's Donna in last year's special was overbearing, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is hardly there at all. It does make you wonder why casting Kylie {{was regarded as a}} coup. She's a pop star– of course she's going to say yes to being beamed into millions of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She's got a duff album to sell. In truth, Kylie should be grateful to [...]|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Ten started as {{instrumental}} compositions that Vedder added lyrics to after he joined the band. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "All I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in is this fucking moment, like right now. And that, actually, is what the whole album talks about." [...] Vedder's lyrics for Ten deal with subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. The album also tackles social concerns such as homelessness ("Even Flow") {{and the use of}} psychiatric hospitals ("Why Go"). The song [...] "Jeremy" [...] and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.|$|E
500|$|ABT dancer Sarah Lane {{served as}} a [...] "dance double" [...] for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, {{editor-in-chief}} Wendy Perron asked: [...] "Do people <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that {{many people believe that}} Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan." [...] This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman as well as a response from Lane on the subject.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was {{inspired}} by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman the Potters employed {{over the course of}} eleven summers at Dalguise House on the River Tay in Perthshire, writes Leslie Linder. Potter was 26 when, in 1892, she visited MacDonald while staying at Heath Park, Birnam. She wrote in her journal: [...] "Went out with the pony... to see Kitty MacDonald, our old washerwoman... Kitty is eighty-three but waken, and delightfully merry... She is a comical, round little woman, as brown as a berry and wears a multitude of petticoats and a white mutch. Her memory goes back for seventy years, and I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> she is prepared to enumerate the articles of her first wash in the year '71".|$|E

500|$|With the {{ice hockey}} team in mind, there was {{debate about the}} {{trade-off}} between selection standards and participation after the 1960 Winter Olympics. At a 1963 meeting, Kenneth Kennedy complained that the ice hockey team was not given overseas trips to compete {{because they were not}} world class, but could never become competitive unless they had experience in international matches. Edgar Tanner said [...] "I ask the winter sports whether they <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> they are in world class, or world ranking, in the field of sport and whether they can do Australia credit, or just be there." [...] Bill Young, of cycling, disagreed, saying [...] "I thought the first spirit of the Games was to compete", but was overruled by Tanner.|$|E
500|$|The Pawnee {{residents}} vocally {{opposed to}} Leslie's park proposal {{were based on}} real-life California residents the show's producers encountered who fought the construction of parks in their hometowns. One such group, the Committee for a Better Park, was actually opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the producers' writing for those characters. The Parks and Recreation staff worked {{with a number of}} consultants familiar with local government work, including Scott Albright, a California city planner who provided feedback for the Mark Brendanawicz character. Inspiration for Ron Swanson came from an encounter Schur had in Burbank with an elected official, a Libertarian who favored minimal government and admitted, [...] "I don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in the mission of my job." ...|$|E

500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp {{felt that}} [...] "for an album [...] {{inspired}} by performance art, {{it was the}} one moment where music and shock value merged indelibly and credibly." [...] The performance also received criticism for the vomiting act. Recovered bulimic Demi Lovato complained that the show [...] "glamorized" [...] eating disorders. In response to the controversy, Brown told MTV News, [...] "I can understand why people would make that association, but my performance is really not a statement about eating disorders themselves." [...] Gaga confessed on Today, [...] "Millie and I know that not everybody's going to love that performance, but we both <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in artistic expression and strong identities, and I support her and what she does. Artpop, my new album, is about bringing art and music together in the spirit of creative rebellion, and for us, that performance was art in its purest form." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were [...] "really excited to write some new music.

[...] He added, [...] "The first album with Rick {{was also the first}} album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last recordit's my heroit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that. So I'm super-excited." [...] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.
