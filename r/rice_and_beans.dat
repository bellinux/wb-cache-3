40|$|The 30 Si silicon isotope stable {{was used}} for {{assessing}} the accumulation and translocation of Si in <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> plants grown in labeled nutritive solution. The isotopic silicon composition in plant materials was determined by mass spectrometry (IRMS) using the method based on SiF 4 formation. Considering the total-Si added into nutritive solutions, the quantity absorbed by plants was near to 51 % for <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> 15 % for bean plants. The accumulated amounts of Si per plant were about 150 g in <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> 8. 6 g in bean. Approximately 70 % of the total-Si accumulated was found in leaves. At presented experimental conditions, the results confirmed that once Si is accumulated in the old parts of <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> <b>bean</b> plant tissues it is not redistributed to new parts, even when Si is not supplied to plants from nutritive solution.
