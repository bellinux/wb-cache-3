40|$|Today’s {{production}} processes {{are more and}} more optimized to be competitive. The production demands are increased for speed and quality. These increased demands do not pass the roll shops in the steel industry. In the roll shop periodically the rolls from the rolling mill are checked for imperfections. The imperfections are detected by special <b>inspection</b> <b>systems.</b> Improving the <b>inspection</b> <b>systems</b> can speed up the overall process significantly in the roll shop. The request for an improved <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> results in a new generation <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> should measure more signals {{at the same time and}} process the signals faster. To achieve this result the measurements are digitalized and processed in parallel on a FPGA.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an alternative}} approach to the camber angle measurement for vehicle wheel alignment. Instead of current commercial approaches that apply computation vision techniques, this study aims at realizing a micro-control-unit (MCU) -based camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> with a 3 -axis accelerometer. We analyze the precision of the <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> for the axis misalignments of the accelerometer. The {{results show that the}} axes of the accelerometer can be aligned to the axes of the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> imperfectly. The calibrations that can amend these axis misalignments between the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and the accelerometer are also originally proposed since misalignments will usually happen in fabrications of the <b>inspection</b> <b>systems.</b> During camber angle measurements, the x-axis or z-axis of the camber <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and the wheel need not be perfectly aligned in the proposed approach. We accomplished two typical authentic camber angle measurements. The results show that the proposed approach is applicable with a precision of ± 0. 015 ∘ and therefore facilitates the camber measurement process without downgrading the precision by employing an appropriate 3 -axis accelerometer. In addition, the measured results of camber angles can be transmitted via the medium such as RS 232, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi...|$|R
