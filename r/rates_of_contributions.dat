50|$|National health {{insurance}} (NHI) - sometimes called statutory {{health insurance}} (SHI) - is a legally enforced scheme {{of health insurance}} that insures a national population against the costs of health care. It may be administered by the public sector, the private sector, {{or a combination of}} both. Funding mechanisms vary with the particular program and country. National or Statutory health insurance does not equate to government-run or government-financed health care, but is usually established by national legislation. In some countries, such as Australia's Medicare system or the UK's National Health Service, contributions to the system are made via general taxation and therefore are not optional even though use of the health scheme it finances is. In practice, of course, most people paying for NHI will join the insurance scheme. Where the NHI scheme involves a choice of multiple insurance funds, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> may vary and the person has to choose which insurance fund to belong to.|$|E
5000|$|Individually {{purchased}} {{private insurance}} generally must be fully funded. Full funding is a desirable goal for private pension plans as well, but {{is often not}} achieved. Social insurance programs are often not fully funded, and some argue that full funding is not economically desirable. Most international systems of social insurance are funded {{on an ongoing basis}} without reference to future liabilities. That is seen as a matter of solidarity between generations and between the sick and the healthy {{as a part of the}} social contract. The current generation of healthy working people pay something now to meet the health care and living costs of those who are currently temporarily incapacitated through sickness or who have ceased work through old age or disability. The main exception is in the United States, where the two largest programs, Medicare and Social Security programs, the administrators have historically collected more in social premiums than they have paid out as social benefits. The difference is retained in a trust fund. In both programs, US government actuaries periodically attempt to predict up to 70 years in advance the longevity of the fund and must estimate the future <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> and pensions, the types of health care needs of the beneficiaries, and what that might cost. No other country in the world does so. Despite the US programs being in considerable surplus, the political argument is often that these programs are [...] "going bankrupt" [...] or that politicians have spent the money on other things.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the evasion of retirement insurance contributions in Croatia. This problem can be connected to the weakness of the administration and the inefficacy of the competent bodies, to high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> and a general lack of trust in the public pension system based on intergenerational solidarity. One of the most important determinants of evasion is the benefit deriving from the insurance, that is, the relation between the contributions and the pension. Insured persons who have worked their whole lives and have reached old-age pensions have an unfavourable ratio of contributions paid in and amount of pension received, because funds for pensions have been redistributed to several other categories. After a brief explanation of the pension reform, we draw attention to certain legislative inconsistencies connected with retirement insurance.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{apparent}} that many policies that we recommend at the Bank for technical economic reasons {{have not been}} implemented for political reasons. This discrepancy between economics and politics has led the Bank, and the academic community, to begin thinking about {{the political economy of}} reform. Considerable work has already been done on the political economy of macro-economic reform and trade policy, emphasizing factors such as incomplete information, time inconsistency of preferences, credibility problems, path dependency and interest groups as major obstacles to reform. 1 Less work has been done by economists on the political economy of sectoral reform. 2 This study tackles that question, using pension reform as a case in question. Public pension schemes are the largest fiscal program in many countries, and in most countries these schemes are in serious trouble. Declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy has exerted economic pressures on traditional pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems, making them nonsustainable in their present forms. Thus far, some countries have made only minor alterations in the parameters (<b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions,</b> benefit calculations, retirement age) of their existing systems.

The answer is yes and the intuition of the result is as follows : according to portfolio theory, agents should hold two risky assets : (i) savings, the return on which is, in our model, the return on physical capital and (ii) "contributions" which give rights to benefits.
