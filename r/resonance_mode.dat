Therefore, the eigenmode expansion of the electric field is done not in plane waves but in the eigenmodes of the resonator which may be calculated, e.g., via the transfer-matrix method in planar geometries; more complicated geometries often require the use of full Maxwell-equations solvers (finite-difference time-domain method). In the laser diode rate equations, the photon life time [...] enters instead of the resonator eigenmodes. In this approximative approach, [...] may be calculated from the <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> and is roughly proportional to the strength of the mode within the cavity. Fully microscopic modeling of laser emission can be performed with the semiconductor luminescence equations where the light modes enter as an input.

Such investigations can be extended to studying new intriguing effects emerging in semiconductor quantum optics.|$|E

40|$|We analyze {{whether and}} how the neutron <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> in {{unconventional}} superconductors is affected by higher order corrections in the coupling between spin excitations and fermionic quasiparticles and find that in general such corrections cannot be ignored. In particular, we find that in two spatial dimensions (d= 2) the corrections are of same order as the leading, weak coupling contributions demonstrating that the neutron <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> in unconventional superconductors is a strong coupling phenomenon. The origin of this behavior lies in the quantum-critical nature of the low energy spin dynamics in the superconducting state and the feedback of the <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> onto the fermionic excitations. While quantum critical fluctuations occur in any dimensionality smaller than the upper critical dimension d_uc= 3, they can be analyzed in a controlled fashion {{by means of the}} ϵ-expansion (ϵ = 3 -d), such that the leading corrections to the <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> position are small. Regardless of the strong coupling nature of the <b>resonance</b> <b>mode</b> we show that it emerges only if the phase of the superconducting gap function varies on the Fermi surface, making it a powerful tool to investigate the microscopic structure of the pair condensate.
