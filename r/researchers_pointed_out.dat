25|$|Number of protein-coding genes. About 20,000 human {{proteins}} {{have been}} annotated in databases such as Uniprot. Historically, {{estimates for the}} number of protein genes have varied widely, ranging up to 2,000,000 in the late 1960s, but several <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in the early 1970s that the estimated mutational load from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit of approximately 40,000 for the total number of functional loci (this includes protein-coding and functional non-coding genes).|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Herbert Spencer {{said that}} women were {{incapable}} of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and had only the ability to understand issues of care. In 1925, Sigmund Freud also stated {{that women were}} less morally developed {{in the concept of}} justice and, unlike men, were more influenced by feeling than rational thought. Early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because they have smaller and lighter brains. Many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable, emotional, sensitive, and therefore not suited for political participation. As later <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> however, these studies did not control for differences in body size or age.|$|E
25|$|For decades, practitioners' {{handbooks}} and textbooks on IQ testing {{have reported}} IQ declines with age after {{the beginning of}} adulthood. However, later <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> this phenomenon {{is related to the}} Flynn effect and is in part a cohort effect rather than a true aging effect. A variety of studies of IQ and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first Wechsler Intelligence Scale drew attention to IQ differences in different age groups of adults. Current consensus is that fluid intelligence generally declines with age after early adulthood, while crystallized intelligence remains intact. Both cohort effects (the birth year of the test-takers) and practice effects (test-takers taking the same form of IQ test more than once) must be controlled to gain accurate data. It is unclear whether any lifestyle intervention can preserve fluid intelligence into older ages.|$|E
50|$|While typhoid adware is {{a variant}} of the {{well-known}} man-in-the-middle attack, the <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> a number of new important issues, such as protection of video content and growing availability of public wireless internet access which are not well-monitored.|$|R
50|$|Other UFO <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that high-energy {{ionizing}} radiation {{of the kind}} that can cause damage to human beings (e.g. gamma radiation) does not induce radioactivity in objects, and would not have left behind any residual radioactivity in the area.|$|R
50|$|Findings {{indicated}} that, {{in support}} of the hypothesis, the capacity and resources available to patients with Wernicke’s aphasia to procure appropriate gap filling remain intact. Although this process appears to be preserved, the <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that other related processes, such as higher-level sentence comprehension, might be impaired.|$|R
25|$|Controversial {{results from}} one study {{suggested}} that traumatic experiences might produce an epigenetic signal that {{is capable of}} being passed to future generations. Mice were trained, using foot shocks, to fear a cherry blossom odor. The investigators reported that the mouse offspring had an increased aversion to this specific odor. They suggested epigenetic changes that increase gene expression, rather than in DNA itself, in a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odor receptor in the nose that responds specifically to this cherry blossom smell. There were physical changes that correlated with olfactory (smell) function in the brains of the trained mice and their descendants. Several criticisms were reported, including the study's low statistical power as evidence of some irregularity such as bias in reporting results. Due to limits of sample size, there is a probability that an effect will not be demonstrated to within statistical significance even if it exists. The criticism suggested that the probability that all the experiments reported would show positive results if an identical protocol was followed, assuming the claimed effects exist, is merely 0.4%. The authors also did not indicate which mice were siblings, and treated all of the mice as statistically independent. The original <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> negative results in the paper's appendix that the criticism omitted in its calculations, and undertook to track which mice were siblings in the future.|$|E
500|$|Lambeosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the Lambeosaurinae, the {{subfamily}} of hadrosaurids that had hollow skull crests. Among the lambeosaurines, it {{is closely related to}} similar dinosaurs such as Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus, with little separating them but crest form. The relationships among these dinosaur genera are difficult to pick out. Some early classifications placed these genera in the tribe Corythosaurini, which was found by David Evans and Robert Reisz to include Lambeosaurus as the sister taxon to a clade made up of Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and the Russian genus Olorotitan; these lambeosaurines, with Nipponosaurus. However, later <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that due to the rules of priority set forth by the ICZN, any tribe containing Lambeosaurus is properly named Lambeosaurini, and that therefore the name [...] "Corythosaurini" [...] is a junior synonym. The following cladogram illustrating the relationships of Lambeosaurus and its close relatives was recovered in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto-Márquez, Luis M. Chiappe and Shantanu H. Joshi.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{a number}} of <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the {{experiment}} was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported. Others noted that the definition of breakeven as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed {{to refer to the}} energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser. The method used to reach these levels, known as the [...] "high foot", is not suitable for general ignition, and as a result, it is still unclear whether NIF will ever reach this goal.|$|E
50|$|Such factionalizing, <b>researchers</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> {{is common}} to social {{movements}} and {{plays a role in}} sustaining their health.|$|R
25|$|The Rosseinsky {{group showed}} that the {{carboxylic}} acids behave as Brønsted acidic catalysts, facilitating (in the copper cases) the ring-opening methanolysis of a small, cavityaccessible epoxide at up to 65% yield. These <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that superior homogeneous catalysts exist, but emphasize that the catalyst formed here is unique to the MOF environment, thus representing an interesting proof of concept.|$|R
25|$|Most Mussorgsky biographers {{claim that}} the {{directorate}} of the Imperial Theatres also rejected the revised version of Boris Godunov, even providing a date: 6 May 1872 (Calvocoressi), or 29 October 1872 (Lloyd-Jones). Recent <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim, emphasizing that in his revision Mussorgsky had rectified the only objection the directorate {{is known to have}} made.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{have criticized the}} theory, stating {{that it is a}} conspiracy theory. The <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the theory's proponents have provided little or no evidence to support the theory. Gordon Bennett points out that the decision to send troops to Chechnya was taken by Boris Yeltsin – not Vladimir Putin – with the wholehearted support of all power structures after the Invasion of Dagestan. While Yeltsin may have made the decision to invade Chechnya, it was Putin who gave the order to invade. According to John Dunlop, {{on the same day that}} Yeltsin appointed Putin as acting premier, Putin chaired a meeting of the Security Council. In his memoirs, Yeltsin wrote of this meeting: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{that their}} {{findings}} dramatically {{disagree with the}} hypothetical models of neural events being proposed in nearly all current theories of visual spatial perception.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} Web-based {{consensus}} taxonomies remains controversial because, as two Australian <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> taxonomic names are not fixed but hypotheses, and therefore in constant change.|$|E
5000|$|Several other {{researchers}} have found similar results. [...] "Numerous <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that democratic norms and political structures constrain elite decisions {{about the use of}} repression against their citizens whereas autocratic elites are not so constrained. Once in place, democratic institutions—even partial ones—reduce the likelihood of armed conflict and all but eliminate the risk that it will lead to geno/politicide." ...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a degree}} of {{controversy}} amongst researchers regarding {{the extent to which}} restraint positions restrict breathing. Some researchers report that when they conducted laboratory studies of the effects of restraint on breathing and oxygen levels, the effect was limited. Other <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that deaths in real life situations occur after prolonged, violent resistance which has not been studied in laboratory simulations.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2010, while Blumenthal {{continued}} to lead all Republican contenders by 20–30 points, McMahon took frontrunner status from Simmons. Her {{rise in the}} polls was attributed largely to her heavy media presence, as a polling <b>researcher</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "You can't miss her television ads. They're everywhere. She's the only candidate for Senate that's on TV right now." [...] Political research showed that McMahon had gained strong popularity with female voters, social conservatives, and residents in Fairfield County.|$|R
50|$|Experimenters have {{repeatedly}} voiced that loophole-free tests {{could be expected}} in the near future. On the other hand, some <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the logical possibility that quantum physics itself prevents a loophole-free test from ever being implemented.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, {{accounts}} {{associated with}} DNS records of Brazilian banks were hacked. Kasperskys <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to a vulnerability in NIC.brs website and suggested its infrastructure had been compromised. NICs {{director at the}} time, Frederico Neves, denied that NIC.br was [...] "hacked", although NIC admitted the vulnerability.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg. VMware <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in a 2006 ASPLOS paper that the above techniques made the x86 platform virtualizable {{in the sense of}} meeting the three criteria of Popek and Goldberg, albeit not by the classic trap-and-emulate technique.|$|E
30|$|Tamminga et al. [74] {{study the}} {{establishment}} of a standard for exchanging traffic and transportation models as a CityGML ADE. In this work in progress, <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that CityGML provides a geographical context, which many existing traffic and transportation models currently lack. Examples of attributes that are added to the CityGML thematic module representing roads are maximum speed of a road segment, gradient, and capacity. With that, this ADE opens the door for different uses of CityGML in transportation applications.|$|R
50|$|The exact year of {{building}} could not be ascertained from the inscriptions, but the inscriptions found in the Visalur temple indicate benevolent gifts to the temple from Raja Raja Chola I (984-1015 CE) and his successors. Based on the inscriptions, <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the temple had gardens, which {{were supposed to have}} both floral plants and fruit bearing trees. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi and is believed to have established various sculptures.|$|R
25|$|About the {{presence}} of NMO-IgG, some <b>researchers</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that some other cases could be paraneoplastic. It seems also clear that lupus can produce NMO-IgG autoantibodies sometimes, leading to some cases of lupus-derived NMO.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that as {{a result}} of earlier {{consumer}} psychology studies that essentially pointed to the existence of the IKEA effect, many firms transitioned from viewing consumers as [...] "recipients of value" [...] to instead [...] "co-creators of value." [...] One element of this shift was the involvement of consumers in product design, marketing, and testing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> several {{flaws in}} their study. Whitten's main critiques was with their using only their first cycles {{as a control}} for the {{subsequent}} conditions. He argued that this eliminate all within-subject variance [...] Control conditions should have been run between each experimental condition and just {{at the beginning of}} the study. He was also skeptical about whether the coupled-oscillator model from rat research could be applied to humans.|$|E

30|$|Digital game {{industry}} {{becomes the}} mainstream of the market (Siwek 2014; Rideout et al. 2010) because fantasy, curiosity, challenge, and control are the features that attract players (Malone and Lepper 1987). Some <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that playing can hold student attentions and make learning be more interesting (Virvou, Katsionis, & Manos, 2005; Boyle 1997). In fact, games can produce engagement and delight in learning (Boyle 1997). For these reasons, many studies use commercial games directly or design new education games and have evidences of students can get significant improvement in learning.|$|R
50|$|Other criticisms <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that these}} studies have been small scale, with conspicuously shallow {{participant}} pools and lopsided gender distributions. <b>Researchers</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that there aren't enough studies {{on the effects of}} any form of Ginseng on the common cold to form any conclusions.|$|R
50|$|The Worldwide Governance Indicators offer {{a useful}} {{snapshot}} of some {{perceptions of a}} country’s quality of governance but <b>researchers</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> significant problems in their construction. These critiques have been extensively rebutted by the WGI authors in several publications.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{subordination}} of women {{is not unique to}} the genre of hip hop. According to Weitzer and Kubrin's 2009 analysis, 22% of rap songs surveyed in their study contained misogynistic lyrics. Yet the <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that misogyny seems to be less common in rap music than expected and that other music genres, such as rock music, contain more negative images of women according to some studies. In an interview, comic Chris Rock says that misogyny is no stranger to pop music in America.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} {{presidency}} of Ahmadinejad, {{the problem was}} particularly severe with juvenile death penalty since more than 130 juvenile offenders were sentenced to death in Iran as of 2008. Moreover, the independent <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{on the issue of}} political prisoners whose number increased during Ahmadinejad’s first presidency. Other problems with human rights involved the absence of basic protection of LGBT rights as the number of criminal convictions for homosexual sex increased during the period between 2005 and 2009, while the President even denied the existence of gay people in Iran.|$|E
5000|$|Norton and {{his fellow}} {{researchers}} also cited the Build-a-Bear product, which allows people {{to make their own}} teddy bears. Many consumers enjoy this option, even though they are charged a high price for a product for which, thanks to their labor, the manufacturer does not have to pay production costs. In addition, the <b>researchers</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the popularity of [...] "haycations," [...] whereby city people pay to do farmers' work for them. In all these cases, the researchers posit, people seem more willing to pay for an item into which they have put a degree of their own labor.|$|E
30|$|In particular, some <b>researchers</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that in {{the case}} of small {{innovative}} firms, venture capital is a source of external funding preferred by entrepreneurs to debt capital. Nevertheless, whatever the position regarding the validity of the pecking order theory with respect to innovative companies, all scholars agree on the difficulty of small firms to access ‘traditional’ external financing sources such as debt capital and direct collection of equity through the subscription of new shares by the old partners. Therefore, the high rate of mortality in the start-up of innovative projects is often explained by capital rationing.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the logical}} {{components}} of a rule based planning and scheduling system are described. The <b>researcher</b> <b>points</b> <b>out</b> a deficiency in the conventional truth maintenance approach to this class of problems and suggests a new mechanism which overcomes the problem. This extension {{of the idea of}} justification truth maintenance may seem at first to be a small philosophical step. However, it embodies a process of basic human reasoning which is so common and automatic as to escape conscious detection without careful introspection. It is vital to any successful implementation of a rule based planning reasoner...|$|R
40|$|It {{seems like}} a simple enough question: Is {{computer-assisted}} language learning effective for language learning?
