5|$|In 1871, McCreary was re-elected to {{the state}} House without opposition. In the {{upcoming}} legislative session, the major question {{was expected to be}} the Cincinnati Southern Railway's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> to build a track connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, with either Knoxville or Chattanooga, Tennessee, through Central Kentucky. The action was opposed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, a bitter rival of the Cincinnati line. Appeals to the General Assembly to oppose the bill on grounds that an out-of-state corporation should not be granted a charter in the state were successful in 1869 and 1870, and an attempt by the federal Congress to grant the charter was defeated by states' rights legislators there. Moreover, newly elected governor Preston Leslie had opposed a bill granting Cincinnati Southern's request {{when he was in the}} state Senate in 1869. In the lead-up to the 1871 session, frustrated Central Kentuckians threatened to defect from the Democratic Party in future elections if the bill were not passed in the session. Supporters of Cincinnati Southern won a victory when McCreary, a staunch supporter of the bill to grant the line's request, was elected Speaker of the House. After approval of a series of amendments designed to give Kentucky courts some jurisdiction in cases involving the line and the Kentucky General Assembly some measure of control over the line's activities, the bill passed the House by a vote of 59–38. The vote in the Senate resulted in a 19–19 tie; President Pro Tem John G. Carlisle—a native of Covington, through which the proposed line would pass—cast the deciding vote in favor of approving Cincinnati Southern's request. With the will of the people clearly expressed through the legislature, Governor Leslie did not employ his gubernatorial veto. McCreary was again returned to the House without opposition in 1873 and was again chosen Speaker of the House during his term.|$|E

40|$|Why have states <b>requested</b> {{international}} <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> their {{projections of}} military force more after 1989 ? One perspective suggests powerful states should not make such requests. Rather, they should look to their own power instead of international organizations. Another view suggests international authorization {{is a way to}} provide credible signals about state intentions. A third perspective suggests states view international authorization {{of military force}} as appropriate. I establish that states have changed their behavior, requesting international authorization more often after 1989. Then, I develop hypotheses involving material power, burden-sharing, informational signaling, and international norms. I assess their ability to explain the increase in authorization requests through evidence from over 150 military force projections by a wide range of states and through a detailed evaluation of United States behavior. The U. S. provides a strong test case for the theories evaluated, since powerful states should be least susceptible to pressures <b>for</b> <b>requesting</b> <b>authorization,</b> and yet it does so more frequently after 1989. I find the expectation that states should request international authorization emerged after the U. S. set a precedent during the Persian Gulf War. The end of the Cold War changed the perceived "viability" of different strategies for projecting military force for U. S. policy-makers. Requesting authorization from the UN became a plausible alternative. The decision to request international authorization [...] and the justifications U. S. decision makers offered for doing so [...] led to the expectation by other states that the U. S. would do so for future projections of military force. This international norm helps explain the politics of international <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> the airstrikes on Iraq (1998), the Iraq War (2003) and the Libyan intervention (2011). The response of other countries to the Clinton Administration's failure to <b>request</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> airstrikes on Iraq in 1998 demonstrates that expectations regarding whether the U. S. should request authorization had shifted. The subsequent consolidation of the norm helps explain the <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> by the Bush Administration for the Iraq War in 2003 and by the Obama Administration for Libya in 2011.

5000|$|The {{need for}} {{creating}} RVTD arose when its predecessor, {{a private company}} named Mount Ashland Stage Lines, went bankrupt and ceased operating in 1974 after having served the Rogue Valley since 1965. [...] Area voters approved {{the creation of a}} new public transit district in 1975, but funding for operations was not included, and subsequent <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorization</b> of a property-tax increase to fund the service were rejected at the ballot box. The district's board scaled back the original plans by about 35 percent before finally gaining voter approval of operations funding. The service that was inaugurated in July 1977, initially operating under the name, Rogue Rapids Transit, comprised just three buses serving six routes. Initial ridership on the fledging system was better than expected, prompting the city of Medford to agree to purchase three vans for RVTD's use, which were used for a new shuttle service in the downtown area starting in November 1977. The district's bus fleet has since grown to 20 vehicles.|$|R
