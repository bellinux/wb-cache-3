However, advances in information communications technology have given birth to the concept of smart city, which is rapidly being applied to address some of the challenges being faced in such cities.

A proof of concept prototype was implemented for the proposed architecture using Arduino UNO microcontroller board, proximity sensor, breadboard, <b>refuse</b> <b>bin</b> and a personal computer. The proximity sensor was interfaced with the Arduino board to capture dataset that correspond to the five different positions calibrated on a <b>refuse</b> <b>bin.</b> The dataset was shown to be of good quality since the graph of the mean voltages against the distances is similar to the proximity sensor characteristic graph. To determine the appropriate classifier for realizing the pattern classification unit of the prototype, an experiment was performed using the acquired dataset to train five different variants of the K-NN classifier. The 1 -NN classifier was nominated for the prototype because it is simple and it gave higher values of accuracy, precision and recal...|$|R

The study used a mixed approach employing elements of both quantitative and qualitative research designs. One hundred residents were sampled for the study. The study established that there is poor waste management in Zvishavane town council.

Waste collection is very erratic, and sometimes residents would go for two or more weeks without waste collection by the responsible authority.

40|$|Careful {{investigation}} {{has shown that}} when garbage is divided into different categories such as plastic, paper, metals, etc., food waste accounts for about 8 % of the refuse. This food waste is all decomposable and rather than send it away to dumps, can be put to valuable use as organic compost for yards and gardens. The idea below shows how the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER, which is made almost entirely of recycled materials, will produce a fine, clean, non-toxic compost. The entire process is natural and uses bacteria, millipedes, worms, wood lice and other invertebrates {{to break down the}} refuse thrown into the bin. How to use the KITCHEN KOMPOSTER: 1. Place the KOMPOSTER on a flat smooth surface such as concrete or a metal sheet. Be sure the bin is level. 2. Put large breadfruit leaves or other large leaves {{in the bottom of the}} bin to cover the holes. 3. Add millipedes, worms and wood lice from a sack of prestarted compost. Spread the mixture evenly on the leaves making sure the insects have an adequate depth of 'soil` to burrow into. 4. Add kitchen <b>refuse</b> into the <b>bin</b> whenever you need to dispose of scraps. Anything that is organic will decompose in the KOMPOSTER. 5. From time to time, add some garden <b>refuse</b> to the <b>bin</b> to help balance the moisture content in the bin. Be careful not to overheat the KOMPOSTER by adding a large amount of very fresh grass clippings. They will generate a high degree of heat if too much is added at the same time. 6. If you find any millipedes worms or wood lice while working in your garden or yard, add these to the KOMPOSTER, they will help speed up the composting process.

The study was based on household surveys and data were collected from 452 respondents in nine public housing estates constructed between 2003 and 2010 in urban centers in the study area using structured questionnaire and observation schedule. It was observed that although the majority of households in the housing estates have good access to human waste disposal system, accessibility to <b>refuse</b> <b>bins,</b> treated water, electricity, and public transport services as well as educational, shopping, recreational, healthcare, drainage, and other vital facilities is poor.

40|$|Abstract Background Solid {{medical waste}} (SMW) in {{households}} {{is perceived to}} pose minimal risks to the public compared to SMW generated from healthcare facilities. While waste from healthcare facilities is subject to recommended safety measures to minimize risks to {{human health and the}} environment, similar waste in households is often untreated and co-mingled with household waste which ends up in landfills and open dumps in many African countries. In Ghana, the management of this potentially hazardous waste stream at household and community level has not been widely reported. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate household disposal practices and harm resulting from SMW generated in households and the community. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 600 households was undertaken in Ga South Municipal Assembly in Accra, Ghana from mid-April to June, 2014. Factors investigated included socio-demographic characteristics, medication related practices, the belief that one is at risk of diseases associated with SMW, SMW disposal practices and reported harm associated with SMW at home and in the community. Results Eighty percent and 89 % of respondents discarded unwanted medicines and sharps in household <b>refuse</b> <b>bins</b> respectively. A corresponding 23 % and 35 % of respondents discarded these items without a container. Harm from SMW in the household and in the community was reported by 5 % and 3 % of respondents respectively. Persons who believed they were at risk of diseases associated with SMW were nearly three times more likely to report harm in the household (OR 2. 75, 95 %CI 1. 15 – 6. 54). Conclusion The belief that one can be harmed by diseases associated with SMW influenced reporting rates in the study area. Disposal practices suggest the presence of unwanted medicines and sharps in the household waste stream conferring on it hazardous properties. Given the low rates of harm reported, elimination of preventable harm might justify community intervention...|$|E

Comparisons made with existing SCO catalysts showed that the new nanostructured catalyst display better reaction activity and selectivity at a lower temperature. The effects of catalyst loading, catalyst support and pretreatment conditions on physicochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N 2 physisorption, temperature programmed reduction and Micro-Raman spectroscopy.
