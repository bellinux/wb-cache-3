In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc <b>harrows,</b> <b>tine</b> <b>harrows</b> (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
50|$|A spring-tooth harrow, {{sometimes}} called a drag harrow, {{is a type}} of harrow, and specifically a type of <b>tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment. It uses many flexible iron teeth mounted in rows to loosen the soil before planting. It is set in the ground and raised manually and cannot be backed up; this is why it has been replaced by more modern equipment such as the chisel plow and field cultivator.|$|R

Six weed control techniques (spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> inter row hoe with duckfoot sweeps, separately used or in combinations, inter row hoe with additional tools: finger weeder, torsion weeder, ridging wings) were evaluated concerning the effects on weed ground cover and on plant losses.

The field trials were conducted at three sites in four years (2011 - 2014). At harvest, the weed ground cover in the harrowing variant was {{higher than in the}} hoeing variants. In the four environments with high weed pressure, the weed ground cover was already higher at pod filling in the harrowing variant. This resulted in higher yields in the hoeing variants in these environments and was caused by a longer period of weed control with hoeing.

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At {{the same time the}} supply of sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important mechanical weeding techniques. The loosening and aerating of the soil produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance the soil structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated the effects of mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content of the crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at the time of harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. The amount of dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On the soils with the lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % of those in the control, while on the soil with the higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % of those in the control. On average, the best effect on the lighter clay soils was achieved by use of the s-tine harrow, while on the heavier clay soils the Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on the lighter clay soil were achieved by use of the spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005). The best results on the heavier clay soils were achieved by use of Väderstad Crosskill roller, which gave a 5 % yield increase compared with the control, while the use of spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> and s-tine harrow caused a yield reduction of about the same magnitude. On both soil types, the use of an s-tine harrow had a negative effect on wheat yield, probably due to a high degree of mechanical damage to the crop...|$|R
40|$|A {{two years}} field {{experiment}} (2004 - 2005) {{was carried out}} in the Fucino Valley. The aim was to compare different strategies for physical weed control in organic chicory. Chicory is the second most important vegetable crop of the area after carrot. The physical weed control strategy included the stale seed-bed technique before crop transplanting and one or more mechanical and manual interventions after transplanting. Three different operative machines two meters wide were adopted for false seed-bed technique: a rolling harrow, a flame weeder and a spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow.</b> A conventional hoe or a specific innovative precision hoe with six units (45 cm of inter-row) were used to perform both inter-row and intra-row (by means of torsion weeders) weed control.

The results were quite interesting and stressed the chicory high quality yield, under the different physical weed control strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|Different {{implements}} {{for spring}} tillage and different cultivation intensities of autumn-ploughed fields were studied in eleven field experiments in potatoes in northern Sweden in 1965 - 69. The implements used were a spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow,</b> a cultivator-harrow with fairly rigid spring tines and a disc harrow. These implements {{were used in}} two, four and six runs. In addition, there was one treatment with spring ploughing and spring tine harrowing (two runs) and one treatment with rotary cultivation (one run). The experiments were carried out on light soils, rich in fine sand and silt. In one of the experiments, however, the soil had a clay content as high as 23 per cent. Among the harrows, the disc harrow gave the best mean yield result. Four runs gave the highest yield. The differenees were, however small. Ploughing in the spring did not increase the crop yield.

50|$|<b>Tine</b> <b>harrows</b> {{are used}} to refine {{seed-bed}} condition before planting, to remove small weeds in growing crops and to loosen the inter-row soils to allow for water to soak into the subsoil. The fourth is a chain disk harrow. Disk attached to chains are pulled at an angle over the ground. These harrows move rapidly across the surface. The chain and disk rotate to stay clean while breaking up the top surface to about 1 in deep. A smooth seedbed is prepared for planting with one pass.Chain harrowing {{can be used on}} pasture land to spread out dung, and to break up dead material (thatch) in the sward, and similarly in sports-ground maintenance a light chain harrowing is often used to level off the ground after heavy use, to remove and smooth out boot marks and indentations. Used on tilled land in combination with the other two types, chain harrowing rolls remaining larger soil clumps to the surface where weather breaks them down and prevents interference with seed germination.|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} in vivo the effectiveness of scaling and root planing of a power-driven mechanism compared with hand instruments and ultrasonic insert alone with a split-mouth design after 3 and 6 months. METHODS: Healing events after initial periodontal therapy were investigated in 20 patients with moderate-to-severe adult periodontitis. Plaque index (PlI), bleeding on probing (PBI), probing pocket depth (PPD), probing attachment level (PAL) and number of moderate and deep pockets (NMP, NDP) were recorded at baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Oral hygiene instruction was provided for each patient. Randomly assigned quadrants per patient were scaled and root planed with hand instrumentation (curettes, hoes and files), with <b>reciprocating</b> <b>power-driven</b> instruments, with ultrasonic scaler alone and with the combined use of ultrasonic scaler and power-driven inserts. The Friedman test was applied to test the significance of difference between the various methods of root instrumentation. Repeated measures of analysis of variance (manova) were used to analyse the time effect on the different treatments. RESULTS: At the 6 -month evaluation, all groups in the scaling and root planing treatment presented with an improvement in the measured clinical parameters, as compared with baseline. No statistical differences (p> 0. 05) were observed in the assessed periodontal indices among the study sites between the four groups for either treatment.

We ask: i) {{whether there are}} traits or combinations of traits that allow weed species to persist in sown grass strips; and, ii) how does duration of sown grass strips affect weed community composition? We hypothesized that therophyte annual and small weed species will dominate the community in newly sown grass strips (5 years old). Floral surveys were performed in 75 sown grass-margin strips in France and each strip was surveyed twice. Weed species were summarized with trait databases into functional groups using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification. Functional group trajectories were investigated in sown grass-margin strips that differed in age using a space-for-time substitution. We found that geophyte, competitor and monocotyledon species were more frequent and abundant than therophyte, ruderal and dicotyledon species. Trait combinations found in most functional groups appeared to be tolerant of strip management; however, one functional group consisting of therophyte, ruderals with a continuous reproduction period declined in importance with age of sown grass-margin strips. Our findings have implications for non-crop vegetation management for optimizing diversity and ecosystem services in land enrolled in conservation programs.

40|$|Dairy and {{livestock}} farmers face considerable {{economic and environmental}} challenges as they prepare for the future. Over {{the last several years}} many farmers have adopted low-disturbance tillage and soil conservation practices that improve profitability and protect the environment. A modified no-till system with a rolling <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> suitable for use on dairy {{and livestock}} farms reduced machinery costs 25 %, fuel costs 45 %, and labor costs 50 %, compared with a conventional tillage and planting system (Harrigan et al., 1996). Cropping systems that reduce tillage intensity and increase the use of cover crops improve soil quality and protect the environment in many ways. Even small amounts of crop residue reduce soil erosion, and no-till systems are associated with the least runoff. However, manure use is a challenge in no-till crop-ping systems. There is a need for cropping and manure management options that stabilize soil and prevent overland flow of sedi-ment, nutrients, and contaminants. Such options will retain manure in the root zone for nutrient use in the following crop and remediation of pathogens. Cover crops have not been used widely in livestock-based cropping systems because establishment costs, competition for labor and added manage-ment needs have discouraged their use. Because cover crops are an effective barrier to overland flow, sedimentation, and manure contamination of waterways, interest in the use of cover crops is increasing. This article describes on-going work at Michigan State University in combining seeding, manure land application, and aeration tillage in one sustainable, efficient, and environ-mentally sensitive operation (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{three years}} {{experiment}} (2000 - 2002) {{was carried out}} on the possibility to perform the physical weed control of carrot in the typical cultural and environmental condition of the Fucino Valley (that {{is the most important}} area of carrot production in Italy), in order to obtain a “biological” product. Firstly, the strategy of physical weed control of carrot in the Fucino Valley was defined and included the realization of the false seed-bed technique, a flame treatment before crop emergence and one or more mechanical (precision hoeing) and manual interventions in post-emergence. False seed-bed technique was performed by means of a specific spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrow</b> two meters wide, while flaming was performed by means of an operative machine equipped with four “open flame” rod burners 50 cm wide. A specific precision hoe with eleven units (inter-row of about 18 cm) was built, tested, improved and set up to perform weed control both between (by means of a rigid tine supporting a 9 cm wide horizontal blade) and in rows (by means of vibrating teeth or torsion weeder). During the testing period the evolution of weed flora (both presence and biomass) was monitored and carrot root yield was recorded. Moreover work chains characteristics, manpower use and physical weed control cost were determined. The results were quite good and put in evidence that physical weed control in organic carrot cultivated in the Fucino Valley can be performed, obtaining relevant and high quality yields, without the need of too many hours of manual labour and with fully acceptable costs, taking also into account that in Italy the market price of “biological” carrot is quite high...|$|R

40|$|A web-based {{digital image}} {{analysis}} tool (IMAGING Crop Response Analyser) has been developed, tested and made public (www. imaging-crops. dk). This new technology makes possible objective estimations of crop-soil cover (i. e. how much crop is buried with soil) associated with post-emergence weed control with spring <b>tine</b> <b>harrows,</b> rotary hoes and other weeders. Objective estimation of crop-soil cover offers new possibilities to improve decision support of physical weed control practises with low selectivity because trade-offs between weed control and resulting injury to the associated crop now may be quantified, communicated and incorporated into models. The objective of this resentation is to suggest key parameters and research priorities for future research and to suggest standards for estimation and statistical test of the analytical parameters. The overall aim is to help researchers deliver reliable parameter estimates that may help to predict the optimal intensity and timing of physical weed control with low selectivity and, thereby, contribute to the theoretical and methodological framework of physical weed control. Selectivity and crop recovery are suggested as key parameters because they are crucial in predictive models and are less influenced by site-specific soil conditions and implement settings than other parameters. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} ratio between weed control and crop-soil cover and crop recovery is defined as the ability of the crop to recover from soil coverage. Both parameters depend on the intensity of tillage. To facilitate comparisons between different studies, it is suggested that the crop soil cover associated with 80 % weed control and the relative crop yield loss associated with 25 % crop-soil cover are calculated with 95 %-confidence intervals. Experimental protocols needed to make such calculations are outlined and factors that influence - or may influence - selectivity and recovery are listed and research priorities are given. Crop tolerance has previously been used to express the susceptibility of the crop to physical weed control, but crop recovery is shown to be more useful in decision support models than crop tolerance. Recent studies using the new {{digital image analysis}} tool and the above suggested parameter estimation procedure show that timing of weed harrowing is of lesser importance if the intensity of tillage is correctly adjusted to the growth stage compared with prediction of the optimal intensity in sitespecific conditions. This latter issue remains the major challenge for future development...|$|R

This study investigates (i) an expected advantage of an intelligent rotor tine cultivator (the cycloid hoe) in terms of crop-weed selectivity and (ii) an expected synergistic effect between punch planting and post-emergence weed harrowing in terms of improved crop-weed selectivity. Selectivity {{is defined as the}} relationship between weed control and associated crop density decline one week after cultivation, and punch planting is a sowing technique where holes are created in the ground with a minimum of soil disturbance and seeds are inserted into them, without soil disturbance outside the holes. Two experiments were carried out with the cycloid hoe in organic sugar beets. The rotation tines were guided by RTK-GPS relative to geo-referenced sugar beets, and tines were moved into the row when there was enough space between crop plants to cultivate, and kept outside, when they were predicted to strike a crop plant. The selectivity of the cycloid hoe was tested against two machine variants without intelligent guidance: the rotor tine cultivator in a locked mode, where tines rotate within the crop row without taking crop plants into consideration, and an ordinary flex <b>tine</b> weed <b>harrow.</b> The experiments showed no differences between the three machine variants in terms of selectivity. Five experiments with punch planting in sugar beets and carrots showed no synergistic effects between plant establishment procedures and selectivity of post-emergence weed harrowing.

40|$|Uprooting by weed {{harrowing}} and {{the potential}} of the uprooting process for selective weed control at early crop growth stages was studied. Effects of working depth, seed depth, soil moisture content and working speed on uprooting of Lolium perenne L., Lepidium sativum L. and Chenopodium quinoa Willd. were investigated in laboratory harrowing experiments on a sandy soil. Harrowing uprooted on average 51 % of the emerging plants and 21 % of the plants in the seedling stage. Seventy per cent of all uprooted plants were completely covered by soil. An increase in working depth from 10 mm to 30 mm doubled the average fraction of uprooted plants. Uprooting was also promoted by higher soil moisture contents and higher working speeds. Average uprooting selectivity (=fraction of uprooted emerging plants/fraction of uprooted seedlings of the same species) varied between 2. 0 (deep tillage and high speed) and 5. 6 (dry soil). If tines could keep a distance of more than 3 mm from the crop and weed plants, the average selectivity of all treatments would improve from 2. 4 to 5. 5 and the average fraction of uprooted seedlings would decrease from 21 % to 8 %. This study indicates that uprooting may be a more important weed control mechanism than commonly believed.

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each <b>harrow</b> <b>tine</b> functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|R
