5000|$|During World War II he chose, {{instead of}} fighting, to {{volunteer}} for the Civilian Public Service.1. [...] Hulbert, being a Quaker, was a pacifist for moral reasons.5 [...] People in the Civilian Public Service were conscientious objectors to the war {{who worked in the}} United States in the areas of soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, social services and mental health. While in the Civilian Public Service, Hulbert performed <b>range</b> <b>reseeding</b> research in Montana and worked as a 'smoke jumper'. [...] A 'smoke jumper' is a [...] "wildland firefighter who specializes in parachuting to fires in remote areas." [...] "His experiences as a smoke jumper fueled a subsequent interest in the role of fire in natural ecosystems which became a major focus of his research in later years." ...|$|E
30|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that areas near the piospheres have been heavily grazed by animals thereby reducing plant species Shannon-Wiener diversity and richness. It {{is recommended that}} grazing animals be placed under strict monitoring {{to reduce the amount}} of time spent around the piospheres. Alternatively, <b>range</b> <b>reseeding</b> should also be done to rehabilitate the areas that are already degraded. These are expected to improve livestock production and enhance pastoral livelihoods.|$|E
30|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that species diversity, richness, and evenness were low near the piospheres due to heavy grazing. Similarly, the lowest species diversity, richness, and evenness were recorded near the trough {{compared to the}} dam and the river. This study therefore recommends that <b>range</b> <b>reseeding</b> and rest period be done to rehabilitate degraded areas and facilitate plant regeneration. Larger piospheres should {{also be used to}} minimize animal impact per unit area.|$|E
40|$|Public {{concern over}} {{biological}} resources assessment has grown over the decade {{due to a}} decline in resources through habitat fragmentation. The study was designed to evaluate the range condition and trend of Ikwe Forest Reserve in Gwer-East local government area of Benue State, Nigeria. Assessment of herbaceous cover and composition, woody plant/shrubs density and plant vigor were carried out in randomly selected sample plots. Litter cover was determined by step point transect method, while erosion and its extent were assessed by presence and degree of gullies. Data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results obtained showed that the herbaceous cover composed of perennials (39 %) and annuals (61 %). Mean litter cover and mean tree/shrub density were 37 % and 252 trees and shrubs per hectare. The relative density of general herbaceous species shows that Ludwigia decurrens was the highest (8. 22 %) whilst Tephrosia bracteolate was the lowest (1. 27 %). Grass species shows that pennisetum pendicellatum had the highest relative density at 17. 58 % (320 species) while Mariscus alternifolis has the lowest at 1. 21 % (22 species). The range condition was evaluated to be in fair condition (total score of 41. 5 %) when compared to a key for rating condition, and on a downward trend because of the rapid succession of less desirable plants (annuals and weeds), stunted plants and presence of slight erosion. Range management and improvement practices such as prescribed burning, <b>range</b> seeding and <b>reseeding,</b> control rate of livestock grazing and other sustainable management practices should be put in place to restore the reserve...|$|R
30|$|The high soil {{compaction}} around the piospheres resulted in high soil bulk density and reduced soil porosity. Consequently, soil hydraulic conductivity was hampered, reducing soil moisture content. Bare grounds near the piospheres further exposed {{the soil to}} impact of raindrops, decreasing soil aggregate stability and making the soils vulnerable to erosion. This {{could have been the}} reason sand content was higher near the piospheres, because the fine clay and silt particles had been carried off by either water or wind. It is recommended that that grazing animals be placed under strict monitoring {{to reduce the amount of}} time spent around the piospheres and minimize {{soil compaction}}. Alternatively, the number of piospheres can be increased to reduce the number of animals drinking from each. <b>Range</b> <b>reseeding</b> should also be done to rehabilitate the areas that are already degraded.|$|E
