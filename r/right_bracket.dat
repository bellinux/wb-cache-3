40|$|A {{concrete}} {{model of}} the free skew-monoidal category Fsk on a single generating object is obtained. The situation is clubbable {{in the sense of}} G. M. Kelly, so this allows a description of the free skew-monoidal category on any category. As the objects of Fsk are meaningfully bracketed words in the skew unit I and the generating object X, it is necessary to examine bracketings and to find the appropriate kinds of morphisms between them. This leads us to relationships between triangulations of polygons, the Tamari lattice, left and <b>right</b> <b>bracketing</b> functions, and the orientals. A consequence of our description of Fsk is a coherence theorem asserting the existence of a strictly structure-preserving faithful functor from Fsk to the skew-monoidal category of finite non-empty ordinals and first-element-and-order-preserving functions. This in turn provides a complete solution to the word problem for skew monoidal categories. Comment: 48 page...|$|R

40|$|Attempts to {{characterize}} the metal-semiconductor transition in the mixed system Li// 1 // plus //x Ti// 2 // minus //x O// 4 are plagued by chemical instabilities associated with a deviation from Vegard's law that is a maximum near x approximately equals 0. 1.

40|$|The morphosyntactic {{disambiguation}} of verbs is {{a crucial}} pre-processing step for the syntactic analysis of morphologically rich languages like German and domains with complex clause structures like law texts.

The system presented is capable of reducing the rate of POS-tagging mistakes from 10. 2 % to 1. 6 %.

Furthermore, the present study shows that in law texts, the average distance between the left and <b>right</b> <b>bracket</b> of clauses is relatively large (9. 5 tokens), and that in this domain, a wide context window is therefore necessary for the morphosyntactic disambiguation of verbs...|$|E

" Second, there {{is the problem of}} determining the syntactic structure of the compound itself (assuming a binary branching parse structure).
