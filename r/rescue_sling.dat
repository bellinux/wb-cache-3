5000|$|The Sikorsky CH-3C Jolly Green Giant {{helicopter}} {{was the primary}} rescue helicopter for the Air Force during the Vietnam War. The most important requirement for a search and rescue helicopter, in addition to long range, {{is its ability to}} mount a strong winch, or hoist, so the person being rescued can be lifted to safety. This is necessary because usually the helicopter cannot land, as the downed pilot may be in a heavily wooded area and may need to be lifted out through the trees. The winch was usually connected to a long cable—up to 300 feet— and could carry either a horse-collar <b>rescue</b> <b>sling,</b> a rescue basket, or, as used in Vietnam, a special heavy metal cone-like [...] "canopy penetrator" [...] to get through the tree branches. If the downed pilot were injured, a paramedic would be lowered down to assist the pilot into the device. The Jolly Green Giant was armed with a door gunner who used an M60 machine gun to suppress the enemy. Jolly Greens involved in rescue operations flew as a pair, with one going in low for the rescue and the second standing back in case the first encountered enemy fire.|$|E
50|$|The President of the United States of America, {{authorized}} by act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded, {{in the name}} of the Congress, the Medal of Honor to Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger, United States Air Force, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty.Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism on March 11, 1968, in the country of Laos. While assigned as Ground Radar Superintendent, Detachment 1, 1043rd Radar Evacuation Squadron. On that day, Chief Etchberger and his team of technicians were manning a top-secret defensive position at Lima Site 85 when the base was overrun by an enemy ground force. Receiving sustained and withering heavy artillery attacks directly upon his unit’s position, Chief Etchberger’s entire crew lay dead or severely wounded. Despite having received little or no combat training, Chief Etchberger single-handedly held off the enemy with an M-16, while simultaneously directing air strikes into the area and calling for air rescue.Because of his fierce defense and heroic and selfless actions, he was able to deny the enemy access to his position and save the lives of his remaining crew. With the arrival of the rescue aircraft, Chief Etchberger without hesitation repeatedly and deliberately risked his own life, exposing himself to heavy enemy fire, in order to place three surviving wounded comrades into <b>rescue</b> <b>slings</b> hanging from the hovering helicopter waiting to airlift them to safety. With his remaining crew safely aboard, Chief Etchberger finally climbed into the evacuation sling himself, only to be fatally wounded by enemy ground fire as he was being raised into the aircraft.Chief Etchberger's bravery and determination in the face of persistent enemy fire and overwhelming odds are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of military service. Chief Etchberger's gallantry, self-sacrifice, and profound concern for his fellow men, at risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty, reflect the highest credit on himself and the United States Air Force.|$|R
