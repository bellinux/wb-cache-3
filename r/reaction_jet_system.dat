40|$|Results are {{presented}} of experimental {{investigation of the}} controlled and uncontrolled dynamical behavior of a rotating or artificial gravity space station including flexible body effects. A dynamically scaled model {{was supported by a}} spherical air bearing which provided a nearly moment free environment. <b>Reaction</b> <b>jet</b> <b>system</b> were provided for spin-up and spin-down and for damping of wobble motion. Two single-gimbal gyros were arranged as a control moment gyro wobble damping system. Remotely controllable movable masses were provided to simulate mass shift disturbances such as arise from crew motions. An active mass balance wobble damping system which acted to minimize the wobble motions induced by crew motions was also installed. Flexible body effects were provided by a pair of inertia augmentation booms. Inertia augmentation booms are contemplated for use on rotating space stations to cause the spin axis moment of inertia to be the largest of the three moments of inertia as is necessary to assure gyroscopic stability. Test runs were made with each of the control systems with the booms locked (rigid body) and unlocked (flexible body) ...|$|E

INTRODUCTION Free-flying space robotic systems have been proposed for use in space in which a robotic manipulator is mounted on a spacecraft with a <b>reaction</b> <b>jet</b> attitude control <b>system</b> [1, 2].

50|$|On the 6th day of Endeavour’s STS-88 mission, Mission Specialists Jerry Ross and Jim Newman relaxed {{after their}} long spacewalk on Flight Day 5. Ross, Newman, Nancy Currie, and Sergei Krikalev {{prepared}} equipment for Flight Day 7’s EVA. Commander Bob Cabana and Pilot Rick Sturckow fired Endeavour’s main <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jets</b> for 22 minutes {{to raise the}} ISS approximately 5 statute miles.

40|$|The on-off <b>reaction</b> <b>jet</b> control <b>system</b> {{is often}} used for {{attitude}} and orbital maneuvering of various spacecraft. Future space vehicles such as the orbital transfer vehicles, orbital maneuvering vehicles, and space station will extensively use <b>reaction</b> <b>jets</b> for orbital maneuvering and attitude stabilization. The proposed robust fuel- and time-optimal control algorithm is used for a three-mass spacing model of flexible spacecraft. A fuel-efficient on-off control logic is developed for robust rest-to-rest maneuver of a flexible vehicle with minimum excitation of structural modes. The {{first part of this}} report is concerned with the problem of selecting a proper pair of jets for practical trade-offs among the maneuvering time, fuel consumption, structural mode excitation, and performance robustness. A time-optimal control problem subject to parameter robustness constraints is formulated and solved. The second part of this report deals with obtaining parameter insensitive fuel- and time- optimal control inputs by solving a constrained optimization problem subject to robustness constraints. It is shown that sensitivity to modeling errors can be significantly reduced by the proposed, robustified open-loop control approach. The final part of this report deals with sliding mode control design for uncertain flexible structures. The benchmark problem of a flexible structure is used as an example for the feedback sliding mode controller design with bounded control inputs and robustness to parameter variations is investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{attitude}} control {{performance of the}} solar electric propulsion system (SEPS) was evaluated. A thrust vector control system for powered flight control was examined along with a gas <b>jet</b> <b>reaction</b> control <b>system,</b> and a reaction wheel system, {{both of which have}} been proposed for nonpowered flight control. Comprehensive computer simulations of each control system were made and evaluated using a 30 mode spacecraft model.

40|$|The <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jets</b> of the Orion Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle {{can have}} a {{significant}} impact on the magnitude and distribution of the surface heat flux on the leeside of the aft-body, when they are fired. Changes in surface heating are expressed in terms of augmentation factor over the baseline smooth body heating. Wind tunnel tests revealed heating augmentation factors as high as 13. 0, 7. 6, 2. 8, and 5. 8 for the roll, pitch down, pitch up, and yaw jets respectively. Heating augmentation factor models, based almost exclusively on data from a series of wind tunnel tests have been developed, for the purposes of thermal protection system design. The wind tunnel tests investigated several potential jet-to-freestream similarity parameters, and heating augmentation factors derived from the data showed correlation with the jet-to-freestream momentum ratio. However, this correlation was not utilized in the developed models. Instead augmentation factors were held constant throughout the potential trajectory space. This simplification was driven by the fact that ground to flight traceability and sting effects are not well understood. Given the sensitivity of the <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jet</b> heating augmentation to configuration, geometry, and orientation the focus in the present paper is on the methodology used to develop the models and the lessons learned from the data. The models that are outlined in the present work are specific to the aerothermal database used to design the thermal protection system for the Exploration Flight Test 1 vehicle...|$|R

40|$|A pneumatic, pure fluid oontrol system, {{capable of}} {{maintaining}} the angular position of an inertia load in a gravitational space, using only one moving part, was designed and built. The control system consisted of a vortex-sink angular rate sensor, a pendulum controlled flapper-nozzle angular position sensor, a summing amplifier and bistable <b>reaction</b> <b>jets.</b> The <b>system</b> was designed to operate in a bang- bang manner {{in order to reduce}} errors in a minimum amount of time. A previous author's work on the vortex-sink angular rate sensor is extended to include information and data on proportional amplification of the output signal and the frequency response of the sensor. Methods for synthesizing the components into a working system are presented along with a theoretical analysis of the system's performance. Results of experiments performed on the completed system showed that the reaotion jets could be switched in a nearly optimal manner when responding to errors introduced {{on one side of the}} system, but, due to the unsymmetrical gain of the rate sensor, the errors introduced on the opposite side resulted in a certain amount of after end-point chattering. Good correlation between theory and experiment led to the conclusion that the application of standard control system design techniques can be readily applied to the design of pure fluid control systems.

40|$|Failure or {{degradation}} of the flight control system, or hull damage, can lead to loss of vehicle control during entry. Possible failure scenarios are debris impact and wing damage {{that could result in}} a large aerodynamic asymmetry which cannot be trimmed out without additional yaw control. Currently the space shuttle uses aerodynamic control surfaces and <b>Reaction</b> Control <b>System</b> <b>jets</b> to control attitude. The forward jets are used for orbital maneuvering only, while the aft jets are used for yaw control during entry. This paper develops a controller for using the forward <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jets</b> as an additional control during entry, and assesses its value and feasibility during failure situations. Forward-aft jet blending logic is created, and implemented on a simplified model of the space shuttle entry flight control system. The model is validated and verified on the nonlinear, six degree-of-freedom Shuttle Engineering Simulator. A rudimentary human factors study was undertaken using the forward cockpit simulator at Johnson Space Center, to assess flying qualities of the new system and pilot workload. Results presented in the paper show that the combination of forward and aft jets provides useful additional yaw control, in addition to potential fuel savings and the ability to balance the use of the fuel in the forward and aft tanks to meet availability constraints of both forward and aft fuel tanks. Piloted simulation studies indicated that using both sets of jets while flying a damaged space shuttle reduces pilot workload, and makes the vehicle more responsive...|$|R

The Microgravity Analysis Workstation quasi-steady environment calculation and comparison of this calculation with Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment data {{was used to assess}} how appropriate a planned attitude was expected to be for one Crystal Growth Facility experiment sample. The microgravity environment related to several different Orbiter, crew, and experiment operations is presented and interpreted in this report. Data are examined to show the effects of vernier <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jet</b> firings for Orbiter attitude control. This is compared to examples of data when no thrusters were firing, when the primary <b>reaction</b> control <b>system</b> <b>jets</b> were used for attitude control, and when single vernier jets were fired for test purposes. In general, vernier jets, when used for attitude control, cause accelerations in the 3 x 10 (exp - 4) g to 7 x 10 (exp - 4) g range. Primary jets used in this manner cause accelerations in the 0. 01 to 0. 025 g range. Other significant disturbance sources characterized are water dump operations, with Y(sub b) axis acceleration deviations of about 1 x 10 (exp - 6) g; payload bay door opening motion, with Y(sub o) and Z(sub o) axis accelerations of frequency 0. 4 Hz; and probable Glovebox fan operations with notable frequency components at 20, 38, 43, 48, and 53 Hz.
