5|$|The game uses SoundFonts {{to provide}} {{additional}} ambient sound effects. A Sound Blaster AWE32 or AWE64 is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this feature. The player can load a SoundFont and use it for ambient sound effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, {{one of which is}} loaded at game startup, and Creative offered sample Dungeon Keeper SoundFonts for download.|$|E
5|$|Among the Betsimisaraka, like {{several other}} Malagasy ethnic groups, {{there is a}} fady against {{speaking}} {{the name of a}} chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden words would be harshly punished or in some instances executed.|$|E
5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a certain period of time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E

5|$|Spins {{earned in}} this round could be {{passed to the}} {{opponent}} with the higher total (if they were tied, the contestant passing the spins could choose the recipient). Contestants were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> all spins passed until they used their spins or hit a Whammy; in the latter case, any remaining passed spins were transferred to their earned spin total. If a contestant using passed spins hit a space that awarded a spin (e.g., $3,000 + One Spin), that spin {{was added to the}} earned total. The contestant in the lead {{at the end of the}} game kept any cash and/or prizes in their bank at that time. Unlike Press Your Luck, three new contestants appeared on each episode.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. The package also included a translation decoder wheel. After the title screen, a copy protection screen was displayed consisting of two pictures and a line. The player was <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the decoder wheel to line up the pictures, then enter the word revealed on the decoder wheel. After three unsuccessful attempts, the game automatically shut down.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls {{for use of}} the river was established by the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. From there to the Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E
5|$|When the {{new airport}} opened on 8 October 1998 the Flytoget airport express trains started {{operating}} immediately, as did the Gardermoen Line from Lillestrøm {{to the airport and}} onwards to Eidsvoll. Because the tunnel was not finished, trains were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the old Trunk Line from Oslo Central Station to Lillestrøm. After this diversion the express trains switched to the completed section of the new Gardermoen Line between Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport. Regular operations using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> his steel dentures.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (and {{not just}} prima facie) proof of Lebanese citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of Lebanese citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a Lebanese citizen for the full period allowed by law. The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though they are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used {{to return to the}} Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E
5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other, Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing off some of its nose. Kahne was <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given to Carl Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's front row by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on the front row for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday afternoon, Matt Kenseth was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.321 seconds, ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt. Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; he came down the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E
5|$|Sharing {{agreements}} {{may also}} be used as a loophole to control television stations in situations where it is legally impossible to own them outright. For instance, FCC regulations only allow a single company to own more than one full-powered television station in a given market if there are at least eight distinct station owners, and also prohibits the ownership of two or more of the four highest-rated stations (based on total day viewership) in a market. An LMA or similar agreement does not affect the ownership of the station's license, meaning that they do not require the approval of the FCC to establish, and the two stations are still legally considered separate operations from a licensing standpoint. Both Tribune Media and the Gannett Company were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> shared services agreements as a similar loophole to take control of certain stations in their respective 2013 purchases of Local TV and Belo, as they did not have exemptions to the FCC's newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in the affected markets. Both companies have since spun out their publishing arms as independent companies; the Tribune Publishing Company and Gannett Company. Tegna, who holds the former Gannett's broadcasting and digital media properties, re-acquired the licenses for most of the affected stations following the split.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player, to allow them time to position the device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story, with the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance to the boss stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person.|$|E
