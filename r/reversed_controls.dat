50|$|While {{the other}} {{algorithms}} focus on accelerating the outgoing traffic, <b>Reverse</b> <b>Control</b> attempts {{to address the}} incoming issues. <b>Reverse</b> <b>Control</b> monitors {{the quality of the}} connections with inbound data, and executes the algorithm to hint the peer to transmit as fast as it can when the connection quality is good. The algorithm also makes good effort to more accurately identify the real packet losses from other abnormal situations in order to avoid triggering unnecessary fast recoveries.|$|R

5000|$|Often, a {{transmission}} has multiple gear ratios (or simply [...] "gears") {{with the ability}} to switch between them as speed varies. This switching may be done manually (by the operator) or automatically. Directional (forward and <b>reverse)</b> <b>control</b> may also be provided. Single-ratio transmissions also exist, which simply change the speed and torque (and sometimes direction) of motor output.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{perception}} and information processing are two key steps of active safety for vehicle reversing. Single-sensor environmental perception cannot meet {{the need for}} vehicle reversing safety due to its low reliability. In this paper, we present a novel multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety. The proposed system consists of four main steps, namely multi-sensor environmental perception, information fusion, target recognition and tracking using low-rank representation and a particle filter, and vehicle <b>reversing</b> speed <b>control</b> modules. First of all, the multi-sensor environmental perception module, based on a binocular-camera system and ultrasonic range finders, obtains the distance data for obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is reversing. Secondly, the information fusion algorithm using an adaptive Kalman filter is used to process the data obtained with the multi-sensor environmental perception module, which greatly improves the robustness of the sensors. Then {{the framework of a}} particle filter and low-rank representation is used to track the main obstacles. The low-rank representation is used to optimize an objective particle template that has the smallest L- 1 norm. Finally, the electronic throttle opening and automatic braking is under control of the proposed vehicle <b>reversing</b> <b>control</b> strategy prior to any potential collisions, making the <b>reversing</b> <b>control</b> safer and more reliable. The final system simulation and practical testing results demonstrate the validity of the proposed multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety...|$|R

It uses a Telecaster body shape, scale length, and electronics controls (albeit, with a <b>reversed</b> <b>control</b> plate). However, many of its construction and electronic features—for example its set-in neck and P-90-style pickups—are similar to those of a Gibson Les Paul Junior and Gibson Les Paul Special electric guitars.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In relationships, {{behaviors}} {{aimed at}} alleviating insecurity {{often end up}} increasing it instead.

Participants in romantic relationships identified an insecurity-based behavior they wanted to reduce and learned the MCII strategy, a <b>reverse</b> <b>control</b> strategy, or no strategy. One week later, partici-pants in the MCII condition showed a greater reduction in the self-reported frequency of their unwanted behavior compared to participants in the control conditions, as well as a greater increase in relationship commitment from 2 months prior to the intervention...|$|R
50|$|In {{this case}} {{generally}} forward reverse synchronizers {{are replaced by}} the multi-plate friction clutches. Typically the multi-plate clutches are arranged on the main shaft or on the counter shaft. The forward reverse section of the gear box is generally located in the forward section {{as close to the}} engine as possible. This is beneficial to the forward <b>reverse</b> <b>control</b> elements as they are not subjected to the high relative torque.The challenge involved in providing this feature in the existing transmissions is the complex shaft arrangement. This problem arises due to the limitation of centre distance between the two shafts and fixed axial dimensions due to the vehicle size limitations.|$|R
