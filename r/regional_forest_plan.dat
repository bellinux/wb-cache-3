In this work we present the achievements of the project LIFE ResilForMed (Resilience of Mediterranean Forests to climate change), as Sicilian response on adaptation and mitigation to climate change. ResilForMed project is co-funded by the LIFE Initiative (2007 - 2014) and started June 1 st 2012 with an expected conclusion on June 30 th 2017. The project consortium involves: (i) the Department of Rural and Land Development of the Sicilian Region, (ii) the Department of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Sciences of University of Palermo, the D. R. E. Am Italia and the Forest Service of the Sicilian Region. The key results of the project are: (1) map of Sensitivity forest areas to desertification of Sicily; (2) list of bird indicators showing sensitivity to desertification in Sicily; (3) set of indicators aimed to assess the resilience of Mediterranean forests to climate changes; (4) list of sporadic and endemic tree species of Sicilian forests; (5) development of five forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) suitable to improve or consolidate the resilience of Sicilian forest ecosystems; (6) implementation of BMPs in a set of forest interventions on 120 hectares of forest areas in Sicily as a showcase; (7) development of 6 Pilot Forest Plans with participatory approach for the actual implementation of a resilience based forest management; (8) training of the regional forest service personnel, seminars and info days for key regional stakeholders; (9) transfer of project results into the new <b>Regional</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Plan</b> is the most important and straightforward action currently under implementation. The monitoring protocols and approaches, the guidelines and planning methods defined by the project will became part of the new <b>Regional</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Plan.</b> ResilForMed is at the forefront of developing knowhow and transferable best management practices that may help Mediterranean forests to adapt to climate change and thereby safeguard their multifunctional benefits for future generations...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable forest {{planning}} {{involves the}} development of an information base that may adequately represent complex data and information relations. This paper presents a methodology designed to simplify the evolvement of such an information base. The development of a <b>Regional</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Plan</b> is used as a case study. Characteristics of an information base such as dimension and diversity depend on the objectives of the planning process and on existing and available knowledge. Information availability and incomplete knowledge are often limiting factors that determine specific adaptations to the proposed methodology. For example, intensification of participatory mechanisms and effective communication may be key issues to promote knowledge acquisition. These adaptations, as well as the management of the information itself, can be enhanced and implemented with Information Systems (IS). IS may also be used to generate a more adequate representation of the complexity of the planning information base...|$|E

30|$|It is {{the primary}} {{objective}} of this simulation study to quantify the effect of long-term persistent dryer climates on forest productivity and to derive tangible recommendations for <b>regional</b> <b>forest</b> <b>planning.</b> Thus, we first compare volume increment under climate change to volume increment under constant current climate. The analysis based on mean values from single trees provides deeper insights into individual growth reactions to climate change. The innate age trend on volume increment is eliminated by looking at deviations. However, the absolute value of volume increment depends on initial tree dimension (c.f. Berrill and O’Hara 2014). Consequently, the larger the initial volume the more likely a large deviation between volume increment under climate change and constant climate will occur.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{management}} involves multiple objectives, multiple stakeholders, complex socio-ecological {{and political}} interactions. Public involvement in forest {{decision making is}} a challenging task that involves controversies. Various participatory tools such as public consultation forums, public comment processes, opinion polls are used to consult and to obtain inputs from communities. All these methods can provide useful information but they fail to quantify the trade-offs systematically and offer little help in minimizing conflicts. The Australian <b>Regional</b> <b>Forest</b> Agreement (RFA) program was implemented {{in response to the}} decades of conflicts and debate between various stakeholder groups and government over the use and management of forest resources.

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} {{decision}} support approaches (DSAs) {{are used in}} adaptive management of forests. Existing DSAs are aimed at coping with uncertainties in ecosystems but not controllability of outcomes, which is important for regional management. We designed a DSA for forest zoning to simulate the changes in indicators of forest functions while reducing uncertainties in both controllability and ecosystems. The DSA uses a Bayesian network model based on iterative learning of observed behavior (decision-making) by foresters, which simulates when and where zoned forestry activities are implemented. The DSA was applied to a study area to evaluate wood production, protection against soil erosion, preservation of biodiversity, and carbon retention under three zoning alternatives: current zoning, zoning to enhance biodiversity, and zoning to enhance wood production. The DSA predicted that alternative zoning could enhance wood production by 3 – 11 % and increase preservation of biodiversity by 0. 4 %, but decrease carbon stock by 1. 2 %.

(2) What are the challenges of public participation? The results are based on the analysis of discourse communities in a case study concerning a <b>Regional</b> <b>Forest</b> Programme and <b>forest</b> management <b>planning.</b> It was shown that the purpose of participation was to promote communication at the regional level and to gather information at the local level. The general conclusion is, that the <b>regional</b> <b>forest</b> programmes include practices to offer possibilities for communication among participants. This does not mean, that all the programme processes have reached consensus automatically. The case studied here reached compromise. The case study points out problems faced, if public participation would become common practice at the local level on non-industrial private forests lands. In <b>forest</b> management <b>planning</b> it would result in an excessively demanding mediator/expert role for the planner. The need to consider all relevant issues, e. g. biodiversity management, would also become apparent.

40|$|As {{the area}} of the world 2 ̆ 7 s forests shrinks, the {{management}} of production forests is becoming increasingly paramount for biodiversity conservation. In the United States and Australia, public debate and controversy about the management of production forests during the later decades of the 20 th century resulted in governments adopting sweeping top-down changes to <b>forest</b> policy, with <b>regional</b> <b>forest</b> <b>plans</b> a cornerstone of this process. This paper reviews the biodiversity conservation outcomes of two such processes, the Southeast Queensland Forests Agreement (Australia) and the Northwest <b>Forest</b> <b>Plan</b> (United States). Several key lessons are identified. First, these plans are significant steps forward in the struggle to conserve forest biodiversity while providing for production of timber. Second, expanding the conservation reserve system by itself does not necessarily ensure biodiversity conservation, especially if reserves are traded off for increased timber harvesting in forests outside of reserves or if certain important elements of biodiversity are not accounted for either by conservation forests or production forests. Third, reserves often need active management to restore diversity in previously-logged forests and reduce fuels that have accumulated as a result of fire exclusion. Fourth, the current plans fall short of the comprehensive whole-of-landscape, multiple-ownership approach needed to support long-term sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation. Fifth, adaptive management was not adequately institutionalized and sometimes misapplied, although, {{in the case of the}} Pacific Northwest, a major regional monitoring strategy was developed and partially implemented. Finally, ecological science suffered in the collision with the socio-political decision-making process due to the limited scope that was left for testing and evaluating the new approaches to forest management. We conclude, based on the evaluation of the two regional plans, that regional biodiversity conservation goals may be better achieved by implementing sustainable forest management practices across all ownerships and involving all stakeholders and the broader community.

Here, we implement an approach to identify locally appropriate adaptation options by tapping into the experiential knowledge base of local forest practitioners while at the same time, building capacity within this community to implement the results. We engaged 30 forest practitioners who are involved with the implementation of a <b>regional</b> <b>forest</b> management <b>plan</b> in identifying climate change vulnerabilities and evaluating alternative adaptation options.

30|$|In {{recent years}} {{biodiversity}} informatics research has rapidly advanced (Graham et al. 2004; Botkin et al. 2007) and forest ecology has swiftly benefited from it (Ash et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). Currently, <b>regional</b> <b>forest</b> monitoring <b>plans</b> are being implemented worldwide, scientific collaboration networks {{are being developed}} and large-scale data infrastructures and tools for big-data biodiversity research and ecological studies have been developed (Franklin et al. 2017). While the future of forest diversity research and monitoring is promising, urgent efforts are still needed to properly document worldwide tree distributions and diversity {{in order to assess}} the relationship between species occurrence and climate and set up conservation plans. First, data are sparse or absent in various regions (Sousa-Baena et al. 2014; Meyer et al. 2016). Second, public data availability – a key aspect of reproducible science (Hampton et al. 2015) – is often limited as forests may represent key national resources with huge economic impact. In addition, some national forest inventories have not been fully integrated in large-scale biodiversity infrastructures or registries (e.g. Global Biodiversity Infrastructure Facility, Global Index of Vegetation Databases, Botanical Information and Ecological Network). Therefore, data on tree species distributions, even when available, may be highly heterogeneous. The result is that most insights on the role of biodiversity in forest ecosystems come from certain well-studied regions (Ruiz-Benito et al. 2014) or concentrate on certain biomes for which research collaboration networks are in place (ter Steege et al. 2006; Sullivan et al. 2017).|$|R

Responding to calls for bringing human dimensions of landscape disturbance and heterogeneity into ecological assessments and management strategies, this paper explores linkages between biophysical, socioeconomic, and perceptual aspects of a mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak in north central Colorado. Findings are presented from surveys conducted with residents of nine Colorado communities and variations in local perceptions of MPB risks and forest management attitudes are compared to indices of tree mortality and amenity characteristics. Findings suggest respondents from lower amenity communities with more recent emphasis on resource extraction and higher tree mortality had significantly higher risk perceptions of some MPB impacts, lower trust in federal forest management, and higher faith in forest industry and specific industry options than those from higher amenity communities with less tree mortality.

In North-West Russia, in the Komi Republic in particular, the increasing role of <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> is based on the obvious need to transfer from the extensive way of forest management and use of primary natural forests to intensive way of secondary reforestated forests management and use. <b>Forest</b> <b>planning</b> in these conditions should provide the required demand in timber under conditions of forest ecological and social importance protection, taking into account the existed spatial structure of the forest fund. Landscape, ecological and economical forest evaluation as a basis for <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> allows to define secondary forest areas where efficient forestry and economically profitable activities are possible (taking in consideration the pattern structure and spatial heterogeneity of secondary forests, where most of the territory is covered with low-value stands). <b>Forest</b> <b>planning</b> in intensive forestry should be long-term, minimum for one felling rotation period. This requires to work out regional research programmes for forest activities, but allows giving the economical estimation at each stage of forest management, not only by the felling time. <b>Forest</b> <b>planning</b> allows to estimate the costs of forestry activities and to relate to the expected results that are really important for the financial and economical planning at the enterprise. Long-term <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> guarantees not only economical efficiency, but makes the grounds for forest social and ecological values protection. <b>Forest</b> <b>planning</b> process is dealing with the necessity of various data collection and joint use. Besides forest inventory data, <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> includes remote sensing data that can guarantee acute and updated information about a certain forest area, allows to specify spatial, age and tree species structure of a forest stand, define a landscape and ecological peculiarities of the planning object, mark high value forests and key biotopes. Modern information technologies based on GIS provide the tools for the complex analysis of information about forests and give opportunities to modeling of expected results and give an opportunity for <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> to select the optimal way of forest management for a certain place...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis {{is the use of}} {{knowledge}} in the <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> process of large Swedish forest owning companies. The <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> is conducted as a three step system: long-, medium- and short-term planning. In these steps, knowledge is created, stored, shared and applied – knowledge about the forest as well as other relevant knowledge. The studies have knowledge management theory linked to strategy theories as a base for description and analysis of the use of knowledge in the <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> process. A draft for a changed planning process is presented which aims at a better management of knowledge in forest companies. In Swedish forest owning companies the long-term <b>forest</b> <b>plans</b> are developed at top level and transferred down the organization over a number of steps. These steps involve the medium-term planning where planners prepare the compartments to be harvested and register them in the so called tract bank. The harvest managers use the compartments in the tract bank as a stock to meet delivery plans. This is where the <b>forest</b> <b>plans</b> meet harvest and delivery plans. The interaction between the <b>forest</b> <b>plans</b> and the sales plans was studied. The results showed that sales managers tend to use other input data such as previous sales volumes, rather than what is found in the medium-term plan, due to what they considered as lack of precisions and detail in the <b>forest</b> <b>plan.</b> Also, the supply of compartments with desirable attributes in the tract bank is not always sufficient to meet the demand from the harvest managers. This could make the harvest managers to sidestep the <b>forest</b> <b>plan</b> altogether. It seems that <b>forest</b> <b>plans</b> do not always are followed. In the light of these studies, a proposition for a bottom-up approach to an integrated planning process was developed. This approach was made with the purpose to stimulate the use of knowledge at local level to enhance the accuracy and applicability of the <b>forest</b> <b>plans.</b> With this approach employees at local level would hopefully be more involved in the planning process, leading to a higher adherence of the plan. This would in turn increase the association of realized plans with intended plans, thus improving the competitive position of the company...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{integrated}} <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> system {{which has been}} designed and implemented in Victoria to help analyze the spatial and temporal aspects of <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> problems. Typical allocation and scheduling problems are integrated {{through the use of}} interactive visualization. Such integration allows the spatial assessment of modeling results as well as greater verification of input data to allocation and scheduling models. Through the iterative process of visualizing modeling results and altering constraints in the model, realistic results can be achieved for more environmentally sensitive management. Furthermore, the integration of remote sensing into visualization provides a degree of spatial control for the mapped information used in the modeling and also provides indicators of spatial change resulting from implementation of the <b>forest</b> management <b>plan</b> and indicators of natural processes. Effective implementations of the integrated <b>forest</b> <b>planning</b> system suggests several interesting future directions, for different levels of <b>forest</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R
