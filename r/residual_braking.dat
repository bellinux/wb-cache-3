In pure {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the adoption of electric motor barking function for vehicle braking energy recycling make its braking control become more complicated. But making good use of braking energy can improve vehicle efficiency. A new method was developed to coordinate the electric motor regenerative braking and ABS braking. Which identify the road condition with real time basing on wheel speed information from four wheel speed sensors. Then control system decides the braking force provided by ABS system. The <b>residual</b> <b>braking</b> force is produced by electric motor barking to meet total braking force requirements. The two braking forces are coordinated by control system to perform brake function of vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} {{was used}} to investigate {{the effects of a}} heat treatment designed to remove internal <b>residual</b> stresses in <b>brake</b> discs. It is believed that residual stresses may change the rate of deformation of the discs during severe braking conditions when the disc temperature is increased significantly. Neutron diffraction {{was used to}} map out residual strain distributions in a production disc before and after a stress-relieving heat treatment. Results from these neutron diffraction experiments show that some residual strains were reduced by as much as 400 microstrain by stress relieving. 5 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|In this contribution, the {{mechanical}} behaviour of a near pearlitic wheel steel of type ER 7 is studied. Isothermal experiments of cyclic loading {{combined with a}} hold time are performed at several temperatures, ranging from room temperature up to elevated (below austenitization) temperatures. The experiments show a viscous behaviour at temperatures above 300 °C. To capture the cyclic hardening/softening and viscous behaviour of the material, a Chaboche model of viscoplastic type is presented and calibrated against the experimental data. The robustness and uniqueness of the obtained material parameters are then ensured by employing sensitivity and correlation analyses. The main goal {{of this study is}} to improve the modelling of wheel materials subjected to thermal loading due to tread braking and also to highlight the importance of viscoplastic material modelling. In this regard, finite element analyses of generic heavy haul wheels, subjected to high power drag braking loads, are carried out and comparisons between analyses with plastic and viscoplastic material models are shown. Results are presented for simulated global wheel behaviour, i. e. axial rim displacements during and after <b>braking,</b> and also <b>residual</b> stresses after <b>braking.</b> A conclusion is that the obtained results for a generic wheel with an S-shaped web, which builds substantial stresses in the wheel rim during braking, is rather sensitive to the choice of material model. Substantial differences are found already at 400 °C. Moreover, the results indicate that a generic Low-stress wheel, which builds less stresses in the rim during braking, is less affected by the choice of material model. However, at temperatures higher than about 500 °C also the results for this wheel are significantly affected by the choice of material model...|$|R
40|$|In {{heavy-duty}} {{disc brake}} systems, braking is a transient, non-linear and asymmetrical thermo-mechanical process. Surface cracking, rather than wear, {{is the major}} factor limiting the brake disc's life. The disc material (cast-iron), heat transfer boundary conditions and pad-disc frictional reactions are characteristically non-linear and asymmetrical during the friction process. Non-uniform deformation and surface cracks in brake discs result from the accumulation of excessive <b>residual</b> stress/strain. During <b>braking</b> processes, many factors affect the distributions of the residual stress and strain in discs, and hence the propagation of the surface cracks. The disc material, structure and boundary conditions are three of the crucial aspects. From the structure, a brake disc could be either solid or ventilated. In practice, solid structures always have higher anti-cracking performance than the same class of ventilated designs. However solid discs cost more material and have lower cooling efficiency. This thesis presents an improved finite element analysis for heavy-duty disc brakes and identifies design improvements. As the friction pads slide against the disc's surfaces continuously, the thermal and mechanical loads are functions of time and spatial coordinates. A 3 -D asymmetrical finite element model was developed to achieve more accurate simulations of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of brake discs during braking processes. A non-linear inelastic material model for cast-iron was employed in the FE model. Permanent plastic stress and strain fields were predicted and analysed for multi-stop drag operations. The residual stress/strain fields in the discs are investigated to {{understand the differences between}} solid and ventilated discs in terms of the cracking resistance ability. Several engineering solutions are recommended for optimising the performance of the disc brake system. _ The thesis is organized in five chapters. Chapter One introduces the background concepts about the commercial disc brake system. In this part, the brake structure, material and previous researches are reviewed. The goals for this investigation are also summarised {{at the end of this}} chapter. Chapter Two introduces the general finite element modelling knowledge, procedures and the modelling boundary conditions and material models. Chapter Three presents an analysis of the disc brakes thermo-mechanical behaviour and the affecting factors. Chapter Four is focused on the residual stress field prediction and cracking behaviour analysis. The project conclusions and further research recommendations are presented in Chapter Five...|$|R
