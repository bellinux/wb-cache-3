5|$|From {{the late}} twentieth century onwards, there has been much {{investigation}} of low-mass, <b>radiative</b> collectors; these have proved to be much more successful.|$|E
5|$|The <b>radiative</b> {{zone and}} the {{convective}} zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the <b>radiative</b> zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (swollen areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} <b>radiative</b> energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the <b>radiative</b> process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} {{approaches to the}} design of the heat sinks that collect the moisture in air wells: high mass, <b>radiative</b> and active. Early in the twentieth century, there was interest in high-mass air wells, but despite much experimentation including the construction of massive structures, this approach proved to be a failure.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{nuclear fusion}} in the Sun's core has {{modified}} the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost {{portion of the}} Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the abundance of heavier elements unchanged. Because heat is transferred from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see <b>Radiative</b> zone below), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between conductive heat transfer and <b>radiative</b> heat transfer. <b>Radiative</b> heat transfer can be filtered to pass only a definite band of <b>radiative</b> frequencies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiative</b> forcing is {{a measure}} of the {{difference}} between the incoming radiation energy and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth. Positive <b>radiative</b> forcing results in warming. From the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive <b>radiative</b> forcing, averaging about 1.66nbsp&W/m².|$|E
25|$|As noted under 'Public Policy', ozone {{depleting}} {{chemicals are}} also often greenhouse gases. The increases in concentrations of these chemicals have produced 0.34± 0.03W/m2 of <b>radiative</b> forcing, corresponding to about 14 {{percent of the}} total <b>radiative</b> forcing from increases in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{short-lived}} nature, {{tropospheric ozone}} {{does not have}} strong global effects, but has very strong <b>radiative</b> forcing effects on regional scales. In fact, there are {{regions of the world}} where tropospheric ozone has a <b>radiative</b> forcing up to 150% of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiative</b> forcing is {{a measure}} of how various factors alter the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere. A {{positive}} <b>radiative</b> forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (chemical formula: CO2) led to a positive <b>radiative</b> forcing, averaged over the Earth's surface area, of about 1.66 watts per square metre (abbreviated Wm−2).|$|E
25|$|The {{contribution}} of each gas to {{the greenhouse effect}} {{is determined by the}} characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct <b>radiative</b> effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct <b>radiative</b> effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct <b>radiative</b> impact, methane has a large, indirect <b>radiative</b> effect because it contributes to ozone formation. Shindell et al. (2005) argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates {{as a result of this}} effect.|$|E

25|$|The direct aerosol effect {{consists}} of any direct interaction of radiation with atmospheric aerosol, such as absorption or scattering. It affects both short and longwave radiation {{to produce a}} net negative <b>radiative</b> forcing. The magnitude of the resultant <b>radiative</b> forcing due to the direct effect of an aerosol {{is dependent on the}} albedo of the underlying surface, as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space. e.g. if a highly scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater <b>radiative</b> forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo. The converse is true of absorbing aerosol, with the greatest <b>radiative</b> forcing arising from a highly absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo. The direct aerosol effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a <b>radiative</b> forcing by the IPCC. The interaction of an aerosol with radiation is quantified by the single-scattering albedo (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (extinction) of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} natural and {{man-made}} mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate. Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism. Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere. As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long period. <b>Radiative</b> forcing quantifies the effect of factors that influence Earth's energy balance, including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Positive <b>radiative</b> forcing leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative <b>radiative</b> forcing leads to cooling.|$|E
25|$|The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA, 2009) {{responded to}} public {{comments}} {{on climate change}} attribution. A number of commenters had argued that recent climate change {{could be attributed to}} changes in solar irradiance. According to the US EPA (2009), this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature. Citing the work of the IPCC (2007), the US EPA pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to <b>radiative</b> forcing {{since the start of the}} Industrial Revolution in 1750. Over this time period (1750 to 2005), the estimated contribution of solar irradiance to <b>radiative</b> forcing was 5% the value of the combined <b>radiative</b> forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (see graph opposite).|$|E
25|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {{relies on}} Monte Carlo methods in {{probability}} density function analysis of <b>radiative</b> forcing.|$|E
25|$|If {{the plasma}} is {{optically}} thin, the bremsstrahlung radiation leaves the plasma, carrying {{part of the}} internal plasma energy. This effect {{is known as the}} bremsstrahlung cooling. It is a type of <b>radiative</b> cooling. The energy carried away by bremsstrahlung is called bremsstrahlung losses and represents a type of <b>radiative</b> losses. One generally uses the term bremsstrahlung losses in the context when the plasma cooling is undesired, as e.g. in fusion plasmas.|$|E
25|$|Daytime {{exposure}} to sunlight will rapidly destabilize the upper {{layers of the}} snowpack if the sunlight {{is strong enough to}} melt the snow, thereby reducing its hardness. During clear nights, the snowpack can re-freeze when ambient air temperatures fall below freezing, through the process of long-wave <b>radiative</b> cooling, or both. <b>Radiative</b> heat loss occurs when the night air is significantly cooler than the snowpack, and the heat stored in the snow is re-radiated into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaics {{may also}} be {{incorporated}} as energy conversion devices for objects at elevated temperatures and with preferable <b>radiative</b> emissivities such as heterogeneous combustors.|$|E
25|$|The <b>radiative</b> decay lifetimes {{of atoms}} in {{metastable}} {{states to the}} ground state is important to understanding astrophysics observations and tests of the standard model.|$|E

25|$|Different {{scalings}} {{are derived}} for <b>radiative</b> evolution {{and for a}} non-constant-density environment (such as a stellar wind), but share the general power-law behavior observed in this case.|$|E

25|$|In October 2017, {{scientists}} from various European universities proposed {{a means for}} sources of GEv photons using lasers as exciters through a controlled interplay between the cascade and anomalous <b>radiative</b> trapping.|$|E
25|$|Particles, due {{to their}} de Broglie wavelength, {{can also be a}} source of <b>radiative</b> energy and both {{electrons}} and neutrons are commonly used. For a particle, its kinetic energy determines its wavelength.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radiative</b> forcing from carbon dioxide, methane, and {{nitrous oxide}} {{combined}} {{is very likely}} (>90%) increasing more quickly during the current era (1750–present) {{than at any other}} time in the last 10,000 years.|$|E
25|$|The Sun closely approximates a black-body radiator. The {{effective}} temperature, {{defined by}} the total <b>radiative</b> power per square unit, is about 5780K. The color temperature of sunlight above the atmosphere is about 5900K.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} <b>radiative</b> scattering {{processes in}} the atmosphere (Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering) are elastic in nature, by which light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and with no change in wavelength.|$|E
25|$|A {{second reason}} {{that climate change}} has been {{attributed}} to land use is that the terrestrial albedo is often altered by use, which leads to <b>radiative</b> forcing. This effect is more significant locally than globally.|$|E
25|$|Absorption {{occurs when}} {{energy from the}} <b>radiative</b> source is absorbed by the material. Absorption is often {{determined}} by measuring the fraction of energy transmitted through the material; absorption will decrease the transmitted portion.|$|E
25|$|Aerosols, {{natural and}} anthropogenic, {{can affect the}} climate by {{changing}} the way radiation is transmitted through the atmosphere. Direct observations {{of the effects of}} aerosols are quite limited so any attempt to estimate their global effect necessarily involves the use of computer models. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, says: While the <b>radiative</b> forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol <b>radiative</b> forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time. However, they are mostly talking about tropospheric aerosol.|$|E
25|$|The major non-gas {{contributor}} to Earth's greenhouse effect, clouds, also absorb and emit infrared radiation {{and thus have}} an effect on <b>radiative</b> properties of the greenhouse gases. Clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{greenhouses}} are {{yet another}} matter, having an internal source of heating they leak heat out, {{which must be}} prevented. So it again makes sense {{to try to prevent}} <b>radiative</b> cooling through the use of adequate glazing.|$|E
25|$|John Tyndall (1820–93) {{retired to}} Haslemere in 1885 and {{is buried in}} St Bartholemew's parish church, Haslemere. He was an eminent physicist, mountaineer and science educator, and first {{established}} the <b>radiative</b> properties of various greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in cloud droplet number {{due to the}} introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud droplet size, as the same amount of water is divided between more droplets. This has the effect of suppressing precipitation, increasing the cloud lifetime, known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect, second indirect effect or Albrecht effect. This has been observed as the suppression of drizzle in ship exhaust plume compared to ambient clouds, and inhibited precipitation in biomass burning plumes. This cloud lifetime effect is classified as a climate feedback (rather than a <b>radiative</b> forcing) by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle. However, it has previously been classified as a negative <b>radiative</b> forcing.|$|E
