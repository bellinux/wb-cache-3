40|$|YesWe examine {{links between}} factual recall, emotion and constructions of normativity in {{narrative}} accounts, using as an empirical case President Clinton's descriptions of his <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky.</b> We analyse those accounts in the sequences of talk {{in which they}} occurred, under Grand Jury cross-examination. Clinton's accounts of Lewinsky were part of how he attended to issues alive in court concerning himself, including his possible exploitation and abuse of power in an asymmetrical relationship; his motives, sincerity, credibility and intentions; and, indirectly, his fitness for office as President. Analysis focuses on how Clinton's portrayal of Lewinsky accomplished a reflexive portrayal of himself, not as mendacious and exploitative, but as caring, responsible, sincere, rational and consistent, while reducing the scope and implications of their admitted sexual relationship.

I argue that since merely mentioning something can give rise to rumours and gossip, for example by asking a unwarranted question, and the questions about Lewinsky were unwarranted, it would have been (morally) permissible for Clinton to lie to the press regarding his affair with Monica Lewinsky...|$|E
