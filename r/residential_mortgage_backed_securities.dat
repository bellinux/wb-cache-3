40|$|AbstractThe {{underlying}} {{objective of}} the study is to testify that Shari’ah <b>residential</b> <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Backed</b> <b>Security</b> (MBS) performs better than conventional issued by Cagamas with the equal issuance year, rating grades and maturity period. As a preliminary case study of Cagamas, the comparative financial performance for both Shari’ah and conventional MBS is measured by key financial ratios in terms of profitability, capitalization and debt coverage for one year before, during the year and one year after its each issuance, and key performance indicators. Interestingly, the initiation of Shariah MBS has demonstrated cheaper financing costs to Cagamas as an originator and much better investment returns to investors. Therefore, the findings support past studies on benefits of conventional asset securitization and interestingly verifying that Shari’ah MBS performs better than its conventional MBS for equal originator, rating and tenure...|$|R

After returning to the US, Bass hired several private investigators to determine the ease of obtaining a mortgage. Bass spent a significant amount of time studying the residential mortgage market and performed research to identify which <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> (RMBS) composed of low-quality mortgages were most likely to default. This investment thesis was expressed by purchasing credit default swaps against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable, which essentially was a manner of shorting the bonds using synthetic instruments. After purchasing the positions for his flagship fund in 2006, Bass raised additional capital for a special fund dedicated exclusively to capitalizing on the opportunity that existed in the market place. Bass managed or advised over $4 billion of positions in subprime RMBS.|$|E

50|$|On March 23, 2009, Geithner {{announced}} a Public-Private Investment Program (P-PIP) to buy toxic assets from banks' balance sheets. The major stock market indexes in the United States rallied {{on the day}} of the announcement rising by over six percent with the shares of bank stocks leading the way. P-PIP has two primary programs. The Legacy Loans Program will attempt to buy residential loans from bank's balance sheets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will provide non-recourse loan guarantees for up to 85 percent of the purchase price of legacy loans. Private sector asset managers and the U.S. Treasury will provide the remaining assets. The second program is called the legacy securities program, which will buy <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> (RMBS) that were originally rated AAA and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS) which are rated AAA. The funds will come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's TARP monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). The initial size of the Public Private Investment Partnership is projected to be $500 billion. Economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman has been very critical of this program arguing the non-recourse loans lead to a hidden subsidy that will be split by asset managers, banks' shareholders and creditors. Banking analyst Meredith Whitney argues that banks will not sell bad assets at fair market values because they are reluctant to take asset write downs. Economist Linus Wilson, a frequent commenter on TARP related issues, also points to excessive misinformation and erroneous analysis surrounding the U.S. toxic asset auction plan. Removing toxic assets would also reduce the volatility of banks' stock prices. This lost volatility will hurt the stock price of distressed banks. Therefore, such banks will only sell toxic assets at above market prices.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the roots}} of the recent global {{financial}} crisis has been seen in the design of subprime mortgage contract leading to high sensitivity of such type of loans to house price changes. The market of subprime loans, especially in the last years preceding the crisis, has been highly financed by securitization. The paper investigates how borrowers with subprime characteristics influence the transmission mechanism of business cycles in the economy and whether the securitization of subprime loans has a positive effect on the economy. The formal setup is a DSGE model with different types of borrowers and banks acting as financial intermediaries, in which households and entrepreneurs borrow against housing collateral. The economy is subject to four shocks: monetary, inflationary, preference and technology. It is shown that alone the existence of subprime borrowers does not make the economy more responsive to different shocks at the aggregate level (it has only redistributional effects) and that under certain circumstances the securitization of subprime loans (in form of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities)</b> may lead to amplification of the business cycles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Our study {{examines}} {{two aspects of}} life insurers ’ exposure to the troubled <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> (RMBS) market. First, we develop and estimate a model that explains cross-sectional variation in RMBS exposure in terms of firm characteristics. We find that firms least likely to invest in RMBS tend to be small and to have high separate accounts ownership and large investments in common stocks and cash and short-term investments. Among firms that do invest in RMBS, publicly traded firms and those with a relatively high proportion of separate accounts assets have lower levels of RMBS exposure. We then estimate {{the effect of a}} change in RMBS risk ratings on insurer surplus via the asset valuation reserve. We find that, while there is a measurable exposure to RMBS, this exposure and its resulting effects on the asset valuation reserve are unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} most insurers ’ balance sheets. However, a dramatic downgrade of aggregate (residential plus commercial) mortgage backed securities could result in a decrease in surplus of almost 10 % for the largest U. S. life insurers. [Key words: mortgage backed securities, life insurance companies, asset valuation reserve. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical essays on securitization and the resolution of financial distress, examining the information content of prices of mortgage-backed securities, the role of securitization in preventing mortgage renegotiation {{and the effect of}} minimum bids in ascending price auctions of repossessed assets. In the first chapter, I present evidence that the prices at origination of <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> contain information {{on the quality of the}} underlying asset pools above what is reflected in the ratings. Yield spreads at issuance predict both future downgrades and defaults even after the information contained in ratings is taken into account. This holds for all rating classes except triple-A. Yield spreads of the highest rated securities have no predictive power for future performance. This suggests that investors in triple-A were less informed about the quality of the securitized assets than investors in riskier, more information sensitive securities. In the second chapter (co-authored with Kris Gerardi and Paul Willen), we show that securitization does not explain the reluctance among lenders to renegotiate home mortgages. We focus on seriously delinquent borrowers from 2005 through the third quarter of 200...|$|E
40|$|Our paper {{examines}} {{the reliability of}} ratings assigned to Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) by Credit Rating Agencies (CRA) and tries to define other factors, except ratings, that can influence the spreads on CMBS. The {{first part of the}} paper contains a general discussion about the CMBS market and about rating issues that are related to CMBSs. General assumptions and empirical conclusions about the reliability of ratings are drawn. A comparison between CMBS markets and <b>residential</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>backed</b> <b>securities</b> market is also provided. The second part of the paper contains models, data description and numerical analysis, which is created to prove empirical observations from our first part. Average spread model provides an insight about the general dynamics of spreads for differently rated securities. This model tries to define other general factors that can affect spreads. Regression models elaborate on the numerical results and try to test whether some other factors that are closely related to the issuance or collateral can potentially influence spreads. Conclusions for each of the models are provided in {{the end of the second}} part. The last part of the paper contains general conclusions based on the performed analysis.
