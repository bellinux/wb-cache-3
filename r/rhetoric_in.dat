5|$|As a child, Modi {{helped his}} father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and later ran a tea stall {{with his brother}} near a bus terminus. Modi {{completed}} his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, {{with an interest in}} theatre. Modi had an early gift for <b>rhetoric</b> <b>in</b> debates, and this was noted by his teachers and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.|$|E
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>in</b> the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|In other respects, {{individual}} countries had different preferences for styles of memorial. French communities usually chose simple monuments, located in public spaces, and deliberately avoided political or religious imagery and <b>rhetoric.</b> <b>In</b> Australia and the US, memorial halls – {{some of which}} were large, grand structures – were popular. Australia also created the idea of an Avenue of Honour, involving lines of trees, with memorial plaques, along a road. Canadians often brought back various material from Europe for their memorials, including pieces of local European churches and soil from the relevant battlefields. Individual countries also had typical national symbols that were widely incorporated, from the British Britannia, to the Gallic rooster to the Romanian vulture. Postcards of war memorials were widely produced in Britain and Italy, and ceramic models of the more famous ones, such as the Cenotaph, were sold as souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his <b>rhetoric</b> <b>in</b> favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration <b>rhetoric.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats). In the 1995 presidential election, Le Pen rose slightly to 15% of the vote.|$|E

25|$|There are {{technical}} and cultural aspects to the producing maps. In this sense, maps are biased.

25|$|However, most {{religious}} systems acknowledge {{an afterlife}} and improving this {{is seen as}} an even more basic good.

25|$|As in Italy, wages {{were set}} by the state in {{negotiations}} between officially recognized workers' syndicates and employers' organizations, with the state as mediator. During the Spanish Republic, workers' groups had aligned with the communists, anarchists or other republican forces. Franco's regime, however, tended to favour the interests of large businesses, despite its syndicalist <b>rhetoric.</b> <b>In</b> response, workers created illegal syndicates and organized strikes, which usually were repressed brutally by Franco's police state.|$|E

25|$|Venus is {{the planet}} of Friday. In {{languages}} deriving from Latin, such as Romanian, Spanish, French, and Italian, {{the word for}} Friday often resembles the word Venus (vineri, viernes, vendredi and venerdì respectively).
