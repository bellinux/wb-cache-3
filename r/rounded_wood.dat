Orthodox Christians stand throughout the long divine services, rather than sit or kneel, though some seating is provided for the elderly and infirm. Whereas Greek monks will tend to lean in their stalls during the services, Russian monks usually stand upright.|$|E
40|$|After the {{collapse}} of the centralized Soeharto regime, deforestation caused by over logging accelerated. To tackle this problem, an IMF/World Bank-led forestry sector reform program adopted a market-friendly approach involving the resumption of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> exports and raising of the resource rent fee, with the aim to stop rent accumulation by plywood companies, which had enjoyed a supply of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> at privileged prices. The Indonesian government, for its part, decentralized the forest concession management system to provide incentives for local governments and communities to carry out sustainable forest management. However, neither policy reform worked effectively. The <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> export ban was reimposed and the forest management system centralized again with cooperation from a newly funded industry led institution. In the midst of the confusion surrounding the policy reversal, the gap between the price of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> in international and domestic markets failed to contract, although rent allocations to plywood industries were reduced during 1998 2003. The rents were not collected properly by the government, but accumulated unexpectedly in the hands of players in the black market for <b>round</b> <b>wood...</b>|$|R

The main working method of upper diameter (STB 1667 - 2012, GOST 2708 – 75) was researched (in comparison with the control data of formulas Smaliana and a truncated cone). An analysis of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 in comparison with control data showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in standard volumes (GOST 2708 – 75) (up to 13 % for medium-sized (24 cm) and large (over 24 cm) <b>round</b> <b>wood).</b> However, for logs with taper coefficient more than 1 cm/m) negative deviations are characterized, which, in turn, suggests an underestimation of wood volume in the standard tables {{in relation to the}} control data of formulas Smaliana and truncated cone (– 18 %). Formula Smaliana versus frustoconical formula underestimates the timber volume (however, not more than 1 %). Obviously, both of these formulas can be used to determine the amount of measurement errors by the method of upper diameter. In our view, it is advisable to clarify the method of upper diameter based on the average value of taper coefficient in stacked batches of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> (entering of amendments to the volumes from GOST 2708 – 75 on a log taper coefficient of real value) ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the twenty-first}} century the price of forest land in Sweden has {{increased}} heavily. Buying forest land has become more common and the stakeholders have grown in number. The countries around Sweden have through the globalization become connected in the market of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> and wood products. The price of forest land and <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> are also close connected. The goal with this report {{is to make a}} comparison of forest land prices between Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Estonia and Latvia and to see how the prices have developed in the period 2000 - 2011. The prime factor in the comparison, except the direct price difference between the countries, is the <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> prices. The <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> prices give information about the economic situation in the countries and {{play an important role in}} the return on the forest land. The prices of forest land shifts heavily between the countries. Denmark has the highest prices followed by Sweden and Finland. Lower prices are found in Norway, Estonia and Latvia. Norway has a strict legislation that keeps the prices on low levels. Many factors are involved in the price of forest land and only a few of them are analyzed in this report. The non-monetary values have become increasingly higher and are one contributing factor to the big price difference among the countries...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the Swedish forest {{products}} sec-tor have resulted in increased <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> consumption per mill. Increased consumption volumes result in in-creased <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> transport distances and transport output (m·km). At the same time, the coordination of trans-port services is being taken over by transport organiza-tions of increasing size. New technological developments combined with organizational innovations have made link-ing between transport service providers easier. This has lead to the opportunity to offer different services through networking and diversify service levels for different cus-tomers (service divergence). This study examines the service divergence potential of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> transport in Sweden. The goal {{of the study is}} to develop a better understanding of customer demands and service complexity. This study is based on the inter-view results of 20 transport service providers and buyers in the Swedish forest sector. The results presented con-cern three main themes: transport service goals, decisions and decision support processes. The study reports the rankings of responses as well as their correlations in order to group them into a goal-decision-decision support hier-archy. The rankings and correlations are used to suggest a customer service matrix for <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> transport. The interview also included a fourth theme describing current problems with planning and control. The responses of this final theme are related to the different parts of the hierarchy in order to identify impediments to service di-vergence...|$|R

40|$|In this bachelor’s thesis, {{a general}} {{description}} about {{the construction of}} skeletal structures out of roundwood is introduced. This method of construction involves buildings built from cross section uncut logs, as found in nature. Included in the thesis are types of wood, their characteristics, and ways of using them. <b>Round</b> <b>wood</b> has many advantages in comparison to sawn wood, such as a lower environmental impact, greater bearing strength, durability and aesthetics. The weaknesses of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> include its geometrical irregularity, lack of planning regulations and also people’s fear of such buildings collapsing. Further description includes the capacity of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> {{in comparison to the}} sawn type, description of carpenter tools and the construction itself. Three buildings are described as examples of log skeletal constructions, one located in Slovenia and two in England and Scotland. The main intention of this research is to highlight this field of wood construction which, in Slovenia, isn’t sufficiently developed, according to author’s opinion. Among the sources used were interviews with builders, experienced in these types of constructions, as well as the author’s own knowledge of the subject, technical articles in journals and monographs...|$|R

An analysis of <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 {{in comparison with the}} Lithuanian volume tables showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in “Lithuanian” volumes (up to 10 % for butt and middle logs and 15 % – for top logs, although for butt logs over 70 cm diameter the differences in their volumes are around 2 % only). The main working method of upper diameter (STB 1667 - 2012, GOST 2708 – 75) was researched. 194 logs in 6 stacked batches were measured (diameters at both ends of a log (twice, rounding to 0. 1 cm), and length (0. 1 m)). The greatest deviations have been received when logs with increased taper coefficient (1 – 2 cm/m) are inventoried (– 14. 5 % according to the formula of the “end cross-sections” (SmalIana) and – 13. 1 % – using formula of “truncated cone”).

40|$|During {{the recent}} years {{the total cost of}} <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> for the Finnish forest {{industry}} has been in the order of US 1. 5 billion annually. The share of stumpage price represents roughly one half whereas harvesting, transportation etc. account for the rest. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate long term equilibrium prices for wood (and thereby total <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> costs) under various conditions of world market of wood products. In the first part of this paper a (discrete time) dynamic linear model for the forest sector is discussed. The steady state version of it is analyzed in more detail. An application of the steady state forestry model is carried out for the Finnish forests. As a result, alternative sustained yield solutions for the Finnish forests are obtained. In the analysis of the second part, a steady state sectoral model is adopted to carry out a Stackelberg equilibrium analysis for the <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> market. Further elaboration appeared necessary until the steady state model became suitable for this game theoretic analysis. This elaboration involves definitions of objective functions of the key parties (the forestry and the industry) in the forest sector game.

40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and slide caliper. Bark gauge gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring. Both two methods gave the closest results to real values while our tests and it is very simple to use this instrument...|$|R

However, large variations are observed between different purchas-ers, in their usage of the plans. The purpose of this report is to identify to what extent a forest management plan can promote an increase in the amount of <b>wood</b> which a <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> purchaser can obtain and to find differences in the way of using the plans between different wood purchasers. Furthermore, the purpose is also to ana-lyse if varying owner structures can be underlie variations in the selling of forest {{management plans}}. Qualitative interviews with nine of Stora Enso’s <b>round</b> <b>wood</b> purchasers were performed. The interviews was recorded and put together in a docum-ent for further analysis. The conclusion of the interviews is that forest management plans has been {{and will continue to be}} a powerful tool in wood supplying business.

The result in the report shows that private forest owners who have bought forest management plans from Stora Enso are generally considered to be a stable and important group of wood suppliers.
