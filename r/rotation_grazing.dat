40|$|Short-duration <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> was {{compared}} with deferred grazing in a 3 -year experiment at ICRISAT, Niger. Short-duration grazing used a mixed herd (2 steers, 4 sheep and 4 goats) and cycles of 15 - 21 {{days in the}} wet season and 91 days in the dry season. Wet season grazing compared high (83 - 126 kg W/ha) and moderate (35 - 37 kg W/ha) stocking rates. In the second grazing system, the paddocks were ungrazed in the wet season and grazed in the dry season in 2 cycles of 91 days with a herd {{twice as large as}} in short-duration <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing,</b> such that overall stocking rates in the 2 systems were similar. Herbage yields were related to annual rainfall, with grazing having limited effect on yield. In 1996, herbage production under short-duration <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> was greater than under protection (+ 31 percent) or deferred grazing (+ 9 percent), but this was reversed with poor rains in 1997. Range condition in 1996 showed that moderate stocking rate favours grasses over dicots and results in more palatable herbage. Continuous grazing at high stocking rate promoted unpalatable dicots and a few poorly palatable grasses. From 1997 to 1998, grasses declined dramatically in all treatments, with unpalatable dicots exceeding 70 percent...|$|E

Four livestock grazing treatments were studied: High Intensity Low Frequency, rotation, moderate continuous and non-grazing. A combination of cattle and goats were utilized in each treatment. Two vegetation types and bare ground were also studied: Chloris roxbughiana, Grewia bicolor and bare ground (unvegetated). The study objectives were to determine 1. the influences of High Intensity Low Frequency (HILF), <b>Rotation</b> <b>Grazing</b> (RG), Moderate Continuous Grazing (MCG) and livestock exclosure(EXC) on infiltration rates and sediment production, 2. the influence of Grewia bicolor, Chloris roxburghiane and bare ground on infiltration rates and sediment production, 4. interrelationships of plant standing crop and cover, soil bulk density, organic matter, soil moisture content, texture, aggregate stability and micro relief with infiltration rates and sediment production. Infiltration rates were consistently greater in vegetated plots than unvegetated plots. However, in the vegetated plots there was significant difference between the two vegetation types. Infiltration rates were greater under Grewia bicolor than in Chloris roxburghiana. Sediment production was greater from unvegetated plots than from vegetated plots. The EXC had the greatest infiltration rate, although it was not significantly different from High Intensity Low Frequency before grazing (HILFI), <b>Rotation</b> <b>Grazing</b> before grazing (RG 1) and <b>Rotation</b> <b>Grazing</b> after grazing (RG 2). The MCG pasture infiltration rates were less than other pastures although they were not significantly greater than RG pastures. During August the greatest sediment production occurred from MCG pastures although it was not significantly greater than RG pastures.

The residual N effect was estimated in a dairy crop rotation (spring barley undersown with grass-clover, 1 st and 2 nd year ley, spring barley/pea undersown with ryegrass, oats undersown with ryegrass and fodder beets) with different management (grazed/cut) and manure type (slurry/deep litter) by anaerobic incubation and plant N-uptake in a pot experiment and in the field. For comparison a 10 -year-old grass-clover was included. Type of animal manure did not affect the residual N effect. Crop <b>rotations</b> with <b>grazed</b> grassland had a residual effect that on average was 13 % higher than the same <b>rotation</b> without <b>grazing.</b> Ploughing of grasslands clearly increased residual N effects for several years, but grassland age at ploughing was of little importance. Thus, the residual effect of 10 -year-old grass-clover ley only marginally exceeded that of undersown grass-clover despite considerable difference in estimated accumulated N-surplus. The results indicate that organic N is easier to mineralise the more recently it has been formed.

40|$|Grazing is {{commonly}} used in conservation to promote biodiversity, but {{the search for a}} grazing management regime that optimises biodiversity is still ongoing. <b>Rotation</b> <b>grazing,</b> where grazing is followed by a relatively long period of non-grazing, is a relative new tool in conservation management, and empirical studies on its effects on biodiversity are scarce. In this study, we tested for the effects of this <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> on vegetation in comparison with more traditional regimes. We used a grazing experiment on the salt marsh of Noord-Friesland Buitendijks, The Netherlands, where we determined the effect of three rotation cycles (6 years; one year summer grazing with 1 cattle ha(- 1) alternated with an ungrazed year) on species richness, temporal turnover and composition in comparison with more traditional regimes of summer grazing with horses and cattle at two densities (0. 5 and 1 animal ha(- 1)) : We also determined the change in cover of two species of specific concern, Aster tripolium (an important host plant for pollinators) and Elytrigia atherica (an invasive dominant species). After six years, species richness increased in all grazing regimes, but less in rotation than in grazing with 1 horse or 1 cattle ha(- 1). Species turnover was similar across all grazing regimes. Species composition in rotation differed from compositions in 1 cattle and 1 horse ha(- 1). The increase in cover of A. tripolium was lower under rotation than grazing with 0. 5 cattle ha(- 1), but not different to the other regimes. Change in cover of E. atherica did not significantly differ across regimes, and showed a trend of increase in the ungrazed regime only. Hence, we found that the effects of <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> on vegetation are relatively similar to the grazing regimes with cattle or horses in low densities. The implementation of this rotation regime over the more traditional regimes remains to be decided by the conservation body, depending on its applicability in terms of available grazing areas and livestock, as well as overall conservation goals...|$|E
30|$|Flexibility and {{mobility}} were {{key components of}} nomadic pastoral systems and are supported {{in the literature on}} the premise that grazing pressure must vary to match spatially and temporally varied rainfall and forage production (Behnke et al.

Towards Sustainable Use neither directly challenges nor offers alternatives to Chinese state policies that restrict mobility while providing production goals and inflexible stocking rates, however. Suggestions to initiate rest <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> systems (e.g. p. 68) ignore the fact that little quantitative support for this practice exists in the literature (Briske et al. [2011]).

The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the effectiveness of an early catch crop in reducing nitrogen leaching from coarse sandy soil. Barley as a green crop for silage was undersown with Italian ryegrass in spring and harvested at the beginning of early heading, and the Italian ryegrass was subsequently used for roughage production in autumn. Material and methods Experiments were established in spring 2003 on a commercial organic farm with a coarse sandy soil. Two fields with grass-clover were ploughed. One field, a 3 -year-old grass-clover, had formed part of a crop rotation dominated by cereals, and the other, a 5 -year-old grass-clover, was part of a grass-intensive <b>rotation</b> <b>grazed</b> by dairy cows. After ploughing the grass-clover, the following treatments were established in each of the two fields: 1) spring barley, harvested at maturity and subjected to mechanical weed control in autumn (“Mature”) and 2) spring barley harvested early as a green crop for silage with an undersown catch crop of Italian ryegrass (“Green”), which was mowed twice in autumn. The treatments were fertilized with 0, 60 or 120 kg ammonium-N ha- 1 in cattle slurry, injected in the spring following ploughing. The resultant treatments are called: Mature- 0 N, Mature- 60 N, Mature- 120 N, Green- 0 N, Green- 60 N and Green- 120 N. Leaching of nitrogen (nitrate and total-N) was measured from May 2003 to May 2004 by means of ceramic suction cups installed in treatments fertilized with 0 or 120 kg ammonium-N ha- 1.

The grazing season lasted from June 20 to October 10 of each year. Cows equipped with esophageal fistulas were used to evaluate diet quality and diet botanical composition. Yearling heifers were used to evaluate livestock performance. The weight estimate method combined with a double sampling technique was used to estimate forage production. Utilization estimates were made by employing {{the use of the}} ocular-estimate-by-average-of- plants method. Grass was the most important forage class in cattle diets among the three systems. Grasses made up 67. 7 percent of cattle diets on the season-long and rest-rotation grazing systems when data were pooled across systems, periods, and years. Forbs and shrubs contributed 19. 7 percent and 11. 6 percent of the diet, respectively. Area collected and vegetation structure appear to influence the percent by weight of important species found in the diets of cattle among the systems. More grasses were consumed in the season-long system during early summer of 1979 than in the rest-rotation grazing system. Forb consumption decreased from 32. 0 percent by weight to 8. 1 percent as the grazing season advanced. Shrub consumption totalled only 13. 4 and 17. 5 percent during early summer and late summer, respectively. Crude protein, acid detergent fiber, lignin, and cellulose values of diet samples were not significantly different among the systems when data were pooled across years and periods. Although values for in vitro dry matter digestibility were different among the three systems, differences were not great enough to change animal performance. Livestock performance data trends were very consistent with diet quality data trends. However, livestock performance was significantly different among the grazing systems when data were pooled across years and periods even though there was little difference in diet quality among the systems. Average daily gains were 0. 51, 0. 61 and 0. 65 kg for the rest-rotation, season-long, and deferred <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> systems. Animals gained significantly more in deferred rotation than in the other two systems. Cattle gained significantly less in rest-rotation than cattle in season-long when data were pooled over years and periods. When spring rainfall was highest in 1980, production was greatest.

The study area was a shrubland mainly consisting of Quercus coccifera and data were collected from two fenced neighboring areas (5000 m 2 each one), from which the first was protected against grazing while the second one was grazed every 3 weeks, with a <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> system and where 20 plants of Quercus coccifera (10 in each area) with fully expanded mature leaves were randomly selected. In the above plants of two treatments, the hydrodynamic (leaf water potential, osmotic potential, turgor pressure), physiological (stomatal conductance) and growth parameters (total and leaves production, leaf area, leaf area index, specific leaf area, specific leaf weight, relative growth rate) were measured by helping scientific equipment or calculated using the suitable formulas during the growing season. The results indicated that the grazed plants of Quercus coccifera showed higher stomatal conductance than ungrazed during the drought period, thought they maintained higher relative water content at the same values of water potential and their leaves were youthful and tender. Also, powerhouse phenotypical plasticity, mechanism of counter weighting relating weight and area of leaves, high index of resistance to grazing, function of homeostasis and causal nexus between water potential - leaf area index - production occurred in kermes oak canopy.

Field testing using 1997 and 1998 data from Logan, Utah showed that the model accurately simulates both orchardgrass and orchardgrass-alfalfa mixture. ^ Sensitivity analysis of the GRASIM model was conducted to investigate the impact of model parameters and initial conditions on output using data from State College, Pennsylvania in 1993 and Bekaa Valley, Lebanon in 1998. Results indicate that the model performs consistently over the two locations with the different base values. The standing biomass is sensitive to photosynthetic fraction partitioned to shoot, leaf photosynthetic efficiency, extinction coefficient, specific leaf area, maximum specific growth rate, soil bulk density, available water, water content at 15 bar, rainfall, temperature, nitrogen mineralization rate, and initial water and nitrogen levels in soil. Nitrogen leaching from top soil layer is sensitive to bulk density, available soil water, mineralization and nitrification rate, leaching coefficient, initial water and nitrogen levels, rainfall, and temperature. ^ The new model developed from APEX and GRASIM is capable of simulating pastureland and rangeland systems with watershed analysis capabilities at a farm or small watershed level. The model evaluates various management strategies essential for economical and environmental sustainability such as crop <b>rotation,</b> <b>grazing</b> management, manure handling, fertilization, irrigation, and sustainable landscape design in a continuous mode over several years using actual or generated weather.

Thus, herbivores must make foraging decisions in complex environments which will affect their intake of both nutrients and parasites. However, the pattern of forage and faecal resources in agricultural environments will also be affected by the grazing management system in place. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of grazing management on the risk of infection/infestation to livestock. We used a spatially explicit individual based stochastic foraging model to simulate livestock contact (both grazing and investigative) with faeces in the environment. The model was parameterised to simulate cattle grazing under three types of grazing management: set stock (i. e. where sward growth and cattle intake are in equilibrium in a single field); a two pasture <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> system with increasing number of rotations; and a rotational grazing system with two rotations and increasing subdivisions of the pasture. Overall the amount of cattle contact with faecal-contaminated patches was similar in both set stocking and rotational grazing scenarios, suggesting no difference in the risk of infection or infestation between the different systems. However, the timing and absolute amounts of peak contact varied greatly indicating that different grazing management systems expose livestock to risks of different types of parasites at different times of the grazing season. Intensive rotational systems with small pasture blocks (especially the first grazing period) maximised livestock contact with fresh faeces, and thus exposure to microparasites (e. g. bacterial pathogens). Livestock reentering pasture blocks in rotational systems and set stocked livestock had the highest contact with old faeces and thus have a greater risk of macroparasite transmission (gastrointestinal nematodes). This study highlights how livestock management affects the highly dynamic interaction between livestock and distributions of parasites in the environment and thus the levels of livestock exposure to parasites and pathogens viathe faecal–oral route...|$|E
40|$|In Somalia, camel (Camelus dromedarius) {{survivability}} {{and milk}} production has been {{higher than for}} other domestic livestock and contributes substantially to the subsistence of Somali pastoralists. The objective {{of this research was}} to study management, foraging behavior and nutrition of camels in their natural habitat to determine how production continues under seasonal nutritional stress. Management systems of Ceeldheer pastoralists are based on available natural pasture and water. The natural <b>rotation</b> <b>grazing</b> system maintained an ecological equilibrium in the District. Pastoralists manipulate their herds to suit existing environmental conditions, family needs and labor availability for herding. In herd management, control of breeding males and preferential treatment to increase the female component of the herd are geared to secure continuous milk supply for the family. Camels were watered only in the dry seasons. They foraged continuously throughout the day the first few days after watering, but foraged mostly in the morning and evening as watering days approached. The quantity of water camels consumed in summer and winter dry seasons were similar. In winter, milking camels foraged more, travelled shorter distance and rested less than dry ones. In fall, 1986, and spring, 1987, lactating camels spent less time foraging than non-milking animals. Foraging time was the same for both groups in summer 1986, 1987 and fall, 1987. Camels spent more time chewing bones in summer of 1986 in Xarar foraging area than other seasons. Low or high relative humidity together with hot temperature apparently reduced foraging time, increased rumination and idling times in winter and spring seasons. As forage availability declined, camels ingested a broader array of dietary items in the dry seasons and consumed large amounts of herbaceous plants. The diets of milking and dry camels were similar. Lactating camels consumed more green forage than dry camels in the dry seasons. Shrubs and trees comprised major components of the diets (80. 9 %). Physical structures of plant species did not prevent feeding on the plants. Camel diets were rich in crude protein (cp), calcium (Ca), potassiuim and sodium. Phosphorus (P) was deficient. Ca:P ratios were extremely low. Neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin were high. CP intake seemed adequate year round assuming camel protein requirements are similar to other livestock requirements. Digestible energy was deficient in dry seasons. Low energy intake, inadequate phosphorous availability and water deprivation were probably responsible for the weight loss of camels as the dry season progressed...|$|E
40|$|Grazing {{and burning}} are {{commonly}} applied practices that can impact {{the diversity and}} biomass of wetland plant communities. We evaluated the vegetative response of wetlands and adjacent upland grasslands to four treatment regimes (continuous idle, fall prescribed burning followed by idle, annual fall cattle <b>grazing,</b> and <b>rotation</b> of summer <b>grazing</b> and idle) commonly used by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study area was Grays Lake, a large, montane wetland in southeastern Idaho that is bordered by extensive wet meadows. We identified seven plant cover types, representing the transition from dry meadow to deep wetland habitats: mixed deep marsh, spikerush slough, Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), moist meadow, alkali, mesic meadow, and dry meadow. We compared changes in community composition and total aboveground biomass of each plant cover type between 1998, when all units had been idled for three years, and 1999 (1 yr post-treatment) and 2000 (2 yr post-treatment). Analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated that compositional changes varied among cover types, treatments, and years following treatment. Treatment-related changes in community composition were greatest in mixed deep marsh, Baltic rush, and mesic meadow. In mixed deep marsh and Baltic rush, grazing and associated trampling contributed {{to changes in the}} plant community toward more open water and aquatic species and lower dominance of Baltic rush; grazing and trampling also seemed to contribute to increased cover in mesic meadow. Changing hydrological conditions, from multiple years of high water to increasing drought, was an important factor influencing community composition and may have interacted with management treatments. Biomass differed among treatments and between years within cover types. In the wettest cover types, fall burning and <b>grazing</b> <b>rotation</b> treatments had greater negative impact on biomass than the idle treatment, but in drier cover types, summer grazing stimulated biomass production. Our results illustrate the spatial and temporal complexity of the transition between dry meadow and wetland habitats, and variable interactions among plant communities, treatments, and annual wetland conditions...|$|R
40|$|Expanding {{dairy farming}} {{around the world}} {{including}} the Canterbury region of New Zealand is causing increasing demand for irrigation, placing more pressure on already stressed water resources. The challenge for New Zealand dairy farming is to maintain an appropriate equilibrium between pasture production and environment protection, achievable through the proper management/utilization of agricultural water, for which application and expansion of carefully identified and evaluated irrigation scheduling can play a key role. The focus of this research was, therefore, {{to contribute to the}} development of irrigation scheduling to determine the irrigation range within the soil water holding capacity taking into consideration precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), plant available water (PAW) and crop coefficient (Kc). This was achieved through estimating Kc of pasture at different <b>grazing</b> <b>rotations</b> by field measurements and analysing irrigation and deep percolation under a range of PAW-based irrigation triggers by applications of mathematical modelling of irrigation scheduling. A farmers’ survey has been carried out with 32 dairy farmers in Canterbury, New Zealand to collect information on current irrigation practices, particularly in relation to PAW and <b>grazing</b> <b>rotation.</b> The experiments were conducted at Lincoln University Dairy Fram (LUDF), South Island, New Zealand during the period August 2014 to March 2016. A network of 20 non-weighing lysimeters and an Aquaflex installed on LUDF were utilized for the study. Pasture height, precipitation, irrigation application, deep percolation and change in soil moisture in the lysimeters were measured throughout the study period. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes with 200, 500 and 900 mm lengths were installed vertically adjacent to the Aquaflex and lysimeters for improving soil moisture determination in the lysimeters without disturbing natural water flux inside the lysimeters. To account for climatic variability, available 16 years of climatic data were collected from Broadfield weather station. Irrigation and deep percolation have been estimated using two soil-plant-atmosphere mathematical models (IrriCalc and CropWat 8) under a range of irrigation management strategies, including those identified in the farmers’ survey, and commonly applied crop coefficient values in addition to those estimated in this research. Based on reference and actual evapotranspiration, Kc of pasture was estimated for different <b>grazing</b> <b>rotations.</b> Analysing the relationship between Kc and crop canopy represented by pasture’s height (h in cm) showed that a linear fit simulates well this process. Aquaflex soil moisture (SM) readings resulted in a value of 0. 43 for the coefficient of determination (R 2) for the Kc – h relationship, which increased to 0. 66 when Aquaflex SM measurements were adjusted for each lysimeter using corresponding TDR readings. This signifies the importance of accurate soil moisture determination to improve irrigation planning. The estimated values of Kc just after and before grazing were 0. 6 and 1. 0 for corresponding pasture heights of 10 cm and 30 cm. Average Kc for one <b>grazing</b> <b>rotation</b> was estimated at 0. 7. This implies conventional irrigation planning with a constant pasture crop coefficient of 1. 0 would provide “on average” 30 % more water compared to the actual water demand of pasture under grazing condition. This significant amount of water saving can contribute to conserve water and reduce leaching of nutrients. During the shoulder seasons (September – October and March – May) current irrigation strategy leaves sufficient space for potential rain. However, during the peak irrigation season (November - February), the majority of farmers apply irrigation to fill soil up to 100 % of the Field Capacity (FC), which is prone to cause deep percolation if rainfall follows an irrigation event. Analysis of the irrigation and deep percolation predicted for 14 irrigation seasons indicated that a minimum soil moisture level to start irrigation at 55 and 60 % of PAW, respectively on the shoulder and peak irrigation seasons, and stopping irrigation correspondingly at 80 and 90 % of PAW were optimal for this case study. This would allow for rainfall harvesting and thus, reduce net irrigation requirement and deep percolation losses. These results will make important contributions towards improving irrigation scheduling. Such irrigation scheduling can serve as soft adaptor to cope with weather uncertainty. The proposed irrigation scheduling contributes to agricultural water management, eventually supporting the sustainable development of dairy farming industries in New Zealand and around the world. In addition, it would also decrease water pollution by reducing nutrient leaching from pastoral farms to water resources...|$|R
40|$|Western Canadian grain {{producers}} are considering diversifying from crop production and including forages in their rotations for hay production or livestock grazing. The {{addition of a}} livestock enterprise can stabilize farm income as returns from livestock are negative or weakly positively correlated with grain and oilseed returns. This study showed {{a high degree of}} risk and variability of revenue associated with the addition of forages to a crop <b>rotation</b> for livestock <b>grazing,</b> relative to hay production at the scale of this study. Revenue from grazed alfalfa exceeded that for hay production but costs were also higher. Sources of risk include cattle deaths and costs related to animal care. The choice between cattle or hay production should be based on an analysis of the uncertainty related to forage production, management of animal health, and contracted prices; and long-term fixed infrastructure costs such as fencing or watering systems...|$|R
