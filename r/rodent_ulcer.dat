Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E

[...] "There was a famous beauty in London Society--I mention no names--who used to be {{remarkable}} a few seasons ago for the very low dresses which she would wear. She had the whitest of skins, and most beautiful of shoulders, so it was no wonder. Then gradually the frilling at her neck lapped upwards and upwards, until last year she astonished every one by wearing quite a high collar {{at a time when it}} was completely out of fashion. Well, one day this very woman was shown into my consulting-room. When the footman was gone she suddenly tore off the upper part of her dress. 'For God's sake do something for me!' she cried. Then I saw what the trouble was. A <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer</b> was eating its way upwards, coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of it was flush with her collar. The red streak of its trail was lost below the line of her bust. Year by year it had ascended and she had heightened her dress to hide it, until now it was about to invade her face. She had been too proud to confess her trouble, even to a medical man." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rodent</b> <b>ulcer</b> (also {{known as}} a [...] "Jacob's ulcer") is a large skin lesion of nodular basal-cell {{carcinoma}} with central necrosis. Almost all cancers can metastasize except glioma (maligancy of the central nervous system) and the <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Basic {{theoretical}} bases As {{a chronic}} wound {{is called a}} secondarily healing wound which despite adequate therapy does not tend to heal {{for a period of}} 6 - 9 weeks. The cause of the chronic wound occurrence and its transformation into an acute wound can be infection, influence of associated diseases, skin top layer microtraumatization or skin necrosis cavity. Among the most frequent types of chronic wounds there are aligned venous ulcerations, arterial <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcers,</b> decubitus <b>ulcers</b> and neuropathic <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcers</b> as a consequence of diabetes mellitus disease. Knowledge about wound healing has been deepened considerably in the last few years. The pharmaceutical industry introduces to the market continuously new means of phase wound healing and owing to new trends the classical treatment has nearly disappeared. Essay targets 1. To monitor nurse knowledge about new trends in chronic wound healing. 2. To determine what means of draping and bandaging materials are used in chronic wound treatment in practice and what means appear to be the most effective. 3. To find out if in practical terms there are conditions for nurses to use new trends in chronic wound healing and what constraints they meet in their endeavour to apply these trends. 4. To learn if patients with a non-healing wound are informed about new trends in chronic wound healing. 5. To learn if new trends in chronic wound healing are available for affected patients and in what extent they are used by them. 6. To determine if new trends in chronic wound healing improve life quality of patients with chronic wounds. Used methods The empirical part of the diploma work was processed with a tool of qualitative research inquiry. For data acquisition I chose the technique of semi-structured interview with respondents. For research inquiry I selected two groups of respondents. The first group of respondents was comprised of 10 nurses employed in Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s. and in the other group there were 5 patients hospitalized in this facility. The interview findings were analysed and divided into categories. For clear arrangement there were created schemes to individual categories in XMind programme. The schemes are supplied with commentary and several quotations of the respondents. Findings From interview analyses it is clear that there is a certain influence of individuality. In the first part there is monitored nurse knowledge about modern trends in chronic wound healing. The conclusion of the research is that in all sections where interviewed nurses work chronic wounds are treated by the way of wet (phase) healing. I also found out that there are several therapeutic and draping materials suitable for all phases of chronic wound healing. There are also described a few practical problems which make effective care about chronic wounds difficult. In the second part there are mentioned particular defects in patient acquaintance with modern methods in wound healing and insufficient education by medical staff. There are also described all problems which deteriorate life quality of patients with chronic wounds. Conclusion The chronic wound healing methods have changed completely in the last few years. Pharmaceutical firms introduce to the market a lot of new materials facilitating very effective and comfortable care about wounds. However, this fact requires continuous education of medical staff participating in the chronic wound treatment. This brings positive results and finally decreases economic costs of care about patients with chronic wounds...|$|R

50|$|Within a few months, {{scientific}} journals were swamped with {{accounts of the}} successful treatment {{of different types of}} skin tissue malignancies with x-rays. In Sweden, Thor Stenbeck published results of the first successful treatments of <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer</b> and epithelioma in 1899, later that year confirmed by Tage Sjögren. Soon afterwards, their findings were confirmed by a number of other physicians.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{radiation}} therapy or radiotherapy {{can be traced}} back to experiments made soon after the discovery of x-rays (1895), when it was shown that exposure to radiation produced cutaneous burns. Influenced by electrotherapy and escharotics — the medical application of caustic substances — doctors began using radiation to treat growths and lesions produced by diseases such as lupus, <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer,</b> and epithelioma. Radiation was generally believed to have bactericidal properties, so when radium was discovered, in addition to treatments similar to those used with x-rays, it was also used as an additive to medical treatments for diseases such as tuberculosis where there were resistant bacilli.|$|E

40|$|Although rodent ulcers are a {{relatively}} common malignant {{condition of the}} skin, pulmonary metastases arising from them are extremely rare. There have so far been only 29 authenticated reports of this condition. A further case is described of a man who, {{at the age of}} 35, developed a <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer</b> (typical basal-cell carcinoma) on the forehead. Despite local excisions, skin grafting, and radiotherapy, the ulcer continued to recur, although there was no spread to regional lymph nodes. When he was aged 52, he developed widespread bilateral pulmonary lesions and a right pleural effusion. Thoracotomy provided a lung biopsy which showed the typical histological appearance of basal-cell carcinoma. He died aged 54, 19 years after the onset of the <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer,</b> and necropsy confirmed that the pulmonary lesions were bloodborne metastases of basal-cell carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|THIs {{communication}} is an enquiry into {{the incidence of}} secondary malignant disease of bone in relation to primary tumour, its frequency at various sites and its treatment with special reference to (a) pathological fractures and their treatment and (b) paraplegia, its treatment and prognosis. The material used comprised all cases of malignant disease with bone metastases seen during the fifteen-year period covering the years 1945 to 1959 inclusive at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, and followed {{up to the end}} of 1960. During this period 24, 051 cases of malignant disease, excluding <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer,</b> were seen. It was accepted that <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer</b> (basal cell carcinoma) did not metastasise. An arbitary period of one year after the last case in the series was first seen was chosen as the completion date for the collection of the bone metastases. The longer this follow-up period, the greater the number of metastases of all kinds which would accumulate, and it was felt that the end of 1960 was a convenient point at which to terminate the enquiry. In all, the records of 1, 967 patients with bone metastases were collected from 16, 239 of the patients who died during the time under survey. In addition, 34 patients were alive at the end of 1960 with known bone metastasis.

40|$|AN Anglo-Indian woman, aged 58 years, {{suffering}} from turban tumour (cylindroma) had many large tumours {{on the body}} {{as well as the}} scalp. All the larger tumours were excised surgically and skin grafts were applied to the head where surgical " scalping " down to the pericranium was necessary to remove the turban tumour. The histology of these benign basal celled epidermal growths is similar to benign epithelioma adenoides cysticum (Brooke's disease) and to the malignant basal celled epithelioma (<b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer).</b> The epidermis is little changed except by stretching over the tumour. In the dermis there are spherical, oval or irregular masses of cells. The cells are round or oval and take up the basophil stain readily, especially the nuclei. Within the cell masses are areas of pink staining hyalinelike material giving the appearance of cysts as in epithelioma adenoides cysticum. At the periphery of the cell masses the cells are arranged in a pallisade manner and stain rather more deeply than those in the centre, this is also seen in the malignant basal celled epithelioma and in Brooke's disease.

The use of rice mills instead of the primitive hand-pounding method, by which only the husk was removed, and the decreased consumption of millet in urban areas have caused a high incidence of B-complex deficiency among rice-eating Indians. The white bread produced in India also lacks vitamin B. With few exceptions the resulting ocular lesions cannot be definitely ascribed to a deficiency of any particular vitamin, and in most cases all the B-complex factors are deficient. (1) Angular Conjunctivitis and Blepharo-conjunctivitis Lesions of the lid margin {{similar to those of the}} lips in riboflavin deficiency are common. In early cases the lesions appear in the medial and lateral canthi and extend over the whole thickness of the intermarginal strip and some portion of the skin near it. In moderately severe cases where angular stomatitis is associated with cheilosis, the whole length of the lid margins is ulcerated, producing typical blepharo-conjunctivitis which extends over the intermarginal strip of both eyelids and the surface of the skin and conjunctiva and even over the naso-labial folds; the lesion may be 0 5 to 1 0 cm. deep with raised and pigmented edges sometimes resembling a <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer.</b> A case of riboflavin deficiency is shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|IRRADIATION of {{the brain}} {{has been carried out}} for many years as a {{therapeutic}} measure in patients with neoplasms. It was Fischer and Holfelder in 1930 who first described a case of delayed radiation necrosis {{of the brain}} in man. This occurred seven years after the irradiation of a <b>rodent</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Markiewicz (1935) and Scholz and Hsll (1938) described delayed necrosis occurring eighteen months after the last exposure of the brain to irradiation. In the former paper it was for the treatment of a skin disease. A full description of the pathological findings in delayed radiation necrosis of the brain in man was given by Pennybacker and Russell (1948). Almost all the publications to date are concerned with changes following the experimental irradiation of animals or the irradiation of gliomas or skin tumours in man. This paper, however, is concerned with delayed necrosis of the brain in man following the irradiation of pituitary tumours. This complication of X-ray therapy to the pituitary {{does not appear to have}} been fully described before. Irradiation of pituitary adenomata is a therapeutic method of a long history and acknowledged value. It was practised by Cushing in the earlier part of the century and Henderson (1939), in a review of Cushing's series of cases, found that post-operative X-radiation increased the number of patients surviving five years without recurrence. Harvey Jackson (1958) stated that, in his experience, cases receiving post-operative X-ray therapy have a more lasting recovery than those receiving surgery alone. It is only recently in the literature, however, that the danger of delayed necrosis following therapeutic irradiation of pituitary tumours, has been recognized. Jackson Richmond, in 1958, briefly mentioned the first case that is described in this paper. In such cases deterioration due to delayed radiation necrosis of the brain may not be easily recognized either clinically or at autopsy, and the probability that by guest on Septe...|$|E
