30|$|The <b>regulatory</b> <b>sandbox</b> {{originates}} {{from the}} UK, which intends {{to give a}} more flexible space for innovations. The sandbox delineates a restricted scope with simplified market access standards and procedures. Given that consumers’ rights are safeguarded, FinTech innovation enterprises or businesses are permitted to rapidly implement operations, and are allowed to expand within the testing conditions of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>sandbox.</b> Currently, the UK, Australia, and Singapore have announced the establishment of FinTech regulatory sandboxes (Hu Jin-Hua. Calls for regulating blockchains continues to increase, industrial bigwigs urges establishment of sandbox mechanisms [EB/OL]). Although China has proposed similar ideas for “flexible regulation,” these have not been sufficiently standardized. Hence, their development should be accelerated {{in order to provide}} a controlled testing environment for the growth of blockchain technology.|$|E

The developments in FinTech, the tremendous changes in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators (for instance {{with the development of}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>sandboxes),</b> may potentially combine to facilitate a transition from one regulatory model to another.|$|R

Since the Crisis the regulatory pendulum has swung to the other extreme. Post-Crisis regulation, plus rapid technological change, have spurred the development of financial technology companies (FinTechs). FinTechs and data-driven financial services providers profoundly challenge the current regulatory paradigm. Financial regulators are increasingly seeking to balance the traditional regulatory objectives of financial stability and consumer protection with promoting growth and innovation. The resulting regulatory innovations include technology (RegTech), <b>regulatory</b> <b>sandboxes</b> and special charters. This paper analyses possible new regulatory approaches, ranging from doing nothing (which spans being permissive to highly restrictive, depending on context), cautious permissiveness (on a case-by-case basis, or through special charters), structured experimentalism (such as sandboxes or piloting), and development of specific new regulatory frameworks. Building on this framework, we argue for a new regulatory approach, which incorporates these rebalanced objectives, and which we term ‘smart regulation’. Our new automated and proportionate regime builds on shared principles {{from a range of}} jurisdictions and supports innovation in financial markets. The fragmentation of market participants and the increased use of technology requires regulators to adopt a sequential reform process, starting with digitization, before building digitally-smart regulation. Our paper provides a roadmap for this process...|$|R
40|$|We present Views, a {{file system}} {{architecture}} that provides isolation between system components {{for the purposes}} of access control, <b>regulatory</b> compliance, and <b>sandboxing.</b> Views allows for discrete I/O entities, such as users, groups, or processes, to have a logically complete yet fully isolated perspective (view) of the file system. This ensures that each entity’s file system activities only modify that entity’s view of the file system, but in a transparent fashion that does not limit or restrict the entity’s functionality. Views can therefore be used to monitor system activity based on user accounts for access control (as required by federal regulations such as HIPAA), provide a reliable sandbox for arbitrary applications without inducing any noticeable loss in performance, and enable traditional snapshotting functionality by manipulating and transplanting views as snapshots in time. Views’ architecture is designed to be file system independent, extremely easy to use and manage, and flexible in defining isolation and sharing polices. Our implementation of Views is built on ext 3 cow, which additionally provides versioning capabilities to all entities. Benchmarking results show that the performance of Views is nearly identical to other traditional file systems such as ext 3. ...|$|R
