5|$|A {{section of}} <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> about 15m (50ft) long and 4m (13ft) high remains, {{incorporated}} into an outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side. The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are {{designated as a}} scheduled monument. The area {{to the south of}} the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers. The site is {{on the east side of}} Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access.|$|E
25|$|The south aisle is 15th century. The <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> has {{a single}} {{buttress}} adjacent to the south porch on the west end and a plain parapet. A pair of two-lighted rectangular windows are {{on the south side}} and a two-lighted pointed arch window is in the west end. The porch is diagonally buttressed on the outer corners with a gabled roof. The south chapel was rebuilt or refaced in 1866 in with two-lighted rectangular windows in 15th century style. The north wall of the nave is from the late 11th century or from the 12th century with quoins of tufa stone. Two two-lighted windows traceried with quatrefoil and sexfoil decoration are late 13th century or early 14th century. A 15th-century three-lighted window is located in the centre of the north façade. The chancel is mostly 13th century with elements contemporaneous with the nave. The three-lighted east window is 19th century, but in 15th century style. The north façade contains a broad lancet window. The vestry was probably added in 1866 and has two lancet windows on the north side and a doorway on the west.|$|E
500|$|A summerhouse {{was added}} to the grounds, {{probably}} alongside the 19th-century additions to the main building. It was constructed of red and white brick, and had a steep slate roof. The east side displayed a crucifix. The building was Grade II listed in July 1975, but has since been demolished. The stone walls around the site are Grade II listed where they are the original [...] "high stone <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> with brick capping"; in other places they have been renovated in newer red brick.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} 26 ft by 36 ft {{and has a}} hipped roof on <b>rubble</b> <b>walls.</b> The gable-roofed barn, also with <b>rubble</b> <b>walls,</b> is about 30 ft by 30 ft..|$|R

500|$|The fort {{comprises}} a stone blockhouse, probably {{built in}} at least two phases, with the original, circular design altered at a later date to form a more irregular shape. The exterior of the blockhouse is approximately , the interior , with a limestone <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> enclosing an area cut out of the cliff face behind it. The exterior eastern wall is now [...] thick and [...] high. Eleven gunports for heavy artillery surround the ground floor close to sea level, similar in design to those at Dartmouth Castle, as well as nearby Little Dennis Fort and St Catherine's Castle. It would originally have had a wall-walk and parapet to protect musketeers. One of the gunports has been converted to form an entrance, and another has been blocked off. The original lean-to accommodation for the garrison lay on the west hand side of the fortification but this, and the internal modifications from its later use as a storage facility, have since been destroyed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rubble</b> <b>walls</b> (ħitan tas-sejjieħ) {{are found}} {{all over the}} island of Malta. Similar walls are also {{frequently}} found in Sicily and the Arab countries. The various shapes and sizes of the stones used to build these walls look like stones that {{were found in the}} area lying on the ground or in the soil. It is most probable that the practice of building these walls around the field was inspired by the Arabs during their rule in Malta, as in Sicily who were also ruled by the Arabs around the same period. The Maltese farmer found that the technique of these walls was very useful especially during an era where resources were limited. <b>Rubble</b> <b>walls</b> are used to serve as borders between the property of one farm from the other. A great advantage that <b>rubble</b> <b>walls</b> offered is that when heavy rain falls, their structure would allow excessive water to pass through and therefore, excess water will not ruin the products. Soil erosion is minimised as the wall structure allows the water to pass through but it traps the soil and prevents it from being carried away from the field. One can see many <b>rubble</b> <b>walls</b> {{on the side of the}} hills and in valleys where the land slopes down and consequently the soil is in greater danger of being carried away.|$|R

50|$|Like {{many of the}} Knights' early {{defensive}} structures, St. Agatha's Tower was strengthened {{during the}} early 18th century. A low profile <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> entrenchment was built around the flanks of the tower {{in the form of}} a redan trace. Due to this, the tower also functioned as a redoubt, similar to the one at Żabbar during the French blockade.|$|E
50|$|The {{batteries}} {{were linked}} together with long <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> entrenchments. A Belvedere Tower was also located {{north of the}} batteries.

50|$|Core-and-veneer, {{brick and}} <b>rubble,</b> <b>wall</b> and rubble, ashlar and rubble, and emplekton all {{refer to a}} {{building}} technique where two parallel walls are constructed and the core between them is filled with rubble or other infill, creating one thick wall. Originally, and in later poorly constructed walls, the rubble was not consolidated. Later, mortar and cement were used to consolidate the core rubble and produce studier construction.|$|E
50|$|This {{retaining}} wall was planned in 1888 to endow William Street with some aesthetic distinction to compliment the new Treasury Building being erected opposite the site. The Victoria Bridge {{end of an}} old <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> along William Street was {{to be replaced by}} a porphyry and sandstone wall with an elaborate cast iron railing and a small pissoir built into the wall at the Elizabeth Street end.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{was built}} {{at the bottom of}} Jesuit Hill, close to the shoreline. Jesuit Hill Battery was located nearby on higher ground. The battery was small, and {{consisted}} of a small masonry parapet with three embrasures, a hardstone gun platform, a sentry room on the left, and a flanking <b>rubble</b> <b>wall</b> on the right. A magazine was also built {{to the rear of the}} battery. Marsa Battery was designed by Salvatore Camilleri from Valletta.|$|E
25|$|Most, {{if not all}} units {{stationed}} in Malta during World War II including the RMA had adopted a unique camouflage pattern on their helmets. This pattern attempted to replicate the <b>rubble</b> <b>walls</b> that are still commonly used to separate fields and properties in Malta. It was also applied to vehicles, bunkers and anti-aircraft guns.|$|R
