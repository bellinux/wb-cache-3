So he'd {{better be}} <b>really</b> <b>something,</b> right? Well, as it happens, he is." [...] Tom Charity of CNN found Garfield's [...] "combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor ... immediately appealing." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline said she [...] "had no specific {{desire to see}} the series resuscitated. But watching Garfield and Stone made me think doing so wasn't such a bad idea". Mary F. Pols of Time [...] said {{that even though the}} story was familiar Garfield and Webb made it feel [...] "convincingly fresh and exciting." ...|$|E

This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3".

The French actress was enthralled with the script because she was [...] "very concerned about germs. I've always been ... scared, in a way, by all of those disease. So ... it was <b>really</b> <b>something</b> I was really interested." [...] Soderbergh said that Orantes [...] "gets dropped into situations and has to deal with cultural as well as scientific issues that are sometimes at odds", and notes that she has a [...] "professional" [...] yet stubborn, [...] "remote", and [...] "dispassionate" [...] demeanor, though [...] "something happens to her {{in the course of the}} story that causes a significant emotional shift." ...|$|E

500|$|Busoni made a {{considerable}} number of piano rolls, and a small number of these have been re-recorded onto vinyl record or CD. These include a 1950 recording by Columbia Records sourced from piano rolls made by Welte-Mignon including music of Chopin and transcriptions by Liszt. The value of these recordings in ascertaining Busoni's performance style is a matter of some dispute. Many of his colleagues and students expressed disappointment with the recordings and felt they did not truly represent Busoni's pianism. Egon Petri was horrified by the piano roll recordings when they first appeared on vinyl and said that they were a travesty of Busoni's playing. Similarly, Petri's student Gunnar Johansen who had heard Busoni play on several occasions, remarked, [...] "Of Busoni's piano rolls and recordings, only Feux follets (no. 5 of Liszt's [...] Transcendental Études) is <b>really</b> <b>something</b> unique. The rest is curiously unconvincing. The recordings, especially of Chopin, are a plain misalliance".|$|E
500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't <b>really</b> <b>something</b> that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{which first}} aired April 1, 1998, was an April Fools' Day prank by Parker and Stone on South Park fans, who were anxiously waiting {{to learn the}} {{identity}} of Cartman's father after the cliffhanger ending of [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", the first season finale. Instead, Parker and Stone presented an episode entirely focused on a Terrance and Phillip cartoon, with nothing in the story about Cartman's father. Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to Comedy Central {{within a week of}} the episode's original broadcast, and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast. Stone said to Entertainment Weekly in response to the fan backlash, [...] "If you get that pissed off because you don't know who a little construction paper kid's father is, then there's <b>really</b> <b>something</b> wrong with you." [...] Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune said Comedy Central was [...] "punking out" [...] with the decision.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the {{original}} release on AllMusic, Porcupine was described as a [...] "solid outing", a [...] "noticeably better listen than its predecessor, Heaven Up Here" [...] and [...] "well worth hearing".

CMJ critic Eric Chappe wrote that [...] "the constant emotional peaks and valleys of Porcupine may be perhaps too strong for some, but the musical peaks achieved in getting there are <b>really</b> <b>something</b> to behold." [...] The album appeared in the 1983 end of year critics' lists for both Melody Maker, where it was listed at number nine, and NME, where it was listed at number 32. The album is also listed in the 2006 book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not <b>really</b> <b>something</b> I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E
500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is <b>really</b> <b>something</b> that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the film, Emin {{describes}} leaving {{school at}} age 13 and spending her time on Margate's Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex. Sex [...] "was {{something you could}} just do and it was for free". She was [...] "13, 14" [...] and having sex with men of [...] "19, 20, 25, 26". In the film, the narration states: “It could be good, <b>really</b> <b>something.</b> I {{remember the first time}} someone asked me to grab their balls, I remember the power it gave me. But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap.

2500|$|Ewan McGregor {{was offered}} the part of King Edward VIII, but was later {{replaced}} by James D'Arcy. Additionally, producer David Parfitt and casting director Nina Gold also quit W.E., with sources claiming that the duo had [...] "creative differences" [...] with Madonna and found that she struggled to [...] "collaborate and delegate". Actress Margo Stilley was {{to play the role}} of Lady Thelma Furness, but left the project, citing [...] "artistic differences" [...] with Madonna. Stilley said: [...] "I had the role, but we had artistic differences. She (Madonna) is <b>really</b> <b>something.</b> I wish the cast luck because they are all really talented." [...] In her place, Katie McGrath joined the cast. Judy Parfitt was signed to portray Queen Mary and Geoffrey Palmer as Stanley Baldwin. Real-life father and son James and Laurence Fox were signed to the parts of King George V and his son, Bertie—Edward's younger brother. BBC reported that members of the London Welsh Center expressed interest in appearing for a scene in the film, which involves Edward being shocked at the living conditions in Welsh mining villages. A spokesperson for the centre, which was contacted by the film's casting agency, said: [...] "I've had about 15 phone calls this morning, and yesterday was bedlam because everybody wants to be in a film with Madonna." [...] The centre said Welsh-speakers were needed as extras to create scenes based on Edward's visits to the south Wales valleys in the 1930s. Actress Natalie Dormer was cast to play the part of a young Queen Elizabeth (Queen Mother). Dormer reflected on the role, saying: [...] "This country tends to remember the Queen Mother as a rather wrinkly 97-year-old, but I am playing her when she was quite an enchanting, engaging twenty- and thirty-something. [...] She was quite a savage and savvy game player." [...] Dormer's assertion of the role was confirmed by royal historian Hugo Vickers, who was sought by Madonna to advise her on the characteristics of the different members of the royal family. He confirmed that Madonna was portraying the Queen Mother as an unfavorable influence on the relationship between Edward VIII and Simpson.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible <b>really,</b> <b>something</b> we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have to stand there and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
