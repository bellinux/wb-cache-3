The motorways forming the Pan-European Corridor X in the area—Slovenia's A2, Croatia's A3 and Serbia's A1 motorways—represent a part of European route E70 Bordeaux–Turin–Ljubljana–Zagreb–Belgrade–Bucharest, and the European route E61 Villach–Ljubljana–Trieste–Rijeka. A largely double track railroad with a <b>railway</b> <b>electrification</b> system {{is also a}} part of the Corridor X. The railroad was a part of the Simplon-Orient-Express and Direct-Orient-Express routes. The navigable river course between Belgrade and Galdovo north of Sisak is spanned by 25bridges. The Sava River valley east of Sisak is also used as a route for the Jadranski naftovod, a crude oil pipeline. The system connects the Port of Rijeka oil terminal to oil refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, to Brod in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as Novi Sad and Pančevo in Serbia.|$|E

25|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>electrification</b> in Great Britain began {{during the}} late 19th century.

25|$|The re-organisation of {{railways}} in India into regional zones {{began in}} 1951. On 14 April 1951, Southern Railway was created. On 5 November, Central Railway and Western Railway were created. In the same year,the post of Chief Commissioner of Railways was abolished and the Railway Board adopted {{the practice of}} making the seniormost member Chairman of the board. In the same year, the government of West Bengal entered into {{an agreement with the}} Calcutta Tramways Co. to take over its administrative functions. On 14 April 1952, Northern Railway, Eastern Railway and North-Eastern Railway were created. In the same year, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all classes of passenger accommodation and sleeping accommodation was introduced in coaches. On 1 August 1955, Eastern Railway was split to form new South-Eastern Railway. In 1956, divisional system of administration was set up for the various regional zones. Also in 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi. In 1957, after successful trials in France, SNCF proposed 25kV AC electrification for railways. Railways took a decision to adopt 25kV AC electrification and chose SNCF as technical consultant. An organisation, Main Line Electrification Project (which later became the <b>Railway</b> <b>Electrification</b> Project and still later the Central Organization for <b>Railway</b> <b>Electrification)</b> was established in the same year. In 1958, the North-Eastern Railway split to form a new Northeast Frontier Railway. In 1959, the Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section became the first section to be electrified with 25kV AC traction. The first scheduled train using 25kV AC traction ran on Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section on 11 August 1960. In 1966, first containerized freight services were started, between Bombay and Ahmedabad. In the same year, electrification of several suburban tracks around Delhi, Madras and Calcutta was completed with the 25 kV AC system. In 1979, Main Line Electrification Project was reconstituted into Central Organization for <b>Railway</b> <b>Electrification</b> (CORE).|$|E
25|$|Three-phase AC <b>railway</b> <b>electrification</b> {{was used}} in Italy, Switzerland and the United States {{in the early twentieth}} century. Italy was the major user, for lines in the mountainous regions of {{northern}} Italy from 1901 until 1976. The first lines were the Burgdorf-Thun line in Switzerland (1899), and the lines of the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina from Colico to Chiavenna and Tirano in Italy, which were electrified in 1901 and 1902. Other lines where the three-phase system were used were the Simplon Tunnel in Switzerland from 1906 to 1930, and the Cascade Tunnel of the Great Northern Railway in the United States from 1909 to 1927.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} in Thailand, and Malaysia {{are largely}} manually operated, where the barriers are lowered using a manual switch when trains approach. A {{significant number of}} crossings are without barriers. <b>Railway</b> <b>electrification</b> in Malaysia has gradually eliminated level crossings in Peninsular Malaysia, replacing those along nearly all upgraded lines with large overhead viaducts or deep underground tunnels, and simply cutting off non-essential crossings outright. Level crossings used to exist along the KTM railway line in Singapore, but these were removed after the closure of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, and the moving of the KTM railway station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. But {{there are still some}} that are used on the line between Port Klang - Westport (Pulau Indah). However, it seems like only the level crossing near Port Klang Komuter Station has the barrier.|$|E

25|$|The VGN {{had a very}} major {{grade at}} Clark's Gap, West Virginia, and tried large steam {{locomotives}} before turning to an alternative already in use by one of its neighboring competitors, Norfolk & Western Railway: a <b>railway</b> <b>electrification</b> system. With work authorized beginning in 1922, a 134-mile portion of the railroad in the mountains from Mullens, West Virginia over Clark's Gap and several other major grades to Roanoke, Virginia was equipped with overhead wires supported by a catenary system. The VGN built its own power plant at Narrows, Virginia. The electrification was completed in 1925 {{at a cost of}} $15 million, equal to $ today. A link was established with Norfolk & Western to share electricity from its nearby electrification during contingencies. ALCO and Westinghouse supplied the electric locomotives, which were equipped with pantographs. The 36 initial units were normally linked in groups of three as one set, and had much greater load capacity than the steam power they replaced. In 1948, four huge EL-2B twin-unit locomotives were purchased, followed by twelve EL-C rectifier locomotives in 1955.|$|E
