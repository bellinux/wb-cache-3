Both fuel and oxidizer were toxic and required extreme care when loading in the aircraft, yet there were occasions when Komets exploded on the tarmac from the propellants' hypergolic nature. Both propellants were clear fluids, and different tanker trucks were used for delivering each propellant to a particular Komet aircraft, usually the C-Stoff hydrazine/methanol-base fuel first. For safety purposes, it left the immediate area of the aircraft following its delivery and capping off of the Komets fuel tanks from a rear located dorsal fuselage <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> just ahead of the Komets vertical stabilizer.

50|$|Because {{the lines}} ran on or {{alongside}} roads {{it was decided}} to design the locomotives as tramway or 'box' locomotives (Kastenlokomotive). They had a fully glazed, box body and the drive was covered to reduce the risk to passers-by or horses. In order to enable the engine driver to see the line there was a sliding side window. The driver himself stood to one side next to the boiler. The water tank was integrated into the rivetted plate frame.

The relationship between low temperature superfluid density and particle density is symmetric and appears parabolic about the half <b>filling</b> <b>point.</b> Disorder appears to break the superfluid phase up into two distinct localized states, depending on the particle density.

Through freezing and thawing strength and frost heaving amount test, the research analyzes factors affecting frost heaving of subgrade <b>filling,</b> <b>points</b> out that water content, fine stuff admixing amount and plasticity of fine-grained soil have relatively large influence on frost heaving, while freezing temperature and freezing and thawing cycle index have relatively small influence. Water content is main factor to {{have effect on}} frost heaving of subgrade filling. When the water content reaches to some certain value, even coarse-grained soil can produce considerable frost heaving amount. Therefore, taking effective waterproof and drainage measures is of great importance in subgrade frost heaving prevention and treatment...|$|R

An additional question surrounds {{the purpose of the}} wall. The Marcomanni Wars around 170 AD have been suggested as the reason, as has the invasion by the Alemanni in the 3rd century AD, but others have suggested that the walls were built primarily to defend the city against flooding or landslides - a not impossible reason if the industry carried on in the town led to extensive deforestation of the surrounding hills. A final suggestion is that the wall and gate were originally built for show, but hastily extended and improved to withstand the Alemanni.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} properties of simultaneous water filling for a wireless system with two mutually interfering transmitters and receivers with non-cooperative coding strategies. This is slightly {{different from the}} traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this non-cooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous water <b>filling</b> fixed <b>points</b> where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user water fills over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous water <b>filling</b> <b>point</b> the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous water filling that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance {{as a function of}} interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall...|$|R
40|$|During the {{delivery}} of unleaded petrol to a Snax service station on the Southend Arterial Road a small fire occurred in the manhole chamber containing the underground offset fill pipes. The manhole involved has four fill pipes and is constructed from GRP with a metal frame at the top. The pipes are plastic but have a metal transition fitting for connection to the tanker hose. When not in use the fittings have an aluminium cap with an o-ring seal in place. It is understood that {{the delivery}} driver had two hoses connected to the offset <b>fill</b> <b>points</b> and was delivering the product. One delivery had finished and he opened up the cap of the next <b>fill</b> <b>point</b> to commence delivery to that tank. He then went to place the cap on the pipe of the tank {{to which he had}} completed the first delivery when the ignition occurred. The fire was quickly extinguished and no one was hurt. Initially it was suspected that the probable cause of the ignition was static electricity igniting an uncommonly high concentration of petrol vapour. This is not an unreasonable assumption since the metal termination on the plastic pipe was ungrounded. In order for an ignition to occur at this point however there must be an electrostatic discharge between the cap and the termination fitting of sufficient energy to exceed the minimum ignition energy of the vapour mixture. Normally the caps made from aluminium are connected to the termination fitting by means of a short length of chain but in this case the chain was broken and consequently there was no electrical continuity between the fitting and the cap. It follows that electrostatic ignition would be reliant on either the fitting to be raised to high potential or the cap/delivery driver being raised to high potential...|$|R
