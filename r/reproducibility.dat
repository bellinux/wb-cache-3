5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of light but by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better <b>reproducibility</b> and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

It was found that pectin from different sources provides different gelling abilities, due to variations in molecular size and chemical composition.

When the tumours were classified according to degree of differentiation (high, moderate, low) or graded according to WHO (which includes both differentiation and nuclear atypia), however, {{there was a significant}} correlation with the five-year recurrence rate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the performances of the standard aerobic bottle (StAe), FAN aerobic (FANAe) and enhanced FAN aerobic (E-FANAe) (the charcoal component of the FANAe was revised recently to improve the feasibility of Gram smear interpretation) blood culture bottles for BacT/Alert system for the detection of Brucella melitensis in simulated blood culture. Triplicate strains of eight clinical isolates of B. melitensis were studied. Each bottle was inoculated with 5 mL of freshly collected human blood at three different targeted bacterial inocula (101, 102 and 103 CFU/bottle). All bottles were monitored for up to 21 days or until they became positive. The results of time to detection (TTD) on the eight B. melitensis samples were as follows: at 101 CFU/bottle, the E-FANAe had a mean TTD significantly shorter than the StAe (48 h vs. 56. 2 h, P < 0. 05); and at 103 CFU/bottle, the FANAe and E-FANAe had a mean TTD significantly shorter than the StAe (41. 2 h and 40 h vs. 45. 6 h, P< 0. 05). The <b>reproducibilities</b> (no. of positive signals/no. of all bottles) of three bottle systems were as follows: at 101 CFU/bottle, the <b>reproducibilities</b> of StAe, FANAe and E-FANAe were 96, 83 and 58 %, respectively. At 103 CFU/bottle, the <b>reproducibilities</b> of StAe, FANAe and E-FANAe were 95, 95 and 91 %, respectively. Positive results for the presence of bacteria in Gram smears were confirmed in 68 % of StAe, 54 % of FANAe and 90 % of E-FANAe.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} optimization of chlorine extraction from silicate samples by pyrohydrolysis {{prior to the}} precise determination of Cl stable-isotope compositions (637 Cl) by gas source, dual inlet Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) on CH(3) Clg. The complete method was checked on three international reference materials for Cl-content and two laboratory glass standards. Whole procedure blanks are lower than 0. 5 mu mol, corresponding to less than 10 wt. % {{of most of the}} sample chloride analysed. In the absence of international chlorine isotope rock, we report here Cl extracted compared to accepted Cl contents and <b>reproducibilities</b> on Cl and delta Cl- 37 measurements for the standard rocks. After extraction, the Cl contents of the three international references compared within error with the accepted values (mean yield = 94 +/- 10 %) with <b>reproducibilities</b> better than 12 % (10). The laboratory glass standards - andesite SO 100 DS 92 and phonolite S 9 (2) - were used specifically to test the effect of chloride amount on the measurements. They gave Cl extraction yields of 100 +/- 6 % (1 sigma-; n = 15) and 105 +/- 8 % (1 sigma-; n = 7), respectively, with delta Cl- 37 values of - 0. 51 0. 14 %o and - 0. 39 0. 17 %o (1 g). In summary, for silicate samples with Cl contents between 39 and 9042 ppm, the Pyrohydrolysis/HPLC method leads to overall CI extraction yields of 100 8 %, <b>reproducibilities</b> on Cl contents of 7 % and on delta Cl- 37 measurements of 0. 12 %o (all 1 sigma). The method was further applied to ten silicate rocks of various mineralogy and chemistry (meteorite, fresh MORB glasses, altered basalts and setpentinized peridotites) chosen for their large range of Cl contents (70 - 2156 ppm) and their geological significance. delta Cl- 37 values range between - 2. 33 and - 0. 50 %o. These strictly negative values contrast with the large range and mainly positive values previously reported for comparable silicate samples and shown here to be affected by analytical problems. Thus we propose a preliminary, revised terrestrial CI cycle, mainly dominated by negative and zero delta Cl- 37 values. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
