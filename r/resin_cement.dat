5000|$|The wing or {{retainer}} must be {{rigid and}} is usually fabricated from a metal alloy. The inner surface must fit closely to the abutment tooth. The intaglio is treated {{in some way to}} enhance the micromechanical adhesion between the prosthesis and the composite <b>resin</b> <b>cement.</b> In the past various methods have been used, ranging from metal-weave patterns to tin plating. The modern resin-retained bridge retaining wing is usually sandblasted with an alumina powder. The metal wing needs to engage as much of the sound enamel. In the majority of cases the metal wing is taken to the incisal edge of anterior teeth and overlapping of the occlusal (biting) surface of the teeth for posterior teeth.|$|E
50|$|In dentistry, a veneer is a {{layer of}} {{material}} placed over a tooth, veneers improve the aesthetics of a smile or and protect the tooth's surface from damage. There are two main types of material used to fabricate a veneer: composite and dental porcelain. A composite veneer may be directly placed (built-up in the mouth), or indirectly fabricated by a dental technician in a dental lab, and later bonded to the tooth, typically using a <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> such as Panavia. In contrast, a porcelain veneer may only be indirectly fabricated. Full veneer crown is described as “A restoration that covers all the coronal tooth surfaces (Mesial, Distal, Facial, Lingual and Occlusal)”. Laminate veneer, on the other hand, is a thin layer that covers only {{the surface of the}} tooth and generally used for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

30|$|Contemporary <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> may be {{classified}} into two main groups, {{according to the}} adhesive approach.

These latter materials are known as self-adhesive (or self-etching) <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> and may simplify the adhesive luting procedures.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} how curing protocol affects the extent of polymerization of dual-cured <b>resin</b> <b>cements.</b> Methods. Four commercial <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> were used (DuoLink, Panavia F 2. 0, Variolink II and Enforce). The extent of polymerization of the <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> cured under different conditions was measured using a (1) H Stray-Field MRI method, which also enabled to probe molecular mobility in the kHz frequency range. Results. <b>Resin</b> <b>cements</b> show well distinct behaviours concerning chemical cure. Immediate photo-activation appears to be the best choice for higher filler loaded <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> (Panavia F 2. 0 and Variolink). A photo-activation delay (5 min) did not induce any significant difference in the extent of polymerization of all cements. Significance. The extent of polymerization of dual-cured <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> considerably changed among products under various curing protocols. Clinicians should optimize the materials choice taking into account the curing characteristics of the cements. (C) 2010 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Six test groups and one control group represented by a standardized L 929 -fibroblast cell culture were formed.

30|$|For {{cementation}} to zirconia without separate primer application before luting, bonding efficacy depends {{entirely on}} the luting agent and its mechanical stability [24]. Regular bis-GMA resin cements which do not contain the MDP itself may show low bond strength values. However, RelyX U 200 cement contains methacrylate monomers with phosphoric ester functional groups (MDP) and these functional monomers of RelyX U 200 cement are able to form hydrogen bonds with zirconium oxide surfaces, enhancing adhesion and bond strength [26 – 28]. Significantly higher bond strength values between lithium disilicate ceramic and self adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement</b> was also stated. This was attributed to phosphoric-acid methacrylates in the self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cement,</b> which provided a strong physical interaction, such as chemical reaction with the substructure [29].

Understanding {{the effect}} of the degree of {{conversion}} on the mechanical properties of auto- and dual-polymerizing self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> leads to a better estimation of their performance in different clinical scenarios.

Material and methods. Conventional (RelyX ARC and Clearfil Esthetic <b>Cement)</b> and self-adhesive <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> (RelyX Unicem and Clearfil SA Cement) were applied to a Fourier infrared spectrometer to assess the DC (n= 5) under the following 3 polymerization conditions: direct light exposure (dual-polymerizing mode), exposure through the prepolymerized disk, or autopolymerizing. The polymerization kinetic was recorded for 20 minutes. Then, disk-shaped specimens (n= 11) were prepared to evaluate the effect of polymerization on the FS and FM in both extreme polymerization conditions (dual-polymerizing or autopolymerizing). Data were statistically analyzed by 2 -way repeated measure ANOVA (DC) and by 2 -way ANOVA (FS and FM), followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test (alpha=. 05). Results. Autopolymerizing groups exhibited reduced DC means, whereas intermediate values were observed when <b>resin</b> <b>cements</b> were polymerized through the disk.
