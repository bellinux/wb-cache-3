Whilst it may be good employment practice, contrary to popular belief, there is no legal obligation on employers to supply references in respect of employees.

50|$|The {{release of}} Dances with Wolves (1990) {{unexpectedly}} revived the Western genre. Arguably {{the most influential}} Native American-themed film {{of the last few}} decades, it paid <b>reasonably</b> <b>careful</b> attention to the depiction of Lakota life, traditions and clothing, at least compared to earlier efforts. However, the basic formula of the Hollywood stereotypes - at its heart the idea of the white lead ‘going Native’, the arrival of the 'White Saviour' - was not transcended, and there were still cultural errors in the film. Thus, the evaluation of scholarly criticism boiled down to granting the film good intentions, {{but at the same time}} classifying the movie as a revisionist Western simply replaying the romantic Noble Savage with the white as the hero. Dances with Wolves was followed by other sympathetic or revisionist Western blockbusters such as The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and Geronimo: An American Legend (1993) and caused mainstream media to put American Indians on their agenda, at least for a short while. One of the few Hollywood movies that portrays Native life outside the Old West and instead sets its story in contemporary times is Thunderheart.|$|R

He made an abstract of this manuscript at the time, and this abstract is now preserved in the British Museum.

5000|$|From their Emancipation to World War II, Jews {{were very}} active and {{sometimes}} even dominant in certain forms of European theatre, and after the Holocaust many Jews continued to that cultural form. For example, in pre-Nazi Germany, where Nietzsche asked [...] "What good actor of today is not Jewish?", acting, directing and writing positions were often filled by Jews. Both MacDonald and Jewish Tribal Review would generally be counted as anti-Semitic sources, but <b>reasonably</b> <b>careful</b> in their factual claims. [...] "In Imperial Berlin, Jewish artists {{could be found in}} the forefront of the performing arts, from high drama to more popular forms like cabaret and revue, and eventually film. Jewish audiences patronized innovative theater, regardless of whether they approved of what they saw." [...] The British historian Paul Johnson, commenting on Jewish contributions to European culture at the Fin de siècle, writes thatThe area where Jewish influence was strongest was the theatre, especially in Berlin. Playwrights like Carl Sternheim, Arthur Schnitzler, Ernst Toller, Erwin Piscator, Walter Hasenclever, Ferenc Molnár and Carl Zuckmayer, and influential producers like Max Reinhardt, appeared at times to dominate the stage, which tended to be modishly left-wing, pro-republican, experimental and sexually daring. But it was certainly not revolutionary, and it was cosmopolitan rather than Jewish.Jews also made similar, if not as massive, contributions to theatre and drama in Austria, Britain, France, and Russia (in the national languages of those countries). Jews in Vienna, Paris and German cities found cabaret both a popular and effective means of expression, as German cabaret in the Weimar Republic [...] "was mostly a Jewish art form". The involvement of Jews in Central European theatre was halted during the rise of the Nazis and the purging of Jews from cultural posts, though many emigrated to Western Europe or the United States and continued working there.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{many minutes}} the {{housekeeper}} waited upon us--a fresh rosy little {{old woman in}} a clean dowdy cap and a scanty sprigged gown; a quaint <b>careful</b> <b>person,</b> but accessible to the tribute of our pleasure, {{to say nothing of}} any other.

Under her guidance we passed through a dozen apartments, duly stocked with old pictures, old tapestry, old carvings, old armour, with a hundred ornaments and treasures. The pictures were especially valuable. The two Vandykes, the trio of rosy Rubenses, the sole and sombre Rembrandt, glowed with conscious authenticity. A Claude, a Murillo, a Greuze, a couple of Gainsboroughs, hung there with high complacency. Searle strolled about, scarcely speaking, pale and grave, with bloodshot eyes and lips compressed.

She was not registered on the home's title deeds, but she had made significant financial contributions to the home.

5000|$|To {{create an}} easement, first, under Law of Property Act 1925 section 65(1) a {{landowner}} may expressly grant a neighbour a right over his land, or may reserve a right when selling {{a portion of}} land to someone else. Second, an easement may also come about through an express assurance, triggering proprietary estoppel. This {{was the case in}} Crabb v Arun District Council, where a landowner acquired an easement after the council assured him they would leave him access to his land over theirs, when he sold another portion that gave the route in from the main road. Third, the law may find easements by a process of construction, in general, if they are necessary for property's reasonable enjoyment. The rules are analogous to incorporation and implication terms in contracts, so for instance in Green v Lord Somerleyton Jonathan Parker LJ approved an easement for drainage of water from Lord Somerleyton's land into Green's dykes, because when land was sold on in 1921 its proper construction incorporated a drainage deed. In Kent v Kavanagh it was clarified, however, that because reasonable enjoyment was the aim of implication, an easement was only to be implied in situations where land was in common ownership and occupation. This test was satisfied on those facts, where two semi-detached houses had a small path between them to access the back gardens, and a subsequent buyer wished to build into its half of the path. Chadwick LJ held the easement was necessary for enjoyment of the back garden. Fourth, under Law of Property Act 1925 section 62, easements that are [...] "appertaining or reputed to appertain to the land" [...] at the time of a conveyance will bind the purchaser. So in Hair v Gillman a lady who parked her car in a neighbour's forecourt while she had a seven-year lease acquired a crystallised lease when she subsequently bought the house. If easements are used for twenty years, however, a fifth method of acquiring a crystallised legal right is through the Prescription Act 1832. This method comes from simple period of extended use, and does not require showing any need for the easement. There are also a range of statutory easements, including, notably, [...] "wayleaves" [...] reserved by public authorities to install pipes or cables, and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 which extended the registered number of private and common lands where people have the [...] "right to roam" [...] for recreation. However created, an easement ought to be registered to ensure protection. An easement that is not registered will be recognised as an over-riding interest according to LRA 2002 Schedule 3, paragraph 3, if known to a person to whom land is sold and if the easement is obvious on a <b>reasonably</b> <b>careful</b> inspection, but only if the easement is acquired at law (not equity) since 13 October 2003.|$|R

That is, the Kane proposal embraces the past few decades worth of development in the semiconductor industry, and utilizes that framework to create a quantum computing system that is not only easily (relatively) implemented, but also readily scalable. Also like any architecture, it must be relatively invulnerable to both decoherence and error buildup within the internal circuitry. In this paper, we'll examine how to resolve the latter problem, which is often a nastier problem that can still be <b>reasonably</b> resolved given <b>careful</b> circuit design. In doing so, we will discuss how to build up individual error correcting elements together to form error-correction procedures and examine what elements an overall error correction scheme needs to be successful as well as how that affects the design and ultimately architecture of the entir...|$|R
