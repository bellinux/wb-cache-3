The process was found to require a high solids content suspension, hence development work was performed in this direction though in the end a new, commercial suspension was utilised. Of the three forming routes of gel casting, direct coagulation casting and in-situ coagulation moulding, the latter was found to be the most promising for the new process of <b>rotary</b> <b>moulding</b> of ceramics. Due to the low value of clay-based ceramics, a new low cost coagulant was identified and the effect of lactone concentration and temperature on setting time determined. Following substantial optimisation work, it was found that a two-speed approach to multi-axial rotation was the most successful; medium sized cream jugs could be produced in just 7 minutes. With respect to mould materials, the porous resin normally used for pressure casting of sanitary ware was found to be the best option, though since this is quite expensive conventional plaster-of-paris moulds were found to be a suitable material to enable companies, particularly SMEs, to become familiar with the technology whilst avoiding high costs for trials. The processed articles could be successfully fired and glazed using gas-fired kilns with no sign of any black cores. Major advantages of the process include the ability to precisely calculate the amount of ceramic slip required, eliminating either slip wastage or the need to pour used slip back into the virgin material as currently happens with slip casting. In addition, since the precursor suspension has a very high solids content, the time and energy required to dry the green product and associated moulds has been considerably reduced...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Granular or {{particulate}} materials, {{composed of}} a large number of loosely-packed individual particles or grains, are an integral part of our environment; common examples are sand, powder, rocks and grains in their many forms. The flow of such granular material plays a critical role in many industrial processes, such as separation and mixing (eg in the manufacture of glass and pharmaceuticals), <b>rotary</b> <b>moulding</b> of plastics, mineral production and processing (eg blasting and excavation, crushing and grinding of mineral ores), commodity sampling (eg from conveyor belts), stockpile construction and discharge, and flows in and from hoppers and silos. Since small reductions in energy consumption or increases in output represent substantial financial benefits for plant owners, significant effort is placed on improving the efficiency of such processes. Numerical simulation of granular flows has an increasing role to play in this optimisation procedure. Granular flows are known t...|$|E
5000|$|Pressed or molded beads are {{associated}} with lower labour costs. These {{are made in the}} Czech republic. Thick rods are heated to molten and fed into a complex apparatus that stamps the glass, including a needle that pierces a hole. The beads again are rolled in hot sand to remove flashing and soften seam lines. By making canes (the glass rods fed into the machine) striped or otherwise patterned, the resulting beads can be more elaborately colored than seed beads. One `feed' of a hot rod might result in 10-20 beads, and a single operator can make thousands in a day. Glass beads are also manufactured or <b>moulded</b> using <b>rotary</b> machine where molten glass is fed on the centre of <b>rotary</b> <b>mould</b> and solid or hollow glass beads are formed.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Rotary</b> planing and <b>moulding</b> machining operations {{have been widely used}} within the woodworking industry for many years. As a result of these machining processes, the surface proftle of machined timber consists of cuttermarks which determine the product quality. However, the presence of machine system variations does not guarantee the quality requirements. Most of the rotary machining improvement techniques applied to obtain an improved product quality focus on conventional methods such as tooling and spindle system design. Tbe current state of the industry indicates that the design of rotary planing machines has probably reached its mechanical development limit, hence for an advanced machining process, mechatronics based improvement techniques are necessary. Therefore, the focus of this research work is directed towards the improvements on a mechatronics based small scale wood planer. Firstly, the effects of machining variations on the resultant surface form have been investigated. Especially, the effects of spindle vibrations and tooling inaccuracies on the surface ftnish have been analysed through simulation and further demonstrated through experimental work. With the introduced defect generation tool (DGT), the effect of a speciftc disturbance could be made to order, hence allowing generation of defects for quality investigations. This is not possible on existing machinery. Secondly, for an enhanced machining environment, surface proftle information is desirable. Various surface proftle measurement systems have been evaluated in terms of in-process deployment. Most of the evaluated measurement systems lack the measurement speed or exhibit other disadvantages which limit their implementation for real-time measurement purposes. Therefore, a novel in-process surface prof:tle monitoring system (ISMS) has been introduced that is capable of extracting surface proftle features in real-time. Thirdly, active vibration control has been implemented on the small scale planer. Unlike conventional design improvement methods, with the active vibration control approach the dynamic characteristics of the small scale planer were substantially improved, hence enabling a higher degree of freedom in terms of machining operation. This improvement allows machining operations beyond the limitations set by the mechanical properties of the planing system, thus enabling higher product quality where additional machining processes such as sanding could be obsolete...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Rotary</b> planing, and <b>moulding,</b> machining operations have been employed within the woodworking industry {{for a number of}} years. Due to the rotational nature of the machining process, cuttermarks, in the form of waves, are created on the machined timber surface. It is the nature of these cuttermarks that determine the surface quality of the machined timber. It has been established that cutting tool inaccuracies and vibrations are a prime factor {{in the form of the}} cuttermarks on the timber surface. A principal aim of this thesis is to create a control architecture that is suitable for the adaptive operation of a wood planing machine in order to improve the surface quality of the machined timber. In order to improve the surface quality, a thorough understanding of the principals of wood planing is required. These principals are stated within this thesis and the ability to manipulate the rotary wood planing process, in order to achieve a higher surface quality, is shown. An existing test rig facility is utilised within this thesis, however upgrades to facilitate higher cutting and feed speeds, as well as possible future implementations such as extended cutting regimes, the test rig has been modified and enlarged. This test rig allows for the dynamic positioning of the centre of rotation of the cutterhead during a cutting operation through the use of piezo electric actuators, with a displacement range of ± 15 μm. A new controller for the system has been generated. Within this controller are a number of tuneable parameters. It was found that these parameters were dependant on a high number external factors, such as operating speeds and run‐out of the cutting knives. A novel approach to the generation of these parameters has been developed and implemented within the overall system. Both cutterhead inaccuracies and vibrations can be overcome, to some degree, by the vertical displacement of the cutterhead. However a crucial information element is not known, the particular displacement profile. Therefore a novel approach, consisting of a subtle change to the displacement profile and then a pattern matching approach, has been implemented onto the test rig. Within the pattern matching approach the surface profiles are simplified to a basic form. This basic form allows for a much simplified approach to the pattern matching whilst producing a result suitable for the subtle change approach. In order to compress the data levels a Principal Component Analysis was performed on the measured surface data. Patterns were found to be present in the resultant data matrix and so investigations into defect classification techniques have been carried out using both K‐Nearest Neighbour techniques and Neural Networks. The application of these novel approaches has yielded a higher system performance, for no additional cost to the mechanical components of the wood planing machine, both in terms of wood throughput and machined timber surface quality...|$|R
