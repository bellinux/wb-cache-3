5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> {{proteins}} and calories, {{as well as}} minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. A seed can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated the species would exclude other species if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds {{would be more}} aggressive if there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E

Barley is also rich in antioxidants and contains {{a high concentration of}} tocols and tocotrienols, oils that help reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease.|$|R
5|$|Isidore's vast {{encyclopedia}} of ancient learning includes subjects from theology to furniture, {{and provided a}} <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> classical lore and learning for medieval writers. In his works including the Etymologiae, Isidore quotes from around 475 works from over 200 authors. Bishop Braulio, to whom Isidore dedicated it and sent it for correction, divided it into its twenty books.|$|E
5|$|It is {{slightly}} larger than Pallas, though significantly more massive. Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> information about Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Marley was correct. In 1864, just 14 {{years after}} the {{discovery}} of the <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> ironstone, Bolckow, Vaughan and Company Ltd was registered with capital of £2,500,000, making it the largest company ever formed up to that time. Middlesbrough more than doubled in population from 7600 in 1851 to 19,000 in 1861, and then doubled again to 40,000 in 1871, driven by the iron industry.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies {{near the center}} of the Milky Way galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E
5|$|A <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Late Paleolithic {{sites and}} {{artifacts}} (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there contained {{the remains of}} a typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts of their culture, including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a dugout cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a hearth and imported materials) were discovered recently in Ćmielów, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age}} of two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|The League {{failed to}} prevent the 1932 war between Bolivia and Paraguay over the arid Gran Chaco region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it {{contained}} the Paraguay River, which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean, {{and there was also}} speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> petroleum. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at Lake Pitiantuta. Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the Pan-American Conference offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million. It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control of most of the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered a <b>rich</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> material for their creative staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began with was {{the possibility of a}} secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one of the main elements of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the surface appearance of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E
