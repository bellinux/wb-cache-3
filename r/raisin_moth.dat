5000|$|<b>Raisin</b> <b>moth</b> (Cadra figulilella: Phycitinae) [...] - [...] pests of stored dry fruit; now {{introduced}} almost worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Cadra figulilella, the <b>raisin</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It was {{described}} by Charles Stuart Gregson in 1871 and has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution.|$|E
50|$|Ephestiodes gilvescentella, the dusky <b>raisin</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is native to North America, {{where it has been}} {{recorded}} from California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Utah, Montana, Alberta and British Columbia. It was introduced to Hawaii by commerce.|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} - {{particularly}} in the nonbiological literature - are dried currant moth and fig moth, which invite confusion with the close relatives C. figulilella (<b>raisin</b> <b>moth)</b> and C. calidella (dried fruit moth). C. cautella has achieved an essentially cosmopolitan distribution due to inadvertent transport with its larval food; it has, for example, been transported across Polynesia with copra shipments.|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the use of the pheromone (9 Z, 12 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate (TDA/ZETA) for mating disruption (MD) of Pyralidae moths associated with stored products, in most cases the <b>Raisin</b> <b>moth,</b> Ephestia cautella (Walker), Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller and Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner). The experiments were conducted in the Czech Republic, Greece and Italy during 2007 and 2008 in storage facilities that varied in their size and type, and included flour mills, retail stores, storage rooms with currants and raw grain stores. After a summer pre-treatment monitoring period to assess moth population in, dispensers containing TDA were placed in the fall. Adjacent facilities without dispensers were used as control units. Pheromone-baited traps were used to monitor the population fluctuation of the pyralid moths during the entire experimental periods. The presence of MD dispensers notably reduced the number of adults found in the traps in comparison with control rooms. Monitoring of female oviposition, measured as number of hatched larvae in cups containing food, indicated that there was a {{reduction in the number of}} larvae in the areas with MD dispensers. The results of the present work indicate that the use of mating disruption is feasible against pyralid moths in storage facilities, and should be further evaluated as a component of an integrated pest management based control strategy...|$|E
40|$|Current insect control {{measures}} for the dried fruit and nut industry depend on fumigation to disinfest {{large volumes of}} incoming product during harvest, {{as well as to}} control storage infestations. The ban on use of methyl bromide (MB) after 2005, and possible restrictions on phosphine (PH 3) create a critical need for economical alternative systems that provide efficacious control and maintain product quality. Because field pests of dried fruits and nuts do not normally reproduce in storage, initial disinfestation of an incoming product is sufficient to reduce damage by these pests. In contrast, stored product pests are capable of repeated infestation during storage, so that long-term protective treatments provide the most efficient control. We tested an integrated method; combining initial controlled atmosphere (CA) disinfestations with subsequent protective treatments of microbial agents, low temperature storage or maintenance levels of CA for postharvest insect control of walnuts, almonds and raisins. An initial disinfestation treatment of 0. 4 % O 2 for 6 days was found to be efficacious against navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella) and <b>raisin</b> <b>moth</b> (Cadra figulilella), both are common field pests of these products. Indianmeal moth (Plodia interpunctella), the most serious storage pest of dried fruits and nuts, was effectively controlled by all storage treatments, including a maintenance CA treatment of 5 % O 2. Overall product quality was unaffected by any storage treatment. We conclude that combining treatments in an integrated control program shows promise as an alternative insect control strategy for dried fruits and nuts...|$|E
