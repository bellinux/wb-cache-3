25|$|After {{starting}} {{at their own}} 20yard line, Tech's quarterback Graham Harrell completed four straight passes {{to bring them to}} midfield. On the fifth play, Harrell's pass was intercepted by Lendy Holmes and returned for a touchdown giving Oklahoma the early lead. The Red Raiders answered on their next two possessions with two field goals to cut Oklahoma's lead to onepoint. On the Sooners' first offensive play, quarterback Sam Bradford handed the ball off to Allen Patrick who quickly fumbled. Bradford suffered a concussion when he tackled the Tech defender who recovered the lost ball. Bradford did not show any immediate signs as he played on the ensuing Oklahoma possession, but he later told quarterbacks coach Josh Heupel that he did not <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the plays from the previous drive and Bradford was benched {{for the remainder of the}} game. Bradford was replaced by backup Joey Halzle.|$|E

Oklahoma was unable to score a touchdown but managed a field goal with less than ten seconds remaining in the first half. Texas Tech went into halftime with a 27–10 lead.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer {{is eating}} doughnuts. One of them splatters onto the nuclear reactor core's {{temperature}} dial, which is nearing the red zone. Homer fails {{to see the}} warning and the plant approaches a nuclear meltdown. He {{seems to be the}} only person who can stop it, though he has no skills and cannot <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his training (due to being distracted and occupied with a Rubik's Cube at the time). In desperation, he chooses a button at random with a counting rhyme, which miraculously averts the meltdown. Springfield is saved and Homer is hailed as a hero. Mr. Burns names Homer [...] "Employee of the Month". Homer's family is also proud of him, especially Lisa, who starts to see him as a role model. Meanwhile, Homer himself is troubled by the fact that his so-called heroism was nothing but luck, and his gloomy mood deepens when he receives a congratulatory phone call from Magic Johnson, who tells Homer [...] "People like that are eventually exposed as the frauds they are".|$|E

500|$|In May 1934, Barrymore was filming Hat, Coat and Glove for RKO when, {{during the}} filming of one scene, he again forgot his lines and even {{the name of his}} character. Filming was {{postponed}} until the following day, but the result was the same. After he took a break for a few days, he returned to the set, but he still could not <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the script, and RKO replaced him with Ricardo Cortez. Soon afterwards, he suffered a mental and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello confirmed that his drinking over the previous two years had worsened, and she described him as a [...] "hopeless alcoholic". Barrymore's relationship with Costello was deeply troubled and, believing she was going to declare him mentally incompetent, he left their home in Los Angeles and traveled first to London and then to India. He returned to the US in early 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his wife in Los Angeles. Shortly after his return, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and influenza. A 19-year-old fan, Elaine Jacobs, visited him, and the two became good friends. On his release from the hospital, her mother invited him to recuperate at their house. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she explained was to get [...] "as near to Barrymore as I dared", and they began a relationship. In May, the couple underwent the first of several professional collaborations, when they appeared on Rudy Vallée's The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour radio show.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{later said}} he [...] "couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the words but it didn't matter—I just made {{them all up}} and we made a great {{wonderful}} noise." [...] Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the {{show that he was}} [...] "so beautiful you made me cry." [...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" [...] has additional backing vocals from Ono, [...] "Money" [...] has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab., utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar.|$|E
500|$|A {{police officer}} interrogates Parker (Julie Gonzalo) about her rape, {{but she does}} not <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> it. Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not {{checking}} to see what was happening. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) sociology professor recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck in a bear trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they just drive her home.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Live Through This began on October 8, 1993 at Triclops Sound Studios in Marietta, Georgia. The studio was booked at {{the recommendation of}} The Smashing Pumpkins, who had recorded their second studio album, Siamese Dream (1993) there. The assigned producers were Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade. The first week of recording was spent recording basic tracks, including drums, bass, scratch guitars, and scratch vocals. After basic tracks were completed, Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, joined the band in-studio before Nirvana were set to tour to promote In Utero. Cobain was presented with the basic tracks and the band invited Cobain to sing on a few unfinished numbers. Cobain initially refused, due to being unfamiliar with the material. When Cobain asked, [...] "how can I sing on it if I haven't heard it?," [...] Love answered by encouraging him to [...] "just sing {{off the top of}} [...] head." [...] Cobain is known to have provided backing vocals to [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] however Kolderie has said Cobain [...] "sang on about five or so , probably [...] "Violet", [...] "Miss World" [...] and [...] "Doll Parts, I can't <b>remember</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the others." [...] After taking a break for dinner, the session devolved into a [...] "formless jam" [...] with Cobain on drums, Love and Erlandson on guitars and producer Sean Slade on bass. Dana Kletter (blackgirls, Dish, Dear Enemy) was asked to sing backing vocals on the record, and appears on seven songs, including Violet, Miss World, Asking For It, Doll Parts, Softer Softest, and She Walks On Me. Producer Sean Slade said, [...] "I {{think one of the reasons}} that Doll Parts might have been a hit is that harmony Dana does on the You will ache like I ache part, it's almost like an Appalachian close harmony against what Courtney is doing. It's very melancholic." [...] There have been rumors that Kletter did more than sing backing vocals, but the band denies it.|$|E

In the novels, such concepts as Alice's surname and her real name, Janus Prospero, are presented. In the films it is never revealed if Alice <b>remembers</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> her past beyond the flashbacks seen in Resident Evil. The novels explain in greater detail her relationships. The first focuses on her relationship with Spence while the third mentions her possible relationship with ex-U.B.C.S soldier, Carlos Olivera.
