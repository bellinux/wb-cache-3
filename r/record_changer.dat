In the early 1950s, Samuel Margolin begins buying auto-changing {{turntables}} from BSR, using them as the basis of his Dansette record player. Over the next twenty years, [...] "Dansette" [...] becomes a household word in Britain. By 1957, BSR has grown to employ 2,600 workers. In addition to manufacturing their own brand of player—the Monarch Automatic <b>Record</b> <b>Changer</b> that could select and play 7", 10" [...] and 12" [...] records at 33, 45 or 78 rpm, changing between the various settings automatically—BSR McDonald supplied turntables and autochangers to most of the world's record player manufacturers, eventually gaining 87% of the market. By 1977, BSR's various factories produced over 250,000 units a week.|$|E
5000|$|First and foremost, V-M was a <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> {{and tape}} deck {{supplier}} (less the electronics) {{to dozens of}} familiar brand names of their day, such as Zenith and Motorola to name only two good customers. V-M Corporation, from the late 1950s through 1968, was the world's largest <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> manufacturer. During the peak years of <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> production, V-M Corporation produced more record changers than all other <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> manufacturers in the world combined. In the early 1960s, V-M Corporation created a <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> advertisement, placed in an audio magazine, stating this fact. Also, in this advertisement, V-M listed their original equipment manufacturers, (customers), by name. BSR Ltd, a British <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> manufacturer, in the 1970s, copied the format of this ad. By 1969, BSR had surpassed V-M Corporation in <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> production {{to become the world}} largest manufacturer of record changers. In several countries, V-M record changers were produced under license. Telefunken, of then West Germany, was an example, of one such manufacturer sign a licensing agreement with V-M Corporation, to utilize their <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> technology. These large <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> production volumes helped V-M keep its own Voice of Music brand profitable for many years. After 1965, the trend became clear that American audio companies were going out of business or shifting production overseas. As V-M's <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> volumes declined, it became difficult for the company to remain profitable. Retailing began to change from small [...] "mom and pop" [...] stores (V-M's strength) to large electronics retailers where V-M was under-represented. At the end of 1972 year, V-M quit offering console stereos and terminated all tape recorder models, for sale to retail customers, with the exception of an eight track player. At the end of the 1974 year, all their other remaining retail products, except record changers, were discontinued-compact and portable stereo systems, and all other retail audio components, such as receivers, amplifiers and speaker systems. After 1974, V-M record changers were the only consumer product sold to the retail market as components. Record changers continued to be sold to original equipment manufacturers up to the bankruptcy, in mid July, of the 1977 year. Cassette decks still produced, after leaving the retail consumer market, were highly specialized professional units. Some of the companies that bought these professional cassette decks were New Century Education Corporation, Beltone, and Terra Technology. V-M also did contract engineering projects for various manufacturers, along with some assembly projects for outside companies. For the December 1976 Christmas Season, V-M assembled an electronic ping pong game for Factory Direct Marketing. V-M filed for bankruptcy in mid July 1977 when a power failure, in New York City, prevented a wire transfer of critically needed funds.|$|E

50|$|The Webster Chicago Corporation was a {{maker of}} {{electronic}} equipment in Chicago, Illinois. Many products were sold under the brand name Webcor. The product line included <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> wire recorders and reel to reel tape recorders. They also made phonograph amplifiers that are now used as guitar amplifiers in some cases. These amplifiers' sounds {{are similar to the}} sounds of the Fender Princeton. They are valued for their all-tube signal path and hand-wired circuit. Many Webster-Chicago <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> were installed in Magnavox home entertainment systems in the 1940s and early 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|This [...] "drop-automatic sequence" [...] was {{designed}} for <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> which simply dropped records rather than reversing the stack as it was played in sequence. Other <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> including some made {{as far back as}} the 1930s by RCA and GE in addition to the much later Thorens TD-224, were capable of reversing the stack automatically. The RCA and GE units kept the records stacked on the turntable and slid the top record to the side after playing it. A separate sequence, the [...] "slide-automatic sequence," [...] was made for these changers, with sides coupled 1&5, 2&6, 3&7 and 4&8.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> {{could play}} {{both sides of}} each record. Manual {{sequence}} (sides coupled 1&2, 3&4, 5&6 and 7&8) worked with these. Examples were the Markel 75, Capehart turnover, Fisher/Lincoln, Garrard RC-100, and Thorens Symphony CD50/CD53 changers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cost and}} {{complexity}} of the unit eventually led to the Fisher Lincoln <b>Record</b> <b>Changer's</b> demise. According to Schneller, [...] "I think the cost of the machine doomed it. We (also) had a problem with quality. We couldn't consistently build them".|$|R
5|$|Tommy {{was finally}} {{released}} on 17 May 1969 in the US, and 23 May in the UK, because of delays with the cover. The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate <b>record</b> <b>changers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Record sales {{picked up}} appreciably {{by the late}} 30s and early 40s, with greater {{improvements}} in fidelity and more money to be spent. By this time home phonographs had become much more common, though it wasn't until the 1940s that console radio/phono set-ups with automatic <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> became more common.|$|R

50|$|A <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> or autochanger is {{a device}} that plays {{multiple}} phonograph records in sequence without user intervention. Record changers {{first appeared in the}} late 1920s, and were common until the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|V-M Corporation {{was founded}} in June 1944 by Walter Miller in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The company {{originally}} manufactured only 78 rpm <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> and labeled them simply as [...] "A V-M Product". The brand name [...] "Voice of Music" [...] was suggested by a V-M engineer and first used in 1952.|$|R
5000|$|With {{regard to}} records, most double album sets have sides {{one and two}} back to back on the first disc, {{followed}} by sides three and four on the second disc, etc. The record industry term for this practice is [...] "manual sequence." [...] However, some double album LP sets have sides one and four pressed on one disc along with sides two and three on the other. This practice, known as [...] "automatic sequence," [...] began {{in the era of}} 78s and was intended {{to make it easier for}} listeners to play through the entire set in order on automatic <b>record</b> <b>changers.</b> The use of automatic sequence gradually declined during the 1970s as automatic <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> fell out of favor. High quality manual turntables became more affordable and are often preferred because they cause less record wear.|$|R
5000|$|The double {{album was}} {{released}} in the US with a special reduced list price of $7.98, only $1.00 more than the standard $6.98 of most single-disc albums in 1976. The album was pressed in [...] "automatic sequence", with sides one and four on one record, followed by sides two and three on the other. This arrangement was intended {{to make it easier}} to listen through the whole album in sequence on automatic <b>record</b> <b>changers.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the LP release, side one {{was backed}} with side six, side two was backed with side five, and side three was backed with side four. This was common on multi-LP sets of the time, to {{accommodate}} the popular <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> turntables.|$|E
5000|$|First V-M {{designed}} a two speed changer after Columbia Records introduced the LP in 1948. V-M then added the 45rpm speed after RCA brought that innovation to market in 1949. Finally V-M added the fourth speed (16⅔ rpm) for [...] "talking books" [...] in 1954. The changer mechanism, {{used throughout the}} fifties, sixties, and the seventies was developed in 1950. The basic design was retained until <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> production was terminated. The changer mechanism, responsible for operating the tone arm and the dropping of the records, was updated throughout the years to keep V-M's record changers competitive with their competitors, as technology advanced. The speed control mechanism was, however, completely redesigned in 1961. V-M Corporation claimed that their record changers were jam proof. These V-M record changers had a reputation of being both well built and reliable. These mass-produced record changers, while competitive with other manufactures mass-produced record changers, i.e. BSR and Garrard, in both build quality and product specifications, were not competitive with professional record changers. Like other mass-produced record changers, the tone arms had heavier vertical tracking force (VTF), poorer speed accuracy, and poorer rumble specification than the professional record changers. V-M mass-produced record changers, like their competitors mass-produced record changers, were used in low to medium priced audio equipment-compact stereo systems, console stereos, and portable stereo systems. They were sold also as separate components. Most had ceramic cartridges and diamond styluses (needles), with a separate stylus for 78rpm records. Most had two pole synchronous motors. V-M developed their first professional <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> in 1966. This <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> had a twenty-four pole synchronous motor, and a separate motor for operating the tone arm and lowering the record to the turntable. This professional <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> was only a two speed unit-it did not play 78rpm records. This professional <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> was marketed under the Voice of Music trademark, and also sold to other manufactures such as Sherwood, Philco Ford and Westinghouse. V-M's second generation professional record changers design was developed in 1971, and was sold to BIC. V-M's deteriorating financial condition did not permit V-M to market this design under the Voice of Music trade mark.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 65 {{played only}} 33⅓ rpm and was marketed as a Lincoln Fisher <b>Record</b> <b>Changer.</b> The company tried selling them through Steinway dealers, but had more success working with {{specialty}} installers. Austin King {{was a local}} dealer. Lincoln stopped selling record changers in 1965. (Redenbaugh) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 Admiral Corporation listed four {{manufacturing}} plants in Illinois. These {{were identified as}} subsidiaries of Admiral International Corp. of which Norman E. Johnson was named President. The Chicago headquarters was located at 3800 West Cortland street and identified Ross D. Siragusa as Chairman and President, Cy S. Rossate Vice President in charge of production and William L. Dunn Vice President of engineering and stated a work force of 2,100 employees. This factory listed as its product line; television sets & combinations, radios, <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> refrigerators, ranges, freezers, air conditioners, dehumidifiers and stereophonic phonographs. A second Chicago facility was located at 4150 North Knox avenue that had a work force of 230 employees that made <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> power supplies and metal stampings. At Galesburg, Illinois the Midwest Manufacturing Corporation was listed as a subsidiary of Admiral Corp. with George Heidenblut as Vice President of engineering and a labor force of 1,400 employees that made refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, dehumidifiers and ranges. The Harvard, Illinois plant located on South Division street listed Ernest Polichio as plant manager and its 2,000 employees made television sets. The Admiral work force in Illinois totaled 5,730 employees in 1962.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, cheaper {{portable}} {{record players}} and <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> which played stacks of records in wooden console cabinets were popular, usually with heavy and crude tonearms in the portables. The consoles were often equipped with better quality pick-ups. Even pharmacies stocked 45 rpm records at their front counters. Rock music played on 45s became the soundtrack to the 1960s as people bought the same songs that were played {{free of charge}} on the radio. Some record players were even tried in automobiles, but were quickly displaced by 8-track and cassette tapes.|$|R
50|$|Turntables called <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> {{could play}} <b>records</b> stacked {{vertically}} on a spindle. This arrangement encouraged {{the production of}} multiple-record sets in automatic sequence. A two-record set had Side 1 and Side 4 on one record, and Side 2 and Side 3 on the other, so the first two sides could play in a changer without the listener's intervention. Then the stack was flipped over. Larger boxed sets used appropriate automatic sequencing (1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5) to allow continuous playback, but this created difficulties when searching for an individual track.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1954, RCA {{introduced}} [...] "Gruve-Gard" [...] {{where the}} center and edge of a disc are thickerthan the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when used on a turntable with a <b>record</b> <b>changer.</b> Most of RCA Victor Records' competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.|$|E
5000|$|These {{songs were}} {{featured}} on a two-disc twelve-inch, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. DAU-3. [...] The album was auto-coupled {{for ease of}} playing with a <b>record</b> <b>changer.</b> Parts one and two were recorded on June 13, 1947, and parts three and four on June 16, 1947.|$|E
50|$|While {{working as}} an editor for the book {{publishers}} Simon & Schuster, Keepnews moonlighted as editor of The <b>Record</b> <b>Changer,</b> a small jazz magazine, after fellow Columbia graduate Bill Grauer became its owner in 1948. Keepnews wrote {{one of the earliest}} profiles of Thelonious Monk, then little known, for the publication.|$|E
50|$|The first Tefifon {{players and}} {{cartridges}} {{for home use}} came available in the German market {{towards the end of}} the 1940s, but couldn't compete with the popular phonographic disc format readily already available at the time. One reason was that well-known artists were committed exclusively by contract to major record companies, most of which had no interest in offering their artists' albums on Tefifon tapes. As a result, most Tefifon releases were of relatively unknown bands and artists. In addition, the Tefifon saw competition from phonographs equipped with <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> some of which could allow for up to three hours of music without interruption.|$|R
50|$|Wegeforth enjoyed cars; {{he bought}} new Overland Automobile {{around the time}} of his marriage, and in 1923 went into debt to buy an eight-cylinder, fully {{equipped}} Packard which he paid to have repainted fire engine red, then traded in within a year. A fan of music, he often researched details on the latest phonographs and <b>record</b> <b>changers.</b> His hobbies included building radios, shooting, and photography; he created a large collection of color slides documenting the Zoo and his worldwide travels. He was a 32nd-degree Mason, and joined many San Diego social and country clubs. For sport he enjoyed football and baseball and was an active horseback rider. His favorite author was Rudyard Kipling, and his favorite novel was Kim.|$|R
5000|$|Numbering of {{the sides}} of the discs in many double and triple albums (and boxed sets of records (both 78s and LPs) in a certain {{sequence}} enabled them to be stacked and played on <b>record</b> <b>changers.</b> After the discs were stacked and one side of each disc had played, the entire stack would be turned over and replaced on the changer shelf. Thus, to be heard in the proper sequence, each disc of a four-disc set would contain, respectively, [...] "sides" [...] 1&8, 2&7, 3&6 and 4&5 - a practice known as [...] "automatic sequencing", [...] "changer sequencing" [...] or [...] "auto-coupling". In pre-LP days, classical symphonies and concertos, and later, original cast albums, would be recorded using this format.|$|R
5000|$|All {{songs were}} {{recorded}} on June 23, 1949, [...] written by Don Raye and Gene De Paul, directed by Simon Rady and featuring Victor Young and His Orchestra. The songs were featured on a 2-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album DAU-725 which was auto-coupled {{for ease of}} playing with a <b>record</b> <b>changer.</b>|$|E
50|$|On June 24, 1952, Lincoln {{patented}} a vacuum-operated <b>record</b> <b>changer</b> {{capable of}} changing records of various dimensions including 78s, 33⅓ rpm, 16 speed and 45s. Because the unit was vacuum driven, it would stall if the record became hung up, without {{damage to the}} record. Old changers that were mechanically driven would jam under these conditions and crush records.|$|E
50|$|Don began {{listening}} to jazz records {{while still in}} high school and started drawing jazz musicians at the University of Iowa, where he often attended jam sessions and played trombone in a college band. During the 1940s, Anderson also served as the staff artist and designed many of the covers for the The <b>Record</b> <b>Changer</b> magazine, often signing them with his initials, DMA.|$|E
50|$|Audiophiles {{eventually}} disdained <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> {{because of}} the perceived compromise in fidelity resulting from changes in tone arm angle with {{the height of the}} stack, and concerns about changers' seemingly rough treatment of discs, particularly due to slight but cumulative damage to the spindle holes as the records were dropped from a height of a few inches onto the record or stack below or the turntable platter, as well as some sliding and rubbing of the discs together, scratching the record labels in the process, because the dropped disc didn't immediately accelerate to the rotational speed of the spindle or discs below it. Most of these fears were unfounded in changers made after 1953. More advanced changers, such as the TD-224 model from Thorens and the ADC Accutrac+6, partially addressed these problems.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the Pico {{engineers}} jointly {{developed a}} LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham Sound Reproducers, {{at the time}} the largest manufacturer of <b>record</b> <b>changers</b> in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.|$|R
5000|$|Almost all analog disc {{records were}} {{recorded}} {{at a constant}} angular speed, resulting in a decreasing linear speed toward the disc's center. The result was a maximum level of signal distortion due to low groove velocity nearest {{the center of the}} disc, called [...] "end-groove distortion". Loud musical passages were most audibly affected. Since some music, especially classical music, tends to start quietly and mount to a loud climax, such distortion could be minimized if the disc was recorded to play beginning at the inner end of the groove. A few such records were issued, but the domination of automatic <b>record</b> <b>changers,</b> and the fact that symphony movements, for example, varied greatly in length and could be difficult to arrange appropriately on 20-minute disc sides, made them no more than curiosities.|$|R
