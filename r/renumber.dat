5|$|In April 1963, {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{proposed}} renumbering I-80S to I-76 and I-280 to I-276 because the spurs of I-80S did not connect to I-80 in northern Pennsylvania. The renumbering {{was approved by the}} Federal Highway Administration on February 26, 1964. With this renumbering, the tollway would carry I-80S between the Ohio border and Pittsburgh, I-76 between Pittsburgh and King of Prussia, I-70 between New Stanton and Breezewood, and I-276 between King of Prussia and Bristol. In 1971, {{the state of}} Ohio wanted to eliminate I-80S, replacing it with a realigned I-76. The state of Pennsylvania disagreed with the change and recommended that I-80S become I-376 instead. The Pennsylvania government later changed its mind and supported Ohio's plan to <b>renumber</b> I-80S as I-76. In December of that year, the change was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials. As a result, I-76 would follow the highway between the Ohio border and King of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Though the National Freeway was {{designated}} as US48, as {{the completion of}} the freeway neared, the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway came up. In the 1980s, the project to improve US50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis to Interstate Highway standards had been assigned the designation of I-68. MDSHA, however, later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers, since about half the freeway already had two route designations (US50 and US301) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US50 designation. This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible, and so in 1989, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States, approved MDSHA's request to <b>renumber</b> the US50 freeway from I-68 to I-595. That same year, AASHTO approved changing US48's designation to I-68. This change took effect upon {{the completion of the}} last section of the National Freeway, on August 2, 1991.|$|E

The {{state would be}} asking communities along NY281 for their approval to make the change. On March 8, 1965, the Board of Directors of the Cortland County Chamber of Commerce voted unanimously to oppose the renumbering, following actions of the Cortland County Motel Association, who mounted an even larger opposition.

25|$|Interstate 795 {{began in}} 2007 as a {{renumbering}} of the US 117 freeway. Since oversized trucks couldn't use US 117 the state {{decided to get}} the road approved for Interstate designation. On September 28, 2007 AASHTO decided to approve the I-795 designation. The state quickly began to <b>renumber</b> mile posts, update signs and move US 117 back to its original designation. In 2008 major flaws in {{the surface of the}} highway began to develop. The thin road surface had begun to deteriorate mainly because of heavy truck use. The pavement was found to have flaws along the entire route and the FHWA decided that the highway should be resurfaced adding an extra 2.5 to 3 inches to the surface. The project of resurfacing the road was completed in 2010 and was later awarded the Sheldon G. Hayes Award for the best highway construction project and the smoothest road of 2011.|$|E

25|$|A {{year later}} KES started taking {{delivery}} of the more modern Class U trams. In 1902 KES was forced to <b>renumber</b> all its trams to avoid confusion with its competitor Kristiania Sporveisselskap (KSS), and all trams were thus numbered from 101 and upwards. KES started taking {{delivery of the}} larger Class SS trams in 1909. With them the Class A was regarded as small and from 1910 the company started rebuilding them to trailers. The original trailers originally {{did not have any}} braking system, and with increasing speeds this became necessary to install from 1912 to 1914. At the same time the wheelbase was increased. The last motorized versions were taken out of service after the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. No. 102 was never rebuilt and kept as a shunter. It was therefore possible to retire it as a heritage tram in 1919. It was then rebuilt to its original design at delivery and has since been transferred to the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology.|$|E
25|$|Cavour {{moved to}} {{challenge}} republican unification efforts by Garibaldi by organizing popular revolts in the Papal States and used these revolts {{as a pretext}} to invade the country, even though the invasion angered the Roman Catholics, whom he told that the invasion {{was an effort to}} protect the Roman Catholic Church from the anti-clerical secularist nationalist republicans of Garibaldi. Only {{a small portion of the}} Papal States around Rome remained in the control of Pope Pius IX. Despite their differences, Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. Subsequently, the Parliament declared the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 18 February 1861 (officially proclaiming it on 17 March 1861) composed of both Northern Italy and Southern Italy. King Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy was then declared King of Italy, though he did not <b>renumber</b> himself with the assumption of the new title.

500|$|U.S. Route 491 (US491) is a north–south U.S. Highway {{serving the}} Four Corners {{region of the}} United States. One of the newest designations in the U.S. Highway System, it was created in 2003 as a {{renumbering}} of U.S. Route 666 (US666). With the 666 designation, this road was nicknamed the [...] "Devil's Highway" [...] because {{of the significance of}} number 666 to many Christian denominations, which is believed by some that 666 is the Number of the Beast. This Satanic connotation, combined with a high fatality rate along the New Mexico portion, convinced some people the highway was cursed. The problem was compounded by persistent sign theft. These factors led to two efforts to <b>renumber</b> the highway, first by officials in Arizona, later in New Mexico. There have been safety improvement projects in recent years, and fatality rates have subsequently decreased.|$|E

500|$|The {{route in}} the other three states became U.S. Route 491 in 2003, mainly through efforts of New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson. He {{requested}} the change due to the [...] "infamy brought by the inopportune naming of the road". While campaigning for governor, Richardson promised to <b>renumber</b> the highway {{as part of a}} larger plan to improve the highway and build relations between New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. Although traditional Navajo culture does not share the belief of 666 being an evil number, some Navajos had attempted for years to change the number as a way to raise awareness about the dangerous highway. The highway had largely been ignored, with few improvements made since it was first paved. By 1997, US666 was named one of the 20most dangerous highways in the United States. Some Navajo leaders were concerned that efforts to reduce poverty on Navajo lands, via promoting tourism and outside investment, were being hampered by the Christian aversion to the number.|$|E

Although the next three-digit child of US91 would have been U.S. Route291, both the 291 and 391 designations were already in use as state route numbers {{in at least one}} of the affected states. At the news that the motion had passed, a New Mexico spokesperson stated, [...] "The devil's out of here, and we say goodbye and good riddance." [...] Referring to the motion passing with a different number from what New Mexico requested, another spokesperson responded, [...] "As long as it's not 666 and it's nothing satanic, that's OK."

500|$|When the Interstate Highway System {{was created}} in the 1950s, the Vine Street Expressway, Ben Franklin Bridge, and part of the North-South Freeway were {{to become a part of}} it.

In 1958, this freeway was initially planned as I-895 and I-380 before the American Association of State Highway Officials designated it as a part of I-80S. [...] Meanwhile, I-680 was designated along the present-day Schuylkill Expressway between the Vine Street Expressway and the Walt Whitman Bridge. By 1960, the Vine Street Expressway had been completed between the Schuylkill Expressway and 18th Street. The portion of I-80S in New Jersey on the North-South Freeway had opened south of Morgan Boulevard by this time. On April 16, 1963, Pennsylvania wanted to <b>renumber</b> its Interstate numbers. Part of this was the renumbering from I-80S into I-76, and all of its auxiliary routes into I-x76. The Federal Highway Administration approved the request on February 26, 1964. As a result, I-80S became I-76 and I-680 became I-676. In 1972, the I-76 and the I-676 designations were switched onto their current routes.
