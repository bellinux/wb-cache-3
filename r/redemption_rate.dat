Stores serving low-income shoppers differ in important ways from stores that receive less of their revenues from Food Stamp redemptions. Stores with more revenues from Food Stamps are generally smaller and older, and offer relatively fewer convenience services for shoppers. They also offer a different mix of products, with a relatively high portion of sales coming from meat and private-label products. Metro stores with high Food Stamp <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> lag behind other stores in the adoption of progressive supply chain and human resource practices.

40|$|To {{protect the}} most {{vulnerable}} groups from malaria (pregnant women and infants) the Tanzanian Government introduced a subsidy (voucher) scheme in 2004, {{on the basis of}} a public-private partnership. These vouchers are provided to pregnant women at their first antenatal care visit and mothers of infants at first vaccination. The vouchers are redeemed at registered retailers for a long-lasting insecticidal net against the payment of a modest top-up price. The present work analysed a large body of data from the Tanzanian National Voucher Scheme, focusing on interactions with concurrent mass distribution campaigns of free nets.; In an ecologic study involving all regions of Tanzania, voucher redemption data for the period 2007   2011, as well as data on potential determinants of voucher redemption were analysed. The four outcome variables were: pregnant woman and infant voucher <b>redemption</b> <b>rates,</b> use of treated bed nets by all household members and by under- five children. Each of the outcomes was regressed with selected determinants, using a generalized estimating equation model and accounting for regional data clustering.; There was a consistent improvement in voucher <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> over the selected time period, with rates < 80 % in 2011. The major determinants of <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> were the top-up price paid by the voucher beneficiary, the retailer- clinic ratio, and socio-economic status.

Setting: Two WIC clinics in areas that have high <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> for WIC checks and one clinic in an area with low <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> in Washington State. Participants: Twenty three WIC participants in five focus groups. Phenomenon of interest: Barriers and enhancers of WIC check redemption, especially the cash value voucher (CVV) for fruits and vegetables. Analysis: Transcriptions were coded; coded statements were organized into major themes across a socioecologic framework. Coding structures and analysis were strengthened by iterative interactions between researchers. Results: Barriers to redemption arise from multiple sociological levels, but benefits and positive factors, as well as solutions participants use, may lessen the effects of barriers. Factors negatively impacting the WIC shopping experience included food package policies, grocery store experiences, and personal misunderstanding and embarrassment; positive factors included helpful vendors and both vendor and participant understandings {{about the use of}} CVV.

Nevertheless, WIC food instrument <b>redemption</b> <b>rate</b> analysis, together with geographic information systems, might be helpful in pinpointing areas around the country where physical food availability problems might exist. Background Food insecurity has been defined as lack of "assured access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life " (Andrews, 1999). Food inse-curity may be exacerbated in rural areas vis-a-vis urban areas because of transportation issues and less well-stocked grocery stores with more expen-sive items (Kaufian, 1997). To help study possible regional variation in food accessibility, food instrument (voucher) redemption records are available from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Program, whose purpose it is to provide food supplements and nutritional education for low-income women and their small children (Food Research and Action Cen-ter). Qualified individuals can redeem WIC-issued instuments for specified food items from authorized grocers or vendors. Rates of redemption can vary. Previous research has shown a significant difference in California WIC food instrument redemption rates between members of various ethnic and linguistic groups. Notably, limited English-speaking house-holds were generally found to have higher food in-strument redemption rates than primarily English-speaking households (Matthews, 2000). See Figures la and lb.

40|$|Purpose - In 2009, US coupons set a {{new record}} of 367 billion coupons distributed. Yet, while coupon {{distribution}} is on the rise, <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> remain below 1 percent. This paper aims to show how recognizing context variables, such as proximity, weather, part of town and financial incentives interplay to determine a coupon campaign's success. Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports an empirical study conducted in co-operation with a restaurant chain: 9. 880 Subway coupons were distributed under different experimental context conditions. Redemption behavior was analyzed {{with the help of}} logistic regressions. Findings - It was found that even though proximity drives coupon redemption, city center campaigns seem to be much more sensitive to distance than suburban areas. The further away the distribution place from the restaurant, the less does the amount of monetary incentive determine the motivation to redeem. Practical implications - When designing a coupon campaign for a company, coupon distribution should not follow a "one-is-good-for-all-strategy" even for one marketer within one product category. Instead each coupon strategy should carefully consider contextual influence. Originality/value - This paper is the first to the authors' knowledge that systematically investigates the impact of context variables on coupon redemption.

40|$|Targeting {{customer}} segments with tailored promotional {{activities is}} {{widely recognized as}} a potential successful strategy to gain more of existing customers’ discretionary spending. Most previous research focuses on the selection of promising customers for targeting and typically ignores the decision of which specific product category to select for inclusion in such targeted promotions. We present an innovative two-stage decision-support tool that assists managers in selecting promising categories from large assortments for inclusion in targeted promotions. To empirically test {{the performance of the}} derived segment-level category promotions, we implemented and validated our decision-support tool in cooperation with a major home-delivery grocery retailer using a large-scale controlled field experiment. Results point to a very successful campaign: our <b>redemption</b> <b>rates</b> are among the highest reported in both academic and managerial literature. What is more, targeted promotions clearly outperform non-targeted ones in terms of coupon redemption. Yet, not all targeted promotions change purchase behavior successfully. We show that customers who use a coupon where the most influential “draw" category was promoted engage in true cross-category purchases, resulting in an average extra boost in overall shopping basket size of about 10 percentage points (in €-amount and number of SKUs) vis-à-vis a control group. We therefore show that our procedure is an important decision-support tool that can help managers with making smart decisions regarding which category to promote for which customer. status: publishe...|$|R

A key measure of the success of such interventions is the extent to which the programmes have succeeded in reaching the target populations. This article estimates the coverage of facility deliveries by a maternal health voucher programme in South-western Uganda and examines whether such coverage is correlated with district-level characteristics such as poverty density and the number of contracted facilities. Analysis entails estimating the voucher coverage of health facility deliveries among the general population and poor population (PP) using programme data for 2010, which was the most complete calendar year of implementation of the Uganda safe motherhood (SM) voucher programme. The results show that: (1) the programme paid for 38 % of estimated deliveries among the PP in the targeted districts, (2) there was a significant negative correlation between the poverty density in a district and proportions of births to poor women that were covered by the programme and (3) improving coverage of health facility deliveries for poor women is dependent upon increasing the sales and <b>redemption</b> <b>rates.</b> The findings suggest that to the extent that the programme stimulated demand for SM services by new users, it has the potential of increasing facility-based births among poor women in the region.
