50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of physically editing tapes were many. Some broadcasters decreed that edited tapes {{could not be}} reused, {{in an era when}} the relatively high cost of the machines and tapes was balanced by the savings involved in being able to wipe and reuse the media. Others, such as the BBC, allowed reuse of <b>spliced</b> <b>tape</b> in certain circumstances as long as it conformed to strict criteria about the number of splices in a given duration, usually a maximum of five splices for every half hour. The process required great skill, and often resulted in edits that would roll (lose sync) and each edit required several minutes to perform, although this was also initially true of the electronic editing that came later.|$|R
5000|$|For the recording, Reich {{used two}} normal Wollensak tape {{recorders}} {{with the same}} recording, originally attempting to align the phrase with itself at the halfway point (180 degrees). However, due to the imprecise technology in 1965, the two recordings fell out of sync, with one tape gradually falling ahead or behind the other due to minute differences in the machines, {{the length of the}} <b>spliced</b> <b>tape</b> loops, and playback speed. Reich decided to exploit what is known as phase shifting, where all possible recursive harmonies are explored before the two loops eventually get back in sync. The following year, Reich created another composition, Come Out, in which the phrase [...] "come out to show them" [...] is looped to create the same effect.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, 3M {{introduced}} the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits {{could not be}} accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and <b>splicing</b> <b>tape.</b> So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital [...] "word". Unfortunately, the only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit [...] "word" [...] for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50 kHz). It {{was known to be}} the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accepted}} world {{standard was}} created by Sony along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and Mitsubishi Corporation created a different 32 track digital recorder.

So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the [...] "DASH" [...] format meaning, [...] " [...] Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the dynamic range and signal to noise ratios.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years, many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} carried out on the bond strength between normal strength concrete (NSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> bars <b>spliced</b> in tension zones in beams. Many codes gave a minimum splice length for tension and compression reinforcement as a factor of the bar diameter depending on many parameters such as concrete strength, steel yield stress, shape of bar end, shape of bar surface and also bar location. Also, codes gave another restriction about the percentage of total reinforcement to be spliced at the same time. Comparatively limited attention has been directed toward the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> bars <b>spliced</b> in tension zones in beams. HSC has high modulus of elasticity, high density and long-term durability. This research presents an experimental study on the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and <b>reinforcing</b> bars <b>spliced</b> in tension zones in beams. It reports the influence of several parameters on bond in splices. The parameters covered are casting position, splice length as a factor of bar diameter, bar diameter and reinforcement ratio. The research involved tests on sixteen simply-supported beams of 1800 mm span, 200 mm width and 400 mm thickness made of HSC. In each beam, the total tensile steel bars were spliced in the constant moment zone. Crack pattern, crack propagation, cracking load, failure load and mi span deflection were recorded and analyzed to study the mentioned parameters effect...|$|R
