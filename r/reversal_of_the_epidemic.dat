40|$|Genetics {{of common}} {{progressive}} renal disease. Familial aggregation of common chronic kidney diseases provides {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate the susceptibility genetic and environmental factors. In the past decade, a wealth of new data has become available concerning the genetic susceptibility leading to numerous nephropathies. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic components allows better understanding of initiation and progression of these chronic kidney diseases. In addition, one can envision that identification of genetically susceptible individuals might lead to earlier diagnosis and potential <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> end-stage renal disease. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current discussion is to review various issues pertaining to <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> genetic factors in common chronic kidney diseases, as exemplified by two leading causes of end-stage renal diseases worldwide, nephropathy of type 2 diabetes and IgA nephropathy. The genetic and environmental interplay leading to the nephropathies is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|The study {{assessed}} <b>the</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universal Basic Education Programme in Nigeria {{to effectively}} implement the Family Life HIV Education Curriculum. Using descriptive statistics, the study has analysed and presented graphs and tables of various {{national and regional}} public primary school data from 2004 to 2008 to showcase trends of available capacity in the UBE programme. Pupil enrolment is gradually on the increase in Nigeria {{and even though the}} pupil/teacher ratio is inadequate, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers in the UBE programme are qualified. <b>The</b> total number <b>of</b> existing public primary schools, classrooms and qualified teachers are not equitably distributed in <b>the</b> various regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country.

5000|$|AFCA’s {{approach}} to HIV care is family oriented. In {{addition to providing}} care for HIV-infected children from ages 0 through 19, the organization provides pregnant women who are HIV positive with the antiretroviral medication required to prevent <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> HIV to their unborn children. This preventive care is an important aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> care provided by AFCA since according to UNAIDS, <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global HIV <b>epidemic</b> will not occur {{unless there is a}} decrease in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> new HIV infections. [...] AFCA also provides antiretroviral and other medicines for <b>the</b> HIV-positive guardians <b>of</b> infected children to prolong the guardians’ lives, thus preventing the children from becoming orphans. Believing that children and guardians in their programs should become self-reliant, AFCA provides livestock (goats, chickens, sheep, pigs, guinea fowl, and rabbits) to families who've been affected by HIV/AIDS and who want to escape <b>the</b> ravages <b>of</b> poverty. With training and monthly follow ups, the families are able to provide for themselves and not to rely on outside help.|$|R

40|$|Most {{published}} estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been developed from the societal perspective, attempting to measure <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> to society in this country. Although societal cost analysis is well-developed, relatively {{little is known about}} many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors influencing <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic</b> to business firms.

Societal costs include direct costs, the resources used in providing health care, and indirect costs, the resources lost to society as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>epidemic.</b> Costs to business include illness-based employment costs, legal or administrative costs, prevention costs, perception-based employment costs, care giver costs, and nonmonetary costs. Not all societal costs are borne by business, and businesses may incur costs that are not traditionally measured from the societal perspective...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that cytosolic calcium transiently increases after <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sarcolemmal Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger. Calcium released from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) constituted <b>the</b> major part <b>of</b> this cytosolic transient. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to test whether <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger affects SR calcium content, and whether altered SR calcium content is associated with direct triggering of SR calcium release or calcium release secondary to SR calcium overload. To this purpose we studied <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> SR calcium content after <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger and the dependence on <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> change of its free energy (delta Gexch) in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. The Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger was reversed by abrupt reduction of extracellular sodium ([Na+]o). <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> change of deltaGexch was varied with [Na+]o. Cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) was measured with indo- 1 and SR calcium content was estimated from <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> [Ca 2 +]i after rapid cooling (RC). SR function was manipulated either by blockade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SR Ca 2 +-ATPase with thapsigargin or by blockade of SR calcium release channels with tetracaine. <b>Reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger caused a transient increase of [Ca 2 +]i of about 180 s duration with a time to peak of about 30 s. During the first 30 s rapid small amplitude cytosolic calcium fluctuations were superimposed on this transient. <b>The</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> [Ca 2 +]i to RC, during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytosolic [Ca 2 +]i transient, also transiently increased from 174 in control myocytes to 480 nmol/l at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peak value. After correction of [Ca 2 +]i data for <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> mitochondrially compartmentalized indo- 1 and mitochondrial calcium, total calcium released from SR after RC was calculated with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> literature data on cytosolic calcium buffer capacity. Contrary to the measured RC-dependent increase of measured [Ca 2 +]i, after <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger, calculated total calcium released from SR transiently decreased. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> SR calcium depletion after <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger increased with <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> change of deltaGexch. Restitution of [Na+]o 30 s after <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger, greatly accelerated both recovery of [Ca 2 +]i and SR calcium content. Pretreatment of myocytes with thapsigargin caused almost entire depletion of SR and substantial reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytosolic transient <b>of</b> [Ca 2 +]i following <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger. Application of tetracaine hardly affected SR calcium content, but caused an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SR calcium content following <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger, while the cytosolic transient increase of [Ca 2 +]i was substantially reduced. We conclude that <b>reversal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger directly triggers SR calcium release and decreases SR calcium content in a deltaGexch dependent manne...|$|R
