5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E

At length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.|$|E

25|$|Some {{governments have}} begun to {{approach}} slums as a possible opportunity to urban development by slum upgrading. This approach was inspired {{in part by the}} theoretical writings of John Turner in 1972. The approach seeks to upgrade the slum with basic infrastructure such as sanitation, safe drinking water, safe electricity distribution, paved roads, rain water drainage system, and bus/metro stops. The assumption behind this approach is that if slums are given basic services and tenure security – that is, the slum will not be destroyed and slum <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> not be evicted, then the <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> rebuild their own housing, engage their slum community to live better, and over time attract investment from government organizations and businesses. Turner argued to demolish the housing, but to improve the environment: if governments can clear existing slums of unsanitary human waste, polluted water and litter, and from muddy unlit lanes, {{they do not have to}} worry about the shanty housing. Squatters have shown great organizational skills in terms of land management and will maintain the infrastructure that is provided.|$|E

40|$|Residents are key {{stakeholders}} {{of tourism}} destinations. Yet, to date, no study has investigated if and how residents {{can contribute to}} destination recovery when a disaster hits. The emergence of peer-to-peer networks offers an efficient platform for residents to open their homes to displaced tourists. Such help is particularly critical if key tourist infrastructure is severely damaged. But are <b>residents</b> <b>willing</b> to open their homes and help in other ways? The present study adopts a scenario-based survey research design, including Australians who live in tourism regions and Australian tourists. Results indicate that (1) segments of <b>residents</b> <b>willing</b> to support the tourism industry in disaster situations exist, and (2) tourists {{are willing to accept}} residents’ offers of support. The more immediate the emergency, the higher the willingness to help and accept help. These insights point to the potential of involving residents in destination recovery efforts...|$|R

25|$|Supporters of {{traditional}} work hours contend that much may be {{learned in the}} hospital during the extended time. Some argue that it remains unclear whether patient safety is enhanced or harmed by a reduction in work hours which necessarily lead to more transitions in care. Some of the clinical work traditionally performed by residents has been shifted to other healthcare workers such as ward clerks, nurses, laboratory personnel, and phlebotomists. It has also resulted in a shift of some resident work towards home work, where <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> complete paperwork and other duties at home as to not have to log the hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was to present the revised plan to the Board of Supervisors by February 2009 in order to decide if the 11-member board would {{recommend}} to continue with the congestion pricing plan. The plan will need approval at the local and state legislative levels, and possibly some non-objection at the federal level. It has not been decided if San Francisco <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> vote to approve the plan's implementation. Final study results were expected by late 2009, and SFCTA staff estimates that if the proposal moves forward in 2009, implementation will still take several years, as at least two to three years would be spent doing the environmental studies required by law.|$|E

25|$|Foxes, {{particularly}} red foxes, {{have been}} inhabiting and breeding in human-populated areas since the twentieth century. They have adapted well to these environments, {{taking advantage of}} man-made features such as houses and gardens to create dens. For sustenance, they take advantage of food thrown away by humans. In some cases, human <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> feed foxes that frequent their local area. In this sense, a benign relationship {{has been established in}} which foxes have become comfortable and amiable toward the humans who, while becoming their providers, do not much mind the presence of the foxes. However, for some, urban foxes have proven to be a nuisance due to their intrusion and destruction of private property. Urban fox control methods and laws vary regionally.|$|E
25|$|Markham {{offers a}} mix of {{activities}} for its residents to promote its idea of being a place for all. It does this through cultural, entertainment and institutional activities in hopes that its <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> find {{one or more of}} these events attractive. Activities are also free to take place on streets and squares where people live, work, shop and play to make events more accessible for its residents. Its buildings and public transportation are designed with an attractive and inviting attitude in mind to create a more comfortable space. The City also values the importance of a “walkable” downtown as it allows its residents to enjoy buildings and services being in walking distance of each other. This space is pedestrian friendly, creating an accessible space for all. Overall, Markham aims to put its residents and their families first, bringing jobs closer into its boundaries and protecting the environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{market has}} also had famous seller, such as Ignacio Contreras, better known as “El Chacharitas,” who was noted among {{collectors}} as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those {{who knew how to}} bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has been hurt by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> not use public transportation to get to this market.|$|E
40|$|General Information The Pathology {{rotation}} {{will provide}} the house staff officer with a broad overview of clinical pathology, laboratory diagnosis and blood banking procedures. When interested, the resident may be assigned to gross pathology. Otherwise, the resident is encouraged to review general organ pathology in areas of specific interest {{with the assistance of}} a staff pathologist. Goals and Objectives The goal of this rotation is to integrate the role of clinical medicine and clinical pathology in total patient care. Value to the Resident This rotation should allow the resident to understand the pathologist's contribution to disease diagnosis. A better understanding of the interpretation of clinical pathological laboratory studies would result. The utility of various clinical diagnostic testing procedures continues to evolve and provides the resident with new methods for diagnosis. Principal Teaching Methods Directly working with the pathologist daily on assigned topics, the <b>resident</b> <b>will</b> be exposed to the broad array of testing and diagnostic facilities provided by the pathologist. Educational Content The <b>resident</b> <b>will</b> be exposed to clinical as well as surgical pathology experiencing frozen section and autopsy preparation, the basics of pap smear interpretation and reporting, bone marrow reviews, aspiration cytology, biopsy interpretation, pathologic slide interpretation, toxicology screens, tumor marker interpretation, microbiology lab overview, and blood banking techniques.

25|$|While some Baras are Christians, most {{retain their}} {{traditional}} religious beliefs. Tamarind trees were traditionally considered sacred and are found planted near many Bara villages, where <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> leave offerings like woven mats, locks of hair, shells {{and other items}} when offering prayers or after their requests are fulfilled. The indigenous bontona tree was also considered sacred and villagers would tie charms to the branches when offering prayers. Each village also had a hazomanga, a wooden pillar considered the most sacred site of worship, which served as the public altar for group prayer and offerings. This pillar was typically 20 to 30 feet high and a sachet containing sacred herbs, sand and wood chips was hung from the top. Bara men traditionally conduct the rites associated with honoring the ancestors, while women conduct rites associated with fertility and the forces of nature. An exception is childbirth, during which the mother is secluded {{for a period of}} four days; men watch over the birthing process and conduct associated rites.|$|E

Like the rest of Canada, Scarborough's population is aging. It is projected that close to 30% of Scarboourgh <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> be senior citizens by 2041.

500|$|In {{addition}} to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, {{also known as}} The Place of No Stars. The spirits of cats who cause great pain and suffering to others during their lives reside there {{in order to pay}} for their sins. As the name suggests, it {{takes the form of a}} never-ending forest, forcing its residents to forever walk alone. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they later learn how to walk in the dreams of living cats. [...] Like StarClan cats, Dark Forest <b>residents</b> <b>will</b> fade away if they are forgotten, or killed in battle. A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams, they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves.
