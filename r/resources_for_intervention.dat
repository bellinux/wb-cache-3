40|$|Cases {{referred}} to a community physician {{in his role as}} medical adviser to a housing authority were reviewed. A new system of classifying health problems was devised because conventional diagnostic classification was found to be inappropriate. The effectiveness of medical intervention was apparently low, since only 29 out of 612 (4. 7 %) applications for rehousing on medical grounds were successful. The effectiveness of the community physician's role was limited by the available resources and the number of cases he could take before the housing committee. It is proposed that the use of medical <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> in such cases is acceptably efficient, though this proposal is based on value judgement rather than on economic grounds.

The {{data for this study}} consist of 40 interviews and participant observation of 10 overdose prevention training sessions at harm reduction agencies in the Bronx, New York, conducted between 2010 and 2012. This paper contends that the social logic of peer administration is as central to the success of overdose prevention as is naloxone's pharmacological potency. Whereas prohibitionist drug policies seek to isolate drug users from the spaces and cultures of drug use, harm reduction strategies like peer-administered naloxone treat the social contexts of drug use as crucial <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention.</b> Such programs utilize the expertise, experience, and social connections gained by users in their careers as users. In revaluing the experience of drug users, naloxone facilitates a number of harm reduction goals. But it also raises complex questions about responsibility and risk.

40|$|Thesis (D. P. H.) [...] Boston UniversityBackground: Diet-related chronic {{diseases}} and conditions include obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, some cancers, and osteoporosis. Interventions {{that focus on}} increasing nutrition knowledge, motivation, and healthy eating skills {{at the individual level}} alone have been ineffective at producing sustainable changes in eating behaviors. It is now widely recognized that multi-level interventions that support healthy eating practices are needed. Institutions of higher learning have opportunities to positively influence the food choices of large numbers of students {{for an extended period of}} time. To date, no evaluations or guidelines for implementing environmental interventions in a college setting have been published. Methods: A comprehensive and systematic process evaluation of a targeted health promotion intervention designed to transform the food environment at a four-year university was performed. Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to assess the context, fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, and reach of intervention activities. Findings: Support and <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> development and implementation were high. University administrators recognized a responsibility to provide a healthy eating environment for diners in their care at a formative age. Education, language, and cultural barriers negatively impacted fidelity. Perceived higher food costs described by some foodservice managers negatively impacted dose delivered. Dose received and reach were higher for students defining health in terms of absolute and specific eating behaviors compared to students defining health more moderately. Traditional entrees, make-your-own sandwiches, and pasta entrees had broader appeal than entrees with unfamiliar ingredients and vegan and vegetarian options. Research translation: Study findings were used to revise the program implementation manual. The manual includes operational guidelines for nutrition criteria, menu planning, promotional activities, and training of dining services staff and student employees. Strategies for addressing highlighted barriers to improve program implementation are also presented. Conclusion: A successful environmental intervention that has fidelity and reach has the potential to improve the eating habits of millions of young adults when implemented in college dining halls. This evaluation identified barriers that are likely to be common in other foodservice operations. More research is needed to determine if proposed strategies result in improved implementation, and ultimately, increased healthy eating behavior of college students...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 9813645 X - PhD thesis - Faculty of Health SciencesEpidemiological {{information}} on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{is necessary to}} assess {{the magnitude of the}} burden of infections, to identify vulnerable population groups, to mobilise <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> activities and to monitor the impact of these activities. In addition, specific STI surveillance systems, such as studies on the relative prevalence of aetiological agents of STI syndromes and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, are aimed at improving patient care. The studies included in this thesis were designed and implemented to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of STIs and HIV infection in southern Africa. In all the study populations, we observed that high level STI epidemics preceded the explosive spread of HIV infection among high-risk individuals. The studies reported here also demonstrate the importance of triangulating data collected from different recommended STI surveillance components, using a tiered surveillance approach. The studies reported here also explored the bidirectional interactions of HIV and STIs. We observed that different STIs have shown different magnitudes of interaction with HIV infection. We found particularly strong interactions between genital herpes and HIV. At the individual level, HIV-seropositive patients with genital herpes were more frequently found to have atypical clinical presentations, delays in spontaneous healing, longer duration of HSV shedding and increased association with HIV shedding from ulcer and genital exudates. Mixed infections involving chancroid and genital herpes were found to be common, particularly in HIV-seropositive patients. The effectiveness of syndromic treatment targeting only bacterial causes of genital ulceration was significantly reduced due to persistent ulcerations as a result of co-infection with genital herpes. The successful treatment of herpes in men and women was found to be associated with a decline or cessation in HIV shedding into ulcer exudates or genital fluid. The studies have also shown that HIV plasma viral load is the main determinant for HIV shedding in both men and women presenting with STIs. As was the case with HSV infection, there was a strong association between HIV and HPV infection in both men and women. A higher prevalence of HPV infection was found among HIV-seropositive patients in our study population and this may reflect the higher frequency of recurrences and/or longer duration of infection (i. e. persistency). The studies also found that the biological false positive reactions in syphilis serology (i. e. RPR) are not a common occurrence in our HIV-seropositive study population. On the other hand, syphilis serology could be falsely negative in patients with PCR-confirmed primary syphilis who are co-infected with HIV and other aetiological agents causing GUD. In conclusion, the findings of our studies have supported the bidirectional nature of interactions between conventional STIs and HIV infection in southern Africa...|$|E
40|$|Age at the {{initiation}} of puberty and at menarche are key maturational indicators. They reflect health both within and between populations; in that a declining average age is associated with improving health, nutrition, and socio-economic conditions. Knowledge of the timing of pubertal development and menarche is important as earlier development within a population, in particular, has been linked with {{an increased risk of}} negative sequelae including overweight and obesity, development of risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and insulin resistance, and engagement in risk behaviours such as early sexual debut and substance abuse. The main aims of this study were to investigate the timing of, and the early life factors (such as body composition and growth velocities) associated with pubertal development and age at menarche in Black and White urban South African adolescents. Mixed-longitudinal data (n = 401) from the Birth to Twenty (Bt 20) birth-cohort study, initiated in 1990 and set in SowetoJohannesburg, South Africa were used. Median age at the initation of puberty and at menarche was derived by fitting logistic curves to cumulative frequency plots. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the early life predictors of the timing of puberty and menarche. Data were also collected from adolescents and Bt 20 staff (n = 72) using focus groups to explore views on the pubertal development questionnaire used in the Bt 20 study. Median age at {{the initiation}} of genitalia development was 10. 4 years (95 % Cl = 8. 4, 12. 4) for Black boys and 9. 8 years (95 % Cl = 9. 4, 10. 2) for White boys. Median age for {{the initiation of}} pubic hair development for Black males was 10. 8 years (95 % Cl = 9. 6, 12. 0) compared to White males, which was 10. 2 years (95 % Cl = 8. 4, 12. 0). Median age at the initiation of breast development in Black females was 10. 1 years (95 % Cl = 9. 3, 10. 9) compared to White females which was 10. 2 years (95 % Cl = 8. 2, 12. 2). Median age for the initiation of pubic hair was 10. 3 years (95 % Cl = 9. 3, 11. 3) and 10. 5 years (95 % Cl = 8. 7, 12. 3) for Black and White girls, respectively. Results from logistic regression showed that a greater weight and height velocity in late childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving early breasU genitalia development. Furthermore, a low socio-economic status (SES) index at 9 / 10 years significantly reduced the odds of achieving early breasUgenitalia development. A greater weight, height, body mass index (BM I), and growth rate during infancy and childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving early pubic hair development. Median age at menarche for Black females was 12. 4 years (95 % Cl = 12. 2, 12. 6) and 12. 5. years (95 % Cl = 11. 7, 13. 3) for White females. Average menarcheal age for Black girls has declined by 0. 56 years per decade and 0. 32 years for White girls in South Africa, when comparing the current study findings with those from previous studies. Results from logistic regression showed that being taller, fatter and heavier in late childhood significantly increased the odds of achieving earlier menarche. The focus groups provided a range of opinions relating to the Bt 20 pubertal development questionnaire and procedure. The majority of views were positive and included the ease of understanding and completion of the tool. Negative views revolved around the language used and privacy issues. These qualitative results provided a unique insight into the way in which pubertal development data are assessed and how these methods can potentially be improved to enhance the reliability and accuracy of pubertal development data collection. The results from this study provide the most recent estimates of age at the. initiation of puberty and age at menarche for urban Black and White South African adolescents. This is particularly important given the social, nutritional, and economic transition currently occurring in this country as these key maturity indicators reflect population health. This study has also added to our knowledge of the factors that are associated with pubertal development, showing that proximate rather than distal factors are the most sensitive indicators in this urban transitioning environment. In addition, the results from the focus groups provided a unique insight into how pubertal development data are assessed and how these methods could be improved. The negative health outcomes which have been associated with earlier pubertal development and age at menarche are major public health concerns, particularly in the South African context given the HIV/AIDS epidemic and rising levels of obesity. This study highlights the need for renewed research and <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> strategies and policy programmes which target appropriate sex and obesity education in urban South African children.

40|$|PhD (Development and Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Informal {{settlements}} provide residence to {{over fifty}} percent of the urban settlers in many developing nations. These settlements have gained notoriety as hotspots for exposing citizens to a variety of environmental hazards and disasters. Informal settlements are commonly neglected by governments that do not provide them with basic services safe water, adequate sanitation and efficient waste management systems. Furthermore, settlements are often located on fragile lands that are prone to flooding, hilly and more often than not close to heavy industries where pollution and indiscriminate waste disposal is rampant. The communities of informal settlements generally earn their livelihood with unauthorised or low-wage casual employment. This includes street vending, illegal quarrying and domestic work among other things. Kanyama is an informal settlement located in the western direction of Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. The settlement‘s topographical and hydrogeological characteristic is that of a flat terrain with an impervious dolomite rock formation below it. This makes it one of the worst flood-prone areas in Lusaka. The historical profile of the settlement reveals that Kanyama was part of the Chiefdom of Chief Mwalusaka of the Soli tribe of which the city was name as Lusaka. The land was not suitable neither crop production nor human settlement due to the presence of rocks. However, with the increased pressure for land to settlement, Kanyama attracted immigrants from rural parts of the country and developed into an illegal settlement {{to become one of the}} biggest informal settlements in Zambia today. Until 1996, when the government came up with a programme to upgrade informal settlements, Kanyama was an illegal settlement with no mandate from the government to offer basic services to the area. The settlement has undergone rapid urbanisation since 1991 with migrants coming from the rural parts of Zambia and other urban centres. With government following a policy of liberalising economy, companies were privatised. Privatisation led to subsequent job losses in the mines and in the stateowned companies. The Zambian economic management was diversified and developed in a haphazard manner with no physical and land use planning. Residents of Kanyama are exposed to disaster risks, especially flooding, that is caused by the impervious dolomite rock and the lack of proper drainage. Accessing safe water is a big challenge. The members of the community depend upon hand dug shallow wells and they use pit latrines and open spaces. The settlement gets flooded nearly every rainy season. This causes outbreaks of cholera and dysentery. Flooding leads to houses collapsing or being submerged which seriously disrupts the functioning of the community. While natural hazards such as floods are largely unavoidable, they only become disasters when communities‘ coping mechanisms and capacities are exceeded and they cannot manage the impacts (IFRC, 2009 : 7). Kanyama residents have at times been so badly hit by flooding that the government, through the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) had to relocate victims to safety outside Kanyama. Soon after the floods, however, the community returns to their usual flood-prone area. CARE International Zambia became involved in assisting vulnerable communities in the Kanyama settlement since 1992 by invitation of the Government of the Republic of Zambia. Interventions included provision of safe water and sanitation, solid waste management, drainage system construction and rehabilitation, capacity building of community structures and community participation in developmental programmes. The aim of this thesis is to create a model for Community based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM). Interventions from projects implemented by CARE International, the government through Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) and the role played by the community are reviewed. This research seeks to answer several research questions such as why communities at risk choose to continue living in unsafe settlements despite facing numerous hazards. Furthermore, the vulnerabilities of the settlement and the risks of being exposed to disaster in Kanyama will be analysed. A comparison between the reactive approach of the emergency response and the proactive, community based approach by CARE International Zambia is presented. The research is based on the theory that ineffective governance and the lagging in the implementation of legal frameworks and policies have contributed to the failure of government to manage disaster risks sustainably. Research shows the most effective way to manage disaster risks is to involve the community in identifying and analysing their vulnerability and capacity to carry out disaster reduction interventions. The analysis of interventions was done by reviewing project reports by CARE and interviewing local leaders and members of the Ward Development Committees, Resident Development Committees and Zone Development Committees (WDC, RDC and ZDC). Community members and staff involved in the implementation of these projects were also interviewed. CARE International‘s community based risk reduction approach had a greater impact on the community than the government‘s top-down approach. The model CBDRM approach puts the responsibility in the hands of community while working hand in hand with the community at risk. The model CBDRM approach starts by empowering the community with an understanding of the conceptual framework of the management of disaster risks and hazards. The capacity of the community has to be built to understand the disaster risk management process holistically. Secondly, the profile of disaster risks and hazard has to be identified and developed. The third step is the involvement of the community in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) interventions. This model premises on active community participation to reduce the vulnerability and exposure to disaster risks. It involves participatory approaches in the planning and implementation of DRR activities. Lastly, the legal framework of the country has a special role in providing guidance to the entire implementation process and the evaluation of DRR intervention. If communities develop a dependency syndrome where perpetual receivers of relief become unwilling to initiate activities on their own to improve their well-being, it may lead to failure of the community to appreciate their capacity and their own <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention.</b> Doctora...|$|E
40|$|Railway level {{crossing}} collisions in Australia {{are a major}} cause of concern for both rail and road authorities. Despite the fact that the number of railway crash fatalities in Australia has fallen in recent years, {{level crossing}} collisions constitute a significant proportion of the national rail toll. Although rail transport is presently one of the safest forms of land transport, collisions at level crossings are {{three times more likely to}} involve fatalities as compared to all other types of road crashes (Afxentis, 1994). With many level crossing fatalities and injuries resulting in coronial inquests, litigation and negative media publicity, the actions of rail and road infrastructure providers and the behaviour of motorists, pedestrians and rail users, come under close scrutiny. Historically, research in this area has been plagued by the rail/road interface and the separation of responsibilities between rail and road authorities reflecting the social and political context in which they are contained. With the recent rail reform in Australia, safety at level crossings has become a key priority area. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand the scope and nature of motorist behaviour at level crossings, in order to develop and implement more effective countermeasures for unsafe driving behaviour. However, a number of obstacles have hindered research into the area of level crossing safety. As with many road crashes, the contributing causes and factors are often difficult to determine, however a recent investigation of fatal collisions at level crossings supports the notion that human fault is a major contributor (Australian Transport Safety Bureau, 2002 a). Additionally, there is a lack of reliable data available relating to the behavioural characteristics and perceptions of drivers at level crossings. Studies that do exist have lacked a strong theoretical base to guide the interpretation of results. Due to the lack of financial viability of continuing to approach risk management from an engineering perspective, the merits of human factor research need to be examined for suitability. In Australia, there has been considerable recognition regarding the importance of human factor approaches to level crossing safety (Australian Transport Council, 2003). However, little attempt has been made by authorities to scientifically develop and measure the effectiveness of road safety educational interventions. Therefore, there exists a significant need for developing targeted road safety educational interventions to improve current risk management solutions at level crossings. This research program is the first of its kind in investigating motorist behaviour at level crossings and the measuring the effectiveness of educational interventions for improving driving safety. Although other ‘educational’ campaigns exist in this field, no campaign or intervention has been guided by empirical research or theory. This thesis adopted a multidisciplinary approach to theory, reviewing perspectives from psychology, sociology and public health to explain driver behaviour at level crossings. This array of perspectives is necessary due to the variety of behaviours involved in collisions and near-misses at level crossings. The motivation underlying motorist behaviour determines to a large extent how successful behaviour change strategies (e. g. educational interventions) may be. Fishbein’s Integrated Model of Behaviour Change (IM) based largely on the health belief model, theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behaviour (Fishbein, 2000), assisted in the planning and development of a ‘oneoff’ targeted educational intervention specific for three different road user groups and in questionnaire development to ascertain the present context of motorist behaviour at level crossings. As no known research has been conducted that utilizes any psychosocial model to explain or predict level crossing behavior within different road user groups, this research program used this model as an exploratory tool rather than a tool to asses the model’s capacity in explaining such behaviour. The difference between this model and others is the inclusion of two important constructs in driving: skills (or abilities) and environmental factors. Fishbein (2003) suggests that the model recognises the lack of skills (or abilities) and/or environmental constraints may prevent a person from acting on their intentions, in light of the fact that intention is viewed as the primary determinant of behaviour. While the majority of behaviour change theories are limited by a range of conceptual and contextual factors (Parker, 2004), the IM was used to assist this research program as it appeared to be the most applicable model to examining level crossing safety. A variety of data collection methods were used in this research program as much of what is currently known about level crossing collisions is derived from coroner’s findings and statistics. The first study (Study One) was designed to extend this knowledge by undertaking a more thorough examination of contributing factors to level crossing crashes and the road user groups at risk. This study used the method of ‘triangulation’ (i. e. combining research methods to give a range of perspectives) whereby both qualitative (focus groups) and quantitative (modified Delphi technique) research designs were utilised (Barbour, 1999, Bryman, 1992). With the discipline of road safety research requiring methodological strategies that will enhance efforts to conceptualise the multi-faceted nature of motorist behaviour at level crossings, this application provided the robustness required. Results from the Delphi technique indicated that older, younger and heavy vehicle drivers are considered to be three of the highest risk road user groups by experts in the field. For the older driver group, experts agreed that errors in judgment were the most important issue for this group when driving at level crossings. Risk taking by younger drivers, such as trying to beat the train across the crossing, was viewed as the central issue for the younger driver group. Like the younger driver group, a concern by experts with the heavy vehicle group was intentional risk taking at level crossings. However, experts also rated the length of heavy vehicles a major concern due to the possibility of a truck over-hanging a crossing. Results from focus groups with train drivers in Study One indicated that there are unique problems associated with crossings in rural/regional areas compared to urban areas. The metropolitan train drivers generally experienced motorist behaviour at active crossings with flashing lights and boom gates while the regional train drivers experienced behaviours at active crossings with boom gates, crossings with lights only and passive crossings with stationary signs. In the metropolitan train driver group, experiences of motorist behaviour at level crossings included: motorists driving around boom gates, getting stuck under boom gates, queuing over congested crossings and driving through the crossing after the red lights commence flashing. The behaviour of motorists driving around boom gates was noted to occur quite regularly. The majority of metropolitan train drivers reported that it was a common occurrence for motorists to drive through a crossing when the lights are flashing both before and after the booms were activated and some crossings were named as ‘black spots’ (locations where motorists repeatedly violate the road rules). Vehicles protruding into the path of the train and motorists entering congested crossings and then panicking and driving backwards into the boom gates were also mentioned. Regional train drivers indicated that motorists not stopping or giving way to trains is a continual problem at passively controlled crossings (i. e. no boom gates or flashing lights). Regional train drivers generally agreed that the majority of motorists obey protection systems; however some motorists drive through flashing lights or drive around boom gates. Other high risk behaviours included motorists attempting to beat the train across the crossing, speeding up to go through flashing lights, and general risk taking by younger drivers in particular. Motorists not allowing enough time to cross in front of the train or hesitating (stopstarting) at crossings were also noted to be at high risk. There was a general perception by regional train drivers that motorists are unable to judge the speed and distance of an approaching train to determine a safe gap during which to cross. Local motorists were also reported to be a problem at level crossings for regional train drivers. A theme common to regional and metropolitan train drivers was the risk of catastrophic consequence associated with level crossing collisions. The reasons given for this were the threat of derailment, serious property damage, the high risk of a fatality, personal injury and, most earnestly, the potential for enduring psychological consequences. Drivers uniformly spoke about the continual fear they had of being involved in a collision with a heavy vehicle, and many spoke of the effects that such collisions had on train drivers involved. For this reason, train drivers were said to consider any near-miss incident involving trucks particularly serious. The second study undertaken as part of this research program (Study Two), involved formative research as part of the planning, development and delivery of behavioural interventions for each of the three road user groups identified in Study One. This study also used both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to provide methodological triangulation and ensure reliability of the data. The overall objective of the qualitative data collection was to obtain rich data using a qualitative mode of inquiry, based on the key variables of attitudes, norms, self-efficacy (perceived behavioural control), perceived risk, environmental constraints and the skills/abilities of drivers. The overall objective of the quantitative data collection was to prioritise the issues identified in order to direct and allocate project <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> planning, development and delivery. This combined recruitment strategy was adopted as it was an appropriate and practical data collection strategy within the qualitative and exploration methodology. Information obtained from each of the groups was critical in assisting, guiding, and identifying priority areas for message and material development. The use of focus groups and one-on-one interviews provided insights into why drivers think or do what they do at level crossings. The qualitative component of this study found that for the older driver group, regional drivers hold a greater perception of risk at level crossings than urban older drivers, with many recalling near-misses. Participants from the urban older driver group indicated that level crossings are not as dangerous as other aspects of driving, with many participants being doubtful that motorists are killed while driving at level crossings. Both urban and regional younger drivers tended to hold a low perception of risk for driving at level crossings, however many participants reported having great difficulty in judging the distance a train is from a crossing. Impatience for waiting at level crossings was reported to be the major reason for any risk taking at level crossings in the younger driver group. Complacency and distraction were viewed by heavy vehicle participants as two of the major driver factors that put them at risk at level crossings, while short-stacking (when the trailer of the truck extends onto the crossing), angle of approach (acute or obtuse angle) and lack of advance warning systems were seen as the major engineering problems for driving a truck at level crossings. The quantitative component of this study involving research with train drivers found that at the aggregate train driver level, it is apparent that train drivers consider motorists’ deliberate violations of the road rules and negligently lax approach to hazard detection as the predominant causes of dangerous driving at level crossings. Experts were observed to rank risk taking behaviours slightly lower than train drivers, although they agreed with train drivers that ‘trying to beat the train’ is the single most critical risk taking behaviour observed by motorists. The third study (Study Three) involved three parts. The aim of Part One of this study was to develop targeted interventions specific to each of the three road user groups by using Fishbein’s theoretical model (Integrated Model of Behaviour Change) as a guide. The development of interventions was originally seen as being outside of the scope of this project, however it became intertwined in questionnaire development and thus deemed to be within the realms of the current mode of inquiry. The interventions were designed in the format of a pilot radio road safety advertisement, as this medium was found to be one of the most acceptable to each of the road user groups as identified in the formative research undertaken in Study Two. The interventions were used as a ‘one-off’ awareness raising intervention for each road user group. Part Two involved the investigation of the present context of unsafe driving behaviour at level crossings. This second part involved the examination of the present context of motorist behaviour at level crossings using key constructs from Fishbein’s Integrated Model of Behaviour Change (IM). Part Three involved trialing a pilot road safety radio advertisement using an intervention and control methodology. This part investigated the changes in pre and post-test constructs including intentions, self-reported behaviour, attitudes, norms, selfefficacy/ perceived behaviour control, perceived risks, environment constraints and skills/ability. Results from this third study indicated that younger drivers recognise that level crossings are potentially a highly dangerous intersection yet are still likely to engage in risk taking behaviours. Additionally, their low levels of self-efficacy in driving at level crossings pose challenges for developing interventions with this age group. For the older driver sample, this research confirms the high prevalence of functional impairments such as increasing trouble adjusting to glare and night-time driving, restricted range of motion to their neck and substantial declines in their hearing. While factors contributing to the over-representation of older drivers in collisions at level crossings are likely to be complex and multi-faceted, such functional impairments are expected to play a critical role. The majority of heavy vehicle drivers reported driving safely and intending to drive safely in the future, however, there is a sub-set of drivers that indicate they have in the past and will in the future take risks when traversing crossings. Although this sub-set is relatively small, if generalised to the larger trucking industry it could be problematic for the rail sector and greater public alike. Familiarity was a common factor that was found to play a role in driving intention at level crossings for all three road user groups. This finding supports previous research conducted by Wigglesworth during the 1970 ’s in Australia (Wigglesworth, 1979). Taken together, the results of the three studies in this research program have a number of implications for level crossing safety in Australia. Although the ultimate goal to improve level crossing safety for all motorists would be to have a combination of engineering, education and enforcement countermeasures, the small number of fatalities in comparison to the national road toll limits this. It must be noted though that the likelihood of creating behavioural change would be increased if risk taking at level crossings by all motorists was detected and penalised, or alternatively, if perceptions of such detection were increased. The instilling of fear in drivers with the threat of punishment via some form of sanction can only be achieved through a combination of a mass media campaign and increasing police presence. Ideally, the aim would be to combine fear of punishment with the guilt associated with the social non-acceptability of disobeying road rules at level crossings. Such findings have direct implications for improving the present context of motorist behaviour at level crossings throughout Australia...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report on}} the use of lot quality-assurance {{sampling}} (LQAS) surveys undertaken within an area-sampling framework to identify priority areas <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> with trachoma control activities in Viet Nam. METHODS: The LQAS survey method for the rapid assessment of the prevalence of active trachoma was adapted for use in Viet Nam with the aim of classifying individual communes by the prevalence of active trachoma among children in primary school. School-based sampling was used; school sites to be sampled were selected using an area-sampling approach. A total of 719 communes in 41 districts in 18 provinces were surveyed. FINDINGS: Survey staff found the LQAS survey method both simple and rapid to use after initial problems with area-sampling methods were identified and remedied. The method yielded a finer spatial resolution of prevalence than had been previously achieved in Viet Nam using semiquantitative rapid assessment surveys and multistage cluster-sampled surveys. CONCLUSION: When used with area-sampling techniques, the LQAS survey method has the potential to form the basis of survey instruments {{that can be used to}} efficiently target <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>interventions</b> against active trachoma. With additional work, such methods could provide a generally applicable tool for effective programme planning and for the certification of the elimination of trachoma as a blinding disease...|$|R

First, I examine the determinants of a household’s decision to switch to cleaner burning fuels. Based on the decision of a household to switch to cleaner burning fuels, I test if the decision of a household to switch to cleaner fuels impacts respiratory health outcomes. There are real and immediate policy implications {{for this type of}} analysis. Indoor air pollution has serious health impacts on individuals in developing nations, especially women and children. Understanding the factors that contribute to a household’s decision to adopt cleaner burning fuels has implications for the design of improved stove intervention programs. The ability to quantify the health benefits of stove switching will assist policy makers in allocating scarce <b>resources</b> <b>for</b> <b>interventions,</b> and justifying these interventions to funders. With renewed interest in improved stove projects and funding dollars being spent to scale up successful initiatives {{there is a need for}} a better understanding of the characteristics of the targeted population.

In 2001, staff at DDT wanted to explore the impact of diabetes on aging-related outcomes. We assembled a small panel of experts in aging to explore the diabetes-and-aging issue. This group produced a white paper focused on four areas: surveillance, applied public health research, programs, and policy change and development. From this initial effort, the DDT formed the Diabetes and Aging Work Group (DAWG) to highlight the health issues of older adults with diabetes. In addition to conducting scientific research and communications, the DAWG chose one programmatic focus: preserving physical function in older adults. To further that end, this Reference Guide of Physical Activity Programs for Older Adults: A <b>Resource</b> <b>for</b> Planning <b>Interventions</b> was created as a programmatic tool.

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} how experiential {{knowledge}} {{is used in}} areas such as mental health care and youth policy and how it relates to the dominant form of knowledge that underpins these policy areas, ‘expert knowledge’. Experiential knowledge is sometimes considered a resource that helps people in vulnerable situations respond to uncertain futures. Although frequently undervalued, experiential knowledge is involved in multifaceted responses to situations imbued with uncertainty. In this article, we examine the nature of experiential knowledge as a resource and develop a typology of experiential knowledge drawing on existing studies. Experiential knowledge is not merely ‘lay beliefs and fallacies’ that holders of expert knowledge should be aware of so that they can better implement top-down strategies; it reflects lived experiences that are difficult for outsiders to capture. In the Netherlands, the rise of lived experience as a <b>resource</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> was born through the critique of the hegemonic power of ‘expert knowledge’ and as policymakers recognised the potential contribution of ‘experiential experts’ in shaping responses to situations characterised by high uncertainty. In such situations policymakers can draw on insights into the experience of usually silent stakeholders: people deemed at risk. In this article, we also highlight tensions related to these particular multifaceted responses, suggesting that experiential knowledge is viewed with ambivalence by some other stakeholders...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not staff in schools were able to identify working memory difficulties in their students and how pupils with these difficulties were supported. Qualitative and quantitative data was sought from 35 randomly selected primary schools via a questionnaire. Semi-structured follow-up interviews were carried out with SEN Co-ordinators from 10 of the schools. Results revealed that the schools seldom carried out working memory assessment and staff were generally unaware of the characteristics of a poor working memory. Many of the schools within this study were not familiar with the range of assessment tools or <b>resources</b> available <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> and support.
