5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief inspector {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector. The ground station and auxiliary facilities were <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E
5|$|Training for the Beta tracks {{shifted from}} the XAX to the XBX {{training}} and development racetrack in November 1943. A second Alpha I racetrack became operational in January 1944. The first Beta racetrack and the third and first Alpha racetracks, now repaired, became operational in March 1944, and the fourth Alpha racetrack in April 1944. A third building, 9201-3, contained a fifth racetrack that incorporated some modifications, and was known as Alpha I. This became operational on 3 June 1944. Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings, 9202 and 9203, commenced in February 1943, and was completed in September. Work on the Beta process building, 9204-1, began in May 1943, and was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> on 13 March 1944, but was not completed until September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{arrived in}} France in early 1917 {{as part of}} the last batch of second-line Territorial divisions to be sent from Britain, and was attached to the First Army. On 12 April, Brigadier-General Godfrey Matthews, a former Royal Marine officer commanding 198th Brigade, was wounded by shellfire and died the next day. In June, the division was transferred to the XV Corps of the Fourth Army on the relatively quiet coastal sector in Flanders. During the summer, XV Corps was held <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>Operation</b> Hush, an amphibious landing by the 1st Division and a coastal offensive by the rest of XV Corps, which was planned to support an advance from Passchendaele Ridge east of Ypres, by the Fifth Army. The operation was postponed several times and was cancelled in October. At the end of September, the 66th Division was relieved by its parent unit, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. After a few days of overlap, where many men were able to meet friends and relations they had not seen since 1914, the division moved south to the Ypres area. The division was assigned to II Anzac Corps, a predominantly Australian formation and the 199th Brigade moved into the front line to replace the 3rd Australian Division on 5 October. The relief was badly mismanaged, leaving the Australian staff officers doubtful of the efficiency of the division. On 9 October, the division made its debut in the Battle of Poelcappelle.|$|E

On August 13, 2009 the first in-flight test of the YAL-1 culminated with a successful firing of the SHEL at an instrumented test missile.|$|E
25|$|After {{one year}} of {{existence}} a saw-mill had been constructed and was nearly <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation,</b> and a blacksmith shop and a machine shop powered by a steam engine were already operational. In addition, the community included stables, animal and wagon sheds, carpentry shops, a school and children's day care area, guest cottages, landscaped gardens and paths, and an artificial pond for bathing, boating and a supply of ice in the winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} Gannet AEW.3 first flew in August 1958, {{with carrier}} trials taking place using HMS Centaur in November, {{and the first}} production aircraft delivered in December. By August 1959, 700G Naval Air Squadron was formed as the Trials Unit for the new Gannet. This unit put the aircraft through an intensive test programme to make it <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> service, a process that lasted until January 1960, {{at which point the}} unit was renamed as 'A' Flight of 849 Naval Air Squadron. 849A Flight was then declared operational and was embarked {{for the first time in}} HMS Ark Royal. A total of 44 Gannets were ordered for the Royal Navy to replace the Skyraider.|$|E

25|$|The Pakistan army, after {{expelling}} the Mukti Bahini from Bangladesh by May 1971, experienced relative {{peace in}} June and July. Mukti Bahini activity had lessened {{during the months}} of preparation, although the Indian army began shelling border outposts (about half of the 370 outposts were destroyed {{by the end of}} July) to facilitate infiltration into occupied territories. Bengali regular forces were not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> until mid-July. With the conflict largely centred around the India-East Pakistan border region, the Pakistani Eastern Command began reorganizing their forces to consolidate control of the province. An East Pakistan Civil Armed Force, with 17 operational wings,) was raised from West Pakistani and Bihari volunteers, Razakars (50,000), Al-Badr and Al Shams (5,000 from each unit). Five thousand police were flown in from West Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|To {{expedite}} construction, {{the railroad}} had crews in Utah focused on grading the new path and boring a [...] tunnel, while crews in Colorado built track segments that were transported to site. On July 4, 1983, at 3:05p.m., safety inspectors declared the line <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation.</b> At 3:12p.m., the {{centralized traffic control}} signals gave a green light to the first train {{to pass through the}} Thistle area since the slide began, an eastbound freight train coming from the Southern Pacific Railroad at Ogden, destined for Herington, Kansas. Although the line's re-opening on Independence Day was coincidental, the first train became part of the local holiday celebrations. The first passenger train to use the new alignment was the California Zephyr, on July 16.|$|E
500|$|An {{unpublished}} manuscript on {{file with}} the Montana State Historical Society describes life in Basin between 1906 and 1910 in great detail. Two railroads, the Northern Pacific {{on the north side}} of the Boulder River, and the Great Northern on the south side, served the city; both had depots and warehouses in Basin and carried passengers as well as freight. The Glass brothers' smelter had been set up on the north side to process concentrated ore delivered by rail from out of town or from the mills on the south side. Infrastructure included a weight scale for ore cars and an overhead tram to carry ore across the river from the reduction mill to the smelter. Although the smelter was a [...] "massive unit" [...] equipped with furnaces, conveyors, and machinery <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation,</b> it [...] "never turned a wheel".|$|E

500|$|Kellex's {{design for}} K-25 {{called for a}} four-story U-shaped {{structure}} [...] long containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately {{or as part of}} a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the [...] site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October, and the six-stage pilot plant was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, Union Carbide and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480million.|$|E
2500|$|The initial [...] of the Sussex Mine Railroad {{from the}} mine in Andover, which {{was named after}} the mine, was started in May 1849 and {{completed}} in August 1851. During construction of the railroad, the legislature approved a supplement to the charter on March 18, 1851, that allowed the railroad to extend the line to the Morris & Essex Railroad (M), which was extending its line to Hackettstown. The Sussex Mine Railroad {{struck a deal with}} the M that would work in their favor if they were to have the connection <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> by the time the M's extension reached Waterloo. In preparation for this extension and what eventually became a rebuilding of the entire existing line, the New Jersey Legislature approved another supplement to the charter on January 26, 1853, that allowed the company to change its name to the Sussex Railroad, reflecting its new purpose beyond just serving the mines and authorized the company to extend the track to any point in Sussex County on the Delaware River.|$|E
