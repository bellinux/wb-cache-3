40|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> {{testing machine}} {{undergoes}} mechanical stress as an external force is applied. In {{case of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> testing machine, even a tiny flaw results in a fatal demage because {{the size of the}} machine is huge. Therefore, when designing the <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> testing machine, it is necessary to secure a safety factor with the mechanical stress analysis in order to prevent the machine from being destroyed due to scattering or transformation of rotating field. This thesis proposes a LSM <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> tesitng machine which rotates at the speed of up to 600 km/h. And the mechanical stress is considered in order that the safety factor remains above 1. 5 at the maximum speed. In addition, because normal force as well as thrust occurs in the machine, the normal force exerted was considered through the strength analysis. Finally, a design plan which enables to weaken the normal force affecting the <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> testing machine is introduced and its validity is proved by the results of FEM analysis. ? ??? ??????????? ???? ?? ??(???? e???? ?????? ??, ?? ??PK 1501 A) ? ???? ???????...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{component}} {{materials for}} display {{are being developed}} into higher value-added industries which can strengthen national industrial competitiveness. However, a system for production of component materials for display is nearly depending on import, and its development level is inadequate. For this reason, localization of the embossing treatment system for production of the spacer tape and system improvement for increasing of productivity are needed.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{actuated}} {{active suspension}} benefits active control and energy harvesting from vibration {{at the same}} time. However, the <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> electromagnetic actuated active suspension introduces a significant extra mass on the unsprung mass due to the inertia of the rotating components of the actuator. The magnitude of the introduced unsprung mass is studied based on a gearbox type actuator and a ball screw type actuator. The geometry of the suspension and the actuator also influence the equivalent unsprung mass significantly. The suspension performance simulation or control logic derived should take this equivalent unsprung mass into account. Besides, an extra force should be compensated due to the nonlinear features of the suspension structure and it is studied. The active force of the actuator should compensate this extra force. The discovery of this paper provides a fundamental for evaluating the <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> electromagnetic actuated active suspension performance and control strategy derived as well as controlling the electromagnetic actuated active suspension more precisely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Currently, {{many types}} of string hopper {{machines}} are available in Sri Lanka. One is a <b>rotary</b> <b>type</b> {{and the other one}} is the lever type string hopper machine. <b>Rotary</b> <b>type</b> machine which is available in the local market has a main drawback of having to remove the cylinder for each batch of 100 string hoppers [1]. For this task handle should be rotated until the rack comes to its uppermost position which makes the operator fatigued and consumes more time. Another one is the lever type string hopper machine which is operated by a lever mechanism connected to a piston. Disadvantage of this machine is for each 15 hoppers, the cylinder should be refilled. This paper discusses the design of an automated low cost string hopper machine to be used in medium scale industry. The designed new machine has an ability to stop the string hopper mold rotator at the required position, ease of feeding, and better accessibility for cleaning. The proposed machine is also is affordable in price, particularly for the small and medium scale string hopper manufacturers...|$|R
