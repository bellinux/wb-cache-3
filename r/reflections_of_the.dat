5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a convex mirror with <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in the scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|In his 1874 paper, {{entitled}} Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle, Lemoine {{proved the}} concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle; the <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medians {{of the triangle}} over the angle bisectors. Other results in the paper included {{the idea that the}} symmedian from a vertex of the triangle divides the opposite side into segments whose ratio is equal to the ratio of the squares of the other two sides.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E

5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swinging light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera swinging quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna singing the hook while wearing a low cut green dress and dancing {{in front of}} {{tropical}} plants on a beach, whilst singing the hook. Key lighting is used to place emphasis on Rihanna, whilst the backdrop remains virtually dark and unseeable. For the first verse, Rihanna is featured dancing against a plain grey background, wearing a white top and silver glitter mini-skirt, whilst flirtatiously dancing with the male dancer. Halfway through the verse, another scene is introduced, with Rihanna wearing a pink dress in a mirrored room, showing multiple <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singer from different angles. For the first chorus, Rihanna is mainly featured wearing the green dress on the beach, but a new scene of Rihanna wearing black lace is introduced {{toward the end of}} the chorus, where she, as well as four male dancers, perform a choreographed dance routine. Scenes of Rihanna in the mirrored room are intercut with the previous scene for the duration of the chorus. For the second verse, a further scene of Rihanna is depicted, this time featuring the scenes performing a dance routine with a group of female dancers, in the same setting as the one at the start of the video. For the second chorus, another scene of the singer sitting on a chair whilst listening to music is shown. For the remainder of the video, including the bridge and final chorus, all scenes featured in the video are intercut with one and other, displaying a total of five different scenes and settings.|$|E

25|$|The Glass Bees {{combines}} the semi-autobiographical narrative and <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrator, explicitly thematizing {{such topics as}} war, technological and historical change, morality, authenticity, and semantic change. It is classified as one of Ernst Jünger's later works. With its simultaneous nostalgia for militaristic order and deep suspicion of technocratic modernity, it is exemplary of this ambiguity in Jünger's work.|$|E
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} have output powers of more than 500mW in the beam and may cause severe, {{permanent}} damage to eye or skin without being magnified by optics of eye or instrumentation. Diffuse <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser beam can be hazardous to skin or eye within the Nominal Hazard Zone. Many industrial, scientific, military and medical lasers are in this category. Many handheld lasers ("laser pointers") at this output level are now available in this category.|$|E
25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E

25|$|Skeptics like Martin Gardner see {{the science}} in The Urantia Book as clear <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> views that prevailed {{at the time}} the book is said to have originated. The claim by the authors, that no unknown {{scientific}} discoveries could be imparted, is seen as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later. That presentation of post-1955 scientific knowledge is avoided is taken to be evidence it was written by humans and not by celestial beings with superior knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Because the antennas were so {{much more}} {{directional}} than the wide fan-shaped beams of the earlier systems, the entire problem with ground reflections could be avoided simply by ensuring the antennas were always pointed a few degrees above the horizon. This ensured none of the signal bounced off the ground on transmission, and that any nearby <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> returned signal would also not be seen. The need for the wire ground mat of the earlier models was eliminated, and sites could be unlimbered and fully operational in hours.|$|E
25|$|World War I: {{during the}} first three years of World War I, he worked as press {{correspondent}} of El Liberal, and thanks to his detailed chronicles, which came from his courage of getting close to enemy lines, the Spanish readers got to know the horrors of the front. A summary of his articles is found in his books: Crónica de la Guerra (War Chronicles, 1915), Reflejos de la Tragedia (<b>Reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tragedy, 1915), En las Trincheras (Inside the trenches, 1916), and En el Corazón de la Tragedia (At the heart of the tragedy, 1916), among others.|$|E

25|$|In some {{locations}} it {{is necessary}} to span a wide gap at a relatively high elevation, such as when a canal or water supply must span a valley. Rather than building extremely large arches, or very tall supporting columns (difficult using stone), a series of arched structures are built one atop another, with wider structures at the base. Roman civil engineers developed the design and constructed highly refined structures using only simple materials, equipment, and mathematics. This type is still used in canal viaducts and roadways as it has a pleasing shape, particularly when spanning water, as the <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arches form a visual impression of circles or ellipses.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the letter being {{addressed}} directly to D'Alembert, it is undoubtedly meant {{to have an effect}} on the general population. The work is famous for displaying Rousseau's charismatic rhetoric and digressive tendencies, all with his personal experience woven into the text. It may be considered to portray Rousseau's vanity, narcissism and biases, but the text could also be thought of more positively; as expressive, lyrical and austere. The Letter shows Rousseau's tendency to think of the events in his own life as highly significant, as <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger social picture. An example is how the Letter itself is open and expressive in style, while the content of the Letter is about this openness.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the systems}} based on photoresistors evolved, growing more compact and {{moving from the}} {{dashboard}} to a less conspicuous location behind the radiator grill, they were still unable to reliably discern headlamps from non-vehicular light sources such as streetlights. They also did not dip to low beam when the driver approached a vehicle from behind, and they would spuriously dip to low beam in response to road sign <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's own high beam headlamps. American inventor Jacob Rabinow devised and refined a scanning automatic dimmer system impervious to streetlights and reflections, but no automaker purchased the rights, and the problematic photoresistor type remained on the market through the late 1980s.|$|E
