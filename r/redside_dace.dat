50|$|The <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> (Clinostomus elongatus) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae, found in the United States and Canada. It is unique among minnows, being the only species to {{routinely}} feed on flying insects by leaping from water. Thus, it acts as a conduit for nutrient transfers between terrestrial and aquatic environments. The species {{can be used as}} an ecosystem health indicator, as it is sensitive to environmental disturbances.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> is mainly limited to Southern Ontario, the Two Tree River on the St. Joseph Island {{being the only}} exception. Most populations {{have been identified in}} the streams draining into the western part of Lake Ontario, from the Pringle Creek near Oshawa to the Spencer Creek near Hamilton, Ontario. Smaller populations exist in the drainages of Lake Simcoe (Holland River system), Lake Erie (Irvine Creek), Berczy Creek in Markham and Lake Huron (Saugeen River system).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 Presentation date: 1952 - 05 - 10 An {{investigation}} of the fishes of the Willamette River and three of its larger tributaries was made during July, August, September, and November of 1951, to ascertain {{the possibility of using}} them as bio-indices of pollution. Thirteen stations were established on the Willamette River and tributaries. These stations were selected in respect to the major tributaries, cities, and sources of pollution. Two stations were located on the McKenzie river; two on the North Fork of the Santiam River; eight on the main stem of the Willamette River from above Eugene to Oregon City; and one on the Clackamas River. Fishes were collected at each station by means of a seine. The fishes were preserved in a 10 percent formalin solution and returned to Corvallis where they were classified as to species and the numbers of each recorded. Stomach analysis were performed on a portion of the fishes collected from each of the stations. In an attempt to determine the affect of pollution on the fishes of an area, the samples from a clean-water station were compared with those taken from a polluted station. From this survey a tentative list of fishes which were sensitive, intermediate and tolerant to pollution was formed. In general, the trout, salmon, whitefishes and sculpins were found to be sensitive; falcate dace, white crappie, smallmouth black bass, mountain suckers, and longnosed dace were intermediate; and <b>redsided</b> shiner, blacksided <b>dace,</b> coarse-scaled sucker, three-spined stickle back, squawfish, bullhead catfish, chiselmouth, largemouth black bass, Columbia River chub, and larvae of the Pacific lamprey were tolerant. It was found that even the most tolerant fishes disappeared when pollution was excessive. In addition to the biological data collected at each station, certain chemical and physical tests were also determined. Air and water temperatures were taken, along with hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), and dissolved oxygen content of the water. Bio-chemical oxygen demand (B. O. D.) readings were taken at some of the stations by the Oregon State Sanitary Authority. River flow measurements were obtained from U. S. G. S. records for the gage at Salem, Oregon. The physical and chemical tests were used in conjunction with the biological findings to determine the condition of each station. Water flow data was used to determine low water periods. Chemical, physical and water flow data are shown in table form as well as graphically. The numbers of each species of fish and the food organisms found by stomach analysis are listed for each monthly sample and these data are also shown in table form. According to observations from this survey there was a definite indication that pollution can be detected by using the species, numbers and stomach contents of fishes from a waterway...|$|R

50|$|The <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> is brightly coloured, {{with a wide}} red stripe {{extending}} from the head to the dorsal fin, running along {{the middle of the}} body. Above it, a bright yellow stripe extends from head to tail. Colours are the brightest during spring, gradually fading during late summer and fall. Distinguishing it from other cyprinids, the species has a very large mouth and protruding lower jaw, which is an effective adaptation for capturing prey from below. The species' maximum length is 12 cm. The lifespan is no longer than four years.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} {{considered}} by ecologists to provide a unique ecosystem in the region. The lower river {{is considered to be}} a habitat for the relatively rare native muskellunge. The river basin supports several other fish species, including: <b>redside</b> <b>dace,</b> mimic shiner, streamline chub, slender madtom, blue sucker, paddlefish, and eastern sand. There are more than 50 species of freshwater mussels, of which 11 are endangered. The watershed provides wetland stopover habitats for about 250 species of migratory birds, an unusually high number. Several state and federal agencies, as well as private organizations such as The Nature Conservancy work to protect the diversity of this important habitat.|$|E

50|$|Ringwood is a Rouge River {{watershed}} {{fisheries management}} zone. In {{the early nineteenth}} century, pioneer settlers speared large 50 pound salmon spawning on the upper tributaries of the Rouge {{as far north as}} Ringwood. Some of the Little Rouge River in Ringwood is still considered to provide high quality aquatic habitat. Today, the native target fish species that are being supported in the Little Rouge River in Ringwood include brook trout, <b>redside</b> <b>dace,</b> mottled sculpin, American brook lamprey, and rainbow darter. Ringwood is home to the Ringwood Fish Culture Station, which is also responsible for stocking a large proportion of Lake Ontario's stocking quota, including chinook salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout and Atlantic salmon. All stock is destined for Lake Ontario tributaries.|$|E
50|$|The upper 8 mi of {{the river}} have lower water flow than the lower 4 mi, and suffer from {{degraded}} habitat. In the late summer and fall dry season, much of the upper two-thirds {{of the river}} dries out, leaving only unconnected pools. Only on the lower third is sport fishing allowed. Minnows are abundant throughout the river, and among {{those found in the}} Devils River are the western blacknose dace, common creek chub, common shiner, longnose dace, northern redbelly dace, <b>redside</b> <b>dace,</b> white sucker, and various species of darter. Sport fish such as black bullhead catfish and rock bass are native to the lower third. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources stocks brown trout, northern pike, and rainbow trout in the river, but over-winter survival rates are very low.

40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterized eight polymorphic microsatellite loci for <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> (Clinostomus elongatus), a colorful North American cyprinid that is threatened or endangered {{throughout most of}} its range. The number of alleles per locus ranged from three to eighteen, with observed heterozygosity ranging from 0. 31 - 0. 92. Cross-amplification revealed that these markers will also be useful for examining closely related and more distantly related species, including the rosyside dace (Clinostomus funduloides), Lahontan redside shiner (Richardsonius egregius), hornyhead chub (Nocomis biguttatus), and central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum). These microsatellite loci will provide a valuable set of tools for examining fine and coarse scale population structure, exploring reproductive success, and testing outcomes of proposed conservation initiatives (e. g. captive breeding and translocation of wild individuals) for <b>redside</b> <b>dace...</b>|$|E
40|$|Male sexual {{ornamentation}} {{may represent}} a signal designed to increase male reproductive success by conveying information to females. Carotenoid-based ornaments may serve as particularly interesting signals because of the unique properties of carotenoids. I investigated allocation issues, the life-history trade-off and reliable signalling hypotheses, {{and the source of}} carotenoid-based colouration in a wild population of male <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> (Clinostomus elongatus). I identified the chemical basis of the red integument as keto-carotenoids, used reflectance spectroscopy to obtain the spectral properties of the red colouration to test the reliable signalling hypothesis, used absorbance spectroscopy readings to quantify carotenoid content in different tissues to test for allocation and trade-offs, and identified the natural source of the carotenoids. My findings indicate that the red integument is not a reliable signal, no trade-off was observed across tissue types, and terrestrial insects were the natural source of carotenoids for <b>redside</b> <b>dace...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to examine sperm morphometry {{in relation to}} sperm velocity and sperm longevity in the <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> Clinostomus elongatus. There was significant between-male variance in sperm size and shape metrics (total sperm length, sperm head length, flagellum length and sperm head length to width ratio) and positive relationships were found between these morphometrics and sperm velocity. There were no significant relationships found between sperm morphometry and sperm longevity, nor was there a trade-off between sperm velocity and sperm longevity...|$|E
40|$|Understanding pre- and postcopulatory {{mechanisms}} of sexual selection (male-male competition and female choice) can {{provide insight into}} the evolution of male ornamentation. In this study, we use an integrative approach to study sexual selection by incorporating measures of both mechanisms using the <b>redside</b> <b>dace,</b> Clinostomus elongatus, a freshwater, externally fertilizing fish found in streams of eastern North America. We measured the success of individual male <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> in both pre- and postspawning sexual selection and related the success of males to a range of traits, including spectral properties and the size of their red spawning coloration, body size metrics and sperm quality. We found significant sexual dimorphism in the relative amount and spectral properties (saturation and brightness) of the red spawning coloration, with males being more ornamented than females. Using dichotomous mate choice trials, we found that females did not favour males with relatively larger red spawning coloration area and more saturated or brighter red spawning coloration. Males with relatively more red spawning area would be favoured in male-male postspawning sperm competition because they possess sperm with higher velocity, and sperm velocity was determined to be the key predictor of sperm competition success as assessed by paternity analyses related to in vitro sperm competition trials. These results suggest that prespawning selection via female choice is not driving the evolution of red spawning coloration and that postspawning selection via male-male competition is primarily determined by sperm velocity, which was correlated with the relative amount of red spawning coloration.

40|$|Female {{choice and}} sperm {{competition}} can be important determinants of male reproductive success. I investigated which ornamental traits females preferred, a potential direct benefit of female choice, and which sperm traits {{were related to}} competitive fertilization success, in the <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> (Clinostomus elongatus). I identified male ornaments, female preference for these ornaments, and the relationships between ornaments and sperm traits to determine if females might derive fertility benefits by choosing ornamented males. My findings indicate that females prefer males with more breeding colouration with higher hue values and that those males tended to produce large quantities of high velocity sperm. I also studied sperm competition mechanisms using in-vitro fertilization and found that sperm velocity was the primary determinant of competitive fertilization success. These studies are the first on mate choice and sperm competition in this species, and contribute {{to our understanding of}} sexual selection in general...|$|E
40|$|In 1998 and 2000, we sampled {{small stream}} fish {{communities}} at 67 sites {{to evaluate the}} status of nongame fish species in the Greater Rock River Basin. Forty-five sites were located in the Lower Rock River sub-basin and twenty-two sites in the Sugar-Pecatonica River sub-basin. All of the sites were originally sampled {{as part of the}} Fish Distribution Study during the 1970 ’s. Most of the stream sites had not been sampled since that time. Survey results indicated a decline in species richness, intolerant species and species listed as Endangered Resources. Species that were found in 1974 - 75 but not in 1998 and 2000 included blackchin shiner (Notropis heterodon), ozark minnow (Notropis nubila), redfin shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis), lake chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta) and rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum). The number of locations supporting <b>redside</b> <b>dace</b> (Clinostomus elongatus), banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) and least darter (Etheostoma microperca) declined as well. The reasons for these declines can encompass water quality, physical habitat degradation and competition with exotic species. However, expanding livestock operations during the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s may also be a contributing factor as several of the sites showing a decline in species are small streams with documented animal waste management problems...|$|E
40|$|Populations of <b>Redside</b> <b>Dace</b> Clinostomus elongatus have {{declined}} {{in many areas}} across the species ’ North American range. Therefore, the development of sperm cryopreservation technology would provide an invaluable means of preserving genetic diversity in populations that are in imminent danger of extirpation. We developed cryopreservation protocols by testing the effects of diluent (buffered sperm motility-inhibiting saline solution [BSMIS]; BSMIS + glycine; sucrose; and Hanks ’ balanced salt solution [HBSS]), cryoprotectant (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]; propylene glycol [PG]; N,N-dimethylacetamide [DMA]; and methanol), freezing rate (1, 5, and 10 ◦C/min), and male-to-male variation on sperm quality. Incubating sperm in extenders affected motility; BSMIS + glycine + methanol, BSMIS + glycine + PG, and HBSS + methanol were the only treatments for which motility was {{not significantly different from}} that of fresh sperm. Sperm frozen with sucrose had higher motility than sperm frozen with BSMIS + glycine, and sperm frozen with DMSO had higher motility than sperm frozen with methanol. Freezing rates were evaluated for BSMIS + glycine, HBSS, and sucrose; all diluents were frozen with DMSO. The effect of freezing rate was not significant for BSMIS + glycine or for HBSS, but an effect was detected for sucrose, with sperm frozen at 5 ◦C/min or 10 ◦C/min having higher motility than sperm frozen at 1 ◦C/min. The effect of extender was not significant at 1 ◦C/min or 5 ◦C/min, but an effect was detected at 10 ◦C/min such that sperm frozen with sucrose had the highest motility...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{potential}} of fish stocks is critically dependent on sperm performance in an aquatic environment. The {{aim of this}} study is to test hypotheses, which govern the initiation of sperm motility and swimming performance, through physiological functions of osmolality and Ca 2 + ion, in a threatened species of freshwater fish, the <b>redside</b> <b>dace,</b> Clinostomus elongatus. Spermatozoa motility was activated in either ionic or non-ionic media spanning a range of osmolalities. The role of Ca 2 + channels on induction of spermatozoa motility and velocity was experimentally investigated by diluting sperm in media that contain various Ca 2 + channel blockers. Results show that initiation of spermatozoa motility is a hypo-osmolality dependent mechanism. Inhibitors for L-type Ca 2 + channels partially prohibited initiation of spermatozoa motility, while velocity was significantly reduced in both L-type and T-type Ca 2 + channel blockers. Examination using W- 7, an inhibitor for Ca 2 +-dependent calmodulin, showed significant decreases in spermatozoa motility and velocity. Involvement for Ca 2 + in axonemal beating was confirmed by significant increases in velocity after adding Ca 2 + into the activation media, while motility remained unchanged in Ca 2 + supplemented activation media. Together, these findings suggest the involvement of Ca 2 + in hypo-osmolality-dependent initiation of spermatozoa motility mediated by activation of Ca 2 + binding protein in the axoneme of a freshwater fish sperm. Blocking Ca 2 + exchange through L- or T-type Ca 2 + channel influences flagellar beating force and leads to decrease in spermatozoa velocity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
