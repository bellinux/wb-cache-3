5|$|Following the {{decision}} by Fianna Fáil not to <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate. However, on 11 September the party's chief whip, Seán Ó Fearghail, {{made it clear that}} individual TDs and senators would not be permitted to sign the nomination papers of independent candidates. He said that if the party decided to support a candidacy it would be done collectively.|$|E
5|$|Through 1958, over 6000 {{individuals}} took Wood Badge and {{its popularity}} continued to expand. Local councils agitated {{for the opportunity}} to <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> Wood Badge courses. In 1953, the first council-run program was hosted by the Cincinnati Area (later Dan Beard) Council. Qualified local councils continued to provide advanced leadership training to Scoutmasters and other Scout leaders using Wood Badge. Two or more councils are allowed to join together to present Wood Badge with regional approval.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to {{centralise}} and Europeanise the government of the state. Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan. The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850, crushing the local feudal lords, and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province. The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire, and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire. An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862, when the Bosnian Christians (Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats) were granted more rights, including those to open new churches and to <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> schools. This came after several uprisings by the Christians, especially Serbs, who had the strongest national movement in the province. Ivan Franjo Jukić and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847, 1850, 1853, and 1857, but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government.|$|E

5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people {{to sign up for}} coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of the}} ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E

Many businesses hire professionals to take care of these issues, but most individuals can only do their best to learn about all this.|$|E
25|$|Machen was {{suspicious}} of mixing religion and politics. He found attempts {{to establish a}} Christian culture by political means insensitive to minorities. He was even {{more concerned about the}} corrupting influence of politics on Christianity and saw the social gospel as a terrible warning. He opposed school prayer and Bible reading in public school. This position, however, implied that Christians should <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> schools.|$|E
25|$|These {{national}} {{companies were}} vertically integrated organisations {{and it was}} difficult or impossible for private or regional enterprises to <b>run</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> trains on the national networks, or to compete in other EU countries' railway systems.
