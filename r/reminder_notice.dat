As of 5 September 2013, at least 200 bar owners had applied for licences to operate dance bars. However, the licences were not processed by the police, which prompted the owners of 200 bars to send a <b>reminder</b> <b>notice</b> to the police department on 14 August 2013, asking why they were being denied the licences even after the Supreme Court had lifted the ban. Dance bar owners have also threatened to file a contempt petition in the Supreme Court. The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters-I) stated that they were awaiting [...] "suitable guidance from the state regarding the SC order" [...] and assured that they would [...] "process the applications expeditiously" [...] upon receiving the instructions.|$|E

A number of fines trials involved testing {{the use of}} a [...] "stamp" [...] to provide a clear call to action for recipients. One of these trials involved [...] "Enforcement Orders", which are issued to those people who have failed to respond to a Penalty Notice and Penalty <b>Reminder</b> <b>Notice</b> for fines ranging from traffic and parking infringements to civil disorder offences. A red [...] "Pay Now" [...] stamp was printed in a prominent position on letters in the trial group, alongside a number of other changes that made the messaging more salient. In a sample size of 48,445 letters, there was a 3.1 percentage point increase in payment rates in the trial letters compared to the standard notice. When rolled out to scale, this translates to AUD$1.02 million in additional payments for the NSW government, as well as 8,800 fewer vehicle suspensions, which has wider socioeconomic benefits for the community.|$|E
5000|$|Membership {{constitute}} an agreement whereby the customer agree {{to purchase a}} minimum number of movies at regular list price. To join, or enter a legal obligation, the customer agree to purchase one discounted movie at the beginning, which is sent out {{as part of a}} [...] "welcome package." [...] Over the term of the agreement the minimum number of list price movies must be bought. Twenty-one times per year, the company informs each customer of the [...] "Director's Selection" [...] movie. The customer is asked to respond within 10 days whether or not he or she wants to buy this movie, which is offered at a discount provided that the response is received by Columbia House [...] "within the specified time." [...] Failure to respond results in having that movie shipped at full list price. If the customer responds negatively but in time, the idea is that the movie is not sent or charged to the customer's account. In specified circumstances, [...] "memberships" [...] are available, whereby the customer is not required to respond to Director Selection mailings unless he or she wants to buy the movie. When such memberships expire, the old rules return where a response is required in time to prevent shipping of full price movies without customer input. Customers are not reminded when those rules change. The customer also has access to a large variety of other movies, which are advertised by mail and online towards the customer. Only full price purchases deplete that minimum purchase obligation. Purchases are not cumulative, meaning that two movies bought at ten dollars each do not deplete the minimum list price movie purchases by one movie. If the minimum number of movies has not been purchased {{by the end of the}} term, the monetary worth of those movies is charged to the customers' accounts. If any purchases have been made using Columbia House's point of sale device, either credit cards or debit cards linked to credit card accounts, then those accounts are automatically debited. The company will either mail or email a <b>reminder</b> <b>notice</b> prior to the commitment expiring, giving the customer the opportunity to purchase the required purchase obligation before they are charged for any commitment or contract charges. Likewise, backordered movies are automatically debited to those accounts when they become available, without further notification to the customers. Failure to clear such purchases result in collections efforts by Columbia House against the customers.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if shared governance systems result in an increased perception of autonomy for staff nurses. The population for this study included all registered nurses providing inpatient care at two mid-sized community hospitals in the Midwest, who were not identified as supervisors, managers or executives. The convenience sample was obtained from those completing and returning a distributed survey. The sample was 146 staff nurses from each organization. Only responses from nurses with more than one year experience at the current facility were included in the study., One hospital had a shared governance system in place. The other hospital had a traditional organizational system. The theoretical framework for the study was the Neuman Systems Model (1989). Staff nurse autonomy was measured by the Nursing Activity Scale (Schutzenhofer, 1987). Management characteristics were measured by the Profile of Organizational Characteristics (Liken, 1978). Also administered was a brief demographic data questionnaire (Schutzenhofer & Musser, 1994). Each hospital provided the researcher with access to participant mailboxes of those registered nurses providing inpatient care and not in management or executive roles Surveys were placed in each mailbox, and drop boxes were made available in unit classrooms in one hospital, and in nursing administration in the other hospital. A <b>reminder</b> <b>notice</b> was placed in each participant mailbox one week after initial survey distribution. Drop boxes were retrieved by the researcher one week following the <b>reminder</b> <b>notice</b> distribution. Study participants were informed about the study by cover letter and invited to participate. Participation was strictly voluntary. Data was available only to the investigator and only group data were reported without reference to individual participants. Participant responses were completely anonymous. Questionnaires were printed on two different colors of paper in order to distinguish between hospitals. No code numbers or other identifying marks were placed on any of the questionnaires. The study provided information on which to base management decisions regarding nursing governance arrangements. School of NursingThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

40|$|Credit {{unions have}} played an {{important}} historical role in the Canadian economy. However, recent changes in the financial, agricultural and agri-food industry are posing great challenges to Credit unions in Western Canada. Much {{attention has been given}} to the impact of competitive rates and the environment offered by banks on credit union performance to the neglect of issues relating to member satisfaction and commitment which may be adding to other problems in the credit union sector. Studies by Feinberg (2001), Sibbald, et al (1999), Loser et. al (1999), Fried, et. al (1999), Karels and McClatchey (1999) and Tokle, and Tokle (2001) among others have identified key issues relating to the competitive financial roles of credit unions in small financial services, in comparative analysis studies as well as merger related issues. However many of these studies have focused on the financial aspects of credit unions, and have not dealt with broader issues {{of whether or not the}} public understands the nature of credit unions, why people stop or intend to continue being members of credit unions. A mailed questionnaire, designed to elicit understanding of and attitudes towards credit unions was sent out to 1500 Alberta residents. In spite of the fact that the survey was complex with no <b>reminder</b> <b>notice</b> sent, the response rate was 12 %. Analysis was conducted with a series of scale and logit regression analyses based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TpB) (Ajzen and Fishbein 1975, 1980 and Ajzen (2001) to elicit respondents´ beliefs, satisfaction and attitudes towards credit unions, and to measure the factors affecting their intention to patronize credit unions. Results indicate 78 % of respondents were familiar with and understood the concept of credit unions. The majority (58 %) was male, and 71 % were aged 45 or older. Respondents who are active members of a credit union generally held positive attitudes towards their credit unions, and 89 % rated their credit unions as performing well under a set of six performance categories. Analysis from the logit models found credit unions involvement with the local community and customer service to be the major reasons for credit union patronage. Elicitation of respondents´ intentions to patronize a credit union from the TpB analysis show that among the three attributes (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control), respondents´ subjective norm (siblings influence) and perceived behavioral control significantly explained patronization intentions. Results suggest that a 22 percentage of the public is unaware of credit unions, a further 30 percentage was once and is no longer a member of a credit union. For the 58 % of the population that remain committed to credit union, there are still significant issues around member involvement in decision making, communication and provision of education/training to them.

40|$|Purpose – Given {{the calls}} for {{increased}} ethics education following recent corporate collapses, this paper aims to examine the significance of ethical issues that challenge the profession and, more specifically, professional accounting bodies. Design/methodology/approach – The study assesses the perceptions via an online survey of 66 professional accounting bodies worldwide in respect of ethical issues, potential causes of ethical failure {{and the need for}} ethics education. Findings – Respondents identified a number of important challenges including conflicts of interest, earnings management and whistle-blowing. The findings also demonstrate strong support for participation in prescribing the nature of ethics education by members of professional accounting bodies. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study are based on feedback from 41 per cent of member bodies of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Despite a number of follow-up <b>reminder</b> <b>notices,</b> some regions are under-represented in the responses to the survey distributed to the (then) 160 member bodies of IFAC. Geographic isolation and language limitations contributed to the failure to gain a higher response rate. Practical implications – The findings demonstrate that professional bodies support ethics education at the pre- and post-qualifying levels of education and a willingness to {{take an active role in}} promoting ethics education to their members. Originality/value – By addressing member bodies' attitudes to ethics education, this paper fills a gap in prior literature that has been restricted to addressing the attitudes of academics, students and business organisations. ...|$|R

50|$|On a rare day {{off from}} her duties at UNIT, Liz Shaw decides to visit her friend Jean Basemore at Oakington, near Cambridge. However, Jean stands her up for their lunch, and {{is not to be}} found at her cottage: all that is there is Jean's cat and a {{television}} set — both extensively chewed. Liz telephones the Doctor, who is already on his way to Cambridge — UNIT is investigating several missing scientists. The investigation leads to the home of a cleaner, and the Doctor notices that both the cleaner and Jean had recently received <b>reminder</b> <b>notices</b> from their dentist. While the Doctor and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart investigate a suicide at the train station, Liz visits the dentist, Mr. Arnold. Her plans to investigate are thwarted by hypnotic music which sends her to sleep, and when she awakens, dazed and confused, she's had a new filling put in. The Doctor tells her that the dead man at the train station was the cleaner whose home they had visited earlier, and an examination of his body reveals that much of his flesh had been turned into a strange blue metal. As Liz examines the body, she notices that the flesh and bone are still transforming into the alien metal — and then she discovers that the body is full of small robots, like silverfish, which are excreting a blue liquid. One of the creatures attacks a UNIT soldier, and burrows into its flesh. Sergeant Benton attempts to shoot the creatures, but to no avail. In a last-ditch effort, Liz sprays the creatures with a fire extinguisher, which freezes them.|$|R

Over-exposure {{to the sun}} presents serious health risks {{and can lead to}} skin and eye damage and skin cancer. Students must therefore be educated regarding the need for suitable sun exposure, sun protection and be protected for over-exposure to the sun whilst at school. AIM To educate students regarding suitable sun smart protection strategies. To encourage both students and members of staff to get some sun exposure for vitamin D and protect themselves from the harmful effects of overexposure to the sun. IMPLEMENTATION Staff and students can access the daily local sun protection times at sunsmart. com. au (link available on student and staff intranet) or on the free SunSmart app. A combination of sun protection measures are used for all outdoor activities, during recess and lunch time, each term except for the months of June, July and August. Parents/carers are responsible to provide their children with broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher+) and approved hats for all outdoor activities. The wearing of sunglasses (labelled AS 1067) in accordance with the school dress code, is also recommended The students are required to wear school uniform approved, close-weave broad-brimmed or bucket hats that shade the face, neck and ears during each term except for the months of June, July and August whenever they are outside. This policy is a component of the Student Dress Code. Members of staff will act as role models by also wearing broad-brimmed hats and sunglasses when outside. Sunscreen is applied before going outdoors, by the student, and reapplied every two hours if outdoors. Strategies are in place to remind students to apply sunscreen before going outdoors (e. g. <b>reminder</b> <b>notices,</b> staff prompts).

40|$|Incomplete {{immunization}} {{records and}} an increasingly complex immunization schedule {{make it difficult}} for parents and providers to know what shots their children or clients need. Complete and accurate immunization records are needed for day care, sports, camp, and school, but this is difficult [...] especially when previous immunizations have been received at different clinics. Population-based immunization registries help make complete and accurate records more easily available to parents and health care providers. Registries foster the timely sending of <b>reminder</b> <b>notices</b> for children who are due for immunizations and make it possible for providers to quickly assess immunization rates in their clinic. Public health officials use registries to determine immunization rates, to identify pockets of need where immunization rates are low and to target resources. In Minnesota, over 85 % of immunizations are delivered in the private sector. Minnesota is also extensively covered by managed care organizations with an estimated 75 % of the total population enrolled in some type of managed care. Strong local community public health agencies in each county also drive local solutions to community needs. These factors and others led to a de-centralized approach to the implementation of registries. The "Minnesota Model" is based on the development of community-based registries which link together local clinics, hospitals, health plans, public health departments, and schools in each region. Each community-based registry is designed to link to a state hub. This decentralized open architecture design is based on standards for data, not hardware or software. The building begins, not by implementing a state registry into which all immunizations are entered, but at the community level. Currently, 38 % of Minnesota counties (representing 52 % of statewide births) are involved in implementing a community-based registry, and 53 % (representing 43 % of statewide births) have initiated discussions with private providers. Only 9 % of counties (5 % of statewide births) have no current registry activity. This paper describes the steps which have been taken towards developing a decentralized statewide immunization information system for Minnesota, based on recommendations put forth by The State Immunization Practices Task Force Work Group on Immunization Registries...|$|R
