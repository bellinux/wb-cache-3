40|$|The {{currently}} identified cDNA clones of mammalian {{amino acid}} transporters can be grouped into five different families. One family {{is composed of}} the proteins rBAT and the heavy chain (hc) of the cell surface antigen 4 F 2. RNAs encoding these two proteins induce a system bo,+-like (rBAT) and a system y+L-like (4 F 2 hc) activity in Xenopus oocytes. Surprisingly, rBAT and 4 F 2 hc {{do not seem to}} be pore-forming proteins. This finding supports the hypothesis that rBAT and 4 F 2 hc are subunits or modulators of the corresponding amino acid transport systems. Expression of rBAT in oocytes induces high-affinity transport of cystine, which is shared with transport of cationic and zwitterionic amino acids. The rBAT gene is expressed mainly in kidney and small intestine. The rBAT protein is localized to the microvilli of proximal straight tubules of the kidney and mucosa from the small intestine. This finding is consistent with the involvement of rBAT in a high-affinity <b>resorption</b> <b>system</b> for cystine in the proximal straight tubule of the nephron. All of these characteristics suggest that rBAT is a good candidate for a cystinuria gene. Cystinuria is an inheritable defect in high-affinity transport of cystine, shared with cationic amino acids, through epithelial cells of the renal tubule and intestinal tract. Very recently, point missense mutations have been found in the rBAT gene of cystinuria patients. The most frequent rBAT mutation, M 467 T (threonine substitution of methionine at residue 467) nearly abolished the amino acid transport activity elicited by rBAT in oocytes. This result offers convincing evidence that rBAT is a cystinuria gene. Biochemical, cytological and genetic approaches are now needed to delineate the mechanism of action of rBAT and 4 F 2 hc in the transport of amino acids...|$|E

In order to assess slanted root resorptions, a modified Malmgren index is needed [18]. A thorough comparison of various radiographic techniques {{and their ability to}} detect horizontal and slanted resorptions is, hitherto, lacking. To our knowledge, no study has compared slanted root resorptions on PA, PAN, or CBCT in relation to a true histological gold standard. The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of three radiographic techniques: CBCT, PA, and PAN in measuring slanted root resorptions compared to a true histological gold standard, in addition to determining which technique is most precise in detecting slanted root resorption by comparing PA, PAN, and CBCT to each other.|$|R

Dissecting global monocyte proteomics may offer a fresh perspective into understanding monocyte-related biological process and pathology in humans. In this study, we developed the first proteome knowledge base specifically for human monocytes. Such a knowledge base, integrating in vivo monocyte proteome datasets from human PBM samples and in vitro proteome datasets from cultured monocytes, may represent a comprehensive knowledge base for monocyte-expressed proteins in human population. We cataloged a total of 2237 unique monocyte-expressed genes, and conveyed serial information for these genes and their corresponding proteins including protein biochemical features (Mw and pI), protein functions (cellular component, molecular function, and biological processes), gene-disease association and pathway/network information.|$|R
40|$|The bisphosphonates (3 -amino- 1 -hydroxypropylidene) - 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (APD) and {{disodium}} dichloromethylidene bisphosphonate (Cl 2 MDP) effectively {{inhibit the}} accelerated bone resorption associated with some skeletal disorders, e. g., Paget's disease. However, {{it has not}} been established whether these compounds exert their inhibitory effect by rendering the bone mineral more resistant to degradation, by diminishing the activity of resorbing cells, or through some combination of both activities. In this study, we have tested these possibilities using an in vitro <b>resorption</b> assay <b>system</b> consisting of elicited rat peritoneal macrophages co-cultured with particles of 45 Ca-labeled, devitalized rat bone. This assay system permits the quantitative assessment of the action of APD and Cl 2 MDP on the two major phases of bone resorption (cell-substrate attachment and osteolysis) under circumstances where the drugs are present continuously or, most importantly for the issues in question, after the separate pretreatment of the particles or the resorbing cells...|$|R
40|$|As {{a type of}} {{traditional}} cycle for electricity generation, the main limitation of the Rankine cycle is the endothermic process for the evaporation (e) of water (w), which does not always fit very well with the trend of the heat source. The Kalina cycle can make up the efficiency loss by using a working fluid of water–ammonia, which has a variable heating process by adjusting the concentration of ammonia in the water absorbent. Based on the Kalina cycle, a combined power and refrigeration generating cycle has been proposed by Goswami, which generally has reasonable exergy efficiency but suffers from the low energy efficiency for the refrigeration process. In this study, {{a new type of}} the <b>resorption</b> cogeneration <b>system</b> is designed, which features a comparable electrical generating performance and much higher refrigerating performance than the Goswami cycle. The performances are analysed, and the exergy of the system is calculated.

This led to the discovery of cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathological bone resorption associated with primary and secondary bone tumours, particularly breast cancer metastasis, Ewing sarcoma [...] and giant cell-rich lesions such as giant cell tumour of bone and pigmented villonodular synovitis. In addition, his work has studied synovial and inflammatory macrophages and their role in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, infection and Paget disease. His work on hip and knee implants focused on the importance of biomaterial wear particles on promoting osteoclast formation, osteolysis and implant loosening. He also characterised inflammatory criteria for the histological diagnosis of infection using frozen section procedure [...] and was the first to provide a pathological description of pseudotumors associated with metal on metal hip implants.|$|R
40|$|Wear debris causes {{biological}} response which {{can result in}} periprosthetic osteolysis after total joint replacement surgery. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB), a representative transcription factor involved in inflammation, is believed {{to play an important}} role in this event by regulating the production of proinflammatory mediators and osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we sought to determine whether activation of NFκB in response to stimulation by particles could be visualized by in vivo imaging. We loaded polyethylene (PE) particles onto the calvaria of NFκB/luciferase transgenic mouse, and detected luminescence generated by activation of NFκB. On day 7 after loading, the level of luminescence was maximal. Levels of luminescence were significantly correlated with the levels of luciferase activity, proinflammatory mediator mRNAs, and bone <b>resorption</b> parameters. This <b>system,</b> which enabled us to evaluate particle-induced inflammation and osteolysis without sacrificing mice, constitutes a useful tool for evaluating the efficacy of prophylaxis or treatments for particle-induced osteolysis...|$|R
30|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the number of self-ligating appliance systems available for orthodontists. The Damon system (Ormco, Glendora, CA) is based on the use of a passive self-ligating bracket and superelastic nickel-titanium wires [18]. This system is attractive due to the promise of excellent treatment of almost every patient, providing treatment without extractions, orthognathic surgery, palatal expansion, and pain, within a short period of time [19]. The Damon system presents important advances in terms of strength and usability. It is especially emphasized that this system, with low friction brackets, applies only light forces to move the teeth [20]. It has been demonstrated that during the initial leveling and alignment stage, root <b>resorption</b> with this <b>system</b> is similar to conventional preadjusted edgewise bracket systems [21, 22]. However, root resorption after complete orthodontic treatment with the Damon system has not been investigated. Perhaps, the root resorption similarity at the leveling and alignment stage may have been consequent to the light wires initially used in both systems and to the short period of time of evaluation [12, 15 – 17, 20, 23, 24].|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} RANKL/RANK {{system is}} well {{characterized}} within bone, where RANKL/RANK signaling mediates osteoclastogenesis and bone <b>resorption.</b> However, this <b>system</b> {{has also been shown}} to influence biologic processes beyond the skeletal system, including in the immune system and in cancer. RANKL/RANK signaling is important in lymph node development, lymphocyte differentiation, dendritic cell survival, T-cell activation, and tolerance induction. The RANKL/RANK axis may also have direct, osteoclast-independent effects on tumor cells. Indeed, activity of the RANKL/RANK pathway in cancer cells has been correlated with tumor progression and advanced disease. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, inhibits osteoclastogenesis and is widely used not just for the treatment of osteoporosis, but for the prevention of skeletal-related events from bone metastases in solid malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer. The potential effects of denosumab on the immune system have been largely ignored. Nevertheless, with the emergence of immunotherapies for cancer, denosumab may impact the effectiveness of these therapies, especially if they are given in combination. In this article, we review the role of RANKL/RANK in bone, immunity, and cancer. Examining the potential effects of routine treatment with denosumab beyond the bone represents an important area of investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolated}} osteoclast bone resorption assay {{has proved}} to be a useful means of examining the response of mammalian and avian osteoclasts to a variety of stimuli. The assay has traditionally been performed over a period of 24 hours. By extending the duration of the osteoclast bone resorption assay, we have been able to assess the long-term effects of carboxyl-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein (hPTHrP[107 - 139]), salmon calcitonin (sCT) and hPTH[1 - 34] on bone resorption and TRACP-positive osteoclast-like cell number. We found that, in control cultures over a period of up to 144 hours, the osteoclast-like cells not only remained viable but their numbers also increased. The number of mononucleated and multinucleated osteoclast-like cells doubled in the first 48 hours before stabilizing over the remainder of the incubation period. Osteoblasts also proliferated, resulting in a resorption response to hPTH[1 - 34] being evident from 48 hours onward. hPTHrP[107 - 139] persistently inhibited basal and PTH-stimulated bone resorption for at least 96 - 144 hours, whereas 2 ̆ 7 escape 2 ̆ 7 from the inhibitory effect of sCT was seen after 48 - 72 hours. Decreased numbers of both mononucleated and multinucleated TRACP-positive osteoclast-like cells were seen by 48 hours in cultures treated with sCT. In contrast, hPTHrP[107 - 139] reduced the number of mononuclear TRACP-positive cells with only a late effect on multinucleated cells. Furthermore, the increased number of osteoclast-like cells seen in response to hPTH[1 - 34] was inhibited by carboxyl-terminal PTHrP. In summary, this study indicates that the extended bone <b>resorption</b> assay <b>system</b> is a complex one where both osteoclastic resorption and osteoclast maturation are evident. Using this system, we have shown that hPTHrP[107 - 139] acts as a potent long-term inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption, without evidence of escape from its effect. Its action to reduce the number of mononucleated osteoclast-like cells suggests that it affects several aspects of osteoclast activity...|$|R
40|$|Triptolide, a {{purified}} {{component of}} Tripterygiumwilfordii Hook F, {{has been shown}} to have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although triptolide has demonstrated that it could suppress bone destruction in collagen-induced mice, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Many studies have investigated the effect of triptolide on Tregs and Tregs-related cytokine involved in RA. Additionally, previous studies have implied that Tregs inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism by which triptolide influences the Treg-mediated production of IL- 10 and TGF-β 1 to affect osteoclast differentiation and bone <b>resorption.</b> In cocultures <b>system</b> of Tregs and mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), Tregs inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts and reduced the resorbed areas significantly and the production of both IL- 10 and TGF-β 1 was upregulated. When the coculture systems were pretreated with triptolide, they produced higher levels of IL- 10 and TGF-β 1. Our data indicate that triptolide enhances the suppressive effects of Tregs on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing the secretion of IL- 10 and TGF-β 1. Tregs are most likely involved in the triptolide-mediated regulation of bone metabolism and may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bone destruction...|$|R

We have studied the action of recombinant human TGF-alpha in cultured bone cells and in bone explant cultures. In clonal UMR- 106 rat osteosarcoma cells, TGF-alpha and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were equipotent in binding to the EGF receptor. TGF-alpha and EGF both stimulated resorption of neonatal mouse calvaria, and maximal responses were obtained with 10 ng/ml of TGF-alpha after 72 h in culture. The effects of both TGF-alpha and EGF in calvaria, but not those of parathyroid hormone, were inhibited by 5 X 10 (- 7) M indomethacin. Fetal rat limb bone cultures were less sensitive to TGF-alpha than neonatal mouse calvaria, with a concentration of 30 ng/ml being required to stimulate <b>resorption</b> in this <b>system.</b> The bone-resorbing activity of TGF-alpha in fetal rat bones was inhibited by 10 ng/ml calcitonin but not by 5 X 10 (- 7) M indomethacin. EGF at concentrations up to 300 ng/ml did not stimulate resorption of the limb bones at time periods up to 66 h. The results indicate that human TGF-alpha is a potent bone-resorbing agent, and support the concept that this growth factor exhibits some effects distinct from those of EGF. TGF-alpha could play an etiologic role in the hypercalcemia of malignancy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Orthodontic force {{duration}} {{can affect}} the severity of root resorption. The aim of this clinical {{study was to investigate}} the amounts of root resorption volumetrically after the application of controlled light and heavy forces in the buccal direction for 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Methods: The sample consisted of 54 maxillary first premolars in 36 patients (mean age, 14. 9 years; 21 girls, 15 boys) who required first premolar extractions as part of their orthodontic treatment. The teeth were allocated into 3 groups that varied in the duration of force application: 4, 8, or 12 weeks. The right or left first premolars were randomly selected to receive 2 levels of forces. A li ght buccally directed orthodontic force of 25 g was applied to the experimental tooth on 1 side, while a heavy orthodontic force of 225 g was applied on the contralateral premolar. At the end of the experimental period, the teeth were extracted and scanned with the microcomputed-tomography x-ray <b>system.</b> <b>Resorption</b> crater analysis was performed with specially designed software for direct volumetric measurements. Results: Significant differences in the extent of root resorption were found between 4, 8, and 12 weeks of force application (P < 0. 001), with substantially more severe resorption in the longer force duration groups. The light force produced significantly less root resorption than did the heavy force. Conclusions: After 4, 8, or 12 weeks of buccally directed orthodontic forces applied on the maxillary first premolars, the volumes of root resorption craters were found {{to be related to the}} duration and the magnitude of the forces...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The most {{frequent}} adverse effect of canine impaction is resorption of the adjacent incisors. The subjective image {{quality and the}} radiographic diagnostic accuracy for detection of simulated canine-induced external root resorption lesions in maxillary lateral incisors were compared among 6 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems in vitro. METHODS: A child cadaver skull in the early mixed dentition was obtained. This skull had an impacted maxillary left canine and allowed a reliable simulation. Simulated root resorption cavities were created in 8 extracted maxillary left lateral incisors by the sequential use of 0. 16 -mm diameter round burs in the distopalatal root surface. Cavities of varying depths were drilled in the middle or apical thirds of each tooth root according to 3 setups: slight (0. 15, 0. 20, and 0. 30 mm), moderate (0. 60 and 1. 00 mm), and severe (1. 50, 2. 00, and 3. 00 mm) resorption. The lateral incisors, including 2 intact teeth, were repositioned individually in the alveolus with approximal contacts to the impacted maxillary left canine. Six sets of radiographic images were obtained with 3 D Accuitomo-XYZ Slice View Tomograph (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan), Scanora 3 D CBCT (Soredex, Tuusula, Finland), Galileos 3 D Comfort (Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany), Picasso Trio (E-WOO Technology, Giheung-gu, Republic of Korea), ProMax 3 D (Planmeca OY, Helsinki, Finland), and Kodak 9000 3 D (Trophy, Croissy-Beaubourg, France) for each tooth setup. The CBCT images were acquired and subsequently analyzed by 12 observers. Linear models for repeated measures were {{used to compare the}} CBCT systems for the image quality and the degree of agreement between the diagnosed severity of root resorption and the true severity.

CONCLUSIONS: High image quality is important when detecting root <b>resorption.</b> The CBCT <b>systems</b> used in this study had high accuracy with no significant differences between them in the detection of the severity of root resorption. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBone is {{a dynamic}} tissue which is {{continuously}} adapting not only to external mechanical stimuli but also to internal metabolic calcium demands. During normal bone remodeling, bone-resorbing osteoclasts release calcium from the bone and digest the collagenous bone matrix, after which bone-depositing osteoblasts form unmineralized collagen matrix, which subsequently mineralizes. The detailed mechanism by which calcium is deposited {{at the site of}} mineralization and removed from it during bone resorption is largely unknown. Experimental studies are difficult to conduct because in adult bone {{only a small fraction of}} bone tissue is remodeled at any moment in time. Thus, one promising approach is to study mineral deposition and <b>resorption</b> in model <b>systems</b> in which a large fraction of the bone mineral is mobilized in a relatively short period of time. We investigated the microscopic and nanoscopic alterations of avian medullary bone architecture during the egg-laying (oviposition) cycle of hens. Medullary bone forms a labile calcium reservoir for eggshell production and is characterized by an extremely rapid and high-flux calcium metabolism. It thus, provides the unique opportunity to study processes of bone remodeling in their most intensive form. We used a combination of synchrotron X-ray tomography together with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to correlate microscopic medullary bone attributes such as the mineral content, medullary bone volume fraction and medullary bone trabecular thickness with nanoscopic alterations in the mineral particle size (thickness parameter T and length parameter L) during the oviposition cycle. To identify the timing of the different stages of the cycle, ionic calcium, phosphorus and PTH concentrations in the blood of the layers were monitored. We found that the microscopic and nanoscopic architecture of avian medullary bone material changes rapidly during the oviposition cycle. During eggshell calcification, the mineral content and the size of trabeculae of medullary bone decrease markedly. Furthermore, the average mineral particle size increases during resorption, suggesting that the smaller mineral particles are preferrentially removed. Medullary bone thus formes a fast-responding system exhibiting rapid alterations of the material at the micron and nano scale. Those mechanisms are crucial to provide calcium for the high metabolic calcium demand during eggshell mineralization...|$|R
