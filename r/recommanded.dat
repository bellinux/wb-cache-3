The difficulty in approaching the pineal region can be verified {{with the number}} of operative plans that have been proposed to reach this area: transcallosal, occipital transtentorial, infratentorial supracerebellar approaches and sitting, prone or Concorde positions. This emphasizes the surgeon's dissatisfaction with the surgical techniques described. Recently, a three-quarter prone position with the bone flap placed under the midline has been described (1, 3, 8). We have decided to test this approach that we have slightly modified and we report our results on 13 cases: 2 arachnoid cysts, 3 vascular malformations and 8 tumors (3 brainstem gliomas, 2 dysgerminomas, 1 quadrigeminal plate metastasis and 1 meningioma plus 1 metastasis of the falx). Keeping the table in a horizontal plane, risks of air embolus are eliminated. Using the natural effect of gravity, traction on the occipital lobe is no more necessary and hemianopsia no more occurs. We <b>recommand</b> the parieto-occipital route which is the shortest way to reach epiphysis and falco-tentorial notch.

Compliance des Patienten und {{operative}} Erfahrung des Behandelnden sind ausschlaggebend für Indikation und Durchführung des Eingriffs. In unserem dargestellten Fall rechtfertigt die chronische dentogene Infektion mit begleitender submandibulärer Fistelung und Vernarbung das extraorale Vorgehen.

40|$|ObjectiveOur aim was {{to assess}} single and dual-chamber {{pacemakers}} {{with a view to}} updating their reimbursement conditions by French National Health Insurance. MethodsWe performed a critical appraisal of the clinical literature (2002 – 2008) which was then submitted to a multidisciplinary working group of 10 health professionals for discussion. Manufacturers’ application files were also consulted. ResultsWe analyzed 1 health technology assessment, 1 meta-analysis, 3 guidelines and 3 randomised controlled trials providing data on more than 7000 patients with atrio-ventricular blocks (“AVB”) and/or sick sinus syndrome (“SSS”). Pacing mode did not reduce mortality or heart failure hospitalizations. Compared with ventricular pacing, atrial-based pacing (physiologic modes) reduced stroke and atrial fibrillation (“AF”). There was a significant reduction in the composite outcome of stroke or cardiovascular mortality, but only among patients with SSS. Results of quality of life, exercise capacity, functional status and pacemaker syndrome are variable. Physiologic modes were associated with higher rates of perioperative complications (lead dislodgement and infections). Results were independant of age, sex, hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, unpaced heart rate, history of heart failure or AF. Recent pacemakers with specific algorithms for minimal ventricular pacing, as compared to conventional dual-chamber pacemakers, did not reduce mortality or heart failure hospitalizations. It just moderately reduced the risk of persistent AF and the percentage of ventricular pacing. ConclusionsHAS <b>recommands</b> generally implanting a single chamber pacemaker for the management of bradycardia. Dual-chamber pacemakers DDDR have to be reserved for 2 situations: (i) SSS with evidence of impaired atrioventricular conduction, (ii) permanent AVB without AF. HAS will not recommend that pacemakers with specific algorithms for minimal ventricular pacing be systematically used instead of single-chamber pacemakers in patients presenting with SSS or paroxysmal AVB, unless more clinical trials are performed...|$|R

40|$|Methods of calculating design heat {{requirements}} of embedded snow-melting systems are assessed, particularly for those operating in cold climates. Formulas for estimating design heat requirements developed from snow-melting tests carried out during three winters at Ottawa, Canada, are {{compared with those}} recommended in the Guide and Data Book of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air- Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the only comprehensive guidelines available in North America. The relation between convective coefficients and wind speed at an exposed site compares reasonably well with that recommended by ASHRAE, provided adjustments are made for {{the size of the}} heated area, the exposure to wind, and the height at which wind speeds are measured. Evaporative coefficients recommended by ASHRAE also need to be adjusted for the size of heated area and the exposure to wind. Radiative coefficients need to be adjusted for cloud conditions. The design heat requirements for systems operating in cold climates are determined by the maximum rate of surface heat loss from bare, wet pavements for weather conditions that will probably prevail immediately after snowstorms. Design heat requirements calculated for an exposed site at Ottawa by using the heat transfer coefficients obtained are 170 Btu/ft[2]-hour (536 W/m[2]). This agrees quite well with current practice in this region. Two case histories of snow-melting tests are presented to illustrate that the use of insulation will practically eliminate ground heat loss and the need to allow for it in design calculations.

40|$|Recently, {{participation}} {{emerged as}} an appropriate tool to enhance natural resource management. Despite official recognition, {{there is no consensus}} on the practical meaning of participation. In this work, we consider the participation as a process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decision and resources affecting them. The aim of this research is to answer to the participation's issues : who should participate? when? and how? The main contribution of this reserach work is to propose a methodology that allows to introduce the participation for large projects having impacts on the landscape. The result of this methodology is a system of participation. This system is composed of elements (project, stakeholders, techniques and levels of participation) and processes (identification, characterisation and structuration of the stakeholders, identification of the participation level, choice of the participation techniques, application and evaluation of the participation) in interaction. This system of participation is general and can be used for others projects. Howewer, the chronological order of the processes is iterative and is project specific. For each of the process used in the participation system, techniques were adapted, deveopped and tested. Stakeholders identification followed the adapatation of the Mason and Mitroff technique. Stakeholders structuration was made using cluster analysis. Identification of the level of participation followed the modifications of the Daniels et al and Vroom models. Relevent identification and assessment of participation techniques were made with the help of tables. All these thechniques yield results readily and pratically usable. The way stakeholders perceive the landscape and its dynamics are also studied in this research. This study allows to analyze the type and the effects of the information presented on the participative process and on the stakeholders. Based on our results, we advise to present landscape dynamics in a participative context. We <b>recommand</b> the use of simple landscape metrics such as the area doubled with the spatialization of the transition matrix. The stakeholders landscape preference allows to identify criteria such as the attitude towards the changes that would help in the elaboration of the future project. The originalities of this study can be found at various levels. In a general way, we can list the globality of the proposed methodology, the overlap of the social and technical sciences and the application of the methodology to the third Rhone correction project. In a more specific way, we can mention technical developments such as the application of original experiments concerning the identification of stakeholders landscape preferences. The system of participation proposed provides a conceptual framework that can be applied to others participative projects such as agenda 21 or the development of any projects having impacts on the landscape...|$|R
