40|$|A new technique, termed {{spatially}} resolved combing analysis, {{was employed}} to study the conditioning prop-erties of a cationic polymer on various types of hair. In this method, special frames are employed that allow {{the application of a}} treatment to selected areas of the fibers, while shielding the remaining portions as internal reference sections. The combing traces of hair treated in such a way, obtained by using a Diastron tensile tester, show positive or negative peaks depending on whether the treatment results in an increase or a decrease of friction against the hair surface. The method has higher sensitivity than previously employed procedures that involved the measurements of hair before and after conditioning of the whole tress. The conditioning of polyquaternium- 11 was evaluated on <b>untreated,</b> Caucasian brown <b>hair</b> as well as on fibers damaged by oxidative dyeing, bleaching, bleaching/dyeing, and perming. It has been shown that the conditioning effect depends on the type of hair modification. The effect of the polymer on <b>untreated</b> <b>hair</b> is relatively small and becomes apparent only after multiple shampooing, which roughens the <b>untreated</b> sections of <b>hair.</b> For dyed hair, which exhibits three to four times higher combing forces than the reference virgin hair, the adsorbed polyquaternium- 11 reduces the combing forces to the level of <b>untreated</b> <b>hair.</b> The conditioning layer of the polymer can be removed from dyed hair by one to two shampooings. The polymer showed higher substantivity for bleached and perreed hair, with the conditioning effect persisting after multiple shampooings...|$|R

40|$|Historic {{buildings}} {{constructed with}} lime plasters often require repairs and re-plastering of areas {{as part of}} a maintenance and conservation regime. Hair is commercially available for use in lime plaster and mortar, as it is still used today to provide additional strength and crack resistance to fresh plaster. In this study we examine commercially available imported hair from a number of species as well as fresh, <b>untreated</b> horse <b>hair.</b> Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) demonstrates a loss of keratin structure in most of the imported, treated hair samples, including horse <b>hair</b> compared to <b>untreated</b> indigenous horse <b>hair</b> samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) shows that the imported horse hair has high levels of cysteic acid present which is not shown in the fresh, <b>untreated</b> <b>hair.</b> The results obtained suggest that imported hairs are treated with an oxidising agent such as bleach or acid prior to sale, and this weakens the hair making it more susceptible to failure in a building context...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Androgenetic {{alopecia}} {{in women}} {{is a frequent}} dermatological disease, characterized by shortening of ana-gen, hair thinning and hair loss. Although the chemical structure of <b>untreated</b> <b>hair</b> from normal patients has been intensively studied, the hair structure in patients with alopecia or other hair pathology has not been well described in literature or studied in detail. Our preliminary study investigated the potential of Raman micro-spectroscopy (RMS) in hair analysis, its capacity to point out differ-ences between spectral footprints to discriminate the composition of hair follicles from various regions of the scalp. The spectral images were captured by Raman micro-spectroscopy, Bruker Sentera type The comparison of Raman spectra of hair follicles in the occipital and frontal areas showed a similar footprint. The data obtained do not sustain the hypothesis that besides generating a physical change of the hair follicle’s dimensions, the minia-turization process could also involve structural changes of the hair...|$|R
