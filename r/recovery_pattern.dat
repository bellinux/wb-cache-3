40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} forest fires, coupled with changes in spatial and temporal precipitation and temperature patterns, are likely to severely affect the characteristics of forest and permafrost patterns in boreal eco-regions. Forest fires, however, are also an ecological factor in how forest ecosystems form and function, as they affect the rate and characteristics of tree recruitment. A better understanding of fire regimes and forest <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns</b> in different environmental and climatic conditions will improve the management of sustainable forests by facilitating the process of forest resilience. Remote sensing {{has been identified as}} an effective tool for preventing and monitoring forest fires, as well as being a potential tool for understanding how forest ecosystems respond to them. However, a number of challenges remain before remote sensing practitioners will be able to better understand the effects of forest fires and how vegetation responds afterward. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive review of current research with respect to remotely sensed data and methods used to model post-fire effects and forest <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns</b> in boreal forest regions. The review reveals that remote sensing-based monitoring of post-fire effects and forest <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns</b> in boreal forest regions is not only limited by the gaps in both field data and remotely sensed data, but also the complexity of far-northern fire regimes, climatic conditions and environmental conditions. We expect that the integration of different remotely sensed data coupled with field campaigns can provide an important data source to support the monitoring of post-fire effects and forest <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns.</b> Additionally, the variation and stratification of pre- and post-fire vegetation and environmental conditions should be considered to achieve a reasonable, operational model for monitoring post-fire effects and forest patterns in boreal regions...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{weakness of}} conventional reverse engineering approaches {{is the lack}} of support in identifying program structures and recurring patterns.

40|$|The coded wire tag (CWT) {{database}} contains {{detailed information}} on millions of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. released from hatcheries or smolt traps and recovered in the north Pacific Ocean and its tributaries. I used this data set to examine the spatial and temporal variation in the marine distributions of 77 hatchery and 16 wild populations of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha based on recoveries of an estimated 632, 000 tagged salmon in coastal waters from southern California to the Bering Sea during 1979 â 1994 (and 1995 â 2004 for select hatcheries). Chinook salmon showed 12 distinct region-specific <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns.</b> Chinook salmon originating in a common freshwater region had similar marine distributions, which were distinct from those of adjacent regions. Different run types (e. g., spring, summer, and fall runs) originating in the same region exhibited variation in their marine distributions consistent with recovery {{at different stages of}} their ocean residence period. <b>Recovery</b> <b>patterns</b> were surprisingly stable across years, despite high interannual variation in ocean conditions. By contrast, ocean age influenced <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns,</b> as older fish were recovered further from their natal stream than younger fish. Although most of the CWT data used in the analysis came from hatchery fish, recoveries of tagged wild populations indicate patterns similar to those of fish from nearby hatcheries. The consistency in these findings across broad geographic areas suggests that they apply to Chinook salmon across the entire Pacific Rim. Similar findings for tagged coho salmon O. kisutch indicate that the observed patterns may apply to Pacific salmon as a whole and provide a model for other highly migratory fishes that have not benefited from such intensive tagging programs. The results also have implications for the genetic control of migration and salmonâs ability to respond to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} bilingual aphasia is {{important}} {{because we need to}} be able to recommend treatments consistent with a plausible estimate of the course of recovery. Yet we lack a causal account of <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns.</b> We distinguish between the neural representation of a language network and the regions involved in the control of that network. Contrary to some claims, we argue on the basis of normal data that a single adapted network underlies the representation of more than one language and identify a frontalâ(parietal) âsubcortical network in its control. In terms of patient data, the broad expectation is that recovery of L 1 and L 2 will parallel premorbid levels of proficiency where there is no problem of language control. Recent advances mean that such an expectation can be tested on samples of patients rather than by sampling cases reported in the literature. Voxel-based morphometry can be used to relate variations in grey-matter density to variations in task performance. Understanding this relation can then help provide an estimate for future patients of the likelihood of improvement over time or a yardstick against which to measure the effectiveness of any intervention. In addition to this large sample approach, the study of individual cases remains key to achieving an understanding of the connections between representation and control and <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns.</b> We review recent cases of the effects of frontalâsubcortical damage in bilinguals and argue that they provide evidence of effects on language selection and control rather than evidence for distinct neural networks underlying the processing of a second language. We conclude that there are good prospects for substantially improving our understanding of <b>recovery</b> <b>patterns</b> and that neuroimaging studies during recovery will provide further constraints on the mechanisms of control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the acute neuromuscular, biochemical and endocrine responses to a maximal speed training (MST) session. Eighteen male rugby players completed the protocol, which involved performing six maximal effort repetitions of 50 m running sprints with 5 minutes recovery between each sprint.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the time course of}} recovery from neuromuscular fatigue and some biochemical changes between two female soccer matches separated by an active or passive recovery regime. METHODS: Countermovement jump (CMJ), sprint performance, maximal isokinetic knee flexion and extension, creatine kinase (CK), urea, uric acid, and perceived muscle soreness were measured in 17 elite female soccer players before, immediately after, 5, 21, 45, 51, and 69 h after a first match, {{and immediately after}} a second match. Eight players performed active recovery (submaximal cycling at 60 % of HRpeak and low-intensity resistance training at < 50 % 1 RM) 22 and 46 h after the first match. RESULTS: In response to the first match, a significant decrease in sprint performance (- 3. 0 +/- 0. 5 %), CMJ (- 4. 4 +/- 0. 8 %), peak torque in knee extension (- 7. 1 +/- 1. 9 %) and flexion (- 9. 4 +/- 1. 8 %), and an increase in CK (+ 152 +/- 28 %), urea (15 +/- 2), uric acid (+ 11 +/- 2 %), and muscle soreness occurred. Sprint ability was first to return to baseline (5 h) followed by urea and uric acid (21 h), isokinetic knee extension (27 h) and flexion (51 h), CK, and muscle soreness (69 h), whereas CMJ was still reduced {{at the beginning of the}} second match. There were no significant differences in the <b>recovery</b> <b>pattern</b> between the active and passive recovery groups. The magnitude of the neuromuscular and biochemical changes after the second match was similar to that observed after the first match. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals differences in the <b>recovery</b> <b>pattern</b> of the various neuromuscular and biochemical parameters in response to a female soccer match.
