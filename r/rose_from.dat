5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said he <b>rose</b> <b>from</b> the dead, although exact {{details of their}} experiences are unclear.

On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
