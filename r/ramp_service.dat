50|$|During Lorenzo's tenure, Eastern was {{crippled}} by severe labor unrest. Asked to accept {{deep cuts in}} pay and benefits, on March 4, 1989, Frank Lorenzo locked out Eastern's mechanics and <b>ramp</b> <b>service</b> employees, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Concerned that if Lorenzo was successful in breaking the IAM he {{would do the same}} to the pilots' and flight attendants' unions, the pilots represented by Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) and flight attendants represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) called a sympathy strike. Those actions effectively shut down the airline's domestic operations. Non-contract employees, including airport gate and ticket counter agents and reservation sales agents, did not honor the strike. Due to the lockout and sympathy strike, cancelled flights resulted in the loss {{of millions of dollars in}} revenue.|$|E

40|$|The e_cient {{use of the}} {{available}} assets {{is the goal of}} the liberalized electricity market. Nowadays, the development of new technologies of renewable production results in a signi_cant increase in the total installed capacity of this type of generation in the power system. However, the unpredictable nature of this resources results in a changing and non controllable generation that forces the power system to be constantly adapting to these new levels of production. Thermal units, that are the base of generation, are the responsible to replace this changing generation, but their ramp rates may not be fast enough to adapt it. Thus, other resources must be developed to overcome these inconveniences. The degree to which these resources help system stability is called exibility. In this thesis, depending on operational short-term or investment long-term decisions, di_erent points of view about exibility are studied. Short-term includes sources as adaptable demand or storage availability while long-term is examined with the investment. To study the inuence of sources in short-term planning, a model of the National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia is developed. Flexibility in long-term is analyzed with IEEE- 6 and IEEE- 30 node systems, applying Benders decomposition. System Flexibility Index and economic bene_t are calculated to measure exibility. This indicators show the utility of developed model in forecasting the required <b>ramp</b> <b>service</b> in future power systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} scheduling of airport <b>ramp</b> <b>service</b> employees (RSEs) {{is vital for}} the smooth operation of airlines, since it will satisfy the manpower demand while minimizing the manpower cost. Airlines use established flight schedules, which by nature are deterministic in terms of arrival and departure times, as the primary input to calculate the manpower demand for RSEs. However, in practice, airline operations are subject to many uncertain factors, such as weather, air traffic control routing, and non-routine maintenance. Flight delays, caused by these factors, are usually not considered during RSE scheduling. Therefore, with random flight delays, the theoretically “optimal” scheduling plan will not remain optimal in terms of satisfying manpower demands and saving manpower costs. ^ This study used historical on-time performance as well as flight schedules as inputs to a demand simulation program, which was used to project manpower demands during the planning period. Working schedules of RSEs to cover these demands were generated by the shift scheduling model using mixed integer programming and robust optimization. The scheduling plan generated by the robust scheduling model was compared with the plan generated by the deterministic model {{in terms of the}} overall cost, the number of demand violations, and the penalty cost {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the approach proposed by this study. Findings suggested that the scheduling plan generated by the robust scheduling model saved more on the overall cost and the penalty, and had less demand violations than the scheduling plan generated by the deterministic model. ^ Through the method proposed by this study, airlines may be able to save on overall manpower costs, respond faster and better to manpower demand variations caused by unexpected flight delays, and decrease the number of manpower demand violations. Also, a scheduler will be able to adjust the scheduling plan according to the anticipated on-time performance by simply changing the value of the overall demand satisfaction rate in the scheduling model, which could reduce the workload of the scheduler. ...|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Government of Pakistan {{considered}} selling the airline {{to the private}} sector due to the persistent losses suffered by the airline. The government announced its privatization plans but they were never implemented. Several steps towards outsourcing of non-core business have been initiated. Catering units (starting with Karachi Flight Kitchen), ground handling (starting with <b>ramp</b> <b>services)</b> and engineering, are to be gradually carved out of the airline and operated as independent companies. During 1997, Pakistan called in a team from International Finance (IFC), the consulting arm of the World Bank, to advise on restructuring and privatization of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). However, no agreement was reached. The government has had many plans for the privatization of the State owned airline. However, no reasonable agreement or solution has been found to this day.
