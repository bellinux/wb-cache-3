40|$|In Aspergillus nidulans, proline {{can serve}} {{both as a}} carbon and a {{nitrogen}} source. The transcription of the prnB gene, encoding the proline transporter, is efficiently repressed only by the simultaneous presence of ammonium and glucose. Thus, repression of this gene demands the activation of the CreA repressor and the inactivation of the positive-acting GATA factor AreA. Repression of all other prn structural genes results largely from inducer exclusion. In an area null mutation background, prnB is repressible by the sole presence of glucose. We have determined by EMSA and missing-base interference experiments that there are 15 AreA-binding sites in the prnD-prnB intergenic region. Only sites 13 / 14, in {{the proximity of the}} prnB TATA box, are clearly involved in transcriptional activation and <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of these sites mimics qualitatively the regulatory effect of an area null mutation. The deletion of the TATA box has a measurable effect on the maximal level of prnB transcription but does not alter the regulation pattern of this gene. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Premature {{termination}} codons (PTCs) {{are known}} to decrease mRNA levels. Here, we report our investigation of the mechanism for this downregulation using the TCR- � gene, which acquires PTCs {{as a result of}} programmed rearrangements that occur during normal thymic development. We found that a mini-gene version of this gene, which contains only three TCR-� exons, exhibited efficient downregulation in response to PTCs. This demonstrates that the full coding sequence is not necessary for appropriate <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of the translation start AUG and a downstream in-frame AUG that displayed similarity to the Kozak consensus sequence reversed the downregulatory response to PTCs. Thus, an AUG start codon is required to define the reading frame of a PTC. Specific suppressor tRNAs also reversed the downregulatory response, strongly implicating the involvement of a translation-like process. Remarkably, the addition of suppressor tRNAs or the inactivation of the start AUGs caused a dramatic rise in the levels of PTC-bearing transcripts in the nuclear fraction prepared by two independent methods. Collectively, our results provide evidence for a codon-based surveillance mechanism associated with the nucleus that downregulates aberrant transcripts encoding potentially toxic polypeptides from nonproductively rearranged genes. 1 Abbreviations used in this paper: BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; DHFR...|$|E

40|$|Exons 2 and 3 of alpha-tropomyosin are spliced in {{a strict}} {{mutually}} exclusive manner. Exon 3 is a default choice, being selected {{in almost all}} cell types where the gene is expressed. The default selection arises from a competition between the two exons, in which the stronger branch point/pyrimidine tract elements of exon 3 win. Exon 2 is selected predominantly or exclusively only in smooth muscle cells. We show here that {{the basis for the}} smooth muscle-specific switching of exon selection is inhibition of exon 3. Exon 3 is still skipped with smooth muscle specificity, {{even in the absence of}} exon 2. We have defined two conserved sequence elements, one in each of the introns flanking exon 3, that are essential for this <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of either element severely impairs regulated suppression of exon 3. No other exon or intron sequences appear to be necessary for regulation. We have also demonstrated skipping of exon 3 that is dependent upon both regulatory elements in an in vitro splicing assay.

40|$|MOTIVATION: The {{interaction}} between transcription factor (TF) and transcription factor binding site (TFBS) {{is essential for}} gene <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> in either the TF or the TFBS may weaken their interaction and thus result in abnormalities. To maintain such vital interaction, a mutation {{in one of the}} interacting partners might be compensated by a corresponding mutation in its binding partner during the course of evolution. Confirming this co-evolutionary relationship will guide us in designing protein sequences to target a specific DNA sequence or in predicting TFBS for poorly studied proteins, or even correcting and rescuing disease mutations in clinical applications. RESULTS: Based on six, publicly available, experimentally validated TF-TFBS binding datasets for the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) family, Homeo family, High-Mobility Group (HMG) family and Transient Receptor Potential channels (TRP) family, we showed that the evolutions of the TFs and their TFBSs are significantly correlated across eukaryotes. We further developed a mutual information-based method to identify co-evolved protein residues and DNA bases. This research sheds light on the dynamic relationship between TF and TFBS during their evolution. The same principle and strategy can be applied to co-evolutionary studies on protein-DNA interactions in other protein families.

40|$|Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) {{expression}} {{is important for}} proliferation and is elevated in many tumor cells. We previously showed that Sp 1 is a major positive regulator of ODC transcription. In this paper we have investigated transcriptional regulation of rat ODC by the closely related factor Sp 3. While over-expression of Sp 1 caused a dramatic activation of the ODC promoter, over-expression of Sp 3 caused little or no activation in either Drosophila SL 2 cells (lacking endogenous Sp 1 or Sp 3) or in H 35 rat hepatoma cells. Furthermore, co-transfection studies demonstrated that Sp 3 abolished trans -activation of the ODC promoter by Sp 1. DNase I footprint studies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that both recombinant Sp 1 and Sp 3 bind specifically to several sites within the ODC promoter also protected by nuclear extracts, including overlapping GC and CT motifs located between - 116 and - 104. This CT element is a site of negative ODC <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of either element reduced binding, but mutation of both sites was required to eliminate binding of either Sp 1 or Sp 3.

The double mutant gcn 5 hd 1 restored a normal photomorphogenic phenotype. By contrast, the double mutant gcn 5 taf 1 resulted in further loss of light-regulated gene expression. gcn 5 reduced acetylation of histones H 3 and H 4, mostly on the core promoter regions, whereas hd 1 increased acetylation on both core and more upstream promoter regions. GCN 5 and TAF 1 were both required for H 3 K 9, H 3 K 27, and H 4 K 12 acetylation on the target promoters, but H 3 K 14 acetylation was dependent only on GCN 5. Interestingly, gcn 5 taf 1 had a cumulative effect mainly on H 3 K 9 acetylation. On the other hand, hd 1 induced increased acetylation on H 3 K 9, H 3 K 27, H 4 K 5, and H 4 K 8. GCN 5 was also shown to be directly associated with the light-responsive promoters.

The copZA promoter region contains an inverted repeat sequence similar to that recognized by the mercury-sensing MerR protein. To investigate the possible involvement of MerR homologues in copZA regulation, null mutations were engineered affecting each of four putative MerR-type regulators: yyaN, yraB, yfmP and yhdQ. Two of these genes affected copper <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of yhdQ (hereafter renamed cueR) dramatically reduced copper induction of copZA, and purified CueR bound with high affinity to the copZA promoter region. These results suggest that CueR is a direct regulator of copZA transcription that mediates copper induction. Surprisingly, a yfmP mutation also reduced copper induction of copZA. Sequence analysis suggested that yfmP was cotranscribed with yfmO, encoding a putative multidrug efflux protein. The yfmPO operon is autoregulated: a yfmP mutation derepressed the yfmP promoter and purified YfmP bound the yfmP promoter region, but not the copZA promoter region. Since the yfmP mutant strain was predicted to express elevated levels of the YfmO efflux pump, {{it was hypothesized that}} copper efflux might be responsible for the reduced copZA induction. Consistent with this model, in a yfmP yfmO double mutant copper induction of copZA was normal.

The disease phenotypes reflect the function of SOX 10 in diverse tissues including the neural crest, central nervous system and otic vesicle. As expected, the SOX 10 expression pattern is complex and highly dynamic, but little is known of the underlying mechanisms regulating its spatiotemporal pattern. SOX 10 expression is highly conserved between all vertebrates characterised. Results: We have combined in vivo testing of DNA fragments in zebrafish and computational comparative genomics to identify the first regulatory regions of the zebrafish sox 10 gene. Both approaches converged on the 3 ' end of the conserved 1 st intron as being critical for spatial patterning of sox 10 in the embryo. Importantly, we have defined a minimal region crucial for this function. We show that this region contains numerous binding sites for transcription factors known to be essential in early neural crest induction, including Tcf/Lef, Sox and FoxD 3. We show that the identity and relative position of these binding sites are conserved between zebrafish and mammals. A further region, partially required for oligodendrocyte expression, lies in the 5 ' region of the same intron and contains a putative CSL binding site, consistent with a role for Notch signalling in sox 10 regulation. Furthermore, we show that β-catenin, Notch signalling and Sox 9 can induce ectopic sox 10 expression in early embryos, consistent with regulatory roles predicted from our transgenic and computational results.

Here we analyzed arsenic–Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap 1) cysteine thiol interaction in Nrf 2 activation. Arsenic-based Nrf 2 activators, fluorescent biarsenical labeling reagent (FlAsH) and phenylarsine oxide (PAO), {{were used to}} probe binding of arsenic to Keap 1. Strong fluorescence was observed on binding of FlAsH to purified Keap 1. Pretreatment with arsenic, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), or 2, 3 -dimercaptopropanol significantly reduced the fluorescent signal. PAO affinity beads effectively pulled down Keap 1 in vitro and from hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells. Arsenic, tBHQ, free PAO, or cadmium blocked Keap 1 pulldown. Furthermore, arsenic and free PAO significantly reduced the free thiol contents of purified or endogenous Keap 1. Thus, arsenic, FlAsH, and PAO, as well as tBHQ and cadmium, bind to Keap 1 cysteine thiols in a similar fashion. All the domains of Keap 1 bound PAO, and the linker region exhibited the highest binding activity. The function of arsenic-Keap 1 interaction was evaluated in a reconstituted system that mimics endogenous Nrf 2 <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of Cys 273 or Cys 288 in the linker region resulted in high level basal expression of Nrf 2 protein.

40|$|In yeast, {{heat shock}} factor (HSF) is a trimer that binds DNA constitutively but only {{supports}} {{high levels of}} transcription upon heat shock. The C-terminal regions of HSF from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis are unconserved yet both contain strong transactivators which are correctly regulated when substituted for each other. We have performed high resolution mapping of these activator domains which shows that in K. lactis HSF (KlHSF) activity can be located to a confined short domain, while in S. cerevisiae HSF (ScHSF) two separate regions are required for full activity. Alignment of the activator domains reveals similarity, as both overlap potential leucine zipper motifs (zipper C) with a distribution of hydrophobic residues similar to two highly conserved N-terminal domains which mediate HSF trimerization (zippers A and B). In higher eukaryotes a C-terminal leucine zipper is required to maintain HSF in a monomeric and non DNA-binding state under normal conditions and we therefore address the regulatory roles of the three leucine zipper motifs in KlHSF. Whilst the longest and most N-terminal of the trimer region zippers, A, is dispensable for <b>regulation,</b> <b>mutation</b> of a single leucine in zipper B makes HSF constitutively active. In contrast {{to the situation in}} higher eukaryotes disruption of zipper C has no observable regulatory effect and therefore, although an intramolecular contact between zippers B and C cannot be ruled out, such contact is not required for restraining the C-terminal activator domain. We furthermore find that deletions which abolish activator potential of the C-terminus render the host strain temperature sensitive. However, deletion of a double proline-glycine motif in the activator, whilst leaving HSF unable to respond to heat shock, does not cause temperature sensitivity.

40|$|Accurate {{regulation}} of gene transcription {{is essential for}} organismal survival, and is orchestrated by myriad transcription factors and cofactors (TFs). Little is known about how the intrinsic activity of TFs is controlled. Recent work has indicated that the selective proteolysis of TFs provided by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) {{plays an important role}} in stimulating gene expression through a ‘destruction-activation’ mechanism, whereby the degradation of a ‘used’ TF is thought to stimulate further ‘fresh’ TF binding and reinitiate gene transcription. TFs are targeted to the proteasome via E 3 ligases that mediate the addition of ubiquitin molecules to form a chain on the substrate TF. These polyubiquitin chains may be extended by E 4 ligases, which recognize substrates with four or more ubiquitin molecules, amplifying substrate targeting to the proteasome. In plants the immune response to many pathogens is regulated by the hormone salicylic acid (SA), which operates through the transcriptional coactivator NPR 1 to induce large scale changes in gene expression. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NPR 1 appears to be required for the activation of its target genes. Mutation of the E 3 ligase prevents ubiquitination of NPR 1, leading its to stabilisation and suppression of transcription. Chapter 3 of this work identifies the first E 4 ligase, UBE 4, involved in NPR 1 <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of UBE 4 resulted in reduced capacity to polyubiquitinate substrates and stabilized NPR 1. In contrast to E 3 ligase mutants, however, mutant ube 4 plants displayed increased NPR 1 target gene expression. These results suggest that initial ubiquitination of NPR 1 may stimulate its ability to initiate transcription and that subsequent ubiquitin chain elongation limits NPR 1 activity by targeting it to the proteasome. Chapter 4 describes a ubiquitin-protein-ligase (UPL) which is both novel and crucial to the SA-mediated defence response. Mutation of this UPL leads a large reduction in total cellular polyubiquitinated proteins and was associated with strongly enhanced disease susceptibility. Gene expression profiling of upl mutants revealed an intimate connection between cellular polyubiquitination and appropriate activation of SA-responsive gene expression programmes. Destruction activation was first described in yeast and is required for the {{regulation of}} yeast amino acid synthesis TF GCN 4. GCN 4 requires proteasome-mediated degradation to induce genes involved in amino acid production. Chapter 5 investigates the role of two E 4 ligases in GCN 4 turnover. While one mutation had little effect of GCN 4 -mediated transcription a second increased basal transcriptional levels, suggesting that an E 4 is required for the prevention of spurious GCN 4 -mediated transcription. In summary the work presented here describes cellular mechanisms by which global and substrate-specific polyubiqutination are vital to regulation of gene transcription...|$|E

The yeast [PSI+] prion is an epigenetic modifier of translation termination fidelity that causes nonsense suppression. The prion [PSI+] forms when the translation termination factor Sup 35 p adopts a self-propagating conformation. The presence of the [PSI+] prion modulates survivability {{in a variety of}} growth conditions. Nonsense suppression is essential for many [PSI+]-mediated phenotypes, but many {{do not appear to be}} due to read-through of a single stop codon, but instead are multigenic traits. We hypothesized that other global mechanisms act in concert with [PSI+] to influence [PSI+]-mediated phenotypes. We have identified one such global regulator, the Paf 1 complex (Paf 1 C). Paf 1 C is conserved in eukaryotes and has been implicated in several aspects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in Ctr 9 p an...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} of phage-plasmid P 4 in its host Escherichia coli {{depends on its}} replication protein α. In the plasmid state, P 4 copy number {{is controlled by the}} regulator protein Cnr (copy number <b>regulation).</b> <b>Mutations</b> in α (αcr) that prevent regulation by Cnr cause P 4 over-replication and cell death. Using the two-hybrid system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a system based on λ immunity in E. coli for in vivo detection of protein–protein interactions, we found that: (i) α protein interacts with Cnr, whereas αcr proteins do not; (ii) both α–α and αcr–αcr interactions occur and the interaction domain is located within the C-terminal of α; (iii) Cnr–Cnr interaction also occurs. Using an in vivo competition assay, we found that Cnr interferes with both α–α and αcr–αcr dimerization. Our data suggest that Cnr and α interact in at least two ways, which may have different functional roles in P 4 replication control...|$|R
40|$|Acute and {{specific}} sensing of diatomic gas molecules {{is an essential}} facet of biological signaling. Heme-Nitric oxide/Oxygen sensing (H-NOX) proteins are a family of gas sensors found in diverse classes of bacteria and eukaryotes. In mammals, the H-NOX is the sensor domain of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). The H-NOX of sGC binds the diatomic radical gas NO with picomolar affinity and activates production of the second messenger cyclic GMP from GTP. Bacterial H-NOX domains are divided into two subfamilies. In facultative anaerobes, H-NOX domains are encoded as single domain proteins that regulate an effector protein expressed on the same operon. These H-NOX proteins specifically sense NO, inhibit the effector, either a histidine kinase or cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, and regulate a biofilm formation phenotype. In obligate anaerobes, H-NOX domains are fused to methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. These H-NOX domains have a conserved H-bonding network in the gas ligand-binding pocket that allows formation of a stable bond with O 2. The function of these O 2 -binding H-NOX domains is unknown. However, they are likely involved in regulating a repellent chemotaxis response. Because both NO and O 2 are toxic to obligate anaerobes, the physiological ligand for these H-NOX domains is not yet known. These H-NOX domains stably bind NO, but the conservation of the H-bonding network suggests a role in O 2 signaling. In this dissertation, biological function of both subfamilies of H-NOX domains is explored. The chemotaxis signaling circuit of Caldanaerobacter subterraneus was reconstituted in vitro, but no gas ligand or H-NOX dependence was identified. Crystal structures of C. subterraneus H-NOX and orthogonal functional assays with the histidine kinase from Vibrio cholerae indicate specific O 2 signaling function. Additionally, the role of two conserved glycine residues termed the “glycine hinge” was examined. In structures of both NO and O 2 sensing H-NOX domains, a conformational change occurs upon ligand binding along this glycine hinge. However, some H-NOX domains from Flavobacteriaceae have a native alanine substitution {{in the position of}} one glycine residue. It was predicted that the steric bulk from the alanine methyl group would prevent the conformational shift. However, H-NOX dependent histidine kinase assays display NO dependent <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutation</b> of the alanine to a glycine however, destabilizes the H-NOX conformation and allows kinase inhibition independent of NO. Finally, function of the NO sensing H-NOX from Vibrio cholerae was explored. Deletions of V. cholerae H-NOX and its histidine kinase show that the H-NOX controls biofilm formation. Proteomics experiments show that the cholera toxin master regulator TcpN is upregulated in an NO and H-NOX dependent manner. Finally deletion mutants of both the H-NOX and its kinase have a modest but significant competitive advantage compared to wild type V. cholerae during infant mouse infections...|$|E

Seventy nucleotide {{differences were found between}} the wild-type sequences, resulting in 13 amino acid changes. The deduced amino acid changes do not correspond to published AmpC <b>regulation</b> <b>mutations</b> and expand the number of known mutations leading to altered AmpC b-lactamase expression in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The production of the Bush group 1 (1), chromosomally encoded AmpC b-lactamase of gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii is normally induc-ible. Three genes, in addition to ampC (the structural gene for the b-lactamase), which are known to participate in the induc-tion process have been identified. These genes are ampR, which encodes a transcriptional regulator; ampD, which en-codes an enzymatic repressor of induction; and ampG, which encodes a transmembrane protein which possibly functions a...|$|R

The molecular roles of PQBP1 in embryonic development are still being understood, {{but it has been}} found to function in mRNA splicing, and transcription <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in the PQBP1 gene, which encodes for this protein, have been known to cause X-linked intellectual disabilities (XLID), commonly referred to as Renpenning's syndrome. People who suffer from these disabilities share a common set of symptoms including: microcephaly, shortened stature and impaired intellectual development. [...] There are 11 types of mutations that have been identified, but the most common being frameshift mutations. A knockdown model of the gene in mouse embryo primary neurons revealed a decrease in splicing efficiency and resulted in abnormal gastrulation and neuralation patterning. [...] Attempts at creating both PQBP1 mouse knockout or over expression models have been unsuccessful, often with lethal results. Research indicates that in order to appropriately function, the protein must be expressed within a critical range.|$|R

Analysis of a Fur-regulated beta-galactosidase reporter gene revealed {{a loss of}} iron regulation {{as a result of}} the fur mutation. trans complementation with the cloned Y. pestis fur gene restored iron regulation. The expression of most iron-regulated proteins was also deregulated by this mutation; however, a number of iron-repressible and two iron-inducible polypeptides retained normal <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in fur or hmsH, a gene encoding an 86 -kDa surface protein required for hemin storage, increased the sensitivity of Y. pestis cells to the bacteriocin pesticin. Interestingly, the Y. pestis fur mutant lost temperature control of hemin storage; however, expression of the HmsH polypeptide was not deregulated. When grown with excess iron, a Y. pestis fur mutant possessing the 102 -kb pigmentation locus exhibited severe growth inhibition and a dramatic increase in the number of spontaneous nonpigmented chromosomal deletion mutants present at late log phase. These results suggest that the Fur protein of Y. pestis is an important global regulator and that a separate Fur-independent iron regulatory system may exist...|$|R

Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) and stress-induced malignant hyperthermia (MH) events are syndromes that primarily afflict military recruits in basic training and athletes. Events similar to those occurring in ER and in stress-inducedMHevents are triggered after exposure to anesthetic agents in MH-susceptible (MHS) patients. MH is an autosomal dominant hypermetabolic condition that occurs in genetically predisposed subjects during general anesthesia, induced by commonly used volatile anesthetics and/or the neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine. Triggering agents cause an altered intracellular calcium <b>regulation.</b> <b>Mutations</b> in RYR 1 gene {{have been found in}} about 70 % of MH families.
