5|$|As {{part of the}} refurbishment, the Italian company Pininfarina was {{contracted}} to <b>redesign</b> the interiors, and The Yard Creative was selected to design the new buffet cars.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to <b>redesign</b> coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief {{before it could be}} released as a circulating coin. <b>Redesign</b> of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a <b>redesign</b> in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E
50|$|On February 7, 2011, Lifehacker {{revealed}} a <b>redesigned</b> site with a cleaner layout. Then, on April 15, 2013, Lifehacker <b>redesigned</b> their site again {{to match the}} other newly <b>redesigned</b> Gawker sites, like Kotaku.|$|R

5|$|On 16 February 2006 {{the unit}} reorganized as the 82d Sustainment Brigade under the Army's modular {{transformation}} <b>redesign.</b> As {{a part of}} this <b>redesign,</b> the brigade was removed from the command of the 82d Airborne Division and made a separate, independent unit. It would continue to support the 82d Airborne Division, but it would be able to take on different missions when deployed. Instead, its mission is to support all US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) units stationed at Fort Bragg while generating sustainment capabilities to meet rotational demand and respond to future contingencies.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel {{was heavily}} struck during its 30-year run, except during {{economic}} downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended {{production of the}} three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as {{the only one in}} copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the <b>redesign</b> of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a provision in the latter act made them eligible for immediate <b>redesign.</b> In 1896, pattern nickels were struck {{for the first time since}} 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no <b>redesign</b> took place.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a <b>redesign</b> of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a <b>redesign</b> of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E

5|$|The post-war years saw the Echo drop Shipping Gazette {{from its}} main title-piece, {{following}} a <b>redesign</b> in 1959. Instead, the paper {{became known as}} Echo Sunderland for several years, although the name Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette continued to be printed in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece <b>redesign</b> in 1972, however, dispensed with the words Shipping Gazette and introduced an illustration of Wearmouth Bridge alongside the title Echo Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{restarted}} in 1981, largely as an interim measure while the stealth bomber entered service. This {{led to a}} <b>redesign</b> as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during the <b>redesign,</b> and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.|$|E

5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Pittman Act in 1918, the United States Mint was {{required}} to strike millions of silver dollars, and began to do so in 1921, using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I; although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the <b>redesign,</b> they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December 1921, completing the <b>redesign</b> of United States coinage that had begun in 1907.|$|E
5|$|After her father's {{death in}} 1882, Alice Longfellow {{commissioned}} two of America's first female landscape architects, Martha Brookes Hutcheson and Ellen Biddle Shipman, to <b>redesign</b> the formal {{garden in the}} Colonial Revival style. The garden was recently restored by an organization called Friends of the Longfellow House, which completed {{the final stage of}} its reconstruction, the historic pergola, in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and <b>redesign.</b> The Command Module {{was found to}} be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).|$|E

5|$|At the 2000 Perl Conference, Jon Orwant made a {{case for}} a major new language-initiative. This led to a {{decision}} to begin work on a <b>redesign</b> of the language, to be called Perl 6.

5|$|In 1854 William Gibbs {{commissioned}} John Gregory Crace, {{an architect}} {{he was already}} using elsewhere, to <b>redesign</b> and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield. These new designs included gilded panelling, woodwork, moulding and chimneypieces all in the Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin <b>redesign</b> and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate <b>redesign</b> by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for <b>redesign</b> in 1916.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{a decade}} of work began on the {{construction}} of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat.
