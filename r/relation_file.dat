Among the approaches developed till date to stop spam, filtering is an important and popular technique. Common practices for mail filters include organizing incoming email and removal of spam mails and viruses. A rare use is to examine outgoing email at some companies to ensure that employees observe with appropriate rules. Users might also employ a mail filter to prioritize messages, and to sort them into folders based on subject matter or other criteria. For many years these elements have driven pattern recognition and machine learning communities to keep improving email filtering techniques. Mail filters can be connected by the user, either as separate packages, or as part of their email program as email client. In case of emails, users can make manual filters which automatically filter mail according to the criteria chosen by particular user. In this paper, we present a survey of the performance of six machine learning methods in spam filtering techniques. Experiments are carried out on different classification techniques and association techniques using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). Different classifiers are applied on one benchmark dataset in to evaluate which classifier gives better result. The dataset is in Attribute <b>Relation</b> <b>File</b> Format (ARFF). 10 fold cross validation is used to provide well accuracy. Result...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 66). A data set on ‘Preprimary education’ consisting of eleven hundred and fourteen data was collected from IED BRAC University. At {{the end of the}} study the students were tested out of eighteen and scored according to their performance. The entire data set was divided in three groups, and the results were classified in four parts. The first data set consisted of the socio economic attributes and the result obtained from the test, the second data set contained other likely attributes which could possibly have affected the results, like the education of parents, siblings, average education of student’s families etc. The third and final data set consisted of the marks they scored in each question and the net total mark obtained, to test their readiness. The results were classified into four groups called fully prepared, partially prepared, unprepared and needs help and they were categorized accordingly. An attribute <b>relation</b> <b>file</b> format, a format which is compatible with WEKA was made of each data set, before taking input. Once input was taken, these data sets were analyzed using several machine learning algorithms. The main goal of analyzing the data was to test whether or not the preprimary education prepares the students for primary education. The algorithms used in analyzing the data set were Super vector machine: Sequential Maximization Optimization, Multilayer perceptron: Back propagation algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, Random tree and random forest. The results obtained from each algorithm were compared and the algorithm performing the best was selected. Sushmita Laila KhanNusrat Jahan FerozB. Computer Science and Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} company data {{deposited}} in {{hierarchical storage management}} systems heavily increases. Thus, new approaches are necessary {{to keep track of}} a data pool. This paper introduces a semantic storage extension (SSE) for existing hierarchical storage management systems that allows them to exploit semantic <b>relations</b> between <b>files</b> and use them for a more efficient and more intelligent data management. Our approach enhances traditional hierarchical storage management systems regarding migration, deletion, and retrieval operations by making use of semantic <b>relations</b> between <b>files</b> and contextual knowledge. Thereby a predictive file management is possible, which contributes to an increasing system performance and a better user experience. To this end, the SSE uses extracted features of documents to define relations between them and also offers the possibility to specify additional knowledge by a domain expert...|$|R

The story of EU becoming an independent and global actor in foreign policy is a story of the ways of EU dealing with the problems within its own yard - western Balkans. The analysis should put some lights on the EU-western Balkan relations, the reasons behind and the possible future development.

50|$|After {{attending}} the Reviving the Islamic Spirit Conference in Toronto in 2004, scores of Americans were stopped by U.S. Custom and Border Protection agents at the U.S.‑Canada border. They were frisked, interrogated, fingerprinted and photographed. Their information was entered into government databases. This occurred {{as a result}} of a federal policy that targeted thousands of people who attended Islamic conferences outside of the United States. In 2005, the NYCLU, along with the ACLU and the Council on American-Islamic <b>Relations,</b> <b>filed</b> suit against the Department of Homeland Security on behalf of five Muslim Americans who were detained. The organizations argued that the policy violated both the First and Fourth Amendments. In 2005 the District Court ruled that the law did not violate the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Upon appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court’s decision, and held that the policy was tailored to a government concern that terrorists might attend such conferences.|$|R
