5|$|A. m. krausei:The 'eastern' {{subspecies}} (A. m. krausei) <b>range</b> <b>is</b> {{distributed throughout}} the interior mountains, with the western extent of its range encroaching into the low-land areas of the central interior plateau of Washington and British Columbia and the eastern extent of its range pushing through Rocky Mountain valleys into the lowland foothills and prairies of Montana and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its <b>range</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5000|$|Electric <b>ranges</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} in 20, 24 and 30" [...] widths. Gas <b>ranges</b> <b>are</b> {{available in}} 20, 24, 30 and 36" [...] widths.|$|R
50|$|The LX <b>range</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} in production from 2004 by the MAN TG-based HX range. The LX <b>range</b> <b>was</b> occasionally presented as LX 2000.|$|R
50|$|The rocky cores of the {{mountain}} <b>ranges</b> <b>are,</b> in most places, formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old. In the south, an older mountain <b>range</b> <b>was</b> formed 300 million years ago, then eroded away. The rocks of that older <b>range</b> <b>were</b> reformed into the Rocky Mountains.|$|R
5|$|At the {{southern}} part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' <b>range</b> <b>is</b> extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's <b>range</b> <b>is</b> difficult, {{since many}} {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E
5|$|Exposed in {{the middle}} of the {{mountain}} <b>range</b> <b>is</b> an assemblage of deformed andesite to dacite lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments. These basement rocks were created during the late Mesozoic era, long before the Itcha Range formed. They are similar to rocks found in the Hazelton Group, situated north of the Itcha Range, and the Ootsa Lake Group of the Intermontane Belt.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, {{numerical}} <b>ranges</b> <b>are</b> {{used as a}} {{rough estimate}} of eigenvalues of A. Recently, generalizations of numerical <b>range</b> <b>are</b> used to study quantum computing.|$|R

5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' <b>range</b> <b>is</b> still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 and 1970, 59 sea otters were {{translocated}} from Amchitka Island to Washington. Annual surveys between 2000 and 2004 {{have recorded}} between 504 and 743 individuals, and their <b>range</b> <b>is</b> in the Olympic Peninsula from {{just south of}} Destruction Island to Pillar Point.|$|E
5|$|In {{practice}} <b>range</b> <b>is</b> {{affected by}} driving style, hilliness of the terrain, speed {{and use of}} passenger compartment heating and cooling. Strong head and following winds also make a noticeable difference.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 another <b>range</b> <b>was</b> introduced. More {{characters}} were modelled than previously, and some had moving side rods. Additional models from the <b>range</b> <b>were</b> released in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The south <b>range</b> <b>was</b> a Victorian {{addition}} {{consisting of}} a large hall below which {{were a number of}} storage rooms. The south <b>range</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Construction of four skeet <b>ranges</b> <b>was</b> {{authorized}} at the Dateland AAF however, in {{a letter}} dated November 27, 1942, two of the skeet <b>ranges</b> <b>were</b> removed from the construction plans. In addition, a request to construct a target butt range at the site was approved on December 17, 1942. The target butt <b>range</b> <b>was</b> originally planned for construction at the Advanced Single Engine School in Yuma AAF Arizona; however, {{the decision was made}} to conduct all gunnery training and related functions at Dateland. According to the INPR Supplement, the target butt and double skeet ranges first appear on a January 1943 map of the site. Construction of the target butt <b>range</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for completion in April 1943 and the double skeet <b>range</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to be completed in June 1943. A Field Progress Report for Dateland, period ending June 30, 1943, indicates that both the target butt range and double skeet <b>range</b> <b>were</b> complete.|$|R
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal <b>range</b> <b>is</b> below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal <b>range</b> <b>is</b> below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{conditions}} that affect its distribution, as its biogeography is as yet unstudied. An assessment of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its <b>range</b> <b>is</b> likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat <b>Range</b> <b>is</b> a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are {{extremely}} difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles. This part of the trail is frequently bypassed by following the ski area's Polecat Trail to the summit of DPeak.|$|E

In winter, the range extends from southern Canada and northern California, south to Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Sathyamangalam forest <b>range</b> <b>is</b> a {{significant}} wildlife corridor in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve between the Western Ghats {{and the rest}} of the Eastern Ghats and a genetic link between the four other protected areas which it adjoins, including the Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, Sigur Plateau, Mudumalai National Park and Bandipur National Park. The sanctuary covers parts of Sathyamangalam taluk and Gobichettipalayam taluk of Erode District in north western Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{can begin}} to {{manifest}} at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120minutes thereafter. However, the more common <b>range</b> <b>is</b> between 30seconds to 1hour {{after the completion of}} a meal. Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic.|$|E
50|$|The rocks {{making up}} the {{mountains}} were formed before the mountains were raised. The cores of the mountain <b>ranges</b> <b>are</b> in most places formed of pieces of continental crust that are over one billion years old.
