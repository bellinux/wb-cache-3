25|$|Aneutronic fusion is {{any form}} of fusion power in which {{neutrons}} carry no more than 1% of the total <b>released</b> <b>energy.</b> The most-studied fusion reactions release up to 80% of their energy in neutrons. Successful aneutronic fusion would greatly reduce problems associated with neutron radiation such as ionizing damage, neutron activation and requirements for biological shielding, remote handling and safety.|$|E
25|$|When the {{hydrogen}} {{source in the}} core starts to diminish, gravity starts compressing the core, causing a rise in temperature to about 100 million K. Such higher core temperatures then make the star's cooler outer layers expand to create much larger red giant stars. This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> is distributed over a much larger surface area, even though the average surface temperature is lower. In stellar evolution terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB).|$|E
25|$|Energy from {{a nuclear}} {{explosive}} is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When {{there is a}} surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats it to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter {{is at the same}} temperature as the atomic bomb's matter). This causes vaporization of surrounding material resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shockwave. When a nuclear detonation occurs in air near sea level, much of the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> interacts with the atmosphere and creates a shockwave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball and if the burst is low enough, it is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a burst at high altitude, where the air density is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and x-rays than an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.|$|E

This project was worked {{in conjunction with a}} Master’s of Science student. An entire year of Cal Poly’s energy usage was examined and multiple trends were observed about when the maximum amount of energy was used. These trends looked at the time of day, the day of the week, and season to see what would {{be the best way to}} <b>release</b> <b>energy</b> into the grid to save money. There were two different batteries sizes examined and three different ways to <b>release</b> <b>energy</b> into the grid were also studied: <b>releasing</b> <b>energy</b> over a two hour window, a four hour window, and a six hour window. Ultimately, the system that <b>released</b> the <b>energy</b> over a six hour window saved the most money overall, because it was effectively able to reduce the demand charges the highest out of all the systems tested...|$|R
25|$|When {{hydrocarbon}} molecules (oil) {{are forced}} into water layer, hydrogen bond of water molecules and some dispersion forces between hydrocarbon molecules {{must have been}} destroyed, and new water-hydrocarbon interaction must have been formed in this state. Considering enthalpy change of the process, the input energy to reach this state and the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> break even rendering enthalpy change of zero (ΔHsolution =0) for the process. Enthalpy change equals zero also means that the thermal entropy change ΔSthermal is also about zero for the process. However, positional entropy change for the process (ΔSpositional) is negative. This is because when oil droplets are in water medium, those water molecules that are {{in contact with the}} hydrocarbon molecules lose their freedom of movement. If oil droplets are not in water phase, more water molecules would be more freely to move instead of having restriction on their arrangements. Thus, it is a thermodynamically favorable process for the pure, unprotected oil droplets to move out of water medium as the process is driven forward by entropy.|$|E
25|$|In aerobic {{cells with}} {{sufficient}} oxygen, {{as in most}} human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide, generating another reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> {{in the form of}} a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional 28 molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.|$|E

50|$|Small nuclei {{that are}} larger than {{hydrogen}} can combine into bigger ones and <b>release</b> <b>energy,</b> but in combining such nuclei, the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>released</b> is much smaller compared to hydrogen fusion.

2500|$|This {{reaction}} is very [...] exothermic, and the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> raises {{the temperature of}} the mixture to near 100°C, vaporizing about a fifth of it. The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle's internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid is expelled violently through an outlet valve, with a loud popping sound. The beetles' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator. The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-Benzoquinone, which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{difficulties}} in making a working plutonium bomb, {{it was decided that}} there should be a test of the weapon. On July 16, 1945, in the desert north of Alamogordo, New Mexico, the first nuclear test took place, code-named [...] "Trinity", using a device nicknamed [...] "the gadget." [...] The test, a plutonium implosion type device, <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> equivalent to 19 kilotons of TNT, far more powerful than any weapon ever used before. The news of the test's success was rushed to Truman at the Potsdam Conference, where Churchill was briefed and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin was informed of the new weapon.

2500|$|One {{class of}} nuclear weapon, a fission bomb (not to be {{confused}} with the fusion bomb), otherwise known as an atomic bomb or atom bomb, is a fission reactor designed to liberate as much energy as possible as rapidly as possible, before the <b>released</b> <b>energy</b> causes the reactor to explode (and the chain reaction to stop). Development of nuclear weapons was the motivation behind early research into nuclear fission which the Manhattan Project during World War II (September 1, 1939 – September 2, 1945) carried out most of the early scientific work on fission chain reactions, culminating in the three events involving fission bombs that occurred during the war. The first fission bomb, codenamed [...] "The Gadget", was detonated during the Trinity Test in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945. Two other fission bombs, codenamed [...] "Little Boy" [...] and [...] "Fat Man", were used in combat against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in on August 6 and 9, 1945 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Fusion rocket starships, {{powered by}} nuclear fusion reactions, should conceivably {{be able to}} reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy {{considerations}} alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light. These would [...] "burn" [...] such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, 3He, 11B, and 7Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3–0.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as <b>released</b> <b>energy,</b> it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases <0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4–10% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which {{may turn out to be}} intractable for decades or centuries.|$|E
