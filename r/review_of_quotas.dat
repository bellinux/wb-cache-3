40|$|In 2010, the IMF Board of Governors {{approved}} the Fourteenth General <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quotas,</b> which proposes significant redistribution of voting power, displacing {{it from the}} «over-represented» European states towards the «under-represented» emerging market countries. The results, once the changes are applied, will put the four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) among the ten largest contributors to the IMF. Using the analytical framework proposed by Barbé et al. (2014), this article considers the recent changes {{in the light of}} the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the transition to soft loans and the restructuring of sovereign debt. Given that the enormous loans to bailout Greece, Ireland and Portugal recommend continuing to use the IMF to promote the interests of the EU, it is argued that it is too early to speak of European decline at the heart of the Fund...|$|E
40|$|Based on the Executive Board’s {{guidance}} {{during the}} first stage of the Review of Low Income Countries (LIC) Facilities, this paper suggests a number of refinements to the facilities and instruments that are consistent with the self-sustainability of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The proposals seek to improve the tailoring and flexibility of Fund support. Taken together with those advanced in the parallel paper on PRGT eligibility, they are projected to keep the average annual demand for PRGT resources within a range consistent with the Board’s approved strategy to make the PRGT self-sustaining over the period 2013 – 35. The proposals are as follows. Enhancement of the existing blending policy. Members that are currently presumed to blend would use a somewhat higher share of General Resources Account (GRA) resources, thereby releasing concessional resources for poorer members. Some changes are also proposed to the existing market access criteria for blending. On average the changes are projected to shift demand of some SDR 100 million per year from the PRGT to the GRA over the period 2013 – 35. Access Policy: a decision would be adopted now to halve access norms and limits in relation to quota when the quota increase under the Fourteenth General <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quotas</b> comes into effect. The norms and limits were doubled in 2009 and appear broadly appropriate to meet LICs ’ needs. Staff’s proposal would imply unchanged access in SDR terms for most LICs after the new quotas come into effect. Within the self-sustained framework, even a modest nominal access increase now would compress significantly the size of access increases that the PRGT could accommodate in the future, meaning that access as a share of GDP would decline for future users. Modifications to enhance precautionary support and respond more quickly to additional financing needs: For Stand-by Credit Facility (SCF) arrangements treated as precautionary, easing time limitations on use, and allowing more frontloading of access, would make the instrument more helpful to members...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The primary {{objective}} of Workers ‟ Compensation Rehabilitation Centre {{is to provide}} clinical rehabilitation services to patients who have work related injuries. To do this, the centre requires complete rehabilitees ‟ {{data to be transmitted}} from the referrer to the centre as well as across internal departments for the centre. This is because documentation of medical records is a fundamental tool for communication between health professionals. It informs the care provided, treatment, care planned and the outcome of that care as a continuous and contemporaneous record. However, the researcher was not aware of any clinical audit of documented rehabilitees‟ data with respect to compliance with this requirement. This prompted a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> rehabilitees ‟ data for its completeness as a vital initial step towards optimisation of rehabilitees ‟ care pathways. The research method was a non-participatory document <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> sampled discharged rehabilitees ‟ files using a descriptive and analytical research design. Data were captured using a structured data collection instrument designed and tested by the experts in the medical fraternity. The instrument was designed from information prescribed in internationally referred documents and refined using information prescribed in the Procedures Manual for the centre. Generally, rehabilitees‟ information was incomplete thereby making the referral and <b>review</b> <b>of</b> patients difficult. Clinical template forms in use at the research site had inadequate form fields and this was an important factor which modelled the level of completeness of rehabilitees ‟ information. These inadequate form fields resulted in important facts about th...|$|R

40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe {{aim of the}} project was to produce quality, {{scientific}} based policy advice on the most efficient means for the transfer <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> between dairy farmers. The main objective {{of the project was}} to identify milk quota transfer mechanisms that would ensure the viability of the maximum number of farmers in Ireland while still supporting an internationally competitive agricultural sector. During the course of the project the Irish Department of Agriculture introduced a new milk quota transfer scheme. The milk quota exchange scheme was launched in November 2006. At this stage the objectives of the project were altered to be more policy relevant. Rather than exploring the efficiency <b>of</b> various milk <b>quota</b> transfer models, the aim of the project was redirected to explore the efficiency of the scheme as it was operated in Ireland. The rationale for this change was to provide relevant and timely feedback to policy makers on the operation of the new scheme. While the MTR agreement guaranteed the continuation of the EU milk quota regime until 2014 / 15, it also made provisions for a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> the milk <b>quota</b> system to be conducted in 2008. Clearly any changes to EU milk quota policy would have implications for farmers in Ireland. A second objective of this project was to explore some policy scenarios that may transpire from the milk quota review and to estimate the implications for farmers in Ireland...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified.

40|$|To date, {{more than}} 100 {{countries}} have implemented some type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> {{for women in}} their national legislatures, leading {{to one of the}} most significant developments in the global composition of legislative bodies in the past twenty-five years.

To do this, I employ a social network approach to quantitatively model global and temporal trends in gender quota adoption. Controlling for other possible domestic and transnational determinants, my results indicate that the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> policy adoption and design is the existence of similar policies in neighboring countries.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Diagnostic Radiography in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012 Complete, accurate and justified radiological examination requests are prerequisite to radiological exposures. However, global research shows evidence of high numbers of incomplete and inaccurate requests {{as well as that}} up to 77 % radiological exposures are unjustified. Plain lumbar spine and plain skull radiology examinations are reported as being procedures that generate high dose and a low diagnostic yield. This study was designed to objectively measure the completeness, accuracy and justification of these two examinations {{in an effort to make}} inferences that will contribute to an improved radiology service. This research could therefore have positive effects on optimisation of radiation protection in Zimbabwe. Methodology A non participatory prospective descriptive analytical document <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> sampled radiological request forms for 200 plain skull and 200 plain lumbar spine examinations was employed. Data was captured using structured data collection instruments designed and tested by the researcher for this study. The instrument was designed using the IAEA-HHS 4 (2010) minimum prescribed request data as a framework and adding additional form fields found to be relevant through a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> all identified radiological request template forms in use at the research site. Data analysis involved central tendency measures and inferential statistics. Results: The central tendency demonstrated for the two examinations was that generally referrers for plain lumbar spine and for plain skull radiology would respectively provide 38. 9 +/- 0. 6 % and 40. 2 +/- 0. 5 % overall examination request information. This information was significantly below expectation. There was however no significant difference between the samples’ means for the two examinations. The tendency demonstrated in patient information for lumbar spine and skull requests was that generally referrers would respectively provide 48. 4 +/- 0. 8 % and 49. 5 +/- 0. 8 % patient information. These values were inclusive of each other and they were significantly (p= 0. 00 Sig.) below expectation. There was however no significant difference between the two examinations’ data. The tendency demonstrated for examination information was that referrers for the research site would generally provide 29. 8 +/- 0. 8 % (lumbar) and 32. 6 +/- 0. 8 % (Skull) examination information. These values were significantly (p= 0. 000 Sig.) below expectation and demonstrated a significant difference between the sample means for the two examinations. With respect to referrer information, the tendency demonstrated was that generally referrers for plain lumbar spine and for plain skull examinations would respectively provide 38 +/- 1 % and 38. 5 +/- 0. 8 % referrer identification information. These were significantly below expectation (p= 0. 000 Sig.) but there was no significant difference between the samples’ means with respect to referrer information. With respect to accuracy of request data, it was observed that 5 % plain lumbar spine and 3 % plain skull requests were specific in so far as information documented on request forms could unambiguously identify the area to be imaged. It was also observed that 22. 5 % (lumbar spine) and 12 % (skull) examination requests were indicated and therefore justified. All requests forms were found to be legible. Conclusions: Generally, referrers to this research site tend to provide incomplete, inaccurate and unjustified radiological request data. The observed levels of completeness, accuracy and justification of requests were generally consistent between the two examinations relative to expectation. These levels had medico-legal implications and negative effects on optimisation of radiation protection to patients. Further research to establish causes of this variance in referral behaviour is recommended. The researcher also recommends further research to establish whether there is an association between requested examination and completeness, accuracy and justification of diagnostic radiology examination requests.
