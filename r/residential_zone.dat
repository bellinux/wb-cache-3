5|$|The <b>Residential</b> <b>Zone</b> {{specifically}} accommodated {{athletes and}} team officials, with 1,168 apartments in 34 residential towers. Each apartment had {{two to five}} bedrooms, giving 4,008 bedrooms in total; each bedroom accommodated two residents which differed from the traditional practice of providing athletes with a bedroom each. The entire zone itself was divided into four zones, styled after four unique folk art styles found in India as identified by a colour and an image: warli (red), gond (blue), madhubani (green) and sanjhi (purple). Nine Resident Centres, each serving hundreds of residents, were spaced across the residential towers, and they provided key services and facilities as well as entertainment. The <b>Residential</b> <b>Zone</b> also housed offices and services centres for the Commonwealth Games Associations, a polyclinic, religious services and casual dining facilities.|$|E
5|$|I-470 {{begins in}} {{southern}} Kansas City at the Grandview Triangle interchange with I-49, I-435, US50, and US71. The freeway, concurrent with US50, travels east through grasslands before meeting the westernmost interchange, a diamond interchange with Blue Ridge Boulevard. A rail line belonging to Kansas City Southern Railway passes under the freeway {{west of the}} interchange. The concurrent highways continue east through lightly populated Jackson County past a light <b>residential</b> <b>zone,</b> towards an interchange with Raytown Road. Raytown Road provides access to Longview Lake {{to the south of}} I-470. Crossing into urbanized Lee's Summit, the Kansas City Metropolitan Junior College is accessible from the View High Drive interchange. The city line between Kansas City and Lee's Summit is near View High Drive. Exit7 consists of a cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of Route 350 and US50, as well as Northwest Blue Parkway and Northwest Pryor Road. Two rail lines surround the cloverleaf interchange, both operated by the Union Pacific Railroad, however only the eastern line is operational. US50 leaves the freeway and travels southeast as I-470 curves to the north near the Lee's Summit Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|The old Jewish Quarter (Mellah) is {{situated}} in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at {{the site where the}} sultan's stables were previously located. At the time, the Jewish community consisted of {{a large portion of the}} city's bankers, jewelers, metalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly <b>residential</b> <b>zone</b> renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Alzama Synagogue, built around a central courtyard, is located in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is located within the Medina on land adjacent to the Mellah.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{in order to examine}} the pattern of housing-health status among <b>residential</b> <b>zones</b> in Uyo metropolis, Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey in Uyo Metropolis was based on 400 randomly sampled households stratified into 40 <b>residential</b> <b>zones.</b> The study used structured questionnaire administered during a face-to-face interview with heads of household. Housing-health status was measured using indices of physical support, accident/safety, crime/security, indoor temperature/ventilation, household hygiene/sanitation, lighting, crowding, building material type, refuse disposal and environmental quality. Data analysis was done using Chi – square test to examine the “goodness of fit” between observed distribution of housing-health indicators and the WHO theoretical standards. One way ANOVA was also used to examine variation in housing – health status among <b>residential</b> <b>zones.</b> Results showed significant difference between observed distribution of housing – health indicators and theoretical expectation. Housing – health indicators fell quite below WHO standards. Housing - health status was also found to vary significantly among <b>residential</b> <b>zones.</b> These findings provide the needed platform for improving housing -health status by enforcing stringent housing regulatory frameworks and accelerating the distribution of critical housing infrastructure in cities of developing economies...|$|R
