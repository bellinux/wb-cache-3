50|$|On 29 June 1809, Onís was {{appointed}} minister plenipotentiary (with full powers to take independent action) to the United States, his {{letter of appointment}} instructing him to embark {{as soon as possible}} for New York. His assignment was to ensure peace between the two nations and win formal recognition of Fernando VII as the legitimate ruler of Spain. He was to negotiate all points in dispute within certain defined limits; to encourage the loyalty of Spain's colonies in the New World; to buy supplies, armaments, and ships for Spain to use in its war against the French; and to counter Bonapartist propaganda in the US. He was to pursue these objectives despite the refusal of President James Madison to recognize him while the Peninsular war still raged in Europe. Arriving at the port of New York on 4 October 1809 aboard the Spanish frigate Cornelia, after a rough passage of 44 days, Onís <b>requested</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> present his credentials to President Madison but was promptly informed that the US government could not receive or recognize any minister from the provisional governments of Spain as long as the crown was in dispute and that until that question was resolved, the United States would remain neutral.|$|R

Desperately he wrote to the Pope <b>requesting</b> <b>a</b> special <b>audience,</b> <b>to</b> which the Vatican responded that it was neither timely nor necessary. For Msgr da Costa Lopes {{this was one of}} his hardest blows. He went on, in a letter to Australia, to accuse the Indonesian military of mass murder, and anticipated widepead famine unless large food supplies were urgently imported. His predictions were proved correct.|$|R

The emperor is so offended by Hai's criticism that he dismisses Hai from office. Hai is restored to office after the emperor dies.|$|R

Herrington Heritage suggests Peat was supportive of a match with Jane in order to use her relationship (albeit distant) to the prince's unofficial wife, to further advance himself in royal favour.

Seneca subsequently adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates, concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome.|$|R

He urged the pope to appoint Humbert II of Dauphiné, whose friend and spiritual adviser he had been, {{leader of the}} crusade, but Humbert proved incapable and the crusade came to nothing.
