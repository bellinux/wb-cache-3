40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>cost,</b> its relevance in decision making analysis, its decision advantage in both short and long-term planning decisions and how it influences the decision maker’s choice of preference/priorities. The study is based on primary information (data) tailored to allow individual respondents comprehend the concept of “relevant cost”. Forty (40) closely related questionnaires were prepared and administered in some business retail traders in “ALABA INTERNATIONAL MARKET”. A review of related literature was also applied to have a general over-view {{of the concept of}} <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> ideology. It was revealed that <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> or costs are costs appropriate to a specific management decision. They are estimated future costs, that are different under alternative courses of action for a specific problem. It consist of both fixed and variable costs. Relevance in decision making is independent of cost behavior pattern. It influences the decision maker’s choice of preference and priority. If a decision is to be taken to either add a product or drop a product, salary of a supervisor or managing director is irrelevant. It is a differential (or incremental) cash flow that forms a component of <b>relevant</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Relevant</b> <b>cost</b> {{analysis}} {{is a well}} recognised technique in management accounting used to decide whether production is viable in the short run. The removal of production-related subsidies following the reform of the CAP has left many farm enterprises with net margins that show a substantial loss. <b>Relevant</b> <b>cost</b> {{analysis is}} used to determine whether nevertheless it remains worthwhile continuing to produce in the short run. Relevant margins were calculated from industry costings for combinable crop, beef and sheep enterprises for 2004 / 5.

However, when it is calculated for anything other than the entire operation of an airline, the <b>relevant</b> <b>costs</b> will inevitably involve cost allocations that require judgments. For instance, the salary of the airline's senior management needs to be spread across the different parts of the airline and can be divvied up across its routes according to many different methodologies—by the number of flights on that route during that time period, by the number of flight hours on that route, etc. There is not necessarily any right method for making such cost allocations, but it is important when making comparisons across airlines that if an allocation methodology is relevant (i.e. less than the entire of each airline is being compared) then the same allocation methodology is used with each airline being compared.|$|E

One type of <b>relevant</b> <b>cost</b> is incremental cost, which is additional cost when an alternative is not chosen in a process of decision making. A decision can be classified as long and short range decision. Example of short range decision is special order, which is order from a buyer asking price below normal price, and often management directly refuses this order without further consideration. Concept of incremental cost can be used to evaluate this kind of problem. Some considerations in implementing the concept include cost identification, idle capacity, and variable costing system. Incremental cost analysis involves comparison among additional order, additional cost and contribution margin from the special order. This concept supported by variable costing method is important for companies implementing job order costing system before deciding to accept or refuse a special order...|$|R
