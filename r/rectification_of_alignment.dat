Abstract In {{the last decade}} some local communities, by urban plans and codes of practice, {{sensitized}} planners and operators about the necessity to intervene on historical buildings considering the environmental typicalness, recognizable in use of materials, constructive techniques and lexical schemes: it is in an evident dialectic with the Italian academy, strongly reluctant to accept that historical architecture in our cities has to be safeguarded, preserved, repaired, restored, rather study-cases for capricious experimentations. The city of Palermo is an efficacious example, with its historical centre regulated by an Executive Particular Plan (PPE) that privileges the history {{and the maintenance of}} historical building, according to trends that allow also the historical urban tissue reconstruction damaged or cancelled by tragic events. The study recently commissioned by the civic administration follows this idea, and it regards an urban context of great interest and complexity because of its historical-architectural characters: the Cassaro monumental street (today called Corso Vittorio Emanuele). By the sides of this city foundation axis, the actual form of architectural fronts overlaps a complex stratification; the heterogeneity of architectural styles and constructive systems, using often plaster and stucco rather than stone, catches a glimpse of the inextricable formation and evolution of its actual architecture behind every degraded area. We could so punctually recognize medieval urban tissue like in adjacent parts, the <b>rectifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>alignment</b> and the sixteenth-century aggregations, the monumental replanning of some eighteenth-century façades; and also the earthquakes and war events damages, the nineteenth-century completions and interventions with hygiene and decorum intents, especially after the Unity of Italy, when Palermo had to appear like the other cities of the new State. All this conditions had to coexist in a difficult city, where decorum of monumental architectures has been often subdued to comfort and to commerce demands, to the fragmentariness provoked by nobility decadence, to the aggressive and disfigured installations. The study of architectural fronts analyzes about sixty civil buildings along the Vittorio Emanuele main street, and it’s initially founded on a cognitive process that includes historical analysis, geometric and dimensional survey, analysis of material and decay systems. We particularly analyzed both the relationships among decay systems and historical stratifications, both the grammar of architectural façades language. In a second phase, this study includes a project proposal that, according to the individuality of cases, it would assume the sense of an intervention code about some recurrent critical aspects on which it’s possible to intervene only applying codified procedures. The proposed designs represent so an application to concrete cases, not abdicating to involve physical and economic urban environment: as example we cite the complexity of those solutions that would respect the historical image of building without depressing the commercial demands of ground floor shops...|$|R

Without the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> names, different words would have different actions. This essentially means for every action, there is a word that describes that action. The belief is that by following the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names, one would be following the correct/right path. The <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> names also calls for a standard language in which ancient rulers could impose laws that everyone could understand to avoid confusion.|$|R

These are both quasi-regular, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry.|$|R

For example, {{in the study of}} Chinese culture a child only speaks when a parent permits them to speak. Following orders from a person of authority means that you are showing respect, therefore that you are following the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names without explicitly acknowledging it. Confucius' belief in the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names is still practiced in today's society, for example when a teacher asks a student to address a visitor, that student will follow the instructions.|$|R
