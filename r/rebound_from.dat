5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E

The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days, with both Anderson Cooper and Diane Sawyer doing special reports. Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune published articles about the resilient history and nature of Harrisburg to <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> the tornado and floods that have hit the city since its founding in 1889.|$|E
5|$|On {{return to}} his parent club, Mousinho played a lot more {{frequently}} during the 2006–07 season, a total of 39 times, and was subsequently rewarded with an extended contract which was due to run until June 2009. The following campaign, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win against Barnet – tapping in the <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> Kevin O'Connor's missed penalty, and also scored Brentford's first against Dagenham & Redbridge shortly after. However, he only played a total of 24 times in all competitions, 15 times less than during the club's previous campaign. At {{the end of the}} 2007–08 season, Mousinho was transfer–listed by manager Andy Scott because he did not feature in the club's future plans and, as a result, his first–team chances would be limited.|$|E

5|$|Walker was {{dismissed}} as manager, alongside head coach Eric Winstanley, with youth-team coach Neil Redfearn taking over as caretaker manager. He {{took charge of}} the team for the home match against Crawley, which finished a 2–2 draw after Lewis Killeen scored the <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> a Thomas Pinault penalty in the 90th minute. Former Port Vale manager Martin Foyle was appointed as manager, with Redfearn taking the role of assistant manager. Foyle made his first signing by bringing in winger Adam Smith on loan from Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity. Foyle's first match in charge was a 1–1 away draw against Salisbury City, which was earned following a Brodie goal in the 83rd minute.|$|E
5|$|Coach Mike Ellis {{departed}} {{the club}} following the 2007–08 season, {{to be replaced}} by Corey Neilson. After a third-place finish in the 2008–09 season, the Panthers mounted a title challenge during 2009–10, remaining in contention for the championship until the final stages of the season. They eventually finished third for a third successive season. The Panthers also won the Challenge Cup {{for the second time in}} three seasons, defeating the Cardiff Devils 8–7 on aggregate in the final. The 2010–11 season started strongly, but the Panthers suffered a poor mid season run which scuppered their chances of winning the regular season title and led to players being fined a proportion of their wages. The team were able to <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> this, first securing a 4–3 aggregate victory over the Belfast Giants to successfully defend the Challenge Cup, then securing their third playoff championship with a 5–4 win over the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers repeated the double in the 2011–12 season first winning a third straight Challenge Cup with a 10–4 aggregate victory over Belfast. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated Braehead and Hull in the playoffs before winning 2–0 against Cardiff in the final. The game was a tight affair, with David-Alexandre Beauregard breaking the deadlock after 53 goalless minutes.|$|E
5|$|Looking to <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> their disappointing 2010 result, the Opals {{qualified}} for the 2012 Olympic Games in London by beating New Zealand three games to nil in the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship. They finished the Olympic preliminary series with a 4 – 1 record, losing to France in game 2, but after Belinda Snell sank a well beyond the half-court line 3 point shot with less than 1 second on the clock to send the game into overtime. Against Russia, Liz Cambage {{became the first woman}} in Olympic history to successfully slam dunk a basketball. In the quarterfinal against China, Lauren Jackson became the Olympic Games record holder for points scored, overtaking Brazilian legend Janeth Arcain's tally of 535 points. The Opals accounted for China 75–60 to set up a semifinal game with their long-time s USA. Despite holding a half-time lead, the Opals again fell short losing 86–73. The Opals would however, win their 5th consecutive Olympic medal with an 83–74 win over Russia to claim the bronze.|$|E

5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to <b>rebound</b> <b>from</b> the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
