5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the association between residential indoor remodeling and poor semen quality. Sperm donors aged 18 - 45 years old were recruited in Shanghai, China.

25|$|PMI {{estimation}} is used {{to figure}} out how much time has elapsed since a person died by using insects to help estimate this interval. It depends on the species of insect, as some are attracted to fresh corpses while others are only attracted to the putrid and advanced stages of decomposition. This means the insects go through waves of succession. Using this information as well as the lifecycle of the insect in question can help to estimate the PMI. The judgment depends on what stage of development the insect is in, as well as the weather in <b>recent</b> <b>months</b> among other factors. Specifically with C. cadaverina, they tend to be attracted to fairly advanced stages of decomposition, while rarely being found on fresh carrion. They also tend to be in the second wave of succession, usually showing up after Lucilia spp. and Calliphora spp.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 2010, the United Nations {{confirmed}} that rebels from the FDLR {{and from the}} Mai Mai militia raped and assaulted at least 154 civilians from July 30 to August 3, {{in the town of}} Luvungi in North Kivu province. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who had made protecting civilians and combating sexual violence central themes of his presidency, was reported to be outraged by the attack. Atul Khare, deputy head of the U.N.'s peacekeeping department, was dispatched to the region, and Margot Wallström, the organisation's special representative for sexual violence in conflict, was instructed to take charge of the U.N. response and follow up. The United Nations had withdrawn 1,700 peace keepers in <b>recent</b> <b>months,</b> responding to the Congolese government's demand to end the UN peacekeeping mission (recently renamed MONUSCO). Earlier Wallstrom was quoted as saying that this withdrawal would make the struggle against sexual violence in the region significantly more difficult.|$|E

40|$|Much investigative {{effort is}} being {{expended}} worldwide toward improving seasonally adjusted estimates from the Census X- 11 program.

Although there are theoretical arguments supporting the applicaton of X- 11 concur-rently, a comprehensive study documenting the results of concurrent adjustment with X- 11 on U. S. economic series has not previously been undertaken. This study evaluates the effect of applying X- 11 concurrently to a set of selected Census Bureau economic time series.

25|$|On 13 September {{following}} Arclight {{and naval}} and land artillery strikes 3 Battalion task {{forces from the}} 5th Infantry Division attacked into the DMZ northeast of Con Thien. To the east the 1st Squadron, 7th ARVN Armored Cavalry, supported by two platoons from Company A, 3rd Tank Battalion, simultaneously attacked {{to the north and}} northeast of A-2 and Gio Linh. The ARVN achieved almost immediate contact. The Marine tanks providing a base of fire for the advancing ARVN infantry fired 90mm canister and high-explosive rounds and their machine guns to break through the NVA defenses killing 73 NVA. Following {{in the wake of the}} tanks, and supported by helicopter gunships, the ARVN infantry killed an additional 68 NVA and captured one. On the left flank, after encountering mines and antitank fire, the three Army task forces joined the action, accounting for another 35 NVA and seizing a large cache of mortar rounds. The allied forces reached their northernmost objectives, turned south, and returned to their bases by late afternoon. The captured NVA soldier identified his unit as an element of the 138th NVA Regiment which had assumed control of the 27th Independent Regiment's area of operations, due to the heavy casualties suffered by the regiment in <b>recent</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mixon had an {{extensive}} criminal history. Beginning at age 13, {{he was arrested}} multiple times for battery, and by age 20 was serving a Corcoran state prison sentence following a felony conviction for {{assault with a deadly}} weapon and armed robbery in San Francisco. After he was paroled, Mixon went in and out of prison. When the shootings happened, he was living in East Oakland at his grandmother's house and was wanted on a no-bail arrest warrant for violating his current parole conditions. On March 20, 2009, the day before the shootings, the Oakland Police Department learned that Mixon was linked by DNA to the February 5, 2009, rape of a twelve-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint in the East Oakland neighborhood where Mixon's sister lived. On May 4, 2009, a state laboratory confirmed not just this link, but also confirmed that Mixon robbed and raped two young women about seven hours before the shootings (see above). Investigators said that Mixon may have committed several other rapes during <b>recent</b> <b>months,</b> although no convictions or indictments had been secured before his death. Had Mixon been arrested for his parole violation, he would have faced at most six months in prison; if convicted of rape, he faced a life sentence.|$|E

In the most <b>recent</b> <b>month</b> of SHOUTcast data (September 2008), KANM was one of the top college radio streams and among the top Internet streams in general, with nearly 500,000 stream connections. The station's web site claims that, at over 35 years old, it is likely the oldest surviving cable FM station in the country to have never transitioned to licensed over-the-air operation. Since the late 1990s, KANM has adopted other forms of broadcasting to augment the originally cable FM-only service, adding a Part 15 unlicensed AM broadcast and becoming an early adopter of Internet streaming audio in 1998. More recently, a campus cable television channel and downloads have also been added.|$|R
30|$|In {{a recent}} paper, {{we showed that}} low values of HbA 1 c may be {{dangerous}} under recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia (Trevino 2006). In the present technical note, we propose a simulation of a “weighted” version of Eq.  3 proposed by Ladyzynski et al. (2014), using a corrected average glucose (wAG) over 3 months instead of the uniform eAG. Based {{on the relationship between}} PG and HbA 1 c given by Tahara and cited earlier, we assume that, over 3 months, the earliest, middle and <b>recent</b> <b>month</b> contribution of glucose to wHbA 1 c is 20, 30 and 50  % respectively. The limitation to a period of 3 months instead of four is rather a pragmatic choice linked to the blood glucose measurement by diabetic patients. In fact, the simulation with 4 months with weights: 10, 15, 25 and 50  % yields nearly the same results as with 3 months.|$|R
