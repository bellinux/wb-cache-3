40|$|As Parker and Guthrie (1991) state, the {{question}} of the Australian Auditor- General’s performance audit mandate has become an issue of much debate over the last two decades. The initial development of performance auditing by the Australian Audit Office (AAO) {{can be traced back to}} the early 1970 s. In part this was due to the application of existing powers provided by Section 54 of the Audit Act 1901. These investigations were termed by the AAO ‘project audits’. Amendments to the Act, in 1979, additionally permitted the AAO to undertake efficiency audits in addition to fiscal <b>regularity</b> <b>audits.</b> The problem, since the introduction of these amendments, has been that, all too often, debate on the mandate of the Auditor-General has suffered because authors have often not clearly defined what they mean by terms such as ‘effciency’, ‘effectiveness’ and ‘performance’...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} role {{of governments}} {{in planning and}} controlling socio-economic development, results in huge government expenditures on programmes and activities. This increases {{the importance of the}} government budgeting and accounting system as a tool for planning, managing and controlling this huge increase in government activities. The external auditing and controlling authority (State Audit Institution) can strengthen the monitoring and controlling mechanism by performing not only a <b>regularity</b> and compliance <b>audit,</b> but by extending its role to include the examination, evaluation and audit of the economy, efficiency, effectiveness results of government programmes and activities. This study analyses the performance of the State Audit Institution in the U. A. E. in this regard, and identifies deficiencies. Suggestions for improvement, in terms of a more comprehensive, integrated performance approach, are made. As prerequisites to such expansion of the government auditing system, it will be necessary also to reform the government budgeting system. Adoption of the programme performance approach is recommended. Moreover, the need is identified for improvements to the accounting information system, to generate data and information which can respond efficiently and effectively to users' needs for information about programme operations. Internal and external obstacles which impede the effectiveness of the State Audit Institution must be addressed, to facilitate the introduction of an integrated approach to auditing the administrative sector in the United Arab Emirates, thereby safeguarding public resources and enhancing the effectiveness of socio-economic development efforts...|$|R
40|$|Overall {{progress}} {{recorded in}} contemporary society, has increased {{at the same}} time the aspirations and expectations of the population, marked by phenomena which are based on the financial policy of the Executive. Of course, for the legislature to know the financial activity carried out by the Executive Board, in each State was established a Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution, as it is in Germany, or by law, as is the case of the United Kingdom. The variety of powers of supreme audit, is the result of various economic areas, each demonstrations through specific activities and suitable approaches to organizational cultures, which gives them their distinct identities. The work is conducted under the public responsibility with an emphasis on developing and improving continuously audit methodologies to present best practices. The two supreme institutions operate according to an annual plan of action which includes financial <b>audit</b> or <b>regularity</b> and performance <b>auditing</b> actions, and additional Federal Court of Audit of Germany practice preventive control institutions contained in its area of activity. By tradition, the role of supreme consists of the evaluation as regards the legality and regularity of financial management and accounting, but since the 80 's but it was noticeable trend internationally to audit performance or "value for money" (United Kingdom), since the latter refers to the essence of the problem and is the final attainment of the envisaged at the time of allocation of resources. The topic researched is distinguished by originality, marked being the fact that a area so important as that of external public audit is least known works, and I wish to point out the vacuum bibliographic Supreme Audit Institutions experience in the international arena and beyond. Research methodology consists in the evaluation of resources in the area, using foreign literature. For the study of the subject of this material have been followed the official sites of the Federal Court of Audit of Germany and of the National Audit Office of United Kindom, including consulting on hypothetical case studies submitted by the specialists of the two institutions on the occasion of seminars held at the Romanian Court of Auditors. This work focuses on developing institutional development,role, experience and traditions performed in the field of external public audit, as well as their relationship with the Parliament, including the measures taken as a result of recovery audit reports. Thus, the supreme institutions analysed may constitute "models" for Romania's economic reality. In our opinion, any "model" should be adapted to the situation on the field and in this case the model becomes the solution. An assessment of the current business of the supreme audit institutions, we ask where is heading and how they will look in the future. Perhaps the future will provide this response...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of the most important developments that the accounting profession has experienced ever since Albania switched from a closed economy to an open market one. We put forth a discussion about the factors that recently seem to represent major challenges for the accountants. We identify as two of the most important and emergent challenges the technology innovations and the globalization trend in accounting and financial reporting. Since computers began to be widely used in industry the impact of technology has been strong on the way that the accounting transactions are processed and on the financial and fiscal reporting. The use of computerized accounting software is constantly rising and more and more complex packages customized for the specific need of the domestic companies are being developed in Albania. This has presented an ever increasing need for more trainings and specializations of accountants in information and communication technology. Another important development is the globalization of accounting and financial reporting. The implementation of the new National Accounting Standards in Albania in 2008 fully complying with the IAS/IFRS, presents a major change in the accounting environment in Albania. We conclude the paper with some recommendations about several actions that might be taken to smooth the effects of these latest changes and challenges that the accountants are facing. internal audit, efficiency, effectiveness, risk audit, system audit, performance audit, <b>regularity</b> <b>audit...</b>|$|E

40|$|Reporting on {{performance}} was legislatively established in South Africa {{in terms of}} the Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999, section 40 (3) (a). The auditing of the reported information was legislated in the Public Audit Act, Act 25 of 2004, section 20 (2) (c). The objectives of the article are firstly to provide an overview of the development and application of the reporting and secondly providing assurance on service delivery information and thirdly to reflect on challenges to the implementation thereof in South Africa. The aim through deploying these set objectives is to formulate possible future considerations for improved governance. As central part of the methodology, review of literature on reporting and audit of non-financialwas conducted. The research included scrutiny of the different philosophies and approaches adopted by different countries to the reporting and providing assurance on service delivery information. In this respect, the research reflects a comparative element. In South Africa the Auditor-General adopted a phasing-in approach. The development of the audit approach and audit procedures has reached a stable stage, nine years after the initial process started. The audit of performance information now forms {{an integral part of the}} <b>regularity</b> <b>audit</b> process. The analysis of audit findings of the period under study indicates a considerable improvement once initiated, but stagnation persists in subsequent years. Numerous challenges remain around the application of performance reporting in South Africa including non-compliance, the lack of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, inconsistencies between the various strategic documents and the need to improve the usefulness of performance information. In conclusion the article proposes some steps to address the challenges...|$|E
