5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration.

A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the rear wheel.|$|E
