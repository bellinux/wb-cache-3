50|$|The trailer chassis was a {{lattice frame}} of tubular members. It {{comprised}} a transverse trunnion box {{member at the}} front, from which six longitudinal tube members ran aftward and converged into one large main <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> at the rear; the six longitudinal members were braced vertically and horizontally by smaller-gauge <b>tubes.</b> The rear <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> member supported a large horizontal-plane turntable. A steerable front truck was installed just behind the trunnion box member, while the turntable surmounted a two-axle rear bogey.|$|R
50|$|The {{sunlight}} {{bounces off}} the mirrors and {{is directed to}} a <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> filled with synthetic oil, which heats to over 400 C. The reflected light focused at the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> is 71 to 80 times more intense than the ordinary sunlight. The synthetic oil transfers its heat to water, which boils and drives the Rankine cycle steam turbine, thereby generating electricity. Synthetic oil is used to carry the heat (instead of water) to keep the pressure within manageable parameters.|$|R
50|$|The ICP can be {{retained}} in the quartz torch because the flow of gas between the two outermost tubes keeps the plasma away from {{the walls of the}} torch. A second flow of argon (around 1 liter per minute) is usually introduced between the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and the intermediate tube to keep the plasma away {{from the end of the}} <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> A third flow (again usually around 1 liter per minute) of gas is introduced into the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> of the torch. This gas flow passes through the centre of the plasma, where it forms a channel that is cooler than the surrounding plasma but still much hotter than a chemical flame. Samples to be analyzed are introduced into this central channel, usually as a mist of liquid formed by passing the liquid sample into a nebulizer.|$|R

40|$|The Fabriconda {{wave energy}} {{converter}} is a submerged tube lying perpendicular to incoming wave fronts. The tubeconsists {{of a series of}} smaller fabric tubes, called cells, joined together longitudinally to form a larger <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> The cells and <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> are flooded with water. Cross-sectional area changes with pressure due to the cells changing shape. The Fabriconda is therefore distensible, enabling it to extract energy from external waves. Waves induce a series of travelling bulges, and an internal oscillatory flow, in both the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and cells. If the speed of these bulges is close to the phase speed of the external wave, energy is progressively transferred to this flow. A power take-off system terminates the tube at the stern. A 1 D mathematical model has been developed to predict the power captured by the Fabriconda, based on the application of the conservation of momentum and mass to the flow in both the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and cells. An analytical solution of this model has been found using an assumption of harmonic behaviour. A time-stepping finite difference solution was also derived and found to agree with the analytical solution. The results from these models have been compared with measurements. The cross sectional shape of the Fabriconda depends on the ratio between cell and <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> pressure, while the free bulge speed is dependent on the sum of the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and cell distensibilities. Both ?ndings were supported by measurements. Measurements found that power generally peaked closer to the resonance frequency than predicted and was dependent on initial pressure. The effect of tube length on the frequency dependency of power capture and the presence of secondary peaks led to the conclusion that normal mode effects are significant to the Fabriconda's performance. This work has determined the operating principles of the Fabriconda and demonstrated that it can extract energy from waves. Predictions of full scale performance and commercial viability are not considered...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic flux in {{the solar}} {{photosphere}} forms concentrations from small scales, such as flux elements, to large scales, such as sunspots. This paper presents {{a study of the}} decay process of large magnetic flux tubes, such as sunspots, on a supergranular scale. 3 D nonlinear resistive magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations are performed in a cylindrical domain, initialised with axisymmetric solutions that consist of a well-defined <b>central</b> flux <b>tube</b> and an annular convection cell surrounding it. As the nonlinear convection evolves, the annular cell breaks up into many cells in the azimuthal direction, allowing magnetic flux to slip between cells away from the <b>central</b> flux <b>tube</b> (turbulent erosion). This lowers magnetic pressure in the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and convection grows inside the tube, possibly becoming strong enough to push the tube apart. A remnant of the <b>central</b> flux <b>tube</b> persists with nonsymmetric perturbations caused by the convection surrounding it. Secondary flux concentrations form between convection cells away from the <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> Tube decay is dependent on the convection around the tube. Convection cells forming inside the tube as time-dependent outflows will remove magnetic flux. (This is most pronounced for small tubes). Flux is added to the tube when flux caught in the surrounding convection is pushed toward it. The tube persists when convection inside the tube is sufficiently suppressed by the remaining magnetic field. All examples of persistent tubes have the same effective magnetic field strength, consistent with the observation that pores and sunspot umbrae all have roughly the same magnetic field strength...|$|R

50|$|Spiral wound modules are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used style of module and are ‘standardized’ design, available in a range of standard diameters (2.5”, 4” and 8”) to fit standard pressure vessel that can hold several modules in series connected by O-rings. The module uses flat sheets wrapped around a <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> The membranes are glued along three edges over a permeate spacer to form ‘leaves’. The permeate spacer supports the membrane and conducts the permeate to the <b>central</b> permeate <b>tube.</b> Between each leaf, a mesh like feed spacer is inserted. The reason for the mesh like dimension of the spacer is to provide a hydrodynamic environment near the surface of the membrane that discourages concentration polarisation. Once the leaves have been wound around the <b>central</b> <b>tube,</b> the module is wrapped in a casing layer and caps placed {{on the end of the}} cylinder to prevent ‘telescoping’ that can occur in high flow rate and pressure conditions.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} project aiming at {{development}} of a miniaturized hydrogen generator for small mobile/onboard fuel cell applications, a series of experiments was conducted on a novel micro-reactor to examine the effectiveness of its design in promoting the mixing of reactant agents. The reactor is essentially a tubular vessel fitted with a multi-holed baffle plate mounted on a <b>central</b> <b>tube.</b> The mixing phenomenon within the micro-reactor was studied using the micro-PIV (micro-particle image velocimetry) flow visualization technique. Experiments were conducted on a 1 : 1 scale replica of the reactor. Results indicate that the application of the multi-holed baffle plate considerably improves the mixing performance of the reactor when compared with a simpler co-axial jet tubular reactor. However, the geometrical characteristics of the baffle plate and <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> are found to have dramatic impacts upon the flow structure and mixing patterns within the reactor. Hence, the optimization of the reactor geometry is required to achieve the desirable mixing performance. For the range of Reynolds numbers studied here, the optimum reactor geometry is achieved when the <b>central</b> <b>tube</b> and baffle holes are of similar diameters and baffle holes are located half way between the stream-wise axis and the reactor wall...|$|R
