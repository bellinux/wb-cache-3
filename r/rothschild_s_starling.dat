40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is the Kurdish demand for {{federalism}} in Iraq. The research question is What have been the factors behind the Kurdish demand for a federal system in Iraq ? My focus is on two main factors, {{the internal and external}} (regional and international) factors. This is a qualitative case study. The focus is on why the Kurds chose to remain a part of Iraq, though there would seem to be few reasons for this desire. Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan/Southern Kurdistan have lived in a kind of independent mini-state since the Gulf War of 1991. They had developed good relationships with the outside world at the state level, although these relations were never recognized officially. The discussion also touches on the Kurds in other parts. This is because changes in any of the countries with Kurdish population (Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria) would {{have a significant impact on}} the Kurdish issue as a whole. The theoretical part are based on approaches from Lijphart s (1977) and Horowitz s (1985) mechanisms for conflict management and resolutions in divided societies, and from Lake and <b>Rothschild</b> <b>s</b> (ed. 1998) approach of confidence-building measures which includes power-sharing and federalism to keep internal conflicts at a local level and prevent it from spreading. The relationships that have developed after the fall of Ba ath regime indicate that the political system that is taking shape in Iraq will contain elements from both consociational, power-sharing and integrative approaches. The ethnic-religious conflict in Iraq has deep roots and there is a need for power-sharing at regional level, so that Kurds could run own regional affairs. On the other hand, it is necessary for the different groups to negotiate and cooperate in order to solve internal conflicts and future problems ahead in Iraq. The Kurdish issue bears an external dimension too. It is argued that federalism for Kurds seems to be a result of regional and international pressure, and that federalism is being applied to prevent the Kurdish conflict or the conflict in Iraq from escalating, and thereby maintain the geopolitical stability and balance of the region. The analytical part is divided into two, with the internal factors (chapter 4) and the external factors (chapter 5). Due to the internal situation, it would seem to be necessary for the Kurds to maintain their self-rule in a federal order, and also important to have a dialogue with Baghdad and participate in the political process and decision-making. In this way the Kurds could guarantee their future against possible discrimination, and at the same time, bring the Kurds a step further towards gaining control over territories. When it comes to the external factors, the argument is that the demand for federalism came as a result of external pressure on Kurdish decision-makers. The regional powers, especially countries with Kurdish population, have in the past rejected Kurdish demands and have in fact cooperated to prevent the Kurds from establishing autonomous regions. This is because success for Kurds in any neighboring country could awaken nationalistic movements among Kurds across the borders and thereby inspire them to come up with demands. At the international level, the United States seems to need the Kurds, who are struggling for a secular form of democracy in Iraq in order to maintain an internal balance of power, and probably prevent the Shiite majority s attempt to establish another Shiite regime there. Then, federalism with Kurdish regional self-rule satisfies the external powers and neighbors in the region, while the Kurdish population s desire for independency is ignored, again. I also have underlined that one should pay attention to external role regarding internal conflict management. And that the Kurdish conflict, which bears a strong external dimension, is a good example for further studies with similar cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background European {{starlings}} (Sturnus vulgaris) are an invasive {{bird species}} {{known to cause}} damage to plant and animal agriculture. New evidence suggests starlings may {{also contribute to the}} maintenance and spread of diseases within livestock facilities. Identifying and mitigating the risk pathways that contribute to disease in livestock is necessary to reduce production losses and contamination of human food products. To better understand the impact starlings have on disease transmission to cattle we assessed the efficacy of starling control as a tool to reduce Salmonella enterica within a concentrated animal feeding operation. We matched a large facility, slated for operational control using DRC- 1339 (3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline hydrochloride, also 3 -chloro p-toluidine hydrochloride, 3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline), with a comparable reference facility that was not controlling birds. In both facilities, we sampled cattle feed, cattle water and cattle feces for S. enterica before and after starling control operations. Results Within the starling-controlled CAFO, detections of S. enterica contamination disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following starling control operations. Within the reference facility, detections of S. enterica contamination increased substantially within feed bunks and water troughs. Starling control was not observed to reduce prevalence of S. enterica in the cattle herd. Following starling control operations, herd prevalence of S. enterica increased on the reference facility but herd prevalence of S. enterica on the starling-controlled CAFO stayed at pretreatment levels. Conclusions Within the starling-controlled facility detections of S. enterica disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following control operations. Since cattle feed and water are obvious routes for the ingestion of <b>S.</b> enterica, <b>starling</b> control shows promise as a tool to help livestock producers manage disease. Yet, we do not believe starling control should be used as a stand alone tool to reduce S. enterica infections. Rather starling control could be used as part of a comprehensive disease management plan for concentrated animal feeding operations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Patterns of {{resource}} partitioning among 4 sympatric sturnids: [black-collared starling (Sturnus nigricollis), pied <b>starling</b> (<b>S.</b> contra), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and crested myna (A. javanicus) were determined {{based on their}} food habits, foraging and nesting microhabitat selection, morphology and behavior. The study was conducted from March 1986 to June 1988 at and around Bang Pra Game Sanctuary, Cholburi, Thailand. Diets of adults and nestlings of all species were significantly different. The 4 species exhibited significant differences in morphology, primarily in trophic (bill shape and length) and locomotive (wing shape and size) appendages that affect selection of foraging microhabitat and hence choice of diets. Selection of nest site characteristics was significantly different among the species and was associated with types of tree i. e., palm vs non-palm (trees with forks or branches), distance of nest tree from human habitation and distance of nest tree from seasonal or permanent waters. The pied starling, common myna and crested myna all selected different foraging habitats and used different techniques for foraging,-however the black-collared starling shared foraging habitat with the other 3 species. Breeding success, breeding chronology, and clutch sizes were similar for the 4 species. These 4 sympatric sturnids partitioned their resources through differences in morphology, which, in turn, affected their foraging habitat selection and modes of foraging, and hence, differences in diet. Behavioral differences also segregated their foraging techniques and nest site selection...|$|R

Success depended on extensive cooperation from many sources: Bureau agencies, especially the Division of Wildlife Services; other Federal and State conservation and agricultural departments; the Audubon Society; ornithological clubs; and individual bird students. In all, 674 roosts were reported-— 262 in the East and 412 in the West. The total estimated population was 340 million birds: 267 million blackbirds and starlings in the East and 73 million in the West. The national population was composed of 10 species, about as follows: 40 percent red-winged blackbirds, 20 percent starlings, 20 percent common grackles, 15 percent brown-headed cowbirds, 3 per¬cent Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s blackbirds, and 1 percent rusty blackbirds; the other 1 percent included boat-tailed grackles, yellow-headed blackbirds, tricolored blackbirds, and bronzed cowbirds.

40|$|Guillermo Calvo {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} economists in the field of international macroeconomics of the past 30 years. He has produced seminal articles in every area of macroeconomics and international economics that he has worked on, including his early classic articles on capacity utilization and time inconsistency, his 1980 s works on efficiency wages, price stickiness, and policy credibility, and his recent studies on sudden stops and emerging market crises. Yet, the defining feature of Guillermo Calvo s contribution to our profession is not the depth and wide scope of the economic theories he has developed, but the central emphasis he puts in all his work on the role of economics as a tool for understanding reality and improving the quality of human life. Guillermo Calvo s passion for the policy implications of economic theory is obvious to anyone who has met him since his days as Senior Advisor of the Research Department of the IMF in the mid- 1980 s. This feature of his professional interests was much less obvious to those who interacted with him during his early years as an important figure of the rational expectations revolution. It was probably hard to see that behind the highly technical treatment presented in his articles at that time was an author who had his feet soundly set on the ground and focused on understanding how society could benefit from the renaissance of macroeconomic theory that was taking place. Interestingly, Michael Rothschild did figure out the true nature of Guillermo Calvo in those early years. When the University of California at San Diego tried to hire Calvo in the mid- 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>Rothschild</b> explained to Calvo that he was an excellent fit for San Diego because he was a particular type of theoretician: Most theoreticians make theory out of theory, Rothschild noted, but Calvo was different because he made theory out of reality, taking what is really out there and presenting it in a much wider and complex form than a well-developed but narrow theory. The following pages are excerpts from three interview sessions that Guillermo Calvo and I had at his office in the Inter-American Development Bank in the spring of 2003. These interviews provide a clear summary picture of Calvo as the theoretician of reality that Michael Rothschild described. The recollection of the conversation with Rothschild is one of many fascinating memories of Calvo s personal life and professional career that emerged during our meetings. We taped and transcribed the three meetings in Spanish and then Calvo and I together edited that material to produce this much shorter interview in English for Macroeconomic Dynamics. ...|$|R
