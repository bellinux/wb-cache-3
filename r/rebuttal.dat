5|$|Coakley's <b>rebuttal</b> {{witnesses}} {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The <b>rebuttal</b> fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last <b>rebuttal</b> witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOur {{purpose is}} to {{identify}} the Japanese six grade (aged 11 - 12 years) elementary school students’ understanding of the criteria for quality of <b>rebuttals</b> before they learn on argumentation. The criteria for high-quality <b>rebuttals</b> include explicitly pointing out the errors in other people's statements (pointing out) and explaining reasons {{as to why the}} statements are incorrect (reasons). We conducted the evaluation task to identify students’ understanding of the criteria for quality of <b>rebuttals.</b> The results revealed that many students recognized <b>rebuttals</b> include reasons as high-quality <b>rebuttals,</b> but did not recognize <b>rebuttals</b> include pointing out as high-quality <b>rebuttals...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ace Attorney Investigations is a single-player {{adventure}} game {{in which}} players control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases. The game is mostly presented from a third-person perspective, occasionally switching to a first-person view when examining evidence. Each case involves playing through several investigation phases and <b>rebuttal</b> phases.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} known written {{works by}} Augustus that have survived such as his poems Sicily, Epiphanus, and Ajax, an {{autobiography}} of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written <b>rebuttal</b> to Brutus' Eulogy of Cato. Historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} his script was less antisemitic than the Metzger/Möller script. He even {{claimed that the}} Mendes' script was more antisemitic than his. However, in <b>rebuttal,</b> Haggith and Newman point out that Harlan added an {{important}} sequence in which Süß {{is responsible for the}} execution of a blacksmith, a sequence which served to increase the audience's hatred for Süß.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker won {{the local}} people over through his success; {{in his first year}} in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning {{approximately}} half of his cases. He rarely called defence witnesses, thereby avoiding the possibility of <b>rebuttal</b> witnesses for the Crown, and securing the last word for himself. In late 1920, {{he was elected to the}} village council to serve a three-year term.|$|E
5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a <b>rebuttal,</b> which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, actress-comedian Olivia Munn began a tryout {{period on}} the show as a correspondent. Her {{credentials}} were questioned by Irin Carmon of the website Jezebel, who suggested that Munn was better known as a sex symbol than as a comedian. Carmon's column was denounced by Munn and the Daily Show female writers, producers, and correspondents, 32 of whom posted a <b>rebuttal</b> {{on the show}}'s website in which they asserted that {{the description of the}} Daily Show office given by the Jezebel piece was not accurate. Munn appeared as a Daily Show correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.|$|E

5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator Huey Long became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a <b>rebuttal</b> from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend that the crew had gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a <b>rebuttal</b> by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} {{games in}} the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence, and <b>rebuttal</b> phases, in which they confront other characters, to hear what they think has happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters' statements, {{to get closer to}} the truth.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Pandora {{comes out of}} the bathroom, Cook is the only person left at the house. Together they play Twister, which was all Pandora had wanted to do, along with {{learning}} from her friends about human sexuality. Cook offers to have sex with her, and they spend the night together. Effy visits Pandora the next morning, and sees Cook share a kiss with her as he leaves. Feeling hurt, she confronts Pandora, but to no avail, as Pandora is slightly empowered after losing her virginity. Pandora defiantly tells Effy that Cook, due to his promiscuity and impulsive, carnal behavior, belongs to no one. Effy appears to understand, and makes no <b>rebuttal.</b> Suddenly, Thomas appears and runs up to Pandora, and she sobs in his arms as a thoughtful Effy looks on.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaneous {{to these}} developments, Nagavarma II wrote his Kannada grammar Karnataka bhashabhushana ("Ornament of Karnataka language", 1042 or 1145). A {{milestone}} {{in the history}} of Kannada literature, it helped consolidate the language as competitor to established languages such as Sanskrit and Prakrit, bringing the local language within the realm of literary cosmopolitanism. Writing a Kannada grammar in Sanskrit language was essential to Nagavarma II, a subtle <b>rebuttal</b> to Sanskritic scholars of the day who may have considered Kannada a language of the common man and its grammar as underdeveloped. In addition to the Chalukya patronage, Kannada poets and writers of this period were popular in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western Deccan. The Hoysalas, the southern Kalachuris, the Seunas, the Gangas and the Silharas are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.|$|E
5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct <b>rebuttal</b> of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E

5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery <b>rebuttal,</b> {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>rebuttal</b> phases, {{a witness}} or a rival {{character}} provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Foreign Ministry {{said that}} a team {{including}} Attorney-General Lucien Wong, and Chan Sek Keong, S. Jayakumar and Tommy Koh (who had represented Singapore at the original ICJ hearing), had been appointed to study {{and respond to the}} claim. On 5 February 2017, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that on a cursory examination of the documents without detailed legal advice, he did not see how the documents would make any difference to the ICJ's judgment. On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61.
