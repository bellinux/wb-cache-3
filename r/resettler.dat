50|$|His {{relationship}} with the East German state began to deteriorate, however, with his drama Die Umsiedlerin (The <b>Resettler</b> Woman) which was censored in 1961 after only one performance. Müller was banned from the Writers' Association in the same year. The East German government remained wary of Müller in subsequent years, preventing the premiere of Der Bau (Construction Site) in 1965 and censoring his Mauser in the early 1970s. Yet despite these hardships, Müller's work began to gain popularity both in West Germany and internationally at this time. Many of his best-known plays from this period were premiered in the West: this includes Germania Death in Berlin, which was first performed in 1978 at the Munich Kammerspiele. Heiner Müller himself directed a production of The Mission (Der Auftrag) in Bochum in 1982. In Paris, Jean Jourdheuil directed {{the world premiere of}} Hamletmachine (Die Hamletmaschine) in 1979. English translations, first by Helen Fehervary and Marc Silberman, then by Carl Weber, introduced Müller to the English speaking world in the mid- and late 1970s; Müller's controversial play Mauser was first performed in 1975 in Austin, Texas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background It can {{be assumed}} that <b>resettlers</b> (ethnic German {{immigrants}} from the Former Soviet Union) show similar smoking patterns as persons in their countries of origin {{at the time of}} migration. We analysed how the smoking prevalence among <b>resettlers</b> differs from that among the general population of Germany and whether the prevalence differs between groups with increasing duration of stay. Methods To estimate the smoking prevalence we used the scientific-use-file (n = 477, 239) of the German 2005 microcensus, an annual census representing 1 % of all German households. Participation in the microcensus is obligatory (unit-nonresponse <b>resettlers</b> and the comparison group (population of Germany without <b>resettlers)</b> by age, sex, educational level and duration of stay. In total, 14, 373 (3 % of the total) persons were identified as <b>resettlers.</b> Results Female <b>resettlers</b> with short duration of stay had a significantly lower smoking prevalence than women in the comparison group. With increasing duration of stay their smoking prevalence appears to converge to that of the comparison group (e. g. : high educational level, age group 25 - 44 years: short duration of stay 15 %, long duration of stay 24 %, comparison group 28 %). In contrast, the smoking prevalence among male <b>resettlers</b> with short duration of stay was significantly higher than that among men in the comparison group, but also with a trend towards converging (e. g. : high educational level, age group 25 - 44 years: short duration of stay 44 %, long duration of stay 35 %, comparison group 36 %). Except for female <b>resettlers</b> with short duration of stay, the participants with low educational level had on average a higher smoking prevalence than those with a high educational level. Conclusions This is the first study estimating the smoking prevalence among <b>resettlers</b> by duration of stay. The results support the hypothesis that <b>resettlers</b> brought different smoking habits from their countries of origin shortly after migration. The observed convergence of the smoking habits with increasing duration of stay is in line with the hypothesis of migration as 'health transition'. However, due to the cross-sectional design of the study, {{further research is needed to}} confirm these findings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Resettlement as a {{response}} to food security has been practised in Ethiopia since the imperial regime. In all the respective governments, the aim was superficially the same-moving people from drought affected areas or over populated regions and over utilized land settlement to the so called fertile arable lands. Despite the different motives the programme has been launched, it has its own positive and negative impact on the relocated and the host community. Based on this background, this study explores the impact of the current Ethiopian resettlement on the livelihoods of the host and <b>resettler</b> community at Isara resettlement site of Dawuro Zone in Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples` Region (SNNPR) - a region which embraces over 56 ethnic groups. With the multi-cultural context of this region, the resettlement was carried out within the region from one zonal administration to the other zonal or special district administration. Accordingly, people from the Hadiya, Kambata, Tambaro, and Wolayta ethnic zones were moved to Dauwro ethnic zone. The people relocated from these zonal administrations have different socio-economic, cultural and historical backgrounds with the receiving zone, Dawuro Zone. According to the national rural development policy, resettlement was taken as a strategy to alleviate the plight of food security by moving people within the same region of similar socio-cultural, linguistic and historical make up. But the practice in SNNPR basically violates this reality and pushed to be implemented as a region. This study looks into the challenges of this context to maintain livelihood in the new area of settlement. It answers the following questions: what impacts does the resettlement have on the host and <b>resettler</b> community. What livelihood activities are practised by the <b>resettler</b> and host community? What is the current status of the livelihoods for the resettlers and host communities? The study clearly shows that the current resettlement practice at Isara site has predominantly negative impact on the livelihoods of the host and <b>resettler</b> communities. This impact was traced back to the poor provision of social and agricultural input services to the relocatees and the inconsistency of the promised infrastructural and social service institutions in the site. Above all, the inappropriate use or deforestation of the locally available livelihood resource made the matter worst. Meanwhile the growing number of relocated people in the new site aggravated the clearing of more forest land to agricultural settlement. This inevitably caused the ecological imbalance in the site. This contradicts with the basic livelihood concept which incorporates - the capacity, resources affordable and the activities to make a living. Here the demolished local forest and land resources cut of f the above livelihood cycle. Likewise, the capacity where the labour force is the dominant source, is affected by the poor psycho-social support for the relocated and challenge of social networking in the new site hinders the work force motivation and welfare. The poor health and education services in the site hold back the health status of the productive power and thus affect the capacity to make livelihood. Over all, the resettlement launched at Isara site has resulted in the loss of natural resources, and thus has dwindled the effort to sustain their livelihood for the present and future...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between immigrants {{and members of}} the host society has been and still is an important issue during processes of migration. This study analyses inter-ethnic aggressive antisocial actions among adolescents. A descriptive analysis reveals the frequency of such behaviour among German, Turkish and <b>Resettler</b> (Aussiedler) adolescents. The explanatory analysis concentrates on the influence of a) attitudes towards violence (justifications), b) an approval with social dominance, c) bargaining as a conflict resolution strategy, and d) trust in the judicial system (a fair treatment according to the law). It is assumed that justifications for violent behaviour and the approval with social dominance are likely to increase inter-ethnic aggressive antisocial actions. In contrast, bargaining as a preference for conflict resolution and trust in the judicial system are supposed to reduce such behaviour.

40|$|By far {{the highest}} {{immigration}} {{figures in the}} history of <b>resettlers</b> of German origin being admitted into Germany were achieved in 1989 and 1990 with some 400 000 people in each of the years. Since then the immigration of <b>resettlers</b> of German origin has been falling continuously as a result of legal regulations and also of developments in the countries of origin. In 1996 about 178 000 <b>resettlers</b> were admitted. This report deals with the occupational integration of the <b>resettlers</b> who came to Germany {{during the time of the}} great waves of migration. The course of their integration was accompanied by a longitudinal study with three waves, based on a representative sample of participants in German language courses during the period from 1991 until the end of 1993. The subject of this article is the integration situation at the time of the third wave of the survey. It is studied against the background of the conditions in Germany, as these conditions form the standard for integration from an economic point of view. Most of the <b>resettlers</b> bring with them only slight knowledge of the German language, and occupational experience or job skills which do not particularly match job requirements in Germany. In spite of this male <b>resettlers</b> who came to Germany in the early nineties found jobs relatively quickly; female <b>resettlers</b> on the other hand had far greater problems. At the end of 1993, a good two years after completing the German language course, 79 % of the men and 54 % of the women were in employment. The unemployment rate stood at just under 26 % for the women, many of whom had already left the labour market; the unemployment rate for men was 14 %. More extensive analyses showed that in principle resettlers' chances of finding work were determined by the same factors, apart from sex, as German nationals: by age, occupational qualifications and finally also by the knowledge of the German language. The influence of the level of occupational qualifications on the chances of integration is astonishing in that most of the <b>resettlers</b> do not find a job in their previous occupation. Less than one third found employment in a further field of their previous occupational area, and those whohad to change occupational area usually had jobs with low qualification requirements. However, well-qualified people, such those with a university degree, had better chances of finding employment in the occupational area in which they were originally employed. More than 50 % were employed in their previous occupational area, whereas the proportion was far lower in all the other qualification groups. Although many <b>resettlers</b> had to make concessions with regard to their occupations, all in all their satisfaction with their new situation in life was very large. 81 % of the <b>resettlers</b> said they had virtually never regretted migrating. It is particularly remarkable that the number of people who were convinced that they had made the right decision in migrating increased steadily from the first to the third waves of the survey.

There are in many cases a direct link between resettlement and impoverishment. China has in {{the last decades}} done a tremendous effort to improve their resettlement policies and lift the impoverished resettled population out of poverty. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to research the experiences of <b>resettlers</b> who have been moved in the South-North Water Transfer Resettlement Project in Henan, China. The South-North Water Transfer is a water infrastructure project, which will, by constructing three canals, transfer water from the south to the north of China. In this project more than 300 000 people will be relocated. The research is based on qualitative data from observations and interviews in Xichuan County and Zhengzhou in Henan, China. Further, texts from government web pages have also been used.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} notion that making {{individuals}} in-teract across ethnic lines {{seems to be a}} major difficulty (Amir, 1976), this comparative field study offers two explanations for the differences in inter-ethnic contacts among German, Turkish and Aussiedler (<b>Resettler)</b> adolescents. One assumption is based on Social Identity Theory research with its central proposition that in group affiliation is likely to trigger out-group rejection. Thus in group favouritism is expected to decrease the frequency of inter-ethnic encounters. The other assumption is built on acculturation research and argues that certain dispositions towards acculturation facilitate or inhibit inter-ethnic contacts considerably. A preference for interaction is supposed to function as a facilitating factor where as assimilation is likely to prevent inter-ethnic encounters. On the whole the findings of this field study corroborate the assumptionsfor in-group favouritism and acculturation preferences. Further, young men tend more often to approve of in-group favouritism which prohibits inter-ethnic contact, while in contrast, young women more often agree with notions of dissimilation orinteraction which facilitate encounters with out-group members. Finally, subgroup analyses point to the importance of religious affiliation sand their consequences for inter-ethnic contacts under certain conditions...|$|E

According, to Central Statistical Agency (2007) and Temesgen (2015) the population in Bale mountains eco-region had escalated. Accordingly, in 1994 the total population {{in the study area}} was 475, 515 while in 2016 it has increased to 878, 493 with population density of 52 person/km 2. This implies that between these two periods the number of population in study area increased by about 402, 978 with annual rate of increment about 18, 318 persons per year. In these regard, a study made by Lemenih et al.

This paper suggests that while the paternalistic character of resettlement has allowed <b>resettlers</b> to partially keep their group identity, and partially to reconstruct it in relation with the host community, it was also based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between <b>resettlers</b> and the organiser of resettlement.

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{population}} displacement and the livelihood implications of state-planned resettlement schemes {{that have been}} implemented in Western Oromia, Ethiopia. It addresses the livelihoods of both the resettlers and the hosts. Although such resettlements have been implemented in the country since the 1960 s, this study addresses those carried out since 2003. The broad objective {{of the study was}} to explore the dynamics of displacement and resettlement, and their impacts on the livelihoods of <b>resettler</b> and host populations. The specific objectives were: (1) to assess the policies and practices of the resettlement program carried out during the tenure of the current government; (2) to analyze the livelihood outcomes of the resettlements for resettlers and hosts in terms of changes in access to livelihood resources and social services; and (3) to examine resettlers and hosts perceptions of and attitudes towards the resettlement program. The theory of impoverishment risks and livelihood reconstruction (IRLR), the sustainable livelihood framework (SLF), and political ecology constitute the pillars of the theoretical framework. Primary data were collected in 2009 through a survey of 630 households in eight resettlement sites, and 68 thematic (group and individual) interviews in 13 resettlement sites. Several interviews were also held with government officials. Households were selected for the survey through stratified random sampling, whereas informants were selected for the interviews purposively. The primary data were complemented with relevant secondary data. The study is interdisciplinary, and combines both qualitative and quantitative methods through a concurrent mixed-methods design. Qualitative methods were used to address how and why questions through thematic analysis of the interviews and policy documents, thereby illuminating the substantive significance of the issues at stake. Quantitative methods were employed to quantify changes and establish the statistical significance of variables of interest. The quantitative methods used include descriptive statistics, such as percentages, means and cross-tabulations, and inferential statistics, such as logistic regression, mean comparisons using non-parametric tests, factor analysis, Chi-square tests, and loglinear analysis. The complementary relation between the two methods has proved useful in understanding and explaining the processes and the outcomes of the resettlement scheme. The research illuminates the causes, the processes, and the outcomes of the current resettlement program in particular, and critically analyzes the assumptions underlying the resettlement policies of the current and the previous regimes in general. Multiple causes and assumptions underlay the resettlement scheme, most notably land and rainfall shortages in resettlers areas of origin, and the government s claim of land abundance. This last assumption has been persistently made by regime after regime, despite empirical counter-evidence, as also shown in this study. By revealing that the scheme resulted in the displacement of the host population to make way for resettlement, that the resettlers were given less land than promised, and that the relocation led to serious conflicts and disputes over land between resettlers and hosts, the study challenges the state s supposition and rhetoric of ample land. The evidence also illuminates the relocation s glaring lack of inclusiveness of both resettlers and hosts, despite the benign principles of voluntarism and consultation. The outcomes were multiple, leaving some better-off, others worse-off, and still others with no noticeable livelihood deterioration or improvement. In cases where old problems were alleviated, new ones emerged in a context of little plan and capacity to meet contingencies. This calls into question government propagation of generalized success in the resettlement scheme. Although little is known about the sustainability of the improved outcomes for some resettlers in some resettlement sites, the evidence from this study also counteracts the depiction of the scheme as a general failure. The findings suggest that the relative importance of the risks experienced by the resettlers and the hosts varied between the two population groups, and among different resettlement sites. The resettlement sites were widely differentiated in terms of biophysical factors, notably soil fertility and the availability of grazing land. This has serious implications for the resettlers and the hosts as their livelihoods are almost entirely based on agricultural activities. Moreover, historical issues, wider socio-political structures, physical infrastructure, and resettler-host relations are crucial for the understanding of how people s access to livelihood resources and social services is shaped. However, resettler-host relations should be seen in a broader context of state-society relations, as the state is a key actor in planning and implementing the resettlement programs. An important policy lesson from this study is that when one focuses on certain livelihood aspects, one also needs to be aware that other potential livelihood components not evident today may become vital in the future. This awareness should motivate adaptive planning and management to meet contingencies in a way that reflects the multifaceted nature of livelihoods.

However, harsh climate conditions, increased incidence of diseases and human-wildlife conflicts caused much discomfort among <b>resettlers.</b> Diversification away from paddy farming to other agricultural activities and providing legal land titles would have allowed them to gain more from resettlement compensation...|$|R

The analysis was built in six dimensions of sustainability, Sachs (2000), they are social, economic, ecological, spatial, cultural and political. We researched the documentation relating to the entrepreneurial commitments in relation to resettlement, as well as documentation that evaluated the whole process. The interviews with the <b>resettlers</b> were indispensable to the finding that the definitions of sustainability provided in the official documentation are limited; in addition, many actions mitigated under such plans have not been realized, thus preventing socioeconomic advances to <b>resettlers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper discuss {{two cases}} of {{resettlement}} related to dam development: the Saguling project in West Java and the Kotmale project in Sri Lanka. <b>Resettlers</b> {{of these two}} projects were offered new livelihoods created by the project. Their successes and failures in restoring income subsequent to relocation are discussed. In both the projects, alternative compensation schemes had to be formulated {{because it was not}} possible to provide <b>resettlers</b> with the same amount of farmland in the vicinity. The strategic use of new opportunities, by way of providing new prospects in aquaculture development, was promoted as compensation for <b>resettlers</b> of Saguling and, as a result, they were able to enjoy superior economic and social benefits. Two options, based on income restoration through land-based alternatives, were offered for Kotmale resettlers: move away to new settlements or resettle in riparian areas after receiving tea plots. Two decades after relocation, their socioeconomic conditions are better than those who were not affected by the project. However, many questions remain which raise doubts whether <b>resettlers</b> were able to reap the intended benefits; these are discussed in this paper. Some of them include issues of social marginalization and inequality, the negative consequences of lack of access to credit, and over-exploitation of resources that eroded the earnings potential. The following lessons were learnt from the two case studies: livelihood rebuilding efforts should be complemented by introducing opportunities of securing financial assistance; attitude towards risk is crucial in the success of livelihood rebuilding; resettlement options should address the dynamism of local socio-economic conditions and be designed with local collaboration; sustainability of production capacity and economic viability in the long term should be emphasized; and while outsider influence cannot be controlled, the capacity of the local community can be strengthene...|$|R

40|$|Late) resettlers”, {{or to put}} it {{in simple}} terms, people of German ancestry who came to Germany from Eastern Europe after World War II, {{constitute}} a peculiar case within the spectrum of German migration. On one hand, they are distinct from foreigners, on the other hand, despite having German citizenship, they stand out from the native German population. L. Wilkiewicz refers to this category as “quasi-forced resettlers”. The forced nature of the young <b>resettlers</b> migration may then be seen as doubly strengthened {{by the fact that they}} had no impact on their parents decision to leave the country. They were, in a sort of way, uprooted from their original environment and planted into a new, alien one. Having accepted German citizenship and having been attributed the purpose of “living as Germans among Germans”, the <b>resettlers</b> were expected to show a higher degree of integration with local society than “ordinary” migrants. In this study, I shall confine myself to a few selected aspects affecting the success of integration. Presented below are some of the memories that the young <b>resettlers</b> have of the moment of their “(quasi) -forced” migration, of their early days in Germany, of Poland as the country of their childhood, of the reasons for departure as given by their parents, and of the main factors – apart from those personality-related such as intelligence – that contributed to their successful integration...|$|R
