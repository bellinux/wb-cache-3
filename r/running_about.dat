5|$|The Germans, who {{had left}} Songea {{only a few weeks}} before, sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916—250 askaris marched from Likuyu, and 180 more (with two machine guns) set off from Kitanda. The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road, and at Mabogoro {{attacked}} the advance guard, which was commanded by Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Frederick Charles Booth. The Rhodesians were caught by surprise, and many panicked, <b>running</b> <b>about</b> and firing randomly. Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived. The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea. During this contact, Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in the open, and brought him back alive; for this and subsequent actions, Booth received the Victoria Cross in June 1917.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. strike {{aircraft}} were <b>running</b> <b>about</b> 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack {{was more important}} than a massed attack, and because they lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first group—consisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander R. Eation from Hornet—was on its way by about 08:00. A second group—consisting of three SBDs, seven TBFs, and eight Wildcats from Enterprise—was off by 08:10. A third group—which included nine SBDs, eight TBFs, and seven F4Fs from Hornet—was on its way by 08:20.|$|E

Not meant to be taken seriously, the story had the Rani opening a hole in time, cycling the Doctor and his companions through his previous incarnations and menacing them with monsters from the show's past. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location.|$|E

500|$|The Diolkos was a {{trackway}} {{paved with}} hard limestone with parallel grooves <b>running</b> <b>about</b> [...] apart. The roadway was [...] wide.

500|$|Ōkami {{resulted}} from the combined ideas of Clover Studio. The game was originally built around [...] "depict a lot of nature", but had no central concept or theme, according to lead designer Hideki Kamiya. Kamiya eventually created a minute-long demonstration movie showing a wolf <b>running</b> <b>about</b> a forest, with flowers blossoming in its wake, but still lacked any gameplay. Kamiya {{and other members of}} the team introduced ideas around the nature aspect and eventually led to the game's initial prototype, which Kamiya admitted was [...] "incredibly boring to play". Kamiya suggested that he allowed so many ideas from the team that resulted in the development moving off-target, including creating more of a simulation. Eventually, they settled onto the gameplay found in the final product.|$|E
