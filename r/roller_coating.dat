The original power block he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped <b>roller</b> <b>coated</b> with hard rubber. It was suspended from a davit, and powered from the warp end of the winch by a looping rope. In 1954, the power block was trialled by American purse seiners in the Pacific.

As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.|$|R
40|$|The most {{critical}} mechanism {{on board the}} proposed space station is the continously rotating joint which must accurately align the solar power units with the sun during earth orbit. The feasibility of a multiple, discrete bearing supported joint driven by a self-loading, pinch drive actuator was investigated for this application. This concept appears to offer greater protection against catastrophic jamming, less sensitivity to adverse thermal gradients, greater accessibility to inorbit servicing or replacement and greater adaptability to very large (5 m) truss members than to more conventional continuous support bearing/gear reducer joints. Analytical trade studies performed herein establish that a discrete cam roller bearing support system having eight hangers around a continuous ring would provide sufficient radial and bending stiffness to prevent any degradation in the fundamental frequencies of the solar wing structure.

40|$|Coatings on {{grain-oriented}} {{electrical steel}} (GOES) are produced primarily by <b>roller</b> <b>coating</b> deposition of aluminium ortho phosphate {{on top of}} forsterite. These coatings provide the insulation resistance and stress to improve magnetic properties. Electroless deposition of nickel and cobalt based coatings {{could be used as}} an alternative because these coatings can be made insulated and stress can be generated and tailored in these coatings. The rate of deposition in electroless plating is faster when compared to other chemical coating techniques and the process is auto catalytic (no external current required). The coatings are corrosion resistant and the magnetic properties of the coatings can be varied by simply changing the pH of the solution. Addition of alloying elements like phosphorus and boron can manipulate the stress generated in the coating from tensile to compressive and vice versa. A 2. 15 ± 0. 15 μm thick Co-Ni-P coating on GOES was able to reduce the power loss by 9 - 11 %. Similarly a 414 ± 40 nm thick coating of Co-P-Carbon Nanotube on GOES was able to reduce the power losses ranging 13 - 15 %. The reduction in power loss in Co-Ni-P coated sample was due to tensile stress applied on GOES by the coating which reduced the anomalous loss.

Allseas is a company capable of installing these pipelines under various challenging operating conditions. In today's market, competition and oil and gas availability make it necessary for Allseas to operate at the top of capability. For each project, calculations are performed beforehand to ensure a vessel will {{be able to deal with}} the pipeline installation under the specified conditions. When laying pipe in deep water, the longitudinal force required to hold the pipe can go up to 1000 mT. It is found that the calculations performed to predict this force do not always correspond with reality. The process of laying pipe involves transporting pipe over rubber <b>coated</b> <b>rollers</b> to the seabed under high tensions. The contact between the pipe and the rubber <b>coated</b> <b>rollers</b> cause a rolling resistance, which is not yet included in calculations, possibly explaining (part of) the discrepancy between calculations and reality.

The results of the analysis and tests have been analyzed and related to actual operating conditions. It showed that the rolling resistance is much less than currently used in practice.

Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet <b>coated</b> steel <b>roller</b> was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally refined steel substrate and for the mating surface roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the mating surface roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the mating surface roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material.

40|$|This thesis deals {{primarily}} with {{a class of}} elastostatic contact problems involving circular elastic cylinders, whose axes are parallel and whose boundaries touch initially along a line. The object {{of the study is}} to establish the nature of the contact region (a narrow rectangular strip) which develops when a pair of equal and opposite forces is applied compressing these cylinders together. Of prime interest is the pressure distribution which acts in this region for a given set of variables: the radii and elastic properties of the cylinders, combined with either their relative approach or the total compressive force. Specifically, the problems of incorporating the effects of curvature, sharp edges and surface layers, which are all neglected in the existing Hertz theory are investigated within the framework of linear elasticity. Results are discussed in light of their implications to the industrial process of <b>roller</b> <b>coating.</b> The effects of curvature are accounted for by considering the two-dimensional symmetrical compression of a circular elastic cylinder by two identical arbitrary compressors. Two cases of boundary conditions are studied. In each case the general approach adopted involves a simple superposition of basic point force solutions for the circular boundary to derive the governing integral equation for the pressure distribution in the contact region. Complex variable methods are utilised to obtain the point force solutions, while the contact pressure distribution is derived using the properties of the finite Hilbert transform. The first boundary condition constitutes a prescribed horizontal circumferential displacement while the vertical displacement is left to take on whatever value is generated by the given deformation; in this case, the horizontal pressure distribution is sought. The second boundary condition pertains to the physical situation of complete adhesion wherein both the horizontal and vertical circumferential displacements are specified; in this case, both the horizontal and vertical pressures are determined. Analysis relating to the first boundary condition yields an exact formula for the pressure distribution for the following rigid compressors: (i) parallel plates, (ii) circular cylinders of equal radius to the central cylinder, and (iii) elliptical cylinders whose minor axes coincide with that of the central cylinder. Approximate expressions are given for the general cases of (ii) and (iii), and for the situations in which these compressors are elastic. Comparisons are drawn between some of the results and the Hertz pressure. The problem of incorporating the effects of sharp edges and surface layers is dealt with in the context of three-dimensional linear elasticity. A numerical method of solution is developed which utilises the generalised Boussinesq stress-displacement relation for a layered elastic half-space, in conjunction with the flexibility method of structural analysis. A n iterative scheme is employed in which the systems of linear equations for the contact pressures so obtained are solved subject to the conditions of total equilibrium and the exclusion of tensile forces. Subsequently, the method is extended to account for the presence of sharp edges in roller contact by assuming at the outset the inverse square root singularity form for the pressure near the sharp edges. Numerical results are compared with both published theoretical and experimental data. The method is applied to specific <b>roller</b> <b>coating</b> systems, demonstrating how it may be utilised to identify the most influential factors which govern the intensity of the contact pressures for a given roll profile. Finally, a brief examination of the contact between an elastic cylinder and a thin beam in bending is included. The deflection of the beam is deduced in accordance with elementary beam theory. This is followed by a treatment of the limiting case of contact with a rigid cylinder. For the elastic cylinder, the displacement solution corresponding to a point force acting on its circumferential boundary is determined using complex variable methods...|$|E
40|$|As {{the least}} {{expensive}} category of high-slope roofing in the U. S., shingles are found on the roofs of about 80 % of U. S. homes, and constitute about 80 % (by product area) of this market. Shingles are also among the least reflective high-slope roofing products, with few cool options on the market. The widespread use of cool roofs in the two warmest U. S. climate zones could reduce annual residential cooling energy use in these zones by over 7 %. This project targets the development of high-performance cool shingles with initial solar reflectance at least 0. 40 and a cost premium not exceeding US$ 0. 50 /ft². Phase 1 {{of the current study}} explored three approaches to increasing shingle reflectance. Method A replaces dark bare granules by white bare granules to enhance the near-infrared reflectance attained with cool pigments. Method B applies a white basecoat and a cool-color topcoat to a shingle surfaced with dark bare granules. Method C applies a visually clear, NIR-reflecting surface treatment to a conventionally colored shingle. Method A was the most successful, but our investigation of Method B identified <b>roller</b> <b>coating</b> as a promising top-coating technique, and our study of Method C developed a novel approach based on a nanowire mesh. Method A yielded red, green, brown, and black faux shingles with solar reflectance up to 0. 39 with volumetric coloration. Since the base material is white, these reflectances can readily be increased by using less pigment. The expected cost premium for Method A shingles is less than our target limit of $ 0. 50 /ft², and would represent less than a 10 % increase in the installed cost of a shingle roof. Using inexpensive but cool (spectrally selective) iron oxide pigments to volumetrically color white limestone synthesized from sequestered carbon and seawater appears to offer high albedo at low cost.

40|$|Moving machine {{assemblies}} {{are generally}} designed {{to operate in}} full film lubrication regime to ensure high efficiency and durability of components. However, {{it is not always}} possible to ensure this owing to changes in operating conditions such as load, speed, temperature etc. The overall frictional losses in machines are thus dependent on the operating lubrication regimes (boundary, mixed or full-film). The present work is thus aimed at investigating the role of different surface modification technologies on friction of a conformal tribopair both in boundary and full film lubrication regimes. The conformal pair chosen is a hydrodynamic bearing with some hydrostatic lift. A special test rig comprising of two bearings was built for the experimental studies. Tribological tests were conducted in a wide speed range so as to enable studies in all lubrication regimes i. e., in boundary, mixed and full-film lubrication. The influence of application of different surface modification technologies on friction has been studied. In all, rollers with five coatings (four hard DLC coatings and one self-lubricating <b>coating)</b> and two <b>rollers</b> without <b>coating</b> having different surface finish. Friction measurements were made on the new as well as the previously run-in components. The different coatings exhibit different levels of boundary friction, with the self-lubricating coating having lowest boundary friction, closely followed by those with hard DLC coatings. The softer amongst the hard DLC coatings showed similar boundary friction compared to that with uncoated rollers. The lift-off speed, i. e., the transition between full-film to mixed and boundary lubrication mainly governed by the surface topography characteristics. A smooth surface finish can be achieved either by polishing before the test or by effective running in of the new surface. The effectiveness of running-in of surfaces was influenced by the surface roughness and hardness of the interacting surfaces. Godkänd; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20100628 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Diamondlike-carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} {{have received}} a lot of research attention by physicists and engineers, especially in the past 25 years. Attempts to use such materials in tribological applications have achieved variable success. The rationale for this work was to investigate the wear durability of three types of DLC coatings applied to hardened and tempered bearing steel and subject them to realistic high pressure cyclic loading under oil lubricated conditions for long duration. A thrust bearing design was deployed for this purpose. The wear and friction behavior of the DLC coated materials relative to uncoated materials was compared when using base (additive free) oils and typical autoengine formulated oils. The type of oil used made no difference to the dynamic friction and oil temperature for all the material and oil combinations used. Durability of the <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>roller</b> bearings was determined by the type of material. For the uncoated bearings, life was limited after very many test cycles (approaching a billion) via classical rolling contact fatigue pitting. For all the DLC <b>coated</b> <b>rollers</b> life was governed by wear of their coatings. In the case of the tungsten doped DLCs (a-C:H:W), these were worn progressively and uniformly via microabrasion, whereas the nondoped ta-C and a-C DLC coatings were principally worn via delamination and tearing. The latter effect was relatively rapid and was considered to be initiated by blistering of the coating, a process that was probably driven by the high elastic energy/internal stress within the nondoped coating materials. The durability to delamination and tearing of the ta-C coatings was slightly lowered in formulated oil compared to tests made in base oil. Overall, for the test conditions used here, there was no apparent benefit in using DLC coatings...|$|R
40|$|The continual {{demand for}} higher {{load-bearing}} capacity and improved performance {{and reliability of}} gears and other components increases the role of high endurable Hertz pressures and low friction. Coatings prepared by high velocity oxy-fuel spraying (HVOF), {{one of the most}} important thermal spray processes, have the potential to serve as a technical solution for highly loaded components such as gears. In this work the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) behaviour of HVOF-sprayed WC 17 %Co coatings was investigated on <b>roller</b> specimens with <b>coating</b> thicknesses of 600 µm and 100 µm deposited on 16 MnCr 5 steel substrates in the unhardened, quenched and tempered, and case-hardened states with hardness values of 190 HB, 400 HB and 5862 HRc, respectively. The endurable Hertz pressur es of the coated specimens were benchmarked against uncoated case-hardened 16 MnCr 5 steel. The failed coatings and coating damages before failure were thoroughly studied by optical and SEM microscopy. The highest durability was realised for a coating thickness of 600 µm through the use of the quenched and tempered substrate (about 130 % of the benchmark). Coatings on these substrates showed a minimal amount of micropits and no other damage such as large cracks after testing. It can be assumed that differences in specimen preparation by grit blasting prior to spraying and different substrate strengths were responsible for the different results for the coated unhardened, quenched and tempered, and case-hardened substrates. The durability for a coating thickness of 600 µm was higher than for a coating thickness of 100 µm when unhardened and case-hardened substrates were used. Further improvements in the rolling contact fatigue behaviour could be achieved by optimisation of the combination of coating thickness and substrate strength and by use of other WC-based coatings...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of magnetron sputtered carbon nitride coatings suitable for roller bearing components. The research field of tribology of bearings focuses on minimizing friction between components by improving the lubricants. The development of lubricants is, however, expensive and involves environmentally deleterious chemical byproducts. A solution to avoid such harmful conditions, reduce the processing cost, and more importantly, minimize the friction, is to apply a low-friction and wear-resistant coating {{on the surface of}} the bearing. The deposition of such coatings on components can substantially increase their lifetime, reduce the maintenance costs, and eventually increase the reliability of the machinery. Carbon nitride (CNx) coatings have high resiliency and can withstand the demanding conditions of bearing operation. The morphology of CNx coatings is highly affected by applying a negative substrate bias voltage. At high bias (100 - 120 V), the coatings become denser and more homogeneous with decreased porosity, resulting in more wear-resistant materials. I also found that the duty cycle of the applied bias affects the layer morphology. Less homogeneous films are produced using lower duty cycles (i. e., in high power impulse magnetron sputtering, HiPIMS) for a specific value of bias voltage. Thus, changing bias voltage, we can manipulate the structure of CNx and design layers, depending on the requirements of the bearing application. My results show that denser films yield higher hardness and wear-resistance, but also higher compressive stress, which is a disadvantage for the coating-substrate adhesion. In order to obtain improved adhesion on bearing steel, we developed an in-situ surface treatment, prior to the CNx deposition, which also surpasses the limitations set by the properties of each material. The steel substrates are successfully pretreated using W or Cr ions originating from a HiPIMS source. Plasma ions are accelerated to the substrates with energies of 900 eV, due to the application of a synchronized high bias voltage, which clean effectively the substrate surface from residual contaminants and strengthen the interfacial bonding. CNx-coated rollers are tested in rolling operation and show the absence of run-in period in all lubrication regimes. This is a big advantage for applications which rotate under boundary lubrication (BL). The <b>coated</b> <b>rollers</b> yield friction coefficients in the range of 0 : 020 and 0 : 025 in elastohydrodynamic (EHDL) and hydrodynamic (HDL) lubrication regimes, being lower than the friction coefficients of 0 : 026 - 0 : 052, exhibited by the uncoated rollers. Here, friction decreases steadily with increasing number of cycles, due to the presence of CNx in the contact. In BL, CNx-coated rollers present an increased friction coefficient of 0 : 052, but the wear is much lower than in the case of uncoated rollers. All rollers are covered with CNx in the wear tracks after the tests, avoiding failures and presenting low abrasive wear. The obtained tribological performance of the CNx-coated rollers in rolling is overall improved compared to the established operation of uncoated rollers. Thus, CNx layers can function as low-friction and wear-resistant coatings protecting the steel components in several roller bearing applications, such as in gearboxes and wheels in automotive, aerospace, marine, and turbine industry...|$|R
