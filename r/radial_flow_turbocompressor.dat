For the amount of <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> in intermediate energies seen experimentally, the main influence of the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> on observables can be incorporated by a displacement in the $E^*/A$ (the excitation energy per nucleon) axis.

40|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>flow</b> {{chromatography}} can be {{a solution}} for scaling up a packed bed chromatographic process to larger processing volumes. In this study we compared axial and <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> affinity chromatography both experimentally and theoretically. We used an axial flow column and a miniaturized <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> column with a ratio of 1. 8 between outer and inner surface area, both with a bed height of 5 cm. The columns were packed with affinity resin to adsorb BSA. The average velocity in the columns was set equal. No difference in performance between the two columns could be observed. To gain more insight into {{the design of a}} <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> column, the velocity profile and resin distribution in the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> column were calculated. Using mathematical models we found that the breakthrough performance of <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> chromatography is very similar to axial flow when the ratio between outer and inner radius of the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> column is around 2. When this ratio is increased, differences become more apparent, but remain small. However, the ratio does have a significant influence on the velocity profile inside the resin bed, which directly influences the pressure drop and potentially resin compression, especially at higher values for this ratio. The choice between axial and <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> will be based on cost price, footprint and packing characteristics. For small-scale processes, axial flow chromatography is probably the best choice, for resin volumes of at least several tens of litres, <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> chromatography may be preferable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> in a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blade root region. The <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> is analyzed in the potential flow and viscous flow regions. An experiment carried out by means of stereo Particle Image Velocimetry to measure the velocity field produced by a HAWT blade. While the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> in the potential flow region {{was obtained from the}} measurements, the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> in the boundary layer was derived from CFD. By the direct observations obtained from the experiment, an insight is gained {{about the nature of the}} <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> in the suction side of the blade as well as in the near wake. An outboard <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> motion is observed in the root region. This tendency of the flow changes dramatically when it reaches the maximum chord position of the blade, where the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> moves inboard. The trace of the viscous region due to merging of the boundary layers and trailing vorticity are observed clearly in the radial velocity and vorticity distributions at 135 º azimuth angle of the blade. In the viscous <b>flow</b> region the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> is more pronounced than in the potential flow region.

40|$|International audienceThe gross melt {{fracture}} defect {{is related}} to the flow instabilities developed in the contraction region. To mitigate these upstream instabilities, a convergent <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> in the die entrance has been created. In fact, the ultimate objective of the present work is to examine the effect of the clearance width of <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> on the appearance and development of gross melt fracture defect. So, capillary rheometer experiments were performed with linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil. As for the influence of <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> width on the morphology of gross melt fracture defect, extrudate photographs show that this imperfection can be mitigated since its frequency is higher and amplitude smaller when the gap of <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> decreases. Such results may be related both to shear and elongational components of <b>radial</b> <b>flow.</b> Actually, when gap width is very small compared to the external diameter of <b>radial</b> <b>flow,</b> shear deformations become more enhanced with respect to the elongational deformations and thus the helical gross melt fracture becomes more like a surface defect than volume defect...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} by Palmisano, Gillam and Blackburn (2000) found that adding coherent perspective jitter to constant velocity <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> improved visually induced illusions of self-motion (known as vection). This was a surprising finding, because unlike pure <b>radial</b> <b>flow,</b> this jittering <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> should have generated sustained visual-vestibular conflicts - previously thought to always reduce/impair vection. The current experiments attempted {{to ascertain the}} essential stimulus features for this jitter advantage for vection by examining three novel types of jitter display. While adding incoherent jitter to <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> was found to impair vection, adding coherent non-perspective jitter {{had little effect on}} this subjective experience (contrary to the notion that jitter improves vection by reducing adaptation to <b>radial</b> <b>flow).</b> Importantly, we found that coherent perspective jitter not only improves the vection induced by <b>radial</b> <b>flow,</b> but it also appears to induce modest vection by itself (demonstrating that vection can still occur when there is an extreme mismatch between actual and expected vestibular activity). These results suggest that the previously demonstrated advantage for coherent perspective jitter was due (in part at least) to jittering vection combining with forwards vection in depth to produce a more compelling overall vection experience...|$|R

Produced particles are assumed to acquire <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> and be of non-extensive statistics at freeze-out. J/psi and the particles containing strangeness were examined separately to study their <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> and freeze-out. We found that the strange hadrons approach equilibrium quickly from peripheral to central A+A collisions {{and they tend to}} decouple earlier from the system than the light hadrons but with the same final <b>radial</b> <b>flow.</b> These results provide an alternative picture of freeze-outs: a thermalized system is produced at partonic phase; the hadronic scattering at later stage is not enough to maintain the system in equilibrium and does not increase the <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> of the copiously produced light hadrons. The J/psi in Pb+Pb collisions at SPS is consistent with early decoupling and obtains little <b>radial</b> <b>flow.</b> The J/psi spectra at RHIC are also inconsistent with the bulk flow profile.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{collective}} motion of kaons in heavy ion reactions at SIS energies (about 1 - 2 GeV/nucleon). A <b>radial</b> collective <b>flow</b> of $K^+$ mesons {{is predicted to}} exist in central Au + Au collisions, which manifests in a characteristic "shoulder-arm" shape of the transverse mass spectrum of the midrapidity $K^+$ mesons. The $K^+$ <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> arises from the repulsive $K^+$ mean field in nuclear matter. In spite of a strong reabsorption and rescattering the attractive $K^-$ mean field leads as well to a collective <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> of $K^-$ mesons. The $K^-$ <b>radial</b> <b>flow,</b> however, {{is different from that}} of $K^+$ mesons and can be observed by a characteristic "concave" structure of the transverse mass spectrum of the $K^-$ mesons emitted at midrapidity. The kaon <b>radial</b> <b>flows</b> can therefore serve as a novel tool for the investigation of kaon properties in dense nuclear matter.

40|$|Permeability {{estimation}} {{in tight}} and shale reservoirs is challenging because {{little or no}} flow will occur without hydraulic fracture stimulation. In the pressure falloff following a fracture calibration test (FCT), <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> after the fracture closure {{can be used to}} estimate the reservoir permeability. However, for very low permeability, the time to reach <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> can exceed any practical duration. This study shows how to use the reservoir pressure to estimate the maximum reservoir permeability when <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> is missing in the after-closure response. The approach is straightforward and can also be used for buildup tests. It applies whenever the well completion geometry permits <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> before the pressure response encounters a real well drainage limits. Recent developments have blurred the boundary between fracture calibration test analysis and classic pressure transient analysis. Adapting the log-log diagnostic plot representation to the FCT analysis has made it possible to perform before and after closure analysis on the same diagnostic plot. This paper also proposes a method for diagnosing abnormal leakoff behavior using the log-log diagnostic plot as an alternative method for the traditional G-function plot. The results show the relationship between reservoir permeability and pressure can be used effectively for both estimation of the permeability upper bound when there is no apparent <b>radial</b> <b>flow</b> and for confirming the permeability estimated from apparent late time <b>radial</b> <b>flow.</b> Numerous field examples illustrate this simple and powerful insight...|$|R
