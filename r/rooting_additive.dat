Finally, the detection and removal of a number of additive outliers, all of them related to different periods of military conflict, appears to be vital in obtaining these results.

The five generations were grown under both corn rootworm infested and noninfested environments. Data were obtained for the characters vertical-pulling resistance, root system size, root angle, number of brace roots, secondary roots, and corn rootworm damage rating. ^ Significant, positive correlations {{were found between the}} parental lines, both in the presence and absence of corn rootworms, with their F 1 hybrids in the presence of corn rootworms for vertical-pulling resistance and the number of brace roots. No significant correlation was found between the parental lines and their F 12 ̆ 7 s for the other traits under study. ^ Significant, positive correlations were found between vertical-pull and the number of brace roots and also between vertical-pull with root system size. A significant negative correlation was found between vertical-pull and corn rootworm damage rating. ^ Mather and Jinks 2 ̆ 7 (1971) generation means analysis was used to estimate the cumulative additive, dominance, additive x additive, additive x dominance and dominance x dominance genetic effects. Dominance was the most important effect for vertical-pulling resistance, root system size, and number of brace <b>roots.</b> <b>Additive</b> and dominance effects were approximately equal for root angle and secondary roots.

Linear combination is more valid if the constituents can be related to the quality value through a linear regression. While combining different artifacts through a linear relation, different artifacts can be given different significance. For example, more weight is given to the impact of bitstream layer features than to media-layer features in the hybrid model given in[194].

40|$|The key {{to plant}} {{survival}} under NaCl salt stress is maintaining a low Na(+) level or Na(+) /K(+) ratio in the cells. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs, F(2 : 9)) {{derived from a}} cross between the salt-tolerant japonica rice variety Jiucaiqing and the salt-sensitive indica variety IR 26, {{was used to determine}} Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in the roots and shoots under three different NaCl stress conditions (0, 100 and 120 mM NaCl). A total of nine additive QTLs were identified by QTL Cartographer program using single-environment phenotypic values, whereas eight additive QTLs were identified by QTL IciMapping program. Among these additive QTLs, five were identified by both programs. Epistatic QTLs and QTL-by-environment interactions were detected by QTLNetwork program in the joint analyses of multi-environment phenotypic values, and one additive QTL and nine epistatic QTLs were identified. There were three epistatic QTLs identified for Na(+) in <b>roots</b> (RNC), three <b>additive</b> QTLs and two epistatic QTLs identified for Na(+) in shoots (SNC), four additive QTLs identified for K(+) in <b>roots</b> (RKC), four <b>additive</b> QTLs and three epistatic QTLs identified for K(+) in shoots (SKC) and one additive QTL and one epistatic QTL for salt tolerance rating (STR). The phenotypic variation explained by each additive, epistatic QTL and QTL×environment interaction ranged from 8. 5 to 18. 9 %, 0. 5 to 5. 3 % and 0. 7 to 7. 5 %, respectively. By comparing the chromosomal positions of these additive QTLs with those previously identified, five additive QTLs, qSNC 9, qSKC 1, qSKC 9, qRKC 4 and qSTR 7, might represent novel salt tolerance loci. The identification of salt tolerance in selected RILs showed that a major QTL qSNC 11 {{played a significant role in}} rice salt tolerance, and could be used to improve salt tolerance of commercial rice varieties with marker-assisted selection (MAS) approach...|$|R
40|$|Frequently, {{seasonal}} and non-seasonal data (especially macro time series) {{are observed}} with noise. For instance, the time series can have irregular abrupt changes and interruptions following {{as a result}} of additive or temporary change outliers caused by external circumstances which are irrelevant for the series of interest. Equally, the time series can have measurement errors. In this paper we analyse the above types of data irregularities on the behaviour of seasonal unit root tests. It occurs that in most cases outliers and measurement errors can seriously affect inference towards the rejection of seasonal unit roots. It is shown how the distortion of the tests will depend upon the frequency, magnitude, and persistence of the outliers {{as well as on the}} signal to noise ratio associated with measurement errors. Some solutions to the implied inference problems are suggested. Seasonal unit <b>roots,</b> HEGY tests, <b>additive</b> outliers, measurement errors, Brownian motion...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the response of root turnover to a changing climate is needed to predict growth and produce carbon cycle models. A soil warming system and shading were used to vary soil temperature and received radiation independently in a temperate grassland dominated by Holcus lanatus L. Minirhizotrons allowed root growth and turnover to be examined non-destructively. In two short-term (8 week) experiments, root responses to temperature were seasonally distinct. Root number increased when heating was applied during spring, but root death increased during autumnal heating. An experiment lasting 12 months demonstrated that any positive response to temperature was short-lived and that over a full growing season, soil warming led {{to a reduction in}} root number and mass due to increased root death during autumn and winter. Root respiration was also insensitive to soil temperature over much of the year. In contrast, root growth was strongly affected by incident radiation. Root biomass, length, birth rate, number and turnover were all reduced by shading. Photosynthesis in H. lanatus exhibited some acclimation to shading, but assimilation rates at growth irradiance were still lower in shaded plants. The negative effects of shading and soil warming on <b>roots</b> were <b>additive.</b> Comparison of <b>root</b> data with environmental measurements demonstrated a number of positive relationships with photosynthetically active radiation, but not with soil temperature. This was true both across the entire data set and within a shade treatment. These results demonstrate that root growth is unlikely to be directly affected by increased soil temperatures as a result of global warming, at least in temperate areas, and that predictions of net primary productivity should not be based on a positive root growth response to temperature...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{associations}} with root microbes represent {{some of the}} most important symbioses on earth. While often critically promoting plant fitness, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) also demand significant carbohydrate allocation in exchange for key nutrients. Though plants may often compensate for carbon loss, constraints may arise under light limitation when plants cannot extensively increase photosynthesis. Under such conditions, costs for maintaining symbioses may outweigh benefits, turning mutualist microbes into parasites, resulting in reduced plant growth and reproduction. In natural systems plants commonly grow with different symbionts simultaneously which again may interact with each other. This might add complexity to the responses of such multipartite relationships. We experimented with lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), which efficiently forms {{associations with}} both types of root symbionts. We applied full light and low-light to each of four treatments of microbial inoculation. After an incubation period of 14 weeks, we quantified vegetative aboveground and belowground biomass and number and viability of seeds to determine effects of combined inoculant and light treatment on plant fitness. Under light-limited conditions, vegetative and reproductive traits were inhibited in AMF and rhizobia inoculated lima bean plants relative to controls (un-colonized plants). Strikingly, reductions in seed production were most critical in combined treatments with rhizobia x AMF. Our findings suggest microbial <b>root</b> symbionts create <b>additive</b> costs resulting in decreased plant fitness under light-limited conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: There is {{no doubt}} that the {{dramatic}} worldwide increase in obesity prevalence is due to changes in environmental factors. However, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for the major part of the variation in body mass index (BMI) and other measures of body fatness within populations. Several recent studies suggest that the genetic effects on adiposity may be stronger when combined with presumed risk factors for obesity. We tested the hypothesis that a higher prevalence of obesity and overweight and a higher BMI mean is associated with a larger genetic variation in BMI. Methods: The data consisted of self-reported height and weight from two Danish twin surveys in 1994 and 2002. A total of 15, 017 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were divided into subgroups by year of birth (from 1931 through 1982) and sex. The genetic and environmental variance components of BMI were calculated for each subgroup using the classical twin design. Likewise, the prevalence of obesity, prevalence of overweight and the mean of the BMI distribution was calculated for each subgroup and tested as explanatory variables in a random effects meta-regression model with the square <b>root</b> of the <b>additive</b> genetic variance (equal to the standard deviation) as the dependent variable. Results: The size of additive genetic variation was positively and significantly associated with obesity prevalence (p = 0. 001) and the mean of the BMI distribution (p = 0. 015). The association with prevalence of overweight was positive but no...|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{availability}} and salinity {{of the soil}} affect growth and development of plant roots. Here, we describe how phosphate availability affects root system architecture (RSA) of Arabidopsis and how phosphate levels modulate responses of the root to salt stress. Phosphate (Pi) starvation reduced main root length and {{increased the number of}} lateral roots of Arabidopsis Col- 0 seedlings. In combination with salt, low Pi dampened the inhibiting effect of mild salt stress (75 mM) on all measured RSA components. At higher NaCl concentrations, the Pi deprivation response prevailed over the salt stress only for lateral root elongation. The Pi deprivation response of lateral roots appeared to be oppositely affected by abscisic acid (ABA) signaling compared to the salt stress response. Natural variation in the response to the combination treatment of salt and Pi starvation within 330 Arabidopsis accessions could be grouped into four response patterns. When exposed to double stress, in general lateral roots prioritized responses to salt, while the effect on main <b>root</b> traits was <b>additive.</b> Interestingly, these patterns were not identical for all accessions studied and multiple strategies to integrate the signals from Pi deprivation and salinity were identified. By Genome Wide Association Mapping (GWAS) 13 genomic loci were identified as putative factors integrating responses to salt stress and Pi starvation. From our experiments, we conclude that Pi starvation interferes with salt responses mainly at the level of lateral roots and that large natural variation exists in the available genetic repertoire of accessions to handle the combination of stresses...|$|R
40|$|Striga weeds {{constitute}} a significant bottleneck to profitable maize (Zea mays L) production and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Annual yield loss from Striga infestation of African crops {{has been estimated}} at US $ 7 billion in the savannah region of Africa alone. Genetic resistance in host plant {{is central to the}} success of integrated control measures for minimizing the menace of Striga. However, breeding for Striga resistance in maize has proved elusive for decades. This is due to paucity of resistance sources with known mechanisms of resistance in cultivated maize, perhaps because maize did not co-evolve with Striga; as maize is not an African crop. Decades of effort on Striga research at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Ibadan, has recently led to successful release and registration of Striga resistance maize inbred lines from diverse genetic background. The mechanisms and quantitative trait loci governing resistance to Striga in these germplasm have not been known. Discovering the underlying resistance mechanisms requires an in-vitro system, which can reveal the hidden interactions between parasite and host roots normally concealled in the soil. ^ In this study, we developed a new in-vitro screening technique which we have dubbed the Sand Packed Titer Plate Assay (SPTPA). We used this assay to evaluate 20 Striga resistant maize inbred lines for reactions to Striga post germination infections. These 20 maize inbred lines consisted of 5 lines each from 4 different populations that were sources of resistance. We observed different levels of incompatible response to Striga infection among these maize inbred lines. Resistance manifested as significantly fewer attachments of pre-germinated Striga seeds on the roots of resistant lines, in addition to delayed parasitic development and higher mortality of attached parasites. Striga on the susceptible inbred usually penetrated the xylem and showed substantial internal haustorial development. Haustorial ingress on the resistant inbred was often stopped at the endodermis. Parasites able to reach resistant host xylem vessels showed diminished haustorial development relative to those invading susceptible roots. ^ Putative resistant maize inbred lines differed significantly in their ability to cause arrested parasite growth, delayed parasitic development, and death of Striga seedlings that attached to their roots. Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the maize inbred lines into three groups, based on differences in Striga development on infested host roots. Further assessment of grouping of the lines using canonical analysis also separated the lines into three distinct groups. The first canonical variate which accounted for 93 % of the variance clearly distinguished the three clusters. Cluster 1 exhibited the strongest level of incompatible response to Striga parasitism, causing arrested parasitic growth and death of parasite that attached to their roots. ^ The same 20 Striga resistant maize inbred lines were genotyped with simple sequence repeat markers to assess the genetic diversity present within this diverse germplasm. A total of 352 allelic fragments were obtained, with average gene diversity value of 0. 78, ranging from 0. 44 to 0. 94. Cluster and principal component analyses reflect mixed composition of genetic background during development of these inbred lines. Genotypic distance matrix showed some degree of resemblance to dendrogram topologies based on incompatible response to Striga infestation previously reported. However, no significant correlation was found between the two distance matrices. ^ To identify genomic regions that confer resistance to Striga parasitism, an F 2 mapping population from a cross between the susceptible (5057) and resistant (ZD 05) maize inbred lines were evaluated for their responses to Striga infestation. Composite interval mapping located two putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 6 of maize linkage group that governs incompatible response to Striga parasitism. These QTL accounted for 55 % of observed phenotypic variation for incompatible response to Striga infestation on host <b>roots.</b> Both <b>additive</b> and dominance genetic effects were important for resistance to Striga. However, there appear to be a preponderance of dominance genetic effects over additive genetic effect for the expression of these two major Striga resistance QTL. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the genetics and genetic variation of maize resistance to Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (rootworm). Rootworm resistance is a complex, multi-trait characteristic with inheritance mechanisms not fully understood or explained. In {{order to better}} understand the mechanisms of rootworm resistance and the genetic parameters that condition this trait, three studies were undertaken. The first study examined the genetic variation of components of resistance in twenty-three DEKALB Genetics Corporation hybrids. They were assessed for hydroxamic acid content under uniform greenhouse conditions and compared with field assessments over two growing seasons for resistance to the Western Corn Rootworm in terms of root pull resistance, root damage ratings and root lodging. Hydroxamic acid levels of all hybrids were found to be moderately low resulting in low antibiosis. It appears that rootworm resistance in these hybrids is achieved mainly through tolerance, not antibiosis. The study suggests an opportunity for improvement of resistance in commercial inbreds through selection for antibiosis and hydroxamic acid content. In the second study, the combining ability, additive and dominance effects and the heritability of several traits important to rootworm resistance in maize were determined. GCA and SCA effects were found to be significant in the inheritance of hydroxamate content, root weight and plant height. GCA effects were found to be significant in relation to low root damage ratings. Heritability in a narrow sense as determined by the midparent/offspring regression was found to be 0. 34 for hydroxamate content, 0. 26 for root damage ratings and 0. 35 for plant height. Additive genetic effects were found to be significant in the inheritance of root damage ratings, both additive and dominance effects contribute to the inheritance of plant height and dominance effects were found to be most important in the expression of root weight. In the third study, two inbred lines were used to develop an F 2 :F 3 population to further investigate the genetic parameters governing some of the traits important to rootworm resistance. The inbred lines used were 93 n 445 (susceptible) and 118. 31 (resistant). Dominance effects were found to be significant in the inheritance of plant height, additive effects were found to be significant in the inheritance of <b>root</b> size and <b>additive</b> and dominance effects were found to be significant in the inheritance of root damage ratings. Heritability in a narrow sense was found to be 54 % for root size, 55 % for root damage ratings, 84. 7 % for stalk circumference and 89 % for plant height for the inbreds used in this study.
