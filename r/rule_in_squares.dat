It had been retrieved by French spy and cleaning lady Marie Bastian from the waste paper basket of the military attache at the German Embassy, Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen.

But now he adds and saith, that both in length and breadth and in height she is equal. Wherefore in that he adds at last a squareness of height to her squareness of length and breadth; and also in that he adds it not before he had told us of the measure of her portions, he would have us to understand that as the <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> which this city shall walk shall be complete, and as her obedience to that rule shall be complete, so her enjoyment of God and his grace at that day shall be proportionable also.

Wherefore the prophet in the vision of the measures of the portions doth observe that there was a squareness in them, as well as in their ordinances and obedience: and hence it is that he tells us that every little chamber was one reed broad and one reed long (Eze 40:7).

2500|$|Tile {{is a thin}} modular stone unit, {{commonly}} 12 <b>in.</b> <b>square</b> (30.5cm) and 3/8 in. (10mm) deep. [...] Other popular {{sizes are}} 15 <b>in.</b> <b>square</b> (38cm), 18 <b>in.</b> <b>square</b> (46cm), and 24 <b>in.</b> <b>square</b> (61cm); these will usually be deeper than the 12 <b>in.</b> <b>square.</b> The majority of tile has a polished finish, but other finishes such as honed are becoming more common. Almost all stone tile is mass-produced by automated tile lines to identical size, finish, and close tolerances. Exceptions include slate flooring tile and special orders: tile with odd sizes or shapes, unusual finishes, or inlay work. [...] In summary, the automated tile line is a complicated complex of cutting and calibrating machines, honing-polishing machines, edging machines that put on flat or rounded edges, and interconnecting conveyors to move the stone from the slab input to the final tile product. The stone for tiles is most commonly marble, but often is granite, and sometimes limestone, slate, or quartz-based stone. [...] Common colors are white and light earth colors. Much of the stone for this application is produced in Italy and China.|$|R

Using data from a Monte Carlo simulation, this study found that squared regression structure coefficients corrected with Pratt’s formula produced less biased estimates and might be more accurate and stable estimates of population squared regression structure coefficients than estimates with no such corrections. While our findings are in line with prior literature that identified multicollinearity as a predictor of bias <b>in</b> <b>squared</b> regression structure coefficients but not coefficients of determination, the findings from this study are unique in that the level of predictive power, number of predictors, and sample size were also observed to contribute bias <b>in</b> <b>squared</b> regression structure coefficients...|$|R
