50|$|Synaptogenesis is the {{formation}} of a synapse and in this case the Neuromuscular Junction is of interest. In this section, {{the focus is on the}} development of the NMJ from the outgrowth of axons during development. As mentioned in the development section, Schwann cell precursors accompany growing axons as they reach their associated muscles. It is now known that these PSC precursors are not essential to axonal growth, but when present they guide growth cones and help with the maintenance of NMJs after they are formed. After the initial nervous-muscle interface is formed, there is a striking growth in the number of PSCs at each newly developed NMJ. If, however, there is a lack of PSCs (for example in an ablated model) once the NMJ is formed, there is a lack of further axonal growth or even a retraction of axons can be observed. This is seen in a study on frog NMJs 8 and 12 days after ablation where there was a 44% <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> by the 12th day with no PSCs. This retraction shows that PSCs are not essential for the growth of axons, but are essential for the long-term maintenance of NMJs.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis {{is to increase the}} understanding of the human running gait. The understanding of the human running gait is essential for the development of devices, such as prostheses and orthoses, that enable disabled people to run or that enable able people to increase their running performance. Although these devices are currently being developed, there is not much insight yet in the fundamentals of the running gait. This fundamental knowledge is required for improving these devices. One of the big unknowns is how these devices affect the ability of the user to handle disturbances, like sudden pushes or variations in floor height. To gain insight in the fundamentals of the human running gait and the disturbance rejection behavior in particular, the gait synthesis approach is taken. In this approach, the running gait is studied by synthesizing the human running on simulation models and on robots. This allows studying the effects of specific system parameters in a simplified and controlled environment. A number of simulation models and a physical running robot have been developed. The simulation models vary in complexity, from simple simulation models based on the well-known spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model to simulation models that closely resemble the physical running robot. The simple simulation models are useful to get fundamental insights, due to their simple dynamics. The results of the simple models are validated with the more realistic models and physical running robot. This thesis focuses on the effect of three important system parameters on the disturbance rejection behavior. These three parameters are: the leg stiffness profile, the location of the center-of-mass, and the swing-leg <b>retraction</b> <b>rate.</b> These three parameters were selected, based on our experience with walking robots. The research in this thesis shows that the effects of these parameters are the following. The leg stiffness profile has a significant influence on the disturbance rejection behavior. For a simple running model, we show that nonlinear leg springs can improve the disturbance rejection up to a factor 7 compared to the optimal linear leg spring. The optimal leg stiffness profile for the maximal disturbance rejection behavior is strongly nonlinear. These results show that the generally used linear leg springs are far from optimal in terms of disturbance rejection behavior. The location of the center-of-mass of the torso also has a large influence on the disturbance rejection. The optimal center-of-mass location depends on the type of the expected disturbance, which is above the hip for floor height disturbances and below the hip for push disturbances on the center-of-mass. The commonly used center-of-mass location at the hip is far from optimal. An offset of the center-of-mass location can increase the disturbance rejection up to a factor 10 compared to the center-of-mass at the hip. The swing-leg <b>retraction</b> <b>rate,</b> the speed of the backwards rotation of the front leg prior to touchdown, affects the disturbance rejection rate. We show that this effect is maximal at a mild <b>retraction</b> <b>rate,</b> which is much lower than the <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> for ground speed matching. The optimal <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with increasing running velocity. Besides improving disturbance rejection, swing-leg retraction can also reduce energetic losses, impact forces, and the risk of slipping. However, we show that all of the benefits of swing-leg retraction occur at different retraction rates, which indicates that there is an inherent tradeoff to consider when selecting the <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> for a robot control system. In addition, the effect of the <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> on these benefits is strongly model and/or parameter dependent, making it difficult to make general rules on how to select the <b>retraction</b> <b>rate.</b> Besides the above-mentioned results, this research also revealed the following insights. Firstly, not all results from simple running model studies transfer well to more realistic models and robots. This is especially the case for studies on effects that involve impact dynamics, as impact dynamics greatly depend on the leg morphology. Secondly, the gait sensitivity norm, the disturbance rejection measured introduced by Hobbelen for walking systems, is also suitable for running systems. Finally, the implementation of a spring in parallel with the actuator in the knee joint can greatly reduce the required actuator torque and power. Overall, the results of this thesis show that there are many opportunities to improve the disturbance rejection performance of bipedal running robots. This can be done either by mechanical changes to the robotics system, e. g. implementing a nonlinear leg spring or placing the center-of-mass away from the hip, or by changes to the controller, e. g. implementing swing-leg retraction. The results of this thesis also point out promising directions for the development of better running orthoses and prostheses. Most promising is the implementation of nonlinear springs in exoskeletons, because the results show a large improvement in the disturbance rejection behavior and because nonlinear springs are relatively easy to implement in exoskeletons.

Six different urogynecology synthetic graft types, after scan electronic microscope analysis, were used for the reparation of abdominal wall defect in Wister rats. After three and six weeks the influence of graft structure on tissue integration and retraction was compared. Largest pores were recorded in the multifilament with polyglactine group (1. 06 mm 2) compared to the almost ten times smaller pores in the monofilament collagen coated group (0. 08 mm 2).

40|$|In the {{as-deposited}} state, {{thin films}} are generally far from equilibrium and will agglomerate or dewet to form arrays of islands when sufficient atomic motion is allowed. Dewetting can occur {{well below the}} films' melting temperature in the solid-state. The dewetting process begins by formation and motion of film-substrate-vapor three-phase boundaries. These film edges retract via capillarity-driven mass transport. In the absence of film or substrate patterning, the dewetting morphology of polycrystalline films is not well ordered. However, dewetting in single crystal films leads to a much more regular morphology, due to surface and interfacial energy anisotropy and surface self-diffusivity anisotropy. When dewetting of such films is templated by pre-patterning, dewetting patterns {{much smaller than the}} original template patterns can be generated. This makes templated dewetting a potential self-assembly method for generation of complex structures with sub-lithographic length scales. However, control of such patterns in single crystal films requires a significant degree of quantitative understanding of anisotropic dewetting in the solid-state. As a starting point for quantitative research on solid-state dewetting of single crystal films, dewetting of thin single crystal films that were pre-patterned to have edges with specific in-plane orientations were quantitatively characterized and their observed behavior was modeled. Edges aligned to specific crystallographic orientations remain straight as they retract, while edges with other crystallographic orientations develop in-plane facets composed of kinetically stable edges. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the retraction of kinetically stable edges can {{serve as the basis for}} understanding the retraction of edges with all other orientations. Measurements of the rates of retraction of kinetically stable edges for single crystal (100) and (110) Ni films on single crystal MgO are reported. In cross section, the retracting edges develop out-of-plane facets that are generally consistent with the facets expected from the equilibrium Wulff shape. To capture the observed anisotropic character of the edge <b>retraction</b> <b>rate,</b> capillarity-driven edge retraction through atomic surface self-diffusion was modeled in 2 dimensions using the crystalline formulation method developed by Carter and coworkers. The model and experiments show a similar time scaling for the edge retraction distance. Also, the magnitudes of the predicted retraction rates are consistent with the specific observed <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> anisotropy given the large range of error in parameters used in the model. Other possible sources of error include the fact that actual edges are not fully facetted and are sometimes bound by non-equilibrium facets. by Gye Hyun Kim. Thesis (S. M.)

The morphology evolution of thin films {{is governed by}} surface diffusion and contact line migration. The mathematical model {{is based on an}} energy variational approach. Anisotropic surface energies lead to multiple solutions of the contact angle equation at contact points. Introduction of a finite contact point mobility is both physically based and leads to robust, unambiguous determination of the contact angles. We implement the mathematical model in an explicit finite difference scheme with cubic spline interpolation for evolving marker points. Following validation of the mathematical and numerical approaches, we simulate the evolution of thin film islands, semi-infinite films, and films with holes as a function of film dimensions, Young's angle θ_i, anisotropy strength and crystal symmetry, and film crystal orientation relative to the substrate normal. We find that the contact point <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> can be well described by a power-law, l ∼ t^n. Our results demonstrate that the exponent n is not universal [...] it is sensitive to the Young's angle θ_i (and insensitive to anisotropy). In addition to classical wetting (where holes in a film heal) and dewetting (where holes in a film grow), we observe cases where a hole through the film heals but leave a finite size hole/bubble between the continuous film and substrate or where the hole heals leaving a continuous film that is not bonded to the substrate. Surface energy anisotropy (i) increases the instability that leads to island break-up into multiple islands, (ii) enhances hole healing, and (iii) leads to finite island size even under some conditions where the Young's angle θ_i suggests that the film wets the substrate.

The dynamics of such multiphase systems {{is of interest}} in areas that include the petroleum, pharmaceutical, biomedical and food industries. The {{focus is on the}} role that a surfactant monolayer on the drop interface plays during the deformation and retraction processes. The steady-state characteristics and the bulk flow are analyzed for validation. The transient processes are simulated using an axisymmetric boundary integral method. At each time step the shape of the drop is determined based on the velocity of points at the interface and surfactant is redistributed accordingly. The response time of drop deformation in an extensional flow was seen to depend monotonically on the initial surfactant coverage on the interface. That is, higher surfactant coverage leads to increasing values of response time. It was seen that Marangoni stresses developing on the interface due to surface tension gradients slow the response of the drop. Retraction of the drop when the external flow ceases is caused by an imbalance between the traction along the drop's interface and the shear stresses. Neglecting the initial stages, the retraction process can be closely approximated by an exponential decay. It was shown that the retraction time depends non-monotonically on the surfactant coverage. Small amounts of surfactant slow down the retraction process compared to that of the clean drop for coverage less than 50 %. Further increasing the surfactant concentration accelerates the retraction process and as the coverage approaches 100 %, the value of the retraction time approaches that of the clean drop. These dynamics emerge from the competition between the convective flux that creates the surfactant gradients and the large Marangoni stresses that develop to oppose them during the extension process. At low to intermediate surfactant concentrations, large surfactant gradients developed during the deformation process persist until equilibrium is reached because diffusion time is much longer than the <b>retraction</b> <b>rate.</b> At higher initial surfactant concentrations, lower surfactant gradients develop during deformation and these quickly vanish during the initial stages of retraction leading to a nearly uniform surface tension distribution along the interface...|$|E
40|$|Solid-state {{dewetting}} of {{thin films}} {{is a process}} through which continuous solid films agglomerate to form islands. This process is driven by capillary forces, often occurring via surface self-diffusion. Solid-state dewetting of single crystal films {{has the potential to}} produce a wide range of regular structures because it occurs in ways controlled by crystallographic symmetries in single crystal films. We demonstrate this potential by pursuing two major objectives: understanding the underlying physics of regular morphological evolution during dewetting of single crystal films, and guiding the phenomenon to reproducibly produce regular structures with various morphologies. We used single crystal Ni films grown on single crystal MgO substrates as a model system. Dewetting initiates with the nucleation of holes and proceeds through the retraction of film edges around holes. By analyzing the anisotropy of the edge <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> and facet morphologies, we show that the effect of the anisotropy of surface energy and surface diffusion on early-stage dewetting morphologies strongly depends on the initial film orientation and annealing ambient. A series of instabilities increases the complexity of morphological evolution in the latter stages of dewetting. These include inplane faceting of retracting edges, accelerated growth at concave corners, edge drag at convex corners, edge pinch-off, and Rayleigh-like instabilities. Clear identification of these instabilities leads to improved understandings of the kinetic mechanisms that govern the formation of complex dewetting morphologies. We also demonstrate that solid-state dewetting can be used to produce regular structures with specific shapes via dewetting of patches patterned from single crystal films. Initial patches were systematically designed {{on the basis of the}} dewetting mechanisms to form a variety of specific morphologies. Morphological evolution of these patches occurs in more deterministic ways because of geometric constraints, and leads to the formation of regular structures with smaller sizes and more complex shapes than the initial patches. by Jongpil Ye.

40|$|The {{process of}} cell {{motility}} involves repeated cycles of protrusion and adhesion formation at the front, cell body translocation, and retraction at the rear. The regulation {{of these events}} with each other is essential for maintaining cell movement. In the fish epithelial keratocyte when protrusion {{at the front of}} the cell occurs without retraction at the rear, forward movement is impeded and slows motility rate. Thus, retraction becomes the rate-limiting step of keratocyte movement. Keratocyte, however, possess an interesting mechano-chemical signaling mechanism that involves the activation of stretch-activated calcium channels (SACS) in response to increasing cytoskeletal tension that occurs when retraction fails. The subsequent influx of calcium leads to a transient elevate of [Ca 2 +]i that triggers retraction at the trailing edge. Thus, SAC 2 ̆ 7 s maintain a rapid continuous mode of movement in the keratocyte. However, it remains unknown what changes in contractile force production accompany SAC-mediated calcium transients or what Ca 2 +-dependent signaling mechanisms are involved in inducing retraction at the rear. Here, using a new gelatin-based traction force assay in combination with high-resolution calcium imaging we describe the spatio-temporal changes in force production associated with SAC-mediated calcium transients. We found that SAC-mediated calcium transients act to up-regulate contractility (increase traction stress) until retraction occurs causing a precipitous drop in traction stress. The elevation in traction stress has a distinct spatio-temporal appearance, rising initially at points of highest tension and propagating toward the leading edge. Calcium transients are associated with kinetic changes in traction stress together with cell speed and cell shape, which we arise form alternating periods of increased and decreased adhesiveness. Inhibition of calcium signaling led to increased cell adhesiveness as shown by increased traction stress, cell elongation, reduced cell speed and clustering of adhesion proteins, indicating the importance of SAC-mediated calcium transients in regulating cell retraction. Furthermore, altering myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) activity greatly reduced cell speed and the ability to generate traction stress suggesting its importance in retraction. However, inhibition of Ca 2 +-independent contractility through Rho kinase led to a slow decrease in <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> and cell speed, consistent with it having a minor role in cell motility. Inhibition of calpain, a Ca 2 +-dependent protease, showed no significant initial affect on cell motility. Taken together, we conclude that in the keratocyte mechano-chemical regulation of retraction through SACs involves primarily the activation of MLCK to increase cellular contractility and detach the rear edge, while calcium signaling may act to up-regulate calpain and other Ca 2 +-sensitive pathways to disassemble adhesions when contractile force alone is not enough to rupture adhesions. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} {{framework}} for tracking arbitrary complex cell boundary movements, relying on a unique definition of protrusion and retraction as the pathlength a virtual edge marker traverses when moving continuously perpendicular to the cell boundary. We introduce the level set method as a numerical scheme to reconstruct continuous boundary movement in time-lapse image sequences with finite time sampling. For moderately complex movements, we describe a numerically less expensive method that satisfactorily approximates the definition. Densely sampled protrusion and <b>retraction</b> <b>rates</b> were accumulated in space-time charts revealing distinct morphodynamic states. Applying this technique to the profiling of epithelial cell protrusion we identified three different states. In the I-state, long cell edge sectors are synchronized in cycles of protrusion and retraction. In the V-state random bursts of protrusion initiate protrusion waves propagating transversally in both directions. Cells switch between both states dependent on the Rac 1 activation level. Furthermore, the persistence of transversal waves in the V-state depends on Arp 2 / 3 concentration. Inhibition of PAK shifts cells into a λ-state where continuous protrusion is occasionally interrupted by self-propagating ruffles. Our data support a model where activation of Rac 1 mediates the propagation of protrusion waves, whose persistence depends on the relative abundance of activated Arp 2 / 3 and polymerizable G-actin...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to analyze the {{shoreline}} change of Biguaçu city through aerial photographs and satellite images. Subsequent of the image acquisition, those images were georeferenced using the bases of SPU. The coastlines from 1938, 1957, 1978 and 2005 were extracted using the maximum waterline as reference. The generation of 58 transects orthogonal to the shoreline, spaced between 50 meters, and with 230 meters long were created with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System DSAS, software developed to ArcGIS. The transects comparison was made through the shorelines from 1938 and 1957, 1957 and 1978, 1978 and 2010 and 1938 and 2010. After the result analysis, progradational characteristics were observed in the extreme north and central portion of the shoreline. The values ranged between 0. 07 and 2. 61 meters per year, and 5. 15 to 188. 15 meters for the entire period between 1938 and 2010. In the southern portion, the transects between 18 and 25 showed <b>retraction</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 67 meters per year during the same period, between 1938 and 2010, represented a migration of 5. 12 and 48. 64 meters.

40|$|Atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force {{spectroscopy}} (AFM-SMFS) {{was used}} to study the forced unbinding of quadruple self-complementary hydrogen-bonded urea–aminotriazine (UAT) complexes in hexadecane (HD). To elucidate the bond strength of individual linkages the unbinding forces of UAT supramolecular polymers were investigated for the first time. The bond rupture was probed at three different, fixed piezo <b>retraction</b> <b>rates</b> in far from equilibrium conditions. The number of supramolecular bonds (N) between AFM tip and the surface was determined by independent knowledge of the linker length. The observed rupture force of urea–aminotriazine (UAT) -based supramolecular polymer chains was found to decrease with increasing rupture length. The dependence of the most probable rupture force on N was in quantitative agreement with the theory of uncooperative bond rupture for supramolecular linkages switched in series. Experiments with three different, fixed loading rates provided identical values (within the experimental error) for the characteristic bond length xβ and the off-rate constant {{in the absence of}} force koff(f = 0). The value of xβ was found to agree with literature data on the hydrogen-bond distance obtained via crystallographic data of the hydrogen-bonded dimer. This work broadens the scope of our previous report showing that relevant parameters of the bond energy landscape can be derived from a single data set of rupture events at a fixed loading rate for supramolecular linkages switched in serie...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this randomized prospective clinical {{study was to investigate}} the treatment effects of en-masse retraction compared with two-step retraction of maxillary anterior teeth with microscrews as absolute anchorage units in patients undergoing extraction of first premolars. Sixteen subjects requiring high anchorage for space closure were included in the study and microscrew implants measuring 1, 2 mm in diameter and 8 mm in length were placed between right and left first molars and second premolars buccaly to provide skeletal anchorage. The patients were randomly divided into two groups each consisting of 8 patients. In the first group (6 women, 2 men, mean age 18, 5), space closure was achieved by en-masse retraction of maxillary anterior teeth. In the second group (6 women, 2 men, mean age 19, 7), the retraction procedure was performed in two steps: canine retraction with microscrews followed by incisor retraction with bull-loops. Lateral cephalograms and cast models were taken from each patient before retraction (T 1) and after space closure (T 2). Independent t-test, Wilcoxon test, Student’s t test and Mann Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Successful closure of the extraction spaces without any anchorage loss was achieved with microscrews in 7, 3 months for the en-masse retraction group and in 8, 1 months for the two-step retraction group. All 32 microscrews (100 %) remained stable {{until the end of the}} retraction period. Even though there was no significant difference in treatment times, the first group showed greater incisor <b>retraction</b> <b>rate</b> (0, 74 mm per month) than the second group (0, 57 mm per month). 5, 25 mm retraction, 3, 63 ° tipping and 0, 81 mm intrusion of the central incisors were observed in the first group. The central incisors of the second group showed 4, 63 mm retraction and 7, 13 ° tipping and no intrusion. Only the difference in tipping movement of the incisors was statistically significant between two groups (p< 0, 05). Therefore, 0, 88 mm significant retrusion of A- point was seen in the first group (p< 0, 05). On the other hand, 0, 88 ° significant decrease in mandibular plane was found in the second group (p< 0, 001). No significant maxillary first molar movement was noted in the first group thus no anchorage loss occurred. The first molars in the second group showed 0, 63 mm distal tipping which was considered significant (p< 0, 001). Both groups showed approximately 2 mm of upper and lower lip retrusion. Cast model measurements proved 2, 38 mm decrease of intercanine distance in the first group (p< 0, 001), 2, 75 mm decrease in the second group (p< 0, 01), no change of intermolar distance in both groups. En-masse retraction of the upper anterior teeth with microscrew implants showed faster rate of tooth movement, more translational incisor retraction, no molar movement and reduction of A-point. On the other hand, two-step retraction of upper anterior teeth showed more tipping of the incisors, distal tipping of upper molars and reduction of mandibular plane angle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLipid {{adhesion}} {{forces can}} be measured using several experimental techniques, {{but none of these}} techniques provide insight on the atomic level. Therefore, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a phospholipid membrane in the liquid-crystalline phase out of which individual lipid molecules were pulled. In our method, as an idealization of the experimental setups, we have simply attached a harmonic spring to one of the lipid headgroup atoms. Upon retraction of the spring, the force needed to drag the lipid out of the membrane is recorded. By simulating different <b>retraction</b> <b>rates,</b> we were able to investigate the high pull rate part of the dynamical spectrum of lipid adhesion forces. We find that the adhesion force increases along the unbinding path, until the point of rupture is reached. The maximum value of the adhesion force, the rupture force, decreases as the pull rate becomes slower, and eventually enters a friction-dominated regime. The computed bond lengths depend on the rate of rupture, and show some scatter due to the nonequilibrium nature of the experiment. On average, the bond length increases from ∼ 1. 7 nm to 2. 3 nm as the rates go down. Conformational analyses elucidate the detailed mechanism of lipid-membrane bond rupture. We present results of over 15 ns of membrane simulations. Implications for the interpretation and understanding of experimental rupture data are discussed...|$|R

Cells such as astrocytes and radial glia with many densely ramified, fine processes pose particular challenges for the quantification of structural motility. Here we report {{the development of a}} method to calculate a motility index for individual cells with complex, dynamic morphologies. This motility index relies on boxcar averaging of the difference images generated by subtraction of images collected at consecutive time points. An image preprocessing step involving 2 D projection, edge detection, and dilation of the raw images is first applied in order to binarize the images. The boxcar averaging of difference images diminishes the impact of artifactual pixel fluctuations while accentuating the group-wise changes in pixel values which are more likely to represent real biological movement. Importantly, this provides a value that correlates with mean process elongation and <b>retraction</b> <b>rates</b> without requiring detailed reconstructions of very complex cells. We also demonstrate that additional increases in the sensitivity of the method can be obtained by denoising images using the temporal frequency power spectra, {{based on the fact that}} rapid intensity fluctuations over time are mainly due to imaging artifact. The MATLAB programs implementing these motility analysis methods, complete with user-friendly graphical interfaces, have been made publicly available for download. 1...|$|R
40|$|There is {{compelling}} evidence that circulatory hemodynamics prevent neutrophil activation, including adhesion to microvessels, in the microcirculation. However, the underlying mechanism or {{mechanisms by which}} that mechanoregulation occurs remain unresolved. Here, we report evidence that exposure to fluid shear stress (FSS) promotes neutrophils to release cathepsin B (ctsB) and that this autocrine regulatory event is antiadhesive for neutrophils on endothelial surfaces through Mac 1 -selective regulation. We used a combined cell-engineering and immunocytochemistry approach to find that ctsB was capable of cleaving Mac 1 integrins on neutrophils and demonstrated that this proteolysis alters their adhesive functions. Under no-flow conditions, ctsB enhanced neutrophil migration though a putative effect on pseudopod <b>retraction</b> <b>rates.</b> We also established a flow-based cell detachment assay to verify the role of ctsB in the control of neutrophil adhesion by fluid flow stimulation. Fluid flow promoted neutrophil detachment from platelet and endothelial layers that required ctsB, consistent with its fluid shear stress-induced release. Notably, compared with leukocytes from wild-type mice, those from ctsB-deficient (ctsB -/-) mice exhibited an impaired CD 18 cleavage response to FSS, significantly elevated baseline levels of CD 18 surface expression, and an enhanced adhesive capacity to mildly inflamed postcapillary venules. Taken together, {{the results of the}} present study support a role for ctsB in a hemodynamic control mechanism that is antiadhesive for leukocytes on endothelium. These results have implications in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and cardiovascular diseases involving sustained neutrophil activation in the blood and microcirculation...|$|R

While filopodia are generally thought {{to be one of the}} cellular mechanosensors for probing environmental stiffness, the effects of environmental stiffness on filopodial activities of cancer cells remain unclear. In this work, we investigated the filopodial activities of human lung adenocarcinoma cells CL 1 - 5 cultured on substrates of tunable stiffness using a novel platform. The platform consists of an optical system called structured illumination nano-profilometry, which allows time-lapsed visualization of filopodial activities without fluorescence labeling. The culturing substrates were composed of polyvinyl chloride mixed with an environmentally friendly plasticizer to yield Young’s modulus ranging from 20 to 60 kPa. Cell viability studies showed that the viability of cells cultured on the substrates was similar to those cultured on commonly used elastomers such as polydimethylsiloxane. Time-lapsed live cell images were acquired and the filopodial activities in response to substrates with varying degrees of stiffness were analyzed. Statistical analyses revealed that lung cancer cells cultured on softer substrates appeared to have longer filopodia, higher filopodial densities with respect to the cellular perimeter, and slower filopodial <b>retraction</b> <b>rates.</b> Nonetheless, the temporal analysis of filopodial activities revealed that whether a filopodium decides to extend or retract is purely a stochastic process without dependency on substrate stiffness.

40|$|At {{gastrulation}} in the {{sea urchin}} embryo, a dramatic rearrangement of cells establishes the three germ layers of the organism. Experiments have revealed a number of cell interactions at this stage that transfer patterning information from cell to cell. Of particular significance, primary mesenchyme cells, which are responsible for production of the embryonic skeleton, {{have been shown to}} obtain extensive positional information from the embryonic ectoderm. In the present study, high resolution Nomarski imaging reveals the presence of very thin filopodia (02 - 0. 4 micron in diameter) extending from primary mesenchyme cells as well as from ectodermal and secondary mesenchyme cells. These thin filopodia sometimes extend to more than 80 microns in length and show average growth and <b>retraction</b> <b>rates</b> of nearly 10 microns/minute. The filopodia are highly dynamic, rapidly changing from extension to resorption; frequently, the resorption changes to resumption of assembly. The behavior, location and timing of active thin filopodial movements does not correlate with cell locomotion; instead, there is a strong correlation suggesting their involvement in cell-cell interactions associated with signaling and patterning at gastrulation. Nickel-treatment, which is known to create a patterning defect in skeletogenesis due to alterations in the ectoderm, alters the normal position-dependent differences in the thin filopodia. The effect is present in recombinant embryos in which the ectoderm alone was treated with nickel, and is absent in recombinant embryos in which only the primary mesenchyme cells were treated, suggesting that the filopodial length is substratum dependent rather than being primary mesenchyme cell autonomous. The thin filopodia provide a means by which cells can contact others several cell diameters away, suggesting that some of the signaling previously thought to be mediated by diffusible signals may instead by the result of direct receptor-ligand interactions between cell membranes...|$|R
