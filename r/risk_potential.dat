40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} which EUS characteristics correlate with malignant potential of GISTs. Methods All patients with a diagnosis of GIST based on surgical resection and preoperative EUS at our institution from January 2000 to July 2006 were identified. Pathology reports were used to determine NIH classification of each GIST and EUS exams were reviewed. EUS features were compared to NIH classification of very low/low <b>risk</b> malignant <b>potential</b> or intermediate/high <b>risk</b> malignant <b>potential.</b> Results Fourteen patients had lesions of very low or low <b>risk</b> malignant <b>potential,</b> and 12 patients had lesions of intermediate or high-risk malignant potential. EUS features of tumor size (P = 0. 002), irregular extraluminal border (P = 0. 005), local invasion (P = 0. 02), and heterogeneity (P = 0. 02) were statistically significant correlates of intermediate or high <b>risk</b> malignant <b>potential.</b> Conclusions EUS characteristics of tumor size, extraluminal border, depth, and heterogeneity can be used to predict malignant potential of GISTs.

50|$|In water polo, {{dribbling}} is {{the technique}} of moving the ball while swimming forward. The ball is propelled ahead of the player with the wake created by alternating armstrokes, and often accompanied by occasional nudges using the nose or forehead. Since ball contact is minimal, this creates advantage for the ball carrier advancing the ball; the defender may not make contact unless the attacker is touching the ball. Using short, and rapid arm strokes with high elbows, the dribbling player is often able to shield the ball from tackling attempts by the opposing team, particularly those chasing from behind or approaching adjacently. This aggressive defensive technique ensures any tackling attempts, successful or not, <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> injury as the turbulent elbow motion is considered legal by FINA, and so a defending player must avoid contact in his attempts to steal the ball from the dribbler.|$|E
50|$|Operation of {{technologies}} involving long-term geologic storage of waste fluids {{have been shown}} to induce seismic activity in nearby areas, and correlation of periods of seismic dormancy with minima in injection volumes and pressures has even been demonstrated for fracking wastewater injection in Youngstown, Ohio. Of particular concern to the viability of carbon dioxide storage from coal-fired power plants and similar endeavors is that the scale of intended CCS projects is much larger in both injection rate and total injection volume than any current or past operation that has already been shown to induce seismicity. As such, extensive modeling must be done of future injection sites in order to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> of CCS operations, particularly in relation to the effect of long-term carbon dioxide storage on shale caprock integrity, as the potential for fluid leaks to the surface can be quite high for even small to moderate earthquakes.|$|E

Sun conures are popular as pets because of their bright coloration and curious nature. Due to their inquisitive temperaments, they demand {{a great deal of attention}} from their owners, with whom they can be loving and cuddly. Hand reared pets can be very friendly towards people that they are familiar with, but they may be aggressive with strangers and even territorial with visitors. Sun conures are capable of learning a great deal of tricks and can even perform in front of a live audience. They enjoy listening to music, to which they occasionally sing and dance to. Like many parrots, they are determined chewers and require toys and treats to chew on. Many owners clips their conure's wings but this is not necessary if the proper precautions are put in place. Due to environmental hazards, conures should not be allowed to fly unsupervised. Sun conures are great candidates for outdoor flight when well trained as they are loyal but <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> must be minimized.

40|$|Although most {{individuals}} who gamble {{do so without}} any adverse consequences, some individuals develop a recurrent, maladaptive pattern of gambling behaviour, often called pathological gambling or gambling disorder, {{that is associated with}} financial losses, disruption of family and interpersonal relationships, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Identifying whether different types of gambling modalities vary in their ability to lead to maladaptive patterns of gambling behaviour is essential to develop public policies that seek to balance access to gambling opportunities with minimizing risk for the potential adverse consequences of gambling behaviour. Until recently, assessing the <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> of different types of gambling products was nearly impossible. ASTERIG, initially developed in Germany in 2006 - 2010, is an assessment tool to measure and to evaluate the <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> of any gambling product based on scores on ten dimensions. In doing so, it also allows a comparison to be drawn between the addictive potential of different gambling products. Furthermore, the tool highlights where the specific <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> of each specific gambling product lies. This makes it a valuable tool at the legislative, case law, and administrative levels as it allows the <b>risk</b> <b>potential</b> of individual gambling products to be identified and to be compared globally and across 10 different dimensions of <b>risk</b> <b>potential.</b> We note that specific gambling products should always be evaluated rather than product groups (lotteries, slot machines) or providers, as there may be variations among those product groups that impact their <b>risk</b> <b>potential.</b> For example, slot machines may vary on the amount of jackpot, which may influence their <b>risk</b> <b>potential...</b>|$|E
