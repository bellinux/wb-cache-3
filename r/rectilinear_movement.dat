40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is {{the most}} common cause of {{physical}} disability in children. Action Observation Therapy (AOT) has been developed from mirror neuron system (MNS) theory and proposes that the observation of action could improve both the planning and execution of motor actions through common neural processes. The purpose of this study was to adapt this therapy to children with CP in order to rehabilitate their upper limb movement ability. METHOD: Seven children with hemiplegic congenital CP have participated to the study. Assessment included impairment (force, fine and gross manual dexterity and quality of movement through a robotic device), activity limitation and participation restriction measures. A single blind cross over design has been used. The experimental condition consisted of viewing videos showing a first person perspective of a child’s daily living activities with a narrative. Statistical analysis used was single cases through confidence interval. RESULTS: The results showed significant action improvements for four of the seven children. The improvements were to the measures of force, fine and gross manual dexterity and the quality of <b>rectilinear</b> <b>movements.</b> Participation restriction and quality of shaped movements did not show significant improvements. The initial level of action ability explained the difference between the patients. DISCUSSION: This study was one the first to adapt AOT to children with CP and to assess the three dimensions of handicap including kinematics measures. It seems that the level of manual ability and the functions of the MNS are likely matched: children with poor manual ability may have reduced MNS capacity, explaining the reduced rehabilitation effect. Although additional studies have to be led, AOT provides a recent and promising rehabilitative tool for action in children with CP...|$|R

Subjects were instructed to make reaching movements between points lying on the boundary of a planar virtual surface of varying stiffness.

In the second case, the trajectory is conformed to the object boundary so as to reduce interaction forces. While this dichotomy is evident for very rigid and very soft objects, the likelihood of identifying a surface boundary depended, in a smooth and monotonic way, on the average force experienced in the first movements. This continuum of interactive behaviors suggests that the nervous system uses a weighted combination of two control strategies, one generating a compensatory response, the other a compliant motion. 1...|$|R

Signals generated by the glove operated a remotely-controlled endpoint: a cursor on a computer monitor. The subjects were instructed to execute movements of this endpoint with controlled motions of the fingers. This required inverting a highly redundant map from fingers to cursor motions. We found that 1) after training with visual feedback of the final error (but not of the ongoing cursor motion), subjects learned to map cursor locations into configurations of the fingers; 2) extended practice of movement led to more <b>rectilinear</b> cursor <b>movement,</b> a trend facilitated by training under continuous visual feedback of cursor motions; 3) with practice, subjects reduced motion in the degrees of freedom that did not contribute to the movements of the cursor; 4) with practice, subjects reduced variability of both cursor and hand movements...|$|R

40|$|The General Relativity understands gravity like {{inertial}} {{movement of}} the free fall of the bodies in curved spacetime of Lorentz. The law of inertia of Newton would be particular case of the inertial {{movement of the}} bodies in the spacetime flat of Euclid. But, in the step, from general to particular, breaks the law of inertia of Galilei since recovers apparently the <b>rectilinear</b> uniform <b>movement</b> but not the repose state, unless the bodies have undergone their collapse, although, the curved spacetime becomes flat and the curved geodesies becomes straight lines.

In this paper this error of General Relativity, like generalization {{of the law of}} inertia of Galilei, is examined and it is found that it is caused by suppression of mass and force that allows conceiving acceleration like property of spacetime. This is a mathematical and non-ontological result. Indeed, mass and force are the fundament that the gravitational acceleration is independent of the magnitude of mass of the bodies but gravity not of the mass and the gravitational force. The action of the gravity force, on inertial and gravitational masses of a body, produces mutual cancellation during its free fallen but too its weight when this cease.

According to the law, ther are assessed for their potential danger to {{human health and the}} environment, including alternative test objects. Evaluation has been carried out with regard to cytotoxic effect of pharmacological substances (loratadine and desloratadine) using the bull sperm suspension as test objects, standardized and highly sensitive to toxic substances. Sperm was divided into the control sample (dissolved by phosphate-buffered saline) and the investigated sample. Loratadine was added to phosphate-buffered saline in doses of 1 / 500 LD 50 (12. 3 mg), 1 / 100  LD 50 (61. 5 mg) and LD 50 (6150 mg). Desloratadine doses were 1 / 500 LD 50 (1. 25 mg), 1 / 100 LD 50 (6. 25 mg) and LD 50 (625 mg). Survival of spermatozoa was defined until termination of <b>rectilinear</b> forward <b>movement</b> in sperm intacted at + 2 …+ 5 °C. Respiratory activity (ex tempore) was defined in 1. 0 ml thermostated cell (temperature of 38. 5 °C) by polarography with the automatic registration of process flow by potentiometer; restorative activity was defined potentiometrically, using the open microelectrodes that were inserted in thermostated polarographic cell. Survival of spermatozoa in the sperm under the impact of loratadine in doses of 1 / 500 LD 50 and 1 / 100 LD 50 is respectively 136. 0 ± 26. 2 hours and 144. 0 ± 19. 6 hours. Adding LD 50 dose of loratadine reduced survival to 112. 0 ± 26. 2 hours, which is lower than the control (160. 0 ± 26. 1 hours), respectively, by 10. 0 – 15. 0 and 30. 0 %. Loratadine reduces the respiratory activity of sperm: in the dose of 1 / 500 LD 50 by 20. 5 %, in the dose of 1 / 100 LD 50 – by 43. 6 %, and that of 100 LD 50 – by 61. 5 % compared to the control. Restorative sperm activity under the impact of the loratadine reduced by 84. 0 % (dose of 1 / 500 LD 50), 98. 0 % (dose of 1 / 100 LD 50), 80. 0 % (dose LD 50) compared to controls. The survival of spermatozoa in the sperm under desloratadine action in the dose of 1 / 500 LD 50 is 144. 0 ± 19. 6 hours (10. 0 % reduction compared with the control – 152. 0 ± 23. 6 hours), in the dose of 1 / 100 LD 50 – 136. 0 ± 26. 1 hours (15. 0 % reduction), in the dose of LD 50 – 72. 0 ± 19. 6 hours (30. 0 % reduction). The intensity of oxygen consumption by sperm reduced by 16. 2 % when adding desloratadine in the dose of 1 / 500 LD 50, by 38. 8 % in the dose of 1 / 100 LD 50 and by 80. 7 % – in the dose of LD 50, compared with the control. Inhibition of respiratory activity is accompanied by decreasing in the transport of protons and electrons from spermatozoa into the extracellular medium, that manifests decreasing of reconstructive activity when the dose of desloratadine is 1 / 500 LD 50 (by 12. 0 %), 1 / 100 LD 50 (by 40. 0 %) and LD 50 (by 60, 0 %) compared with the control...|$|R

The forces acting on the glider, a result of the eddy currents, can be easily observed and measured. As a consequence of the air track inclination, the glider accelerates at the beginning, although it asymptotically tends towards a uniform <b>rectilinear</b> <b>movement</b> characterized by a terminal speed. This speed depends on the interaction between the magnetic field and the conductivity properties of the air track.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical design, analysis, fabrication, and testing procedures {{of a new}} large-range microgripper {{which is based on}} a flexible hinge structure. The uniqueness of the gripper is that the gripper arms not only provide large gripping range but also deliver approximately <b>rectilinear</b> <b>movement</b> as the displacement in nonworking direction is extremely small. The large gripping range is enabled by a mechanism design based on dual-stage flexure amplifier to magnify the stroke of piezoelectric actuator. The first-stage amplifier is {{a modified version of the}} Scott Russell (SR) mechanism and the second-stage amplifier contains a parallel mechanism. The displacement amplification ratio of the modified SR mechanism in the gripper has been enlarged to 3. 56  times of the conventional design. Analytical static models of the gripper mechanism are developed and validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation. Results show that the gripping range is over 720  µm with a resonant frequency of 70. 7  Hz and negligible displacement in nonworking direction. The total amplification ratio of the input displacement is 16. 13. Moreover, a prototype of the gripper is developed by using aluminium 7075 for experimental testing.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on a multistable linear {{actuation}} mechanism articulated with electroactive polymer actuators, widely known as artificial muscles. These actuators, which can operate both in wet and dry media under as small as 1. 0 V potential difference, are fundamentally cantilever beams made of two electroactive polymer layers (polypyrrole) and a passive polyvinylidene fluoride substrate in between the electroactive layers. The mechanism considered is kinematically analogous to a four-bar mechanism with revolute-prismatic-revolute-prismatic pairs, converting the bending displacement of a polymer actuator into a <b>rectilinear</b> <b>movement</b> of an output point. The topology of the mechanism resembles that of bistable mechanisms operating under the buckling effect. However, the mechanism proposed in this paper can have many stable positions depending on the input voltage. After demonstrating the feasibility of the actuation concept using kinematic and finite element analyses of the mechanism, experiments were conducted on a real mechanism articulated with a multiple number (2, 4, or 8) of electroactive polymer actuators, which had dimensions of 12 × 2 × 0. 17  mm 3. The numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the angular displacement of the artificial muscles is accurately transformed into a rectilinear motion by the proposed mechanism. The higher the input voltage, the larger the rectilinear displacement.

Os alunos foram instruídos pelos professores e deveriam se movimentar de modo a reproduzir um gráfico d x t, correspondente ao oferecido na tela da calculadora. Assim, procurou-se contemplar a interação aluno-aluno, professor-aluno e alunotecnologia. As falas e as ações foram gravadas e transcritas. Como referencial teórico, o pesquisador valeu-se da Teoria da Cognição Corporificada, baseada e Lakoff e Nunes, em particular no papel das metáforas conceituais e no Modelo de Estratégia Argumentativa (MEA) para análise das falas e gestos organizadas em episódios que visavam a compreensão dos significados produzidos.
