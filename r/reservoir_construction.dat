5|$|In 1881, {{a report}} was {{commissioned}} on water resources {{within a reasonable}} distance of Cardiff. The report concluded that the Taff Fawr scheme would fulfil the town's requirements at the least cost and {{it was decided to}} create Llanishen <b>Reservoir.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{ground was}} broken on the Kinzua Dam, which would dam the Allegheny River downriver from NY280 {{at a point}} east of Warren, Pennsylvania. The {{structure}} was completed on December13, 1965, leading {{to the creation of}} the Allegheny Reservoir. Much of NY280 was inundated by the new reservoir, as were Cold Spring, Quaker Bridge, and a significant portion of Pennsylvania Route346 (PA346) that ran along the river in Warren County. As a result, new alignments were built for both NY280 and PA346 along the eastern edge of the new <b>reservoir.</b> <b>Construction</b> of NY280's new alignment began in 1965 and was completed by 1968. NY280 now began at the realigned PA346 at the state line and ended at exit18 of the Southern Tier Expressway, which was built between Steamburg and Salamanca during the mid-1960s.|$|E

5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{reservoir}} comes from the nearby village of Żelazny Most, located 3.4 kilometres south-west of {{the reservoir}}; with the village of Rudna {{to the east of}} the <b>reservoir.</b> The <b>reservoir's</b> <b>construction</b> began in 1974, and exploitation (and the completion of the <b>reservoir's</b> <b>construction)</b> on February 12, 1977.

25|$|Plantations were {{strategically}} located {{throughout the}} Hawaiian Islands for reasons including: fertile soil area, level topography, sufficient water for irrigation, and a mild climate with little annual variation. These plantations transformed the land primarily to suit water needs: construction of tunnels to divert {{water from the}} mountains to the plantations, <b>reservoir</b> <b>construction,</b> and well digging.|$|E
25|$|A {{page on the}} BLM website, since removed, {{listed the}} impacts of Bundy's {{trespass}} cattle. Among these were risks to people driving on roadways, destruction of crops on private property, damage to community property {{in the city of}} Mesquite, negative impacts on city facilities in Bunkerville, destruction of archaeological artifacts and unauthorized <b>reservoir</b> <b>construction.</b> The regional off-site mitigation strategies of non-governmental organizations were also delayed for the Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone, and a matching $400,000 grant from the Walton Family Foundation to restore habitat for the southwest willow flycatcher along the Virgin River was delayed on the condition that Bundy remove the trespass cattle.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation is {{essential}} for reliable agriculture on the coastal lowlands of the state, and large scale irrigation infrastruction is needed for large scale production. After the Mexican Revolution, the federal government took control of Sonora’s irrigation infrastructure and after World War II, began extensive dam and <b>reservoir</b> <b>construction.</b> From the 1940s to the 1970s, advanced in agricultural techniques were pioneered by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) based in Ciudad Obregón. This combined new varieties of wheat, with irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to greatly increase production. Mexico went from a wheat importer in the 1940s to a wheat exporter in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Before the <b>reservoir's</b> <b>construction,</b> {{an ad hoc}} set of {{wells and}} water {{purchases}} served Roanoke County. In 1986, county officials, anticipating increased water needs, sought and received voter approval for the Spring Hollow Reservoir.|$|R

50|$|New {{geological}} {{research related}} to the <b>reservoir's</b> <b>construction</b> began in 1947 at four places between Gorni Pasarel and Pancharevo.

500|$|Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is {{assessed}} as [...] "Data Deficient" [...] on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it may be}} endangered {{because of}} its narrow ecological preferences. <b>Reservoir</b> <b>construction</b> may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites {{where it has been}} recorded have already been destroyed. Forest loss is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats. Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.|$|E

2500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about East Tennessee's prehistoric American Indians comes as a result of TVA's <b>reservoir</b> <b>construction,</b> as federal law {{required}} archaeological investigations to be conducted in areas that were to be flooded. [...] Excavations at the Icehouse Bottom site near Vonore revealed that American Indians were living in East Tennessee on at least a semi-annual basis as early as 7,500 B.C. [...] The region's significant Woodland period (1000 B.C. [...] 1000 A.D.) sites include Rose Island (also near Vonore) and Moccasin Bend (near Chattanooga). [...] During what archaeologists call the Mississippian period (c. 10001600 A.D.), East Tennessee's American Indian inhabitants were living in complex agrarian societies at places such as Toqua and Hiwassee Island, and had formed a minor chiefdom known as Chiaha in the French Broad Valley. [...] Spanish expeditions led by Hernando de Soto, Tristan de Luna, and Juan Pardo all visited East Tennessee's Mississippian-period inhabitants during the 16th century.|$|E
