5000|$|In September 1628 Rubens {{travelled}} to Spain for {{the second}} time, leaving on 29 September 1629. He had been summoned there to inform the king about his peace negotiations with Britain, but was also able to rework the painting while he was there. Francisco Pacheco relates in his work El arte de la pintura [...] "Rubens changed some things in his painting of the Adoration of the Magi {{that was in the}} palace". This amounted to a complete re-working, with several details modified, strips added to the top and <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edges</b> (its original dimensions were 259 cm by 381 cm) and the style updated to that of the late 1620s, heavily influenced by Titian.|$|R

50|$|It {{then looked}} as though Fury was winning Round 11 until he was docked a point for shots behind the head. However this was partly Klitschko's fault for turning his back, {{as he had done}} several times {{throughout}} the fight. Although Klitschko had landed a few straight left jabs during the fight he rarely threw punches with his <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> it seemed this was in fear of being countered. He improved on this in Round 12 and did land a couple of <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and <b>edged</b> the round but by this time many felt Fury had done enough.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} shows a young, beardless Christ, {{leading the}} two much older-looking brothers. The more prominent of the brothers, presumably Simon, {{is holding a}} fish in his <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> The <b>edge</b> of the canvas is rather damaged, but the central panel is in good condition. The presence of [...] "incisions" [...] into the ground of the canvas marking out St. Peter's ear and the eyes of Christ are typical of Caravaggio's technique. The painting appears to date from the height of Caravaggio's Roman period, c. 1603-06.|$|R
50|$|Until June 1918, {{the dead}} from the {{hospitals}} at Boulogne itself {{were buried in}} the Cimetiere de L'Est, one of the town's cemeteries, the Commonwealth graves forming a long, narrow strip along the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> of the cemetery.

50|$|Close {{examination}} of the fragments, years of study, and careful restoration were needed to reconstruct the altarpiece’s original form. As reconstructed, {{the position of the}} two donor and patron fragments at each side of the painting can be seen by the columns, which match up to those in the top fragment. However the left hand Edinburgh fragment has been slightly trimmed at the bottom and left side, and only the Dulwich fragment on the right contains part of the original bottom and <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edges.</b> The wing, spear and arm of Michael can be seen at the top right corner of the left-hand fragment in Edinburgh, just as his hand holding scales, and the tip of his mantle floating off his shoulder, appear at the left of the Dulwich piece. These elements were overpainted in both these fragments until restorations in recent decades, and a series of proposed reconstructions in 1932-33 had an empty centre, which it was suggested might have been occupied by a Madonna, a crucifix (real or painted), or a real reliquary, although a Saint Michael was recognised as a possibility, and the 1914 Edinburgh Catalogue claimed, completely wrongly, that the missing figure was at Castle Howard.|$|R

50|$|Studies of both {{legibility}} and readability {{have examined}} {{a wide range}} of factors including type size and type design. For example, comparing serif vs. sans-serif type, roman type vs. oblique type, and italic type, line length, line spacing, color contrast, the design of right-hand edge (for example, justification, straight <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge)</b> vs. ragged right, and whether text is hyphenated. Justified copy must be adjusted tightly during typesetting to prevent loss of readability, something beyond the capabilities of typical personal computers.|$|E
50|$|A {{successor}} model, the Brennabor Typ PW, {{appeared in}} 1925. This shared the 2.1-litre {{engine of the}} earlier Typ P, but claimed maximum power was increased to 32 hp, achieved, now, at 2,600 rpm. The gear lever was relocated from the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the car to}} a central floor-mounted position, which necessitated changing gear with the left hand, since the driver continued to be conventionally positioned on the right-hand side of the car. The wheelbase was unchanged, but the standard bodies were nevertheless a little longer than on the previous model.|$|E
50|$|When {{traveling}} {{at a slower}} speed than vehicular traffic, bicyclists must ride {{as close to the}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> as is safe and practicable. Exceptions include: when passing another bicycle or vehicle traveling in the same direction, when preparing for a left turn, when necessary to avoid objects or road hazards, when traveling on a road of width too narrow for bicycles and motorized vehicles to safely travel side by side, when approaching a place where a right turn is authorized, when traveling on a one-way road with two or more lanes (bicyclist can ride on left-hand side).|$|E
50|$|Most {{scissors}} are best-suited for {{use with}} the <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> but left-handed scissors are designed {{for use with}} the left hand. Because scissors have overlapping blades, they are not symmetric. This asymmetry is true regardless of the orientation {{and shape of the}} handles: the blade that is on top always forms the same diagonal regardless of orientation. Human hands are also asymmetric, and when closing, the thumb and fingers do not close vertically, but have a lateral component to the motion. Specifically, the thumb pushes out from the palm and the fingers pull inwards. For right-handed scissors held in the <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> the thumb blade is closer to the user's body, so that the natural tendency of the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> is to force the cutting blades together. Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the left hand, the natural tendency of the left hand would be to force the cutting blades laterally apart. Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> the shearing <b>edge</b> is visible, but when they are used with the left <b>hand,</b> the cutting <b>edge</b> of the scissors is behind the top blade, and one cannot see what is being cut.|$|R

On 26 December 2011, Valencia scored the fourth goal for Manchester United in a 5-0 home win against Wigan Athletic. He received {{the ball on the}} <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> of the penalty area and rifled a shot across goal and into the far corner. On 22 January 2012, Valencia scored the first goal against Arsenal with a header, before later setting up Danny Welbeck to win the game 2-1. On 2 April 2012, in his 100th appearance for the club in all competitions, Valencia scored the first goal in a 2-0 win against Blackburn Rovers, powerfully curling the ball around Paul Robinson and inside the far corner. Five minutes later, Valencia set up the second goal for Ashley Young.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960 Rudolf Radislovich first {{explored}} the front {{part of the}} cave with its main entrance (Hauptgang) and [...] "water entrance" [...] (Wassergang), both of which meet in the Hall of Union (Halle der Vereinigung). In the following year, Max H. Fink surveyed the known section of the cave and discovered the Labyrinth. In 1964 the Federal Monuments Office (Bundesdenkmalamt) designated the cave as a natural monument because of its scientific importance. In 1968 Walter Knezicek and Günther J. Wolf discovered two shafts and the Knesi-Harnisch at the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>edge</b> of the Halle der Vereinigung, which all led down into a tunnel about 10 metres below. This {{was the start of}} what later became known as the Schrauben-Cañon ("Screw Canyon"). In 1970 Hannes Jodl found the Postkastl ("Postbox") at the left hand end of the Halle der Vereinigung, {{which turned out to be}} a continuation of the Spannagel Cave. The first person to enter this section was Günther J. Wolf with seven members of his ice course. The research of the Kolkgang passage (ascending to the Elchschädelgang passage and Dirndlkammer chamber, a link with the Wassergang, and descending via the Kolkgang to the Hannes-Jodl-Dom, at whose ceiling the Schrauben-Cañon enters, onwards to the Dr.-Klaus-Karger-Halle and continuing as the Kolkgang to the edge of the ÖTK-Schacht shaft) resulted in a doubling of the hitherto known extent of the cave and offered an incentive for further exploration.|$|E
