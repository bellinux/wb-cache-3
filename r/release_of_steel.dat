40|$|Key words: End zone, {{prestress}} transfer, wire tendon, transmission length, pull-in, plain wire, indented wire, concrete strength, size of wire, gradual release, sudden release, shock release, time dependent effects. An empirical {{investigation into}} the transfer of prestress force from wire tendons to concrete in the end zones of pretensioned prestressed concrete beams was accomplished in this project. The experimental tests featured 56 small scale prestressed concrete beams. Some of the factors influencing prestress transfer which were considered in the current tests are as follows:(a) type of release - gradual, sudden or shock(b) surface condition of the wire - plain or indented(c) size of the wire(d) concrete compressive strength {{at the time of}} transfer(e) time dependent effectsMost of the tests involved gradual <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> tendons with the prestressing force transferred in approximately ten equal increments. Sudden release in a single step was achieved by allowing the supporting abutments to retract rapidly. Shock release was implemented in some beams by angle grinding the wires. The type of release which gave the best quality of prestress transfer was gradual release. This was followed by sudden and shock releases respectively. There were four types of wires used in the laboratory tests: namely the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron indented, 7 mm dia. Plain and 7 mm dia. Belgian indented wires. Transmission lengths were determined from strain distributions for these wires. Pull-ins of the wire tendons at the ends of the beams were also measured. There was significant scatter in the experimental data. Different ranges of transmission lengths and pull-ins were obtained for the various types of wires used. Three equations were derived for the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron and 7 mm dia. Plain wires, which linearly correlated pull-ins to the transmission lengths. ++These relationships provide a qualitative and quantitative method of indirectly monitoring for the transmission lengths through the measurements of pull-in. Statistical inference tests proved that indented wires were superior in performance compared to plain wires, but the differences were more apparent for the pull-ins than for the transmission lengths. Comparisons on the influence of tendon size substantiated that greater pull-ins occurred for larger wires but the differences were not significant for the transmission lengths. For concrete strength at the time of transfer of less than 32 MPa, the transmission lengths and pull-ins were significantly larger than those for higher strengths. It is recommended that concrete strength at transfer be at least 32 MPa for pretensioned prestressed concrete. Apart from the maturity and strength of concrete, the quality of a mix also influenced the transmission length and there was limited data to suggest that a better grade mix despite having lower strength at a more tender age could outperform a lower grade mix with greater strength released after a longer curing period. Formulae for plain and indented wires were found by dimensional analysis which correlated the transmission length to the diameter of wire tendon and the stress/strength ratio of the prestressed beams. Pull-ins increased significantly over 6 months but the changes in the transmission lengths were small. Normalised longitudinal strain distributions did not indicate that transmission lengths would remain unchanged over time...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{feasibility}} of recycling and/or reuse of non-releasable components and materials arising from nuclear operations within the European Community has been undertaken.

Caress <b>of</b> <b>Steel</b> was considered an audacious move for the band because of the placement of two protracted numbers back-to-back, as well as a heavier reliance on atmospherics and science fiction/fantasy based story-telling. Still, the lead-off track [...] "Bastille Day" [...] hearkened back to the previous album and became a fan favourite [...] "rocker". The song was consistently used as the opener for many of their live shows in the late 1970s. Intended to be the band's first [...] "break-through" [...] album, Caress <b>of</b> <b>Steel</b> sold quite poorly, and the promotional tour consisted of small lackluster venues, which led to the moniker the [...] "Down the Tubes Tour". In light of these events, Rush's record label pressured them into molding their next album in a more commercially friendly and accessible fashion. However, in spite of such urges, the band ignored these requests, and their next album, 1976's 2112, was the band's first taste of commercial success and their first Canadian gold and platinum album.

Gregory Noveck, senior vice president of creative affairs for DC Entertainment stated [...] "we're going to make a Justice League movie, whether it's now or 10 years from now. But we're {{not going to do it}} and Warners is not going to do it until we know it's right." [...] Actor Adam Brody joked [...] "They Brothers just didn't want to cross their streams with a whole bunch of Batmans in the universe." [...] Warner Bros. relaunched development for the solo Green Lantern film, released in 2011 as a critical and financial disappointment. Meanwhile, film adaptations for The Flash and Wonder Woman continued to languish in development while filming for a Superman reboot was commencing in 2011 with Man <b>of</b> <b>Steel,</b> produced by Nolan and written by Batman screenwriter David S. Goyer. Shortly after filming had finished for Man <b>of</b> <b>Steel,</b> Warner Bros hired Will Beall to write the script for a new Justice League film. Warner Bros. president Jeff Robinov explained that Man <b>of</b> <b>Steel</b> would be [...] "setting the tone for what the movies are going to be like going forward. In that, it's definitely a first step." [...] The film included references to the existence of other superheroes in the DC Universe, and setting the tone for a shared fictional universe of DC Comics characters on film. Goyer stated that should Green Lantern appear in a future installment, it would be a rebooted version of the character and not connected to the 2011 film. With the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> Man <b>of</b> <b>Steel</b> in June 2013, Goyer was hired to write a sequel, as well as a new Justice League, with the Beall draft being scrapped. The sequel was later revealed to be Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a team up film featuring Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg in a minor role that will become more significant in leading up to the proposed Justice League film. The universe is separate from Nolan and Goyer's work on The Dark Knight trilogy, although Nolan is still involved as an executive producer for Batman v Superman. In April 2014, it was announced that Zack Snyder would also be directing Goyer's Justice League script. Warner Bros. was reportedly courting Chris Terrio to rewrite Justice League the following July, after having been impressed with his rewrite of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
