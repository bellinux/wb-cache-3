Boeing maintained that the most likely cause of the crash was that the co-pilot inadvertently deflected the rudder hard-over in the wrong direction while in a panic and for unknown reasons maintained this input until impact with the ground. According to aviation law firm Katzman, Lampert, and McClune, which represented families and victims of both US Air 427 and United 585, Boeing did not contest in open court that its 737's rudder was prone to an uncommanded rudder issue while in flight. Nonetheless, Boeing agreed to redesign the rudder control system with a redundant backup and paid for the retrofit of the entire worldwide 737 fleet. As one of the NTSB's main recommendations, airlines were required to add four additional channels of information — pilot rudder pedal commands — into flight data recorders, to which the FAA gave airlines until August 2001 to comply.

50|$|Rudder ratio {{refers to}} a value that is {{monitored}} by the computerized flight control systems in modern aircraft. The ratio relates the aircraft airspeed to the <b>rudder</b> <b>deflection</b> setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately {{within the range of}} the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw, or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with single}} engined aircraft, {{situations}} where the aircraft is at high power and has a high angle of attack (such as take off) will cause a slight, but noticeable yawing motion. The engine with the down-moving blades towards the wingtip produces more yaw and roll than the other engine, because the moment (arm) of that engine's thrust about the aircraft center of gravity is greater. Thus, the engine with down-moving blades towards the fuselage will be [...] "critical", because its failure and the associated reliance on the other engine will require a larger <b>rudder</b> <b>deflection</b> by the pilot to maintain straight flight than if the other engine had failed. For most aircraft (which have clockwise rotating propellers), this is the left engine.|$|E

5000|$|The Flyer {{series of}} {{aircraft}} {{were the first}} to achieve controlled heavier-than-air flight, but some of the mechanical techniques the Wrights used to accomplish this were not influential for the development of aviation as a whole, although their theoretical achievements were. The Flyer design depended on wing-warping and a foreplane or [...] "canard" [...] for pitch control, features which would not scale and produced a hard-to-control aircraft. However, the Wrights' pioneering use of [...] "roll control" [...] by twisting the wings to change wingtip angle in relation to the airstream — even with a British patent of 1868 for such technology that had apparently been completely forgotten by the time the 20th century had dawned — led directly to the more practical use of ailerons by their imitators, such as Curtiss and Farman. The Wrights' original concept of simultaneous coordinated roll and yaw control (rear <b>rudder</b> <b>deflection),</b> which they discovered in 1902, perfected in 1903-1905, and patented in 1906, represents the solution to controlled flight and is used today on virtually every fixed-wing aircraft. The Wright patent included the use of hinged rather than warped surfaces for the forward elevator and rear rudder. Other features that made the Flyer a success were highly efficient wings and propellers, which resulted from the Wrights' exacting wind tunnel tests and made the most of the marginal power delivered by their early [...] "homebuilt" [...] engines; slow flying speeds (and hence survivable accidents); and an incremental test/development approach.
