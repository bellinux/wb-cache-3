5|$|The road makes several {{appearances}} in literature. In Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, the titular character <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road {{trying to escape}} from London to Dover, though in the narrative the street is still partly rural in nature. After suffering an attack of amnesia, the main character of George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter, Dorothy Hare, finds herself alone on Old Kent Road. In 1985, the BBC arts series Arena included a documentary about the road.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E

5|$|The Q11 {{begins at}} Queens Boulevard, and <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{entire length of}} Woodhaven Boulevard and a short portion of Cross Bay Boulevard to Pitkin Avenue. The route then turns east along Pitkin, then south along several local streets through the eastern portion of Howard Beach, running near Aqueduct Racetrack and the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station of the subway and AirTrain JFK. At 160th Avenue, the route splits into two branches; a western branch to Old Howard Beach and an eastern branch to Hamilton Beach (the two neighborhoods are {{separated}} by Hawtree Creek). Both terminate near the southern coast of their respective neighborhoods at 165th Avenue. Select weekday rush hour trips short-turn at Pitkin Avenue. During late night hours, all Q11 trips terminate at Pitkin Avenue; prior to 2010, 24-hour service had been provided to Old Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E

5|$|Robben {{completed}} his move to Real Madrid on a five-year deal on 22 August 2007, with the transfer fee reported as £24million (€35million). He made his debut on 18 September {{as a substitute}} for Raúl during a Champions League match against Werder Bremen, which Real Madrid won 2–1. His La Liga debut came on 23 September, {{as a substitute for}} Royston Drenthe in a 1–1 away draw against Real Valladolid. On 10 February 2008, Robben scored his first goal, coming at home in a 7–0 victory against Valladolid. Robben proved crucial for many Real Madrid matches, making his famous <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left wing and quickly became a first choice for the left midfield position, making 28 appearances during his debut season and scoring five goals. Real Madrid won the Liga title with multiple games to spare, and were already the champions of Spain when they played their arch-rivals Barcelona on 7 May 2008. The Barcelona players formed a guard of honour as the Madrid team came onto the pitch at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Robben played an important part in Real Madrid's subsequent 4–1 victory, scoring the champions' second goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of Phoenix's freeway system {{is composed of}} three major freeways—Interstate 10, Interstate 17, and U.S. Route 60. Interstate 10, being a transcontinental route between California and Florida, is the most heavily traveled freeway in the Valley of the Sun. Interstate 17 <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> center of Arizona, connecting Phoenix with Sedona, Prescott, Flagstaff and the Grand Canyon. U.S. Route 60 spans most of the country, but is only a controlled-access highway (i.e. freeway) for a few short stints, one of them being in the East Valley. West of Phoenix, it shuttles travelers to cities such as Wickenburg, Kingman and Las Vegas (by way of a connection in Wickenburg with U.S. Route 93). In addition to these three freeways, three beltways, Routes 101, 202, and 303 loop around Phoenix, the East Valley, and the West Valley, respectively. State Route 51 connects Downtown with the northern reaches of the city, and Arizona State Route 143 is a distributor for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

5|$|US-64 and SH-51 proceed {{southeast}} {{from downtown}} along another freeway, the Broken Arrow Expressway. Between Lewis Avenue and Sheridan Road, a rail line <b>runs</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> median of the highway. After the freeway splits {{away from the}} railroad alignment, it comes to an interchange with I-44/ SH-66. From here, the Broken Arrow Expressway heads southeast to an interchange with the Mingo Valley Expressway, which carries US-169. Here, US-64 splits away to follow the southbound Mingo Valley Expressway, while SH-51 continues southeast on the Broken Arrow Expressway. US-64/ US-169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike. The freeway merges with a free section of the turnpike, heading west. At an interchange with Memorial Drive, US-64 turns south, splitting away from the freeway. US-169 ends at this point, and tolls resume on the Creek Turnpike {{to the west of}} the interchange.|$|E
