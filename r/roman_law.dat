5|$|Legal studies {{advanced}} {{during the}} 12th century. Both secular law and canon law, or ecclesiastical law, were {{studied in the}} High Middle Ages. Secular law, or <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> was advanced greatly by {{the discovery of the}} Corpus Juris Civilis in the 11th century, and by 1100 <b>Roman</b> <b>law</b> was being taught at Bologna. This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. Canon law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of canon law—the Decretum.|$|E

5|$|In the West, law {{had been}} {{administered}} on a highly localized or tribal basis, and {{private property rights}} {{may have been a}} novelty of the Roman era, particularly among Celtic peoples. <b>Roman</b> <b>law</b> facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite who found their new privileges as citizens to be advantageous. The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> replacing the local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian's efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years, the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus, to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of law, Justinian I's reforms had a clear effect on the {{evolution}} of jurisprudence, with his Corpus Juris Civilis becoming the basis for revived <b>Roman</b> <b>law</b> in the West, while Leo III's Ecloga influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slavic world.|$|E
5|$|Outside the military, Latin {{never became}} the {{language}} of everyday life in the East. An exception was the Roman colony of Berytus (present-day Beirut), where a Latin education could be obtained, and which became famous for its school of <b>Roman</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{still more}} {{resonant}} {{aspect of his}} legacy was the uniform rewriting of <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia.

5|$|During {{the later}} part of Stephen's reign Foliot {{was active in}} {{judicial}} affairs, including a case in 1150 involving sanctuary and his kinsman Roger, the Earl of Hereford, which {{ended up in the}} court of Archbishop Theobald. Foliot's participation in legal affairs led him in 1153 to employ a clerk specialising in <b>Roman</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jews were a {{significant}} {{minority in the}} Byzantine state throughout its history, and, according to <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> they constituted a legally recognised religious group. In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of tensions and persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests, the majority of Jews found themselves outside the Empire; those left inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.|$|E

50|$|Alaric {{displayed}} similar {{wisdom in}} political affairs by appointing a commission {{headed by the}} referendary Anianus to prepare an abstract of the <b>Roman</b> <b>laws</b> and imperial decrees, which would form the authoritative code for his Roman subjects. This is generally known as the Breviarium Alaricianum or Breviary of Alaric.|$|R
5|$|Justinian {{achieved}} lasting fame {{through his}} judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> {{something that had}} not previously been attempted. The total of Justinian's legislature is known today as the Corpus juris civilis. It consists of the Codex Iustinianus, the Digesta or Pandectae, the Institutiones, and the Novellae.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps. Due {{to the demands of}} the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in Transalpine Gaul (Latin: Gallia Transalpina), by Brutus in Macedonia, and by Pompey in Pharsalus. This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and <b>Roman</b> <b>law</b> still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election. Foliot later ordered {{a copy of the}} Digest for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in <b>Roman</b> <b>law.</b> Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.|$|E

The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Jardine {{was called}} to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1893. He {{returned}} to India, where he practised at the Bombay Bar until 1916. At the time, British barristers dominated the Indian legal system, finding considerable financial reward, but causing resentment among the Indian legal profession. At the same time, Jardine held positions of increasing influence in India. He was Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and <b>Roman</b> <b>Law</b> from 1898 to 1902 and then Principal of the Government Law School until 1903. Subsequently, he was Clerk of the Crown, before being appointed Advocate General of Bombay in 1915 before retiring from India in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships, which also violated <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> which mandated a decade between consulships, further weakening the primarily norms-based constitution. The {{attempts to}} recall the general Sulla led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E

5|$|Maltese courts became British {{subject on}} 5 October 1813, {{months before the}} Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony. At this point the British, under Governor Thomas Maitland, adopted a {{codification}} of a mixed system of Civil Law, which included <b>Roman</b> <b>Law,</b> Code Napoléon and continental law. Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E
5|$|Scots law has a basis {{derived from}} <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> {{combining}} features of both uncodified civil law, {{dating back to}} the Corpus Juris Civilis, and common law with medieval sources. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales. Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|The Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD {{during the}} reign of Emperor Claudius, {{subsequently}} conquering much of Britain, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as Britannia province. The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the Catuvellauni led by Caratacus. Later, an uprising led by Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the Battle of Watling Street. This era saw a Greco-Roman culture prevail with the introduction of <b>Roman</b> <b>law,</b> Roman architecture, aqueducts, sewers, many agricultural items and silk. In the 3rd century, Emperor Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (now York), where Constantine was subsequently proclaimed emperor.|$|E
