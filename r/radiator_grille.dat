25|$|Pre-war Triumphs {{carried a}} stylised Globe badge, usually on the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille,</b> {{and this was}} also used on the first three models {{produced}} under Standard's control.|$|E
25|$|In May 1980, {{a series}} of mass strikes at the Togliatti plant {{involving}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} workers were reported by the western press. In 1982 the VAZ-2107, a deluxe version of the 2105, was introduced; it featured a better engine, refined interiors and a chrome <b>radiator</b> <b>grille.</b> In 1984, the VAZ-2104 station wagon completed the line-up.|$|E
25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> has been Daimler's {{distinguishing}} feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E
5000|$|Automotive - air filters, oil filters, {{silencer}} tubes, <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> running boards, flooring, motorcycle silencers, ventilation grids, tractor engine ventilation, etc.|$|R
5000|$|... 1998 - Guardian {{acquired}} trim manufacturer Lab. Radio in Valencia, Spain. Founded in 1977, products included wheel covers, {{interior trim}} panels, emblems, cowl panels, door belt moldings, <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> and air bag covers.|$|R
50|$|Other {{original}} interior spaces include elevator lobbies, judges' chambers, and {{the district}} law library. Terrazzo and marble floors, marble wainscot, bronze elevator doors with bas-relief panels, and bronze <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> are found throughout the building.|$|R
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1934 model year, a {{significant}} portion of the LaSalle was more closely related to the Oldsmobile, than to senior Cadillacs. Again, Earl's work with the LaSalle resulted in a graceful vehicle, led by an elegant and thin <b>radiator</b> <b>grille.</b> Earl's other contribution was the modern, airplane-styled, semi-shielded portholes along the side of the hood. All bodies were now made by Fleetwood.|$|E
25|$|For 2003 {{the design}} of the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille,</b> {{headlamp}} inner panels, and sills were altered. The interior and mirrors were altered, while the suspension and braking systems were also refined. The Skyline Coupe was introduced as a version of Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe for Japanese market. Also, the Skyline 350GT went on sale. It is a version of the Infiniti G35 sport sedan with a six-speed manual transmission for the Japanese market, only available with the 3.5 litre engine. The Skyline 350GT and Skyline 350GT Premium sedan went on sale on 2003-06-03.|$|E
25|$|The Venturer II had {{a common}} front profile for all models, {{together}} with a standard dash panel featuring a four-part <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps. A rear-end revision marked {{the launch of the}} Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced for underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical front profile, and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer – front engined, underfloor-engined with a centre entrance and underfloor-engined with a front entrance. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than the}} <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> and the {{carburation}} {{there was little}} difference between the standard Bentley R Type and the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn. The R Type was the more popular marque, with some 2,500 units manufactured during its run to the Silver Dawn's 760.|$|R
50|$|Visually {{similar to}} their Class 17 Type 1 product, though longer, and with the <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> in {{the ends of the}} engine covers rather than the sides. It was {{similarly}} unsuccessful and was scrapped (in 1967) where it was built having done very little work, mainly around the International Combustion works in Derby.|$|R
50|$|Cars with rear engines, {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle and {{the early}} Porsches, {{necessarily}} have no <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> in front, and so have horn grilles placed below their headlights. Some motor scooters have this feature as well, placed below the handlebars. Their horn grilles may be made of cheap plastic. These vehicles and the cheaper cars have only one horn.|$|R
25|$|Daimler buses were {{fitted with}} {{proprietary}} diesel engines, the majority by the Gardner company, of Eccles, Lancashire, {{although there were}} a few hundred Daimler diesels built in the 1940s & 1950s, and the Leyland O.680 was offered as an option on the Fleetline (designated CRL6) after the merger with Leyland. The bus chassis were also fitted with bodywork built by various outside contractors, as is standard in the British bus industry, so, at a casual glance, there is no real identifying feature of a Daimler bus, apart from the badges (Front engined Daimler buses retained the distinctive fluted <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> top). The last Daimler Fleetline was built at the traditional Daimler factory in Radford, Coventry, in 1973. After that date, the remaining buses were built at the Leyland factory in Farington, Preston, Lancashire, the final eight years of Fleetline production being badged as Leylands. The last Fleetline built was bodied by Eastern Coach Works in 1981.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{estate was}} developed {{in the shape of a}} car <b>radiator</b> <b>grille,</b> with the roads named after various vehicle manufacturers. Coaches regularly picked up holidaymakers throughout the 1930s from Ilford and Romford. The Jaywick Miniature Railway, an [...] gauge miniature railway operated in Jaywick from 1936 to 1939. The locomotive was a model of a GNR Stirling 4-2-2.|$|E
500|$|As the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker {{needed to}} fit inside, {{the largest of}} all the models was the seven-foot FAB 1, which cost £2,500 (approximately £ today) to build. The Rolls-Royce's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson. Rolls-Royce Ltd. {{supervised}} {{the construction of the}} plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> for close-up shots of the front of the car. In exchange for its cooperation, the company requested that a Spirit of Ecstasy be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as [...] "Rolls".|$|E
50|$|The {{launch of}} the 160 SR coincided with a {{revision}} of the K12. The <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> were given a chrome strip through the centre and the original amber indicators were replaced with clear ones. The rear bumper was restyled and made more robust (apparently in response to French parking habits). The interior was also given a makeover, with more supportive seats, thicker glass and better soundproofing.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} retains many original {{features and}} rich finishes. Marble floors and pilasters (attached columns) {{are found in}} the ornate entrance lobby. The coffered (recessed) ceiling is intricately detailed with rosettes. The interior wall contains an elaborate bronze screen that led to the original postal workroom. Other original features that remain include writing desks, <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> and pendant light fixtures, which were specially designed by Rogers.|$|R
50|$|The Tipo was facelifted in 1993 and a three door {{version was}} added, {{as well as}} minor {{exterior}} changes (the two evolutions of the car can be differentiated by their slightly different <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> and headlamps) and improved specifications; safety features like stiffer bodyshells, driver's airbag, and side impact bars {{were added to the}} range. This included the new S, SX, and SLX trim levels, as well as a new eight valve 2.0 GT model.|$|R
500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford twin-choke carburettor. The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified <b>radiator</b> <b>grille,</b> and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E
2500|$|The North American Specification (NAS) Defender 110 {{sold for}} the 1993 model year carried a badge above the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> which read [...] "Defender," [...] whereas the NAS Defender 90 sold for the 1994 to 1997 model years had [...] "Land Rover" [...] spelled {{across the top}} of the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> in {{individual}} letter decals. NAS Defenders also carried a cast plaque on the rear tub in the original style of the Series Station wagons with [...] "Defender 110" [...] or [...] "Defender 90" [...] below the Land Rover lozenge and the vehicle's unique limited edition production run number.|$|E
2500|$|... 969V. The Samara {{engine was}} mostly {{designed}} and produced in-house, {{had a new}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC) design and was driven by a more modern rubber belt. The five-door VAZ-2109 hatchback followed in 1987, and the four-door 1.5 L sedan, the VAZ-21099, was introduced in 1990. The same year, the front sides and <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> were restyled on the whole Samara range.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Chrysler {{introduced}} the Cordoba, the company's first coupe produced {{specifically for the}} personal luxury market, although they had earlier declared that there would [...] "never" [...] be a smaller Chrysler. These models enjoyed large sales figures in the mid-1970s with their intimate, luxury-oriented feel, plush interiors, and mostly vintage styling cues like Rolls Royce-style <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> opera windows, and vinyl roofs. The new Cordoba finished second to the Chevrolet Monte Carlo in sales for that segment.|$|R
50|$|The two {{original}} courtrooms retain many original finishes and features. Both feature elaborate ornamentation on {{the wood}} walls and plaster ceilings. Courtroom No. 1, used for District Court proceedings since its construction, has Oregon maple burl paneling with exotic wood inlays and decorative aluminum grilles. The Courtroom Lobby retains original <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> bronze Art Deco light fixtures, and marble floor and walls. Two black-and-gold marble benches provide seating. Courtroom No. 2 features walnut burl veneer walls and Art Deco wall sconces.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his lack}} of day-to-day control over the firm, Miniger {{nonetheless}} continued to {{play a vital role}} in the company. He pushed for Electric Auto-lite to continue its expansion into additional automotive fields. Miniger helped structure the company's purchase of Alemite Die Casting in 1935, and later forced it to expand into the manufacture of <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> door handles, and assorted automotive hardware. The company purchased a bumper plant, hub cap plant, and spring cover plant the following year at his insistence, and built its first spark plug plant in 1936.|$|R
2500|$|The car used Ford's {{contemporary}} {{design language}} of the period with the black louvred <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> and straked rear lamp clusters, as well as introducing the aerodynamic [...] "bustle-back" [...] bootlid stump (trademarked by Ford as Aeroback) which would be further developed in the forthcoming Sierra and Scorpio; the stump was proven to reduce the car's aerodynamic drag co-efficient significantly, which was a class leading 0.37 at launch.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its final}} years, the LaSalle once again became more Cadillac-like in its {{appearance}} and details. The narrow <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> opening was retained and was flanked by additional side grill work. Headlights, which had moved down and been secured to the [...] "cat-walk", were again {{attached to the}} radiator shell. One interesting feature, adopted by LaSalle in these years, was a Sunroof, marketed as the [...] "Sunshine Turret Top". Sales climbed up from 15,501 in 1938 to 23,028 in 1939.|$|E
2500|$|His {{previous}} Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931 was rebuilt significantly. The {{overall layout}} {{and the simple}} twin deep chassis rails remained, but little else. The bodywork remained similar, with the narrow body, the tombstone <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> and the semi-spatted wheels, but the mechanics were new. Most significantly, a larger, heavier and considerably more powerful Rolls-Royce R V12 engine replaced the old Napier Lion, again with supercharger. This required two prominent [...] "knuckles" [...] atop the bodywork, to cover the V12 engine's camboxes.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building has relatively simple finishes that remain primarily in the courtrooms, judges' chambers, lobbies, stair halls, and corridors. The first-floor elevator and postal lobbies retain many original finishes. Floors are covered with pre-cast orange terrazzo set in pigmented grout with polished Travertine and Vermont marble inlay. The plaster walls have marble wainscot. Brass <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> bronze writing desks, and an iron grille above the original service entrance remain. The transom area above the opening to the staircase in the west entrance vestibule is adorned with a raised-relief plaster eagle, which conveys the federal presence.|$|R
50|$|The AEC Regent II was a front-engined {{double-decker}} bus built by AEC from 1945 to 1947. Despite officially being {{a new type}} it was {{very similar to the}} 1929 Regent. The Regent IIs were all documented as being new with the A173 (also known as the 7.7-litre) engine and a four speed sliding mesh gearbox. The only vehicles that were not standard were the 100 purchased by B.M.M.O. (Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company), which were classified as O661/20 as the front had to be re-designed so they could carry similar bonnets and <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> that B.M.M.O. had designed for the double deckers they built themselves.|$|R
5000|$|There were changes however, albeit small ones. A {{facelift}} in 1975 {{gave the}} Marina new <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> dashboard, seats, suspension modifications and increased soundproofing. In May 1977 Marinas started {{to appear at}} dealers equipped with Allegro style seats: apart from rationalising the procuring and production processes, this was said to give the Marinas more comfortable and supportive seating. [...] The overhead camshaft O-Series engine (that was also used for Leyland Princess) appeared in 1.7-litre form in 1978 to replace the larger B-Series 1.8-litre models. A changed grille, including driving lights, a front spoiler and redesigned bumpers and rear lights were added to all models.|$|R
2500|$|The car was {{available}} {{only as an}} Avant, and was sold only in European markets. [...] Visual differences for the RS6 Plus included the [...] "black optic pack", which consisted of black finish to the framing of the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille,</b> exterior window trims, tailgate lower trim, roof rails, and exhaust tailpipes. [...] It quickly sold out once it was released (999 units total). [...] The last three digits of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) are reproduced on a plaque inside the car, displayed on the centre console.|$|E
2500|$|The 1962 {{model year}} saw an {{extensive}} facelift. The <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> was flattened and shortened. The hood release {{was moved to}} a knob {{at the top of}} the grille frame. The central grille emblem was deleted, except on the top-line Signet 200 2-door hardtop model, which received a black-painted grille with a round central emblem incorporating the red-and-blue stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant emblem. The Signet 200 had pleated, leather-like bucket seats, custom tailored interior trim, deep-pile carpeting, special trunk lid emblem, different headlamp frames and special side moldings; it was America's lowest-priced hardtop with bucket seats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1983 as [...] "Land Rover One Ten", and in 1984 the [...] "Land Rover Ninety" [...] was added - the numbers representing the respective wheelbases in inches. (In fact the Ninety was nearer 93 inches at 92.9".) The number was spelled in full in advertising and in handbooks and manuals, and the vehicles also carried badges above the <b>radiator</b> <b>grille</b> which read [...] "Land Rover 90" [...] or [...] "Land Rover 110", with the number rendered numerically. The Ninety and One Ten replaced the earlier Land Rover Series, {{and at the time}} of launch, the only other Land Rover model in production was the Range Rover.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} use {{of automotive}} body surface design data is described. This data has been originally created elsewhere in GM's two large computer graphics systems of CADANCE and Fisher Graphics. As a supplier exterior lighting components, <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles,</b> energy absorbing soft faced bumper systems, and other associated items, Guide has become most {{dependent on the}} corporate computer graphics systems to supply accurate car body styling and sheet metal surfacing information {{for the design of}} their products. The presentation includes the origin and transfer of design data to a remote user site; its use in the design of their products; and the ultimate production of detailed drawings, N/C punched tapes, and subsequent downstream transfers of detailed part data to a turnkey system for tool design purposes...|$|R
5000|$|The final {{production}} engine was fitted with the newly developed EMD 16-645E engine {{in place of}} the 16-567 (same shell but with larger pistons and other components), called the G26C design and rated at 2,200 hp. Externally the engines were similar to their predecessors but the larger engine spun at a higher rate (900 rpm versus the original 835 rpm), so larger <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles</b> were provided for heat dissipation. However, the radiator elements themselves were identical to the first order. The eight new engines were delivered across 1969-1970, and as before, the class was built in Clyde, tested around Sydney then delivered to Melbourne. [...] On 14th August 2017 Seymour Railway Heritage Centre took acquisition of class leader X37 for preservation purposes.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} the HMMWV (Humvee) has ties with Jeep. In 1971, Jeep's Defense and Government Products Division was turned into AM General, a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of American Motors Corporation, which also owned Jeep. In 1979, while still owned by American Motors, AM General began the first steps toward designing the Humvee. AM General also continued manufacturing the two-wheel-drive DJ, which Jeep created in 1953. The General Motors Hummer and Chrysler Jeep have been waging battle in U.S. courts over {{the right to use}} seven slots in their respective <b>radiator</b> <b>grilles.</b> Chrysler Jeep claims it has the exclusive rights to use the seven vertical slits since it is the sole remaining assignee of the various companies since Willys gave their postwar jeeps seven slots instead of Ford's nine-slot design for the Jeep.|$|R
