Ultra-high-strength (UHS) steels {{are very}} {{interesting}} materials for many applications where high strength can be utilized to create lighter {{and more effective}} constructions. The poor formability of UHS steels, however, may limit the usefulness of these materials in many applications. In this work, some experiments using a flexible roll forming machine developed at the Chair of Manufacturing Technology (LFT), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg were carried out using 4 mm-thick bainitic martensitic UHS steels (YS/TS 960 / 1000 and 1100 / 1250) and the outcomes have been analysed. Results of these experimental tests show that using roll forming {{it is possible to}} bend test materials to an angle of 90 º without damages with an evidently smaller radius than in air bending. The radius obtained using roll forming can be as small as 40 % of the value used in air bending. Tests also show that with the method used in these tests it is possible to make roll forming for the whole length of the plate. The tests proved that the NC-controlled single-step <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>method</b> has potential for manufacturing small batches of bend profiles; however, more development has to be carried out if the process is to be made suitable for industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} model has been {{developed}} to simulate the forming of a channel section profile with the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> <b>method.</b> The model has been optimized to experimental results with respect to strains {{at the edge of}} the sheet and spring back of the sides of the profile. Finite element models with a coarse mesh have been compared to models with a finer mesh. The models with to fine mesh become instable and a model with a rather coarse mesh was finally chosen. Both the models with shell elements and the models with solid elements have been used in the simulations. The simulations with shell elements gave very good results both for the geometry shape and the strains {{at the edge of the}} sheet. The reaction forces at the tools found in the simulations was only half of the reaction forces fond in the experiments. The simulations with the solid element model showed very good results for the reaction forces while the geometry shape of the sheet was really bad. The spring back was much larger in the simulations than in the experiments. The shell element model was chosen because of the excessive spring back with the solid element model. The spring back of the sides of the sheet differs only a few percent between the simulation and the experiment results when using the shell element model.

Thats exactly what the small company Absolicon Solar Collectors placed in Härnösand thinks and carries through. By developing and manufacturing concentrated solarcollectors with a complete runningcentral for producing steam intended for industrial purpose are they pushing the technology and industry forward. They have so far manufactured small volumes of pilot plants but will now have the ability to manufacture larger volumes. To accomplish that they will {{have to be able to}} speed up the manufacturing process regarding some of the processes in the manufacturing line. As a part of the first station in the line will they need a method to semi automatically bend the two longest edges of the collector. It is this method this thesis is all about. A functional prototyp is also a part of the desired result. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> became the <b>method</b> of choice. After choosing method was a small research around the subject accomplished containing visits at companies and literature studying. The demands of the curvature of the bends were also more closely investigated to get a better grip of the demands on the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> mill. Rollforming is an effective way to change the profile of steel plates and strips. The higher rollspeed the faster rollforming. By calculating tension and elongation of the steel or by testing can the number of passes and the length of the mill be determined. In the part theory of the report is essential theory and rules regarding <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> compiled for simple calculations and general understanding of some of aspects in roll and mill design. In the part method of the report is the work regarding planning and contructing the two hand made prototypes. Prototype one is manufactured for the purpose of testing stands, shafts and rolls. Derived from the results of testing prototype one is the final prototype constructed and made. The work is resulting in a final prototype containing two passes which is not producing the desired final bend angle but the function of the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> as a <b>method</b> can still be validated and presented. The steel strip is easily by hand dragged trough the mill and no defects or other problem were encountered. The final prototype is not fully meeting the demands of the final bend angle due to the short deadline it was made in. Two more passes are still needed do be added for the final angle.

40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} (FEA) of nonlinear {{problems in}} solid mechanics {{is a time}} consuming process, but it can deal rigorously {{with the problems of}} both geometric, contact and material nonlinearity that occur in <b>roll</b> <b>forming.</b> The simulation time limits the application of nonlinear FEA to these problems in industrial practice, so that most applications of nonlinear FEA are in theoretical studies and engineering consulting or troubleshooting. Instead, quick methods based on a global assumption of the deformed shape have been used by the roll-forming industry. These approaches are of limited accuracy. This paper proposes a new form-finding method - a relaxation method to solve the nonlinear problem of predicting the deformed shape due to plastic deformation in <b>roll</b> <b>forming.</b> This <b>method</b> involves applying a small perturbation to each discrete node in order to update the local displacement field, while minimizing plastic work. This is iteratively applied to update the positions of all nodes. As the method assumes a local displacement field, the strain and stress components at each node are calculated explicitly. Continued perturbation of nodes leads to optimisation of the displacement field. Another important feature of this paper is a new approach to consideration of strain history. For a stable and continuous process such as rolling and <b>roll</b> <b>forming,</b> the strain history of a point is represented spatially by the states at a row of nodes leading in the direction of rolling to the current one. Therefore the increment of the strain components and the work-increment of a point can be found without moving the object forward. Using this method we can find the solution for rolling or <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> in just one step. This method is expected to be faster than commercial finite element packages by eliminating repeated solution of large sets of simultaneous equations and the need to update boundary conditions that represent the rolls...|$|R

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> of ultra-high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) {{and other}} high strength alloys is an advanced manufacturing methodology {{with the ability}} of cold forming those materials to complex three-dimensional shapes for lightweight structural applications. Due to their high strength, most of these materials have a reduced ductility which excludes conventional sheet <b>forming</b> <b>methods</b> under cold <b>forming</b> conditions. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is possible due to its low strains and incremental forming characteristic. Recent research investigates the development of high strength nano-structured aluminum sheet and titanium alloys, {{as well as their}} behaviour in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> with regard to formability, material behaviour and shape defects. The development of new materials is often limited to small scale samples due to the high preparation costs. In contrast, industrial application needs larger scale tests for validation, especially in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> where a minimum sheet length is required to feed the sample trough the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> machine.

This is because of the excessive computational time due to the long strip length and the multiple numbers of stands that have to be modelled.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand of reducing the body weight of automobiles, the utilization of advanced high strength steel has increased dramatically in recent years. However, high residual stress and redundant strain caused by the traditional cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is still an outstanding problem. Under such circumstances, the Chain-die <b>forming</b> <b>method</b> is developed as a novel sheet metal forming approach which combines <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> and stamping processes. A Chain-die former employs discrete die blocks which run on a chain track with significant virtual roll radius, simulating a <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. Meanwhile, individual pairs of die blocks deform the sheet metal gradually acting as a stamping process. Through the enlargement of virtual roll radius, the peak longitudinal strain developed during the forming process is dramatically decreased (contained in the elastic region), leading to significantly reduced residual stress and almost no redundant deformation. Due to low longitudinal strain, the cross-sections of the product {{can be considered as}} a plane strain state throughout the entire forming process, allowing utilization of 2 -D plane strain simulations to represent for 3 -D simulations. In this paper, using 2 -D FE stamping simulations and 3 -D FE Chain-die forming simulations in assisting die design for a Chain-die formed threshold product using AHSS material is discussed. The results show 2 -D stamping simulations are able to predict the average forming angles of 3 -D simulation results with high accuracy and much higher efficiency. In the initial tooling design process, 2 -D stamping models should be employed to design the tooling geometry in order to compensate the springback effect, followed by 3 -D Chain-die forming models validating the 2 -D design and providing additional information such as variation of the flange angle along the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal bow condition.

Abstract: For {{the flexible}} <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> {{of the control}} system, this paper introduces a method that machine vision bind to the flexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> control system. The detection method for sheet metal forming is image acquisition, image processing and other means for the extraction of sheet metal forming in some time section contour curve. Compare extraction section contour curve with the moment theory section contour curve in the control system, get the deviation value and feedback to the control system that interpolation arithmetic to realize closed loop control...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is an {{advanced}} {{sheet metal forming}} process for producing variable cross section profiles. Flange wrinkling at the transition zone where the cross section changes is a major defect in the flexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. In this paper, the flange wrinkling at the transition zone is studied using finite element analysis. The {{results showed that the}} strip deformation at the transition zone can be considered as a combination of two strip deformations observed in the conventional <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process and the flanging process. According to finite element analysis results, when the flange wrinkling occurs, compressive longitudinal strain is smaller than the necessary compressive longitudinal strain calculated by mathematical modeling to obtain the intended profile geometry in the compression zone. Therefore, comparison of compressive longitudinal strain obtained from the finite element analysis and the necessary compressive longitudinal strain is a good criterion to predict the flange wrinkling occurrence. A flexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> setup was developed. Longitudinal strain history is obtained from the finite element simulation and is compared with the experimental data from the flexible <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> setup. Results show a good agreement and confirm the finite element analysis...|$|R

50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an uncoiler. The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each set of <b>rolls</b> <b>forming</b> a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal parallel shafts supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> line.|$|R
