5|$|While Australian Naval <b>Reserve</b> {{personnel}} {{are assigned to}} permanent units, {{most members of the}} Army <b>Reserve</b> and Air Force <b>Reserve</b> are members of <b>reserve</b> units. Most of the RAAF's <b>reserve</b> units are not intended to be deployed, and <b>reserve</b> {{personnel are}} generally attached to regular air force units during their periods of active service. The Army <b>Reserve</b> is organised into permanent combat and support units, though most are currently manned at levels well below their authorised strengths and are not capable of deploying as formed units. There have been long-running debates over whether the Army <b>Reserve</b> and its structure remain relevant to modern warfare.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point (designated as Blakeney National Nature <b>Reserve)</b> is a National Nature <b>Reserve</b> {{situated}} near to {{the villages}} of Blakeney, Morston and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England. Its main feature is a 6.4km (4mi) spit of shingle and sand dunes, but the <b>reserve</b> also includes salt marshes, tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland. It has been managed by the National Trust since 1912, and lies within the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Ramsar listings. The <b>reserve</b> is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and a World Biosphere <b>Reserve.</b> The Point has been studied {{for more than a}} century, following pioneering ecological studies by botanist Francis Wall Oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist Emma Turner.|$|E

5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board should be abolished.

5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a <b>reserve</b> component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval <b>Reserve,</b> Australian Army <b>Reserve</b> and Royal Australian Air Force <b>Reserve.</b> The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of <b>reserve</b> personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly deployable yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E

5|$|Early {{in the war}} twenty-four <b>reserve</b> cavalry regiments {{were formed}} to provide {{training}} to recruits for the cavalry and yeomanry regiments. Only four of them saw any combat—the 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th <b>Reserve</b> Cavalry Regiments—all during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. The 6th <b>Reserve</b> Cavalry Regiment, with thirty-five officers and 851 other ranks, was the largest unit then available to Dublin commander Brigadier General William Lowe of the 7th Dragoon Guards.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of the 20th century, due to a {{widespread}} distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the <b>reserve</b> military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army <b>Reserve</b> within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army <b>Reserve</b> has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army <b>Reserve</b> are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from <b>Reserve</b> units.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, in {{an attempt}} to rectify this, the Ready <b>Reserve</b> scheme was established. Under this scheme the 6th Brigade, an {{existing}} Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time, was converted to a Ready <b>Reserve</b> formation. The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal <b>Reserve</b> status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and <b>reserve</b> armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular <b>Reserve)</b> may be recalled for duty as needed.
