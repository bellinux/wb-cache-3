5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok.

5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly.

Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E
