5000|$|There are {{two types}} of twig, {{vegetative}} twigs and fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past.

50|$|Acronicta is a genus of noctuid moths {{containing}} about 150 species distributed {{mainly in}} the temperate Holarctic, with some in adjacent subtropical regions. Caterpillars of most Acronicta species are unmistakable, with brightly colored hairy spikes, and often feed quite visibly on common foliate trees. The larva of the Smeared Dagger Moth (A. oblinita) is unusually hairy even for this genus http://www.pbase.com/ronnie_14187/image/45269430. Acronicta species are generally known as dagger moths, as most have one or more black dagger-shaped markings on their forewing uppersides. But some species have a conspicuous dark <b>ring</b> <b>marking</b> instead.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underlying}} storyline of the semi-main event, {{or fifth}} match {{of the evening}} {{was not so much}} between the teams of Atlantis, Diamante Azul and Místico II and their opponents Último Guerrero, Euforia and Rey Escorpión (all part of Los Guerreros del Infierno) but instead centered on the internal struggle of Los Guerreros themselves. Earlier in the year Rey Escorpión had a fall out, especially with Último Guerrero and at one point Rey Escorpión was officially kicked out of Los Guerreros del Infierno and replaced with Euforia and Niebla Roja as his replacements. In the weeks and months following Escorpión still teamed up with Último Guerrero and other Guerreros. They even won a tournament to earn them a match for the CMLL World Trios Championship. The following week the tension erupted as miscommunication cause the team to lose to the trios champions El Bufete del Amor (Marco Corleon, Maximo and Rush). On September 28th the long building animosity between Rey Escorpión and Los Guerreros del Infierno was evident throughout the match, from the start Escorpión came out separately from Guerrero and Euforia. During the match Místico II suffered what one report called [...] "a spectacular fall" [...] in an attempt to pull off a high risk, high flying move off the top rope. Los Guerreros del Infierno actually won the first fall, then quickly lost the second fall. In the third fall the team disintegrated, with miscommunication between the three and Escorpión losing the third and deciding fall to their opponents. After the match Guerrero and Euroria attacked Rey Escorpión, beating him up and leaving him in the <b>ring,</b> <b>marking</b> {{the first time that the}} tension between Escorpión and Guerrero turned so physical.|$|E
5000|$|A {{traditional}} {{wedding is}} arranged by Ghotoks (matchmakers), who are typically {{friends or relatives}} of the couple. The matchmakers facilitate the introduction, and also help agree the amount of any settlement. Bengali weddings are traditionally in five parts: first it is the bride and groom's Mehendi Shondha, the bride's Gaye Holud, the groom's Gaye Holud, the Beeya, and the Bou Bhaat. These often take place on separate days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a <b>ring</b> <b>marking</b> the [...] "engagement" [...] which is gaining popularity. For the mehendi shondha the bride's side apply henna {{to each other as}} well as the bride for the bride's Gaye Holud, the groom's family - except the groom himself - go in procession to the bride's home. Bride's friends and family apply turmeric paste to her body as a part of Gaye Hoof bride, and they are traditionally all in matching clothes, mostly orange. The bride is seated on a dais, and the henna is used to decorate the bride's hands and feet with elaborate abstract designs. The sweets are then fed to the bride by all involved, piece by piece. The actual wedding ceremony [...] "Biye" [...] follows the Gaye Holud ceremonies. The wedding ceremony is arranged by the bride's family. On the day, the younger members of the bride's family barricade the entrance to the venue, and demand a sort of admission charge from the groom in return for allowing him to enter. The bride and groom are seated separately, and a Kazi (authorised person by the govt. to perform the wedding), accompanied by the parents and a Wakil (witness) from each side formally asks the bride for her consent to the union, and then the groom for his. The bride's side of the family tries to play some kind of practical joke on the groom such as stealing the groom's shoe. The reception, also known as Bou-Bhaat (reception), is a party given by the groom's family in return for the wedding party. It is typically a much more relaxed affair, with only the second-best wedding outfit being worn.|$|E
40|$|FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase {{that forms}} a dynamic <b>ring</b> <b>marking</b> the {{division}} plane of prokaryotic cells, {{is essential for}} cytokinesis. It is not known what triggers FtsZ ring assembly. In this work, we use a FtsZ-green fluorescent protein (Gfp) chimera to assay FtsZ assembly over time by using fluorescence microscopy. We show that FtsZ polymers can assemble dynamically in solution in a GTP-dependent manner. Initially, FtsZ nucleation centers grow into aster-like structures that dramatically resemble microtubule organizing centers. As assembly proceeds further, protofilament bundles emanating from different asters interconnect, mimicking {{the closure of the}} FtsZ ring in vivo. Surprisingly, millimolar levels of Ca 2 + promote FtsZ dynamic assembly. FtsZ can undergo repeated GTP-dependent assembly and disassembly in solution by sequential addition and removal of Ca 2 +. In addition, GTP binding and hydrolysis by FtsZ are regulated by Ca 2 + concentration. Although the concentration of Ca 2 + required for FtsZ assembly in vitro is high, its clear and specific effect on FtsZ dynamics suggests the possibility that Ca 2 + may have a role in regulating FtsZ ring assembly in the cell...|$|E

30|$|As already {{described}} in Ref. [6], in concentric multiple rings structures, the inner ring {{has a different}} origin compared to the outer ones. Indeed, the inner ring is formed just after the Ga droplets formation, caused by a partial dissolution of As coming from the substrate or from the background inside the liquid gallium. This was confirmed by fabricating a sample where no As was intentionally supplied after the formation of Ga droplets and by subsequent selective chemical etching in order to remove only the metallic gallium, without damaging the GaAs structure. In this sample, a tiny GaAs ring was clearly found at the droplets edge. Therefore, we can conclude that the inner ring present at {{the centre of the}} final structure {{is the result of the}} accretion of the tiny <b>ring,</b> <b>marking</b> the original droplets perimeter. On the contrary, every outer ring was found to be formed as a result of each As supply, caused by the interplay between the adsorption of arsenic atoms on the substrate surface and the simultaneous migration of Ga atoms, which depart from the original droplets. Being the surface diffusion of Ga atoms a thermally activated process, depending exponentially on the substrate temperature, larger diameter for the outer rings will correspond to higher temperatures. Therefore, in our experimental procedure, the outer rings are the first to be formed, caused by the larger diffusion length of gallium atoms at 380 °C.|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{ultrastructure}} of the freshwater turtle Mauremys caspica (M. caspica) has not {{yet been}} published. Therefore, the present study was carried out to elucidate the ultrastructural details of the sperm of this species. The spermatozoa of M. caspica are filiform in shape with a curved head measuring 7. 9 m. Acrosome complex (acrosomal cap and subacrosomal material) measures 3. 7 m, nucleus is 6. 5 m (2. 3 m acrosomal region, 4. 2 m post-acrosomal region) in length and midpiece and tail (principal and end pieces) are maximally of 4. 2 m and 35. 8 - 38. 6 m length, successively. Diameter of the different tail pieces is gradually diminished from midpiece (1. 2 m) toward principal (0. 5 m) and end (0. 3 m) pieces. The anterior tapered nuclear tip is caped with the conical sheath formed by the acrosome and the subacrosomal material. Endonuclear canals (2 - 3) extend from the nuclear rostrum deep into the nucleus. Midpiece encompasses a mitochondrial sheath (total of 40 mitochondria) encircling the axonemal complex but lacks a fibrous sheath. Mitochondria are rounded having concentric cristae and central dense bodies. Annulus is present as a dense <b>ring</b> <b>marking</b> the distal end of midpiece. The principal tail piece consists of a typical axoneme (9 + 2 pattern of microtubular arrangement) surrounded by the fibrous sheath and plasma membrane. The axoneme is surrounded only by the plasma membrane in the end piece which lacks the fibrous sheath. The present findings were discussed and compared with that reported in other reptilian species...|$|E
40|$|Colony {{growth was}} {{initiated}} by inoculating minimal glucose agar with 1 -microliter. spots of a plasmid-free Escherichia coli culture and incubating at 32 degrees C. Inoculations {{took place over}} a 3 -day period, {{at the end of}} which the plates were fixed and dried for scanning electron microscopy. In this way, it was possible to examine the surfaces of colonies ranging in age from 0 to 68 h. Macroscopically, the colonies were organized into different concentric zones, and several morphological features could be seen to develop over this period. These included a shallow depression <b>ring</b> <b>marking</b> the site of inoculation, a deeper indentation ring whose position moved outward as the colony grew, an expanding plateau region between the two rings, a mound outside the indentation ring, and a flat brim extending onto the substrate which was either present or absent at different times. Microscopically, a variety of cell morphologies and cell arrangements were detected. Upon inoculation, the bacteria accumulated at the periphery of the inoculation spot but showed no other kind of order. For the first 7. 5 h, all bacteria were rod shaped; at the end of this initial phase, a high degree of alignment was seen in the cells at the colony edge. By 24. 5 h, both shorter more ovoid cells and longer filaments had begun to appear, and large multicellular arrays had formed. At later stages of colony development, morphologically distinguishable zones involving cells of different shapes and sizes had formed, and these zones often marked the boundaries of macroscopic features. The edges were particularly interesting and at 68 h displayed very sharp saw-toothed boundaries between concentrically organized groups of bacteria. There were some transient irregularities in the concentric organizations of growing colonies, and one colony had entered upon a distinct developmental pathway...|$|E

40|$|Lake Metztitlán was {{dried up}} {{completely}} {{in the spring of}} 1998 and refilled in August of that year. In the period September-November, two cohorts of 1. 6 million juveniles of a tilapia hybrid were stocked (Oreochromis aureus/O. niloticus), and monitored every month for one year. Since the date of birth of these juveniles was known, the analyses focused on whether the <b>ring</b> <b>marks</b> of the scales, sagittae and opercula or the circuli of the scales could be used to age them. The <b>ring</b> <b>marks</b> of the scales and opercula showed great variability, and the sagittae had a significant relationship with length, but it is unclear if at least the first <b>ring</b> <b>mark</b> could be formed at the hatchery and reflect changes in diet and/or tank movements in the fish farm. The circuli had a continuous regular behavior, with a formation rate of 10. 38 ± 0. 93 and 11. 38 ± 0. 95 circuli/month for the first and second cohorts, respectively. This proportion was maintained during the study period, and could be of help to calculate an approximate age of juveniles, especially in stocked fish that show multiple <b>ring</b> <b>marks</b> because of manipulation in fish farms and stocking events...|$|R
