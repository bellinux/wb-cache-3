40|$|International audienceRiemerella anatipestifer (RA) is the causative {{agent of}} septicaemic and exudative {{diseases}} {{in a variety}} of bird species. Despite numerous outbreaks {{little is known about the}} pathogenicity of RA for turkeys. We investigated the development of RA-induced disease in commercial turkey poults following RA-inoculation via different <b>respiratory</b> <b>routes.</b> Inoculation by aerosol or injection into the abdominal air sac led to systemic infection and mild gross lesions, including pericarditis, epicarditis and airsacculitis, which were less pronounced compared to field outbreaks. It was speculated, that viral pathogens, such as the avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV), may exacerbate RA-pathogenesis under field conditions. We inoculated turkey poults with virulent aMPV. Subsequently, aMPV-infected and virus-free birds were exposed three to five days later to a high dose of RA by aerosol (> 1010 colony forming units [CFU]/ml in 8 ml aerosol per 11 - 12 birds) or were four days later inoculated with a low RA dose (104. 9 CFU per animal) via the intranasal route. Intranasal RA-inoculation with the low bacterial dose led to a respiratory and systemic RA infection in aMPV-infected birds, while virus-free birds remained RA-negative. Following exposure to a high RA-dose by aerosol, aMPV-infected groups showed slightly enhanced incidences of gross lesions and RA-reisolation. This study clearly confirms that RA is pathogenic for turkeys after experimental inoculation via <b>respiratory</b> <b>routes,</b> which are speculated to be the natural route of infection. However, experimental models in this study did not reproduce the severity of RA-related disease as observed under field conditions, which emphasizes the importance of other contributing factors. aMPV-induced respiratory lesions may serve as a predisposing factor for the establishment of RA infection, since they favour colonization of the bacterium...|$|R

40|$|Adenoviruses invading the {{organism}} via normal digestive or <b>respiratory</b> <b>routes</b> require the Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) to infect the epithelial barrier cells. Because CAR is {{a component of}} tight junctions and the basolateral membrane and is normally excluded from the apical membrane, most epithelia are resistant to adenoviruses. However, we discovered that a specialized epithelium, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), anomalously expressed CAR at the apical surface and was highly susceptible to adenovirus infection. These properties of RPE cells correlated with {{the absence of the}} epithelial-specific clathrin adaptor AP 1 B. Furthermore, knockdown of this basolateral sorting adaptor in adenovirus-resistant MDCK cells promoted apical localization of CAR and increased dramatically Adenovirus infectivity. Targeting assays showed that AP 1 B is required for accurate basolateral recycling of CAR after internalization. AP 1 B knock down MDCK cells missorted CAR from recycling endosomes to the apical surface. In summary, we have characterized the cellular machinery responsible for normal sorting of an adenovirus receptor and illustrated how tissue-specific variations in such machinery result in drastic changes in tissue-susceptibility to adenoviruses...|$|R
