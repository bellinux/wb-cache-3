2500|$|The ammolite {{itself is}} {{actually}} a very thin sheet, ca. 0.5–0.8millimeters (0.02–0.03inches) in thickness. Rarely is ammolite without its matrix, which is typically a grey to brown shale, chalky clay, or limestone. So-called [...] "frost shattering" [...] is common; exposed to the elements and compressed by sediments, the thin ammolite tends to crack and flake; prolonged exposure to sunlight {{can also lead to}} bleaching. The cracking results in a tessellated appearance, sometimes described as a [...] "dragon skin" [...] or [...] "stained glass window" [...] pattern. Ammolite mined from deeper deposits may be entirely smooth or with a <b>rippled</b> <b>surface.</b> Occasionally a complete ammonite shell is recovered with its structure well-preserved: fine, convoluted lines delineate the shell chambers, and the overall shape is suggestive of a nautilus. While these shells may be as large as 90 centimeters (35.5inches) in diameter, the iridescent ammonites (as opposed to the pyritized variety) are typically much smaller. Most fossilized shells have had their aragonite pseudomorphously replaced by calcite or pyrite, making the presence of ammolite particularly uncommon.|$|E

60|$|Once {{again the}} oars were taken up, and with {{scarcely}} a sound they moved {{along the shore}} of the lake. The sun was now well over to the hills in the west, and the trees along the shore cast long shadows over the <b>rippling</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R

60|$|Fourth: If water be rippled, {{the side}} of every ripple next to us {{reflects}} {{a piece of the}} sky, and {{the side of}} every ripple farthest from us reflects a piece of the opposite shore, or of whatever objects may be beyond the ripple. But as we soon lose sight of the farther sides of the ripples on the retiring surface, the whole rippled space will then be reflective of the sky only. Thus, where calm distant water receives reflections of high shores, every extent of <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> appears as a bright line interrupting that reflection with the color of the sky.|$|E
60|$|They {{walked down}} the long gallery, chatting lightly. The Colonel drew her {{attention}} to {{a few of his}} favorite landscapes, and then they stood before a large painting of a scene unmistakably in British Columbia. The Indian canoe on the <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> of the lake, the tall, stiff, yet beautiful, trees that crept down to the water's edge, the furrowed snow peaks in the background, stirred the girl's pulse as she thought of one who even then perhaps was wandering about in that wild country. She expressed her admiration of the painting, and then rather hesitatingly mentioned the Colonel's nephew.|$|E
6000|$|We {{already know}} from our {{previous}} discussion that the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks {{is influenced by}} gravitational fields, i.e. by the distribution of matter. This in itself is sufficient to exclude {{the possibility of the}} exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more probable, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane: something like the <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> of a lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasi-Euclidean universe. As regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the average density of matter would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in Section 30.|$|E

Art critic Eleanor Heartney notes that [...] "Her paintings, like those of Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir, focus on the ephemeral moment and the fleeting impression, conjuring the flicker of sunlight through the trees, the shifting shadows of early evening, the reflections of clouds and foliage glancing across the <b>rippling</b> <b>surface</b> of a lake." ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{two hours}} later, and the Marina was almost deserted. The streets and squares, too, of the {{southern}} city were silent and empty. It seemed as though all Palermo had gathered together in that sprawling, whitewashed building, called in courtesy a concert hall. Flashes of light from its many windows gleamed upon the pavements below, and from the upper one the heads of a solid phalanx of men and women, wedged in together, threw quaint shadows across the narrow street. The tradespeople, aristocracy, and visitors of the place had flocked together to the concert, frantically desirous of hearing the great singer who although so young, had been made welcome at every court in Europe. It was an honor to their island city {{that she should have}} visited it at all; much more that she should choose to sing there; and the quick Palermitans, fired with enthusiasm, rushed to welcome her. The heavy slumberous air was still vibrating with the shout which had greeted her first appearance, and the echoes from across the scarcely <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> of the bay were lingering among the rocky hills {{on the other side of}} the harbor.|$|E
50|$|Juncus rugulosus is a {{perennial}} herb growing in thick tufts from a horizontal rhizome. The stem is erect {{and green and}} has a distinctive wrinkled, <b>rippled</b> <b>surface.</b> It reaches a maximum height near 70 centimeters. There are few leaves, those growing at the base lacking blades and appearing as sheaths around the stem, and those further up the stem having cylindrical blades.|$|E
50|$|The Badari {{culture is}} {{primarily}} known from cemeteries {{in the low}} desert. The deceased were placed on mats and buried in pits with their heads usually laid to the south, looking west.

The pottery that was buried with them is the most characteristic element of the Badarian culture. It had been given a distinctive, decorative <b>rippled</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

A model shows that air seeping through the sand bed in response to spatial variations of static pressure along the <b>ripple</b> <b>surface</b> guides water vapor through ripple crests and gradually stores dust beneath troughs.

30|$|Summarizing {{the part}} above, Xe ion {{irradiation}} induces a clear periodic nano-patterned <b>ripple</b> <b>surface</b> structure for both material systems. The structure can be tuned by the used ion energy. Nonetheless, Xe ion irradiation {{has only a}} negligible effect on the surface stoichiometry/chemistry.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} and finite element simulations are performed {{to study the}} surface instability in polymeric nanofibers under uniaxial tension. A polymeric nanofiber is modeled as a core-shell structure, which has been observed from molecular simulations and experiments. The surface instability of the polymeric nanofiber is found, via finite element simulations and a continuum theory, to be governed by the “polarization” at the core-shell interphase, ultimately being induced by the mismatch between their Poisson’s ratios. Without considering the plastic deformation, the initial imperfections cannot lead to a <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> of the polymeric nanofiber under uniaxial tension. It is shown that the strain rate and yield stress greatly influence the onset and modes of the observed <b>rippled</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} steps on H 2 O binding on a nominal Pt(111) surface, we used thermal desorption spectroscopy of water adsorbed on purposefully nanostructured surfaces: a <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> containing densely packed (100) -microfaceted and (111) -microfaceted steps was created using grazing incidence ion bombardment, and a surface with triangular mounds mainly consisting of (111) -microfaceted steps was fabricated through hornoepitaxial growth. These morphologies are determined by scanning tunneling microscopy. We find two additional high -temperature H 2 O desorption peaks using the <b>rippled</b> <b>surface,</b> whereas only the peak with the highest desorption temperature is present on the (111) -microfaceted mound. Thus, water preferentially binds to steps and especially favors (111) -microfaceted ones. Furthermore, the large step concentration on our nanostructured surfaces precludes the coexistence of a condensed and a diluted phase in a monolayer of water and suppresses the formation of crystalline ice multilayers during heating...|$|E

The average length of jumps during saltation corresponds to the wavelength, or distance between adjacent crests, of the ripples. In ripples, the coarsest materials collect at the crests causing inverse grading. This distinguishes small ripples from dunes, where the coarsest materials are generally in the troughs. This is also a distinguishing feature between water laid ripples and aeolian ripples.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} parameterise wave-formed rippled {{sediment}} beds involve {{the determination of}} a characteristic ripple height and length from the <b>rippled</b> <b>surface.</b> A substantial number of previous studies have indicated ripple fields formed in shallow water under real sea conditions will have considerable spatial and temporal variation in their parameters. There has been little work undertaken on quantifying the spatial variation of rippled beds {{in terms of their}} characteristic ripple height and length. This paper will present a method used to calculate a histogram of the ripple heights and lengths from the <b>rippled</b> <b>surface</b> using the zero up-crossing method. The inherent variability of ripple parameters will be discussed in terms of two sets of laboratory measurements taken at two very different scales. The conclusion of the paper is that traditional methods to predict ripple parameters have a bias towards rippled beds formed under medium mobility conditions. At higher and lower mobility conditions rippled beds will be inherently variable with a distribution of ripple parameters existing on a given bed at any given time...|$|E

40|$|Topological {{insulator}} nanowires with uniform cross section, {{combined with}} a magnetic flux, can host both perfectly transmitted mode and Majorana zero modes. Here we consider nanowires with <b>rippled</b> <b>surfaces</b> [...] -specifically, wires with a circular cross section with a radius varying along its axis [...] -and calculate their transport properties. At zero doping, chiral symmetry places the clean wires (no impurities) in the AIII symmetry class, which results in a Z topological classification. A magnetic flux threading the wire tunes between the topologically distinct insulating phases, with perfect transmission obtained at the phase transition. We derive an analytical expression for the exact flux value at the transition. Both doping and disorder breaks the chiral symmetry and the perfect transmission. At finite doping, the interplay of <b>surface</b> <b>ripples</b> and disorder with the magnetic flux modifies quantum interference such that the amplitude of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations reduces with increasing flux, in contrast to wires with uniform surfaces where it is flux-independent...|$|R
30|$|The {{observed}} sedimentary deposits {{allowed to}} suggest that the sedimentation took place during several phases (inundations), producing separate layers. Common presence of fining upward deposits suggests suspension settling to be dominating depositional process. The relatively common massive layers {{may be the result of}} hyperconcentrated flow but also may be the result of the limited variability within the sediment grain size and of the short settling period, which is too short to permit grain size gradation. Reverse gradation and planar lamination of some deposits imply also direct deposition from bed load. Moreover, many local features—for instance: lee side depositional ridges, rows of vortex-generated circular hollows, local <b>rippled</b> <b>surfaces,</b> suggest complex tsunami flow pattern.|$|R
