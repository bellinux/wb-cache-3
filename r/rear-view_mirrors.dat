25|$|Single lenses have {{a variety}} of {{applications}} including photographic lenses, corrective lenses, and magnifying glasses while single mirrors are used in parabolic reflectors and <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Combining a number of mirrors, prisms, and lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply two plane mirrors aligned to allow for viewing around obstructions. The most famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by the Dutch in the late 16th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{the safety of the}} moving car,we have to make {{simulation}} and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> We should consider, in addition to the geometric dimensions, standards and demands, a reasonable choice of the mirror size and installing position, the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> {{in the design of the}} car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this paper, we use the finite element software ANSYS to simulate the vibration frequency and vibration modals of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> under the condition of excitation sources. Based on this and the strength analysis results of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> we make a optimal design of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> structure. We get five-order vibration modals in working condition and analysis the size of displacement and deformation, and dynamic characteristics. The results show that because of the low modal frequency, the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is easily inspired by the engine, powertrain system and road to vibrate. Besides, the deformation and the strain distribution of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> are not uniform. So we should control the low rank flexibility modal frequency within a certain threshold frequency when designing its structure. On the condition of little changes of its overall volume, the maximum equivalent stress of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> decreased by 30. 5 % through optimizing design...|$|R

25|$|In December 1960, {{after its}} last tax disc expired, Dr. Carr stored the Bugatti {{along with other}} classic cars in a lock up garage in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. There it {{remained}} unused and untouched until after Carr's death, when it was discovered by Carr's nephew clearing the garage of his uncle's possessions in 2008. 57502 still possessed its original chassis, engine, drive train and body, though it did contain some modifications: bespoke bumpers, <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> on the A-pillars, and a luggage rack dating from the Earl Howe ownership, {{as well as a}} Marshall K200 supercharger fitted by a later owner.|$|E
25|$|On lap 17, Bird {{attempted}} to overtake López {{heading into the}} first turn, but the two cars made contact in the corner, causing Bird to run wide and fell to sixth after he was passed by Vergne and di Grassi and was placed under pressure by Abt. Bird lost two further positions when Abt and Prost passed him and López fell to fourth when Vergne overtook the higher-placed Virgin car. Di Grassi passed López entering the first corner shortly after. Buemi was 1.3 seconds behind race leader Rosenqvist by the 20th lap but the latter {{was aware of the}} situation and glanced at his <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> to ensure he had large enough of an advantage to remain ahead after the pit stop phase. The mandatory pit stop phase for the switch into a second car began on lap 23 when the leading drivers entered the pit lane. After driving out of his team's garage in his second car, Rosenqvist was released into the path of Heidfeld in the other Mahindra car, causing his teammate to swerve to the outside and nearly entered another team's pit gantry. Heidfeld came to a halt without damaging his car. Although he was briefly delayed, Rosenqvist kept the lead. The stewards immediately investigated Rosenqvist for the pit stop release.|$|E
500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors,</b> {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his gear selection problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to give people a show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E

40|$|The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is a metaphoric {{favourite}} {{in popular}} culture. This exploratory essay positions the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> as, predominantly, a quintessentially modern device for reimagining {{the past and}} its relationship to the present and future. Combined with that icon of modern economies, the motorcar, it gives a sense of a paved journey towards the future while from the driver’s seat allowing a framed, receding view of the past. With distance that past can be critically held: ‘it now makes sense’. This sensemaking relies upon a spatial rendering of time that makes past, present and future concrete. However, this dominant metaphor of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in popular culture is supplemented by less certain uses: it can also evoke the uncanny; bring spectres from the past into the present; or heighten our enmeshment with structural power. This essay explores this terrain of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in examples from radio, song, music video and film, and then questions the efficacy of the metaphor in the anthropocene. The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> then, is an entry point for considering our engagement with the past, present and future, and how and where is our gaze directed and for whom...|$|R
