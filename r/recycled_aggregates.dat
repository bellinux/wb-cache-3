A proposed approach, which may encourage wider use of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> and promote sustainability, is to base the selection of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> on performance-related characteristics that relate the properties of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> to concrete performance across the whole range of recycled aggregate quality, independent of constituents and source.

The concept is that the highest quality <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> will be suitable for high-performance applications, meeting the relevant standards and specifications, while the two lower classes will be more appropriate for lower performance applications. Given this approach, material that is currently not fully specified for use in BS 8500 may be classified and considered for relevant applications.

30|$|The {{valorization}} of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{in concrete}} is not recent and {{many studies have}} shown that material made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> may have mechanical properties similar to those of a conventional concrete mixed with natural aggregates (Etxeberria et al. 2007; Evangelista and de Brito 2007; Li 2008; McNeil and Kang 2013). However, <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> are characterized by a high water absorption capacity related to the presence of old mortar attached to the surface of aggregates which hinders their wide use (Gomez-Soberon 2002; de Juan and Gutirrez 2009). The water absorption capacity affects both fresh and hardened states properties. At fresh state, the mix design of concrete with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> requires an additional quantity of water to obtain a similar workability as a concrete formulated with natural aggregates (Hansen and Boegh 1986). Such a modification may obviously affect the mechanical characteristics of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete. Several studies have investigated the microstructure of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete and showed that the porosity is modified and increases with the replacement ratio (Gomez-Soberon 2002). It is also acknowledged that the high porosity of recycled concrete leads a reduction of the mechanical strengths (Gomez-Soberon 2002; Kou et al. 2011). Furthermore, several studies have shown however that mechanical properties of concrete made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> depend on other parameters such as the quality of concrete from which <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> are obtained (Xiao et al. 2005; Casuccio et al. 2008) as well as the replacement ratio (Belén et al. 2011).|$|E

So far, <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> (which constitute the majority of C&DW) are reused in low volume percentages for average compressive strength concretes and mostly as road sub-base and back-fill material which, in turn, constitutes a down-cycling option. Most investigations related to concrete made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> use aggregates produced in laboratory context which are not contaminated at all. It is then no surprise {{to find out that}} some investigations shows the potential to reuse as much as 100 %, however, industrially produced <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> contain a certain level of impurities that can be deleterious for Portland cement concrete, thus making very difficult for the concrete industry to use such investigations unless uncontaminated <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> are used. This paper reviews current knowledge on concrete made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates,</b> with a special focus on the crucial importance of impurities presence and how those aggregates are not suitable for the production of HPC. Also, the potential of geopolymers to produce HPC based on high volume <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to study the effect of using fly ash with constant cement content with poor quality <b>recycle</b> <b>aggregate,</b> which were only clushed certain grain degree level. The strength of concrete with <b>recycle</b> <b>aggregate</b> decrease. So the author tried to improve the strength of concrete with <b>recycle</b> <b>aggregate</b> by adding fly ash with constant cement content. The test piece were producted under unit quantity of water 185 kg/m 3 and unit quantity of cement 285 kg/m 3. As a result, compressive strength of <b>recycle</b> <b>aggregate</b> concrete increased by fly ash at constant cement content. In addition, the strength of <b>recycle</b> <b>aggregate</b> concrete is larger than normal concrete. In this experiment, the strain at maximum strength stress increased, with quietness elasticity coefficient remaining at constant value...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to obtain}} {{technical}} data {{for improvement of}} utilization of Blast Furnace Slag(BFS), <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> in the future by complementing fundamental problems of BFS such as manifestation of initial strength and excessive alkali quantity as well as weakness of <b>recycled</b> fine <b>aggregate</b> through manufacturing of <b>recycled</b> fine <b>aggregate</b> mortar using BFS. The <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> includes the cement paste hardened as the surface {{and the type of}} the aggregate, which contains plenty of calcium hydroxide(Ca(OH) 2) as well as the unhydrated cement. Accordingly, the objectives of this study are to inspect the manufacturing the <b>recycled</b> fine <b>aggregate</b> mortar used with blast furnace slag, to consider the effects of the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> on the strength development of ground granulated blast furnace slag, and then to acquire the technical data to take into consideration the further usages of the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> and blast furnace slag. In eluted ions from <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate,</b> it showed that there were natrium(Na+) and kalium(K+), expected to be flown out of unhydrated cement, as well as calcium hydroxide(Ca(OH) 2). Application of this water to mix cement mortar with ground granulated blast furnace slag was observed to expedite hydration as calcium hydroxide(Ca(OH) 2) and unhydrated cement component were expressed to give stimuli effects on ground granulated blast furnace slag. The results of the experiment show that the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> mixed with blast furnace slag has comparatively highe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> is {{dealt with}} in three ways, the first way {{is to keep the}} <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> intact; the second way is to wrap the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> in cement slurry of Water-cement ratio 0. 55 for 30 minutes, and then place it at room {{temperature}} for 7 days; the third way is to immerse the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> in water for 24 hours. Three kinds of different <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> is separately used for mixing of recycled concrete. The strength and slump of recycled concrete with different <b>recycled</b> coarse <b>aggregate</b> contents are tested. Experiments show that the recycled concrete produced by using the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> immersed in water and selecting a suitable mix has the higher strength and slump, which can be industrialized. And then, the recycled concrete with 40 % <b>recycled</b> coarse <b>aggregate</b> contents is used in the steel-reinforced recycled concrete beams, which are tested, the failure process of steel-reinforced recycled concrete beams,section strains and maximum load are acquired. Research shows the steel-reinforced recycled concrete beams conform to plane hypothesis before the load reachs 80 % the limit load, the flexural bearing capacity of the steel-reinforced recycled concrete beams can meet the demand of Technichal Specification of Steel-Reinforced Concrete Structures. The use of recycled concrete in the composite structures is proposed...|$|R
