Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS.

25|$|A {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} vacuum {{of up to}} 30 seconds is unlikely to cause permanent physical damage. Animal experiments show that rapid and complete recovery is normal for exposures shorter than 90 seconds, while longer full-body exposures are fatal and resuscitation has never been successful. There is only {{a limited amount of}} data available from human accidents, but it is consistent with animal data. Limbs may be exposed for much longer if breathing is not impaired. <b>Rapid</b> <b>decompression</b> can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself. Even if the victim does not hold their breath, venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs. Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by <b>rapid</b> <b>decompression,</b> soft tissues may bruise and seep blood, and the stress of shock accelerates oxygen consumption, leading to hypoxia. Injuries caused by <b>rapid</b> <b>decompression</b> are called barotrauma, and are well known from scuba diving accidents. A pressure drop as small as 100 Torr (13 kPa), which produces no symptoms if it is gradual, may be fatal if it occurs suddenly.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{identification}} of the cause of failure is a high priority {{in the immediate aftermath}} of a major civil aircraft accident. Attention is often focused on the two recorders, the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder. In the event of sudden, catastrophic loss of an aircraft through explosions or structural failure decompressions, the recordings are seen as even more important. Yet these recorders are not designed to record such events with great fidelity and the ability of accident investigators to interpret such recordings has been severely tested in several major accidents in the past thirty years; comparisons between accident recordings have not been able to produce conclusive results. This paper reports on a programme investigating CVR recordings of explosions and <b>rapid</b> <b>decompressions</b> on a variety of aircraft from trials in several countries. In particular we show that CVR recordings are generally unable to discriminate between explosions and structural failure decompressions and we explain why this is so.

40|$|At various time {{concerns}} have been expressed that <b>rapid</b> <b>decompressions</b> of compartments of gas pockets and thermal blankets during spacecraft launches {{may have caused}} pressure differentials across their walls sufficient to cause minor structural failures, separations of adhesively-joined parts, ballooning, and flapping of blankets.

The pressure profiles measured inside the shrouds of several spacecraft propelled by several vehicles and some profiles obtained from ground vacuum systems have been included. The equation can be used to design the appropriate vent, which will preclude excessive pressure differentials. Precautions and needed approaches for the evaluations of the expected pressures have been indicated. Methods to make a rapid assessment of the response of the compartment to rapid external pressure drops have been discussed. These are based on the evaluation of the compartment vent flow conductance, the volume and the length of time during which the rapid pressure drop occurs...|$|R

500|$|As a {{consequence}} of <b>rapid</b> <b>decompression,</b> any oxygen dissolved in the blood will empty into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans will lose consciousness {{after a few seconds}} and die of hypoxia within minutes. Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3kPa, and this condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid. Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for Shuttle astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa. Supplemental oxygen is needed at [...] to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above [...] pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism. Most space suits use around 30–39kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed.|$|E
