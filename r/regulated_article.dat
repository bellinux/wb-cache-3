Black walnut is a highly valued tree, both economically and environmentally; it is also highly susceptible to TCD. If found in Illinois, this disease would threaten native black walnut stands as well as negatively impact black walnut timber, nuts, and nursery production. In response to this threat, on February 1, 2012, the Governor of the State of Illinois issued a proclamation which established a regulatory framework to protect the walnut resource of the state. The proclamation restricts the movement of certain regulated articles into or through Illinois and establishes a process by which individuals and businesses can continue to move those articles without endangering the state’s walnut resource. The basis of the regulatory framework is a compliance agreement administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Individuals and businesses wishing to move regulated materials into or through Illinois originating in a Thousand Cankers Disease infested area must first enter into a compliance agreement with the Department and the <b>regulated</b> <b>article</b> {{must be accompanied by}} a phytosanitary certificate from the originating state verifying the material complies with the conditions of the compliance agreement.
