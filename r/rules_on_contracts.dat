In Turkish Private International Law, flexibility seems finding itself a broad place in contractual obligations with the entry into force of the new Turkish Law on Private International Law and International Civil Procedure (Milletlerarası Özel Hukuk ve Usul Hukuku Hakkında Kanun –MÖHUK).

They offer an article by article commentary on the principles to provide an accessible guide to the existing case law and legal literature, {{as well as a}} comparison with national and international legislation. The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts are the result of the ambitious quest to codify the lex mercatoria; those unwritten rules of the game by which merchants have always understood to do international business. Since the publication of their first version in 1994, the UNIDROIT Principles have been impressively successful. They have become a serious alternative to national contract laws in international disputes decided by arbitral tribunals, such as those administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). At the same time, they have been accepted as a model for reforming the laws on international contract, by countries such as Russia, Lithuania, and China. With the publication of {{a new version of the}} Principles in 2004, this first phase of codifying international contract law is now considered to be finished.

The Commission unfortunately has not taken the challenge.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the law {{applicable}} to insurance contracts in the EU, most notably on the Regulation No 593 / 2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I), which will replace the Rome Convention. The conflict of law rules relating to insurance contracts have {{always been one of}} the most complicated areas in (European) private international law. The conflict rules emanate from diverse sources - various directives and the Rome Convention - and lack cohesion and uniformity. The conversion of the Rome Convention into the Rome I Regulation was an excellent opportunity to get rid of this maze and to formulate uniform conflict rules for insurance contracts. The Commission proposal did not include a <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> insurance <b>contracts,</b> but a special rule was introduced during the negotiations. The difficult negotiations on this provision demonstrated clearly the complexity and delicacy of the matter. Various proposals were put forward and special consultations were launched, but the final result, laid down in Article 7 Rome I, seems to be no more than a complex compromise. The Regulation of international insurance contracts still remains unnecessarily complicated, fragmented and incomprehensible. In my opinion, therefore, the new rule in Article 7 is disappointing. Rather than removing the current divergences, the introduction of Article 7 mainly conceals them. It may be hoped that on the occasion of the evaluation of the Rome I Regulation, the conflict <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> insurance <b>contracts</b> will be carefully reconsidered...|$|R

40|$|This writing {{concerns}} the new Proposal of Regulation on a Common European Sales Law (CESL). The {{source of this}} one is to be recognized in the series of works dedicated throughout Europe since the first eighties of past century {{to the idea of}} a European codification of private law. In this scope, the result, which makes the content of the Proposal as referred exclusively to the sales contract, sounds in some sense frustrating. The Proposal though includes general <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>contract,</b> especially those <b>on</b> formation and interpretation, which could be intended as a kind of prelude to a more extensive regulation regarding the contract in general. The tentative character of the proposal is manifested by the optionality which the Proposal declares the new regulation has to have. There must be a specific declaration by the parties aiming to the application of the set of rules in which the CESL consists. This will produce difficulties in the promotion of the proposed Regulation as an effectively applied European discipline. Moreover the rules of CESL frequently repeat rules already enacted in previous directives dedicated to the protection of consumers as in turn the CESL wants to be. The author though is not in agreement with critical appraisals which prove to be more ideological than dogmatically persuasive: this is, e. g., the case relating to the duty to mitigate, that convincingly the CESL, following the PECL and the DCFR, has regulated apart from contributory negligence...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{legal issues}} related to evidence and contract laws {{in the context of}} electronic commerce. Electronic commerce raises a number of legal problems such as the need for authentication, liabilities, whether electronic records are admissible as evidence and whether electronic transmissions are considered writing where writing is required. Many legal systems have faced or will face some questions, such as whether electronic evidence is inadmissible only in the ground of being created or stored electronically? Should the law of evidence be reformed {{in order to meet the}} new technologies? It is questionable whether electronic communications and records can or should meet the legal requirements of "writing" and "signature". Do electronic and digital signatures satisfy the legal requirements? It has been argued that it is not logical and reasonable to apply legal requirements that have been constituted in the ground of paper-based communication on electronic communication. Electronic contracts raise some legal issues, including whether the contract must be in a particular form or authenticated; when the message is sent and received; whether it is received in the same form as it is sent; validity, time and place of communication; cross-offers and battle of forms issues. All these issues are considered from UK common law point of view and according to CISG, UNIDROIT Principles, PECL, UNCITRAL Model Laws and the Uniform Commercial Code. Electronic contracts involve consideration whether a computer can properly be used to enter into a contractual relationship, to which existing <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>contract</b> negotiation may need to be developed to suit formation of contracts by means of computer and telecommunications and whether old rules are appropriate today. This study examines other legal problems relating to <b>contracts</b> formed <b>on</b> the Internet, including the use of electronic agents, enforceability of mass-market licences, electronic payments and choice of law and jurisdiction issues.

Hence, the dissertation argues that the implication of applying a Rawlsian framework to European contract law for the position of SMEs is that they deserve the same protection as consumers...|$|R

40|$|Is it {{feasible}} {{that the}} UK accedes to the CISG {{in the near}} future? What benefits {{can be derived from}} accession in the UK where an established and well-developed system of sales law exists already? The Convention is not free from shortcomings. It may have only little relevance in practice. Parties, also from the CISG contracting states, may often have little awareness of the Convention. Importantly, it is English law that plays a dominant position in cross border trade. However, accession may be nonetheless desirable for the UK. Potentially, many legal and economic advantages can be derived from choosing the CISG to govern international sales agreement. In certain circumstances, the CISG may offer a useful alternative to English law. Besides, a globalisation of trade, which is now a clear reality, has created demands for harmonisation of sales laws. The CISG, adopted by many states already, is an important element of the process of harmonisation. In light of the above considerations, it will be argued in this Thesis that accession to the CISG is desirable for the UK. In approaching the problem, focus will be made on practical aspects of accession to such uniform law as the CISG. Accordingly, arguments in favor of acceding and reasons against ratification in context of special legal, economic and social reality in the UK will be discussed. A study on desirability of accession requires comparative analysis of substantive provisions of the CISG and English law. For the purpose of this study, emphasis will be laid upon fundamental basis of a contract, i. e. offer and acceptance. Those rules will be examined in order to determine their compatibility with English law and efficiency for international sales transaction. It will be argued that similarities of the <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>contract</b> formation demonstrate a growing international consensus in the field of international sales contracts. The UK should {{be a part of that}} consensus by adopting the CISG. Furthermore, it is suggested that teaching the CISG in undergraduate mandatory courses of law may contribute to changing the apparently negative attitude of English lawyers towards accession. Ultimately, it may influence the outlook in the UK regarding acceding. This assumption will be examined in light of empirical evidence, i. e. survey on attitudes of UK academics towards the international instruments of contract law conducted across the UK Schools of Law.

In 1993, Brazil implemented into practice the 37 th article of Brazilian Federal Constitution by means of the signature of federal law number 8666 enforcing general <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> administrative <b>contracts</b> for design projects (construction and engineering services).

This jubilee, in conjunction with the 80 th anniversary of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut, now the Max Planck Institute for Comparative and International Private Law in Hamburg, calls for a reflection on the reception of Rabel’s most famous work in German and its importance today. Rabel, who helped found the Institute and served as its first director, laid the groundwork for a worldwide law of sale of goods with his oeuvre. He himself had proposed the conception of such an international law of sale of goods in 1928 and published a Draft of a Uniform Law of Sale of Goods in 1935. His ideas did not come to fruition until 1964, when the Uniform Law on the Formation of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Hague Formation Convention) and the Convention relating to a Uniform Law on the International Sale of Goods (Hague Sales Convention) was passed. But the success of these conventions was limited; they attracted only very few ratifications. Their successor, however, the United Nations Convention <b>on</b> <b>Contracts</b> for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) of 1980, has achieved much greater significance: two thirds of international and foreign trade are governed by the CISG. Furthermore, Rabel, who is seen as the founder of modern legal comparison in Germany, also {{had an impact on the}} German Civil Code (BGB) : when the BGB was modernised in 2002 (also to implement several EC directives), the CISG and Rabel’s suggestions were partly used as a model.

40|$|Common core, PECL and DCFR, {{could they}} change {{shipping}} and transport law? This question {{was included in}} the call for papers for this book. The great response to the call suggests that even though harmonization of shipping and transport law has a much greater tradition than harmonization of general private law, still uniformity in shipping and transport law could benefit from the harmonization instruments. This should come as no surprise: despite the long standing tradition, unification of shipping and transport law didn’t go as far as would be desirable from a trade perspective and three major shortcomings are harmful to uniformity. First of all, some important areas of transport law are still excluded from uniform law. The lack of such uniform rules in these fields is often also detrimental for uniformity in unified fields of law. For example, the lack of uniform <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> transport intermediaries impacts the qualification by national courts of a service provider as a carrier or rather as a transport intermediary and creates therefore also a crack in uniform carriage law. Secondly, even in fields that are unified, there is often only a partial unification, addressing only specific questions. Consequently other questions are left outside the unification. Again, fields that are left outside unification can strongly impact the uniformity of decisions in cases subject to uniform law. For example, the lack of uniform <b>rules</b> <b>on</b> <b>contract</b> interpretation and validity of the contract will obviously impact the interpretation of contracts subject to uniform law in different member states, and will can also lead to diverging court decisions in these member states. The possible impact of the harmonization instruments <b>on</b> <b>contract</b> interpretation are discussed by professor Legros in chapter 1. Other questions that Finally, even for subjects falling within the scope of uniform law, uniform rules are often nonetheless interpreted in a different way by national courts, as these courts read their national law concepts into the uniform rules. This prevents these uniform legislations from resulting in uniform law. As great parts of uniform transport law apply mandatorily, the impact of these cracks in uniformity is even greater. Commercial law is in general Darwinist, in this sense that parties provide for their own contractual framework if uniform law is not considered adequate to govern the specific contract, resulting eventually in the disuse of inadequate regimes. The mandatory nature of said regimes prevents this however, causing inefficient legislation to create obstacles to trade. Taking into account these shortcomings, further unification of private law aspects of shipping and transport law seems highly desirable. Nevertheless, some legislative fatigue has crept into unification of private law aspects of shipping and transport law. Here, a two-fold role can come to the harmonisation instruments. First of all from a methodological point of view, the grassroots perspective taken by harmonisation instruments could offer an example for shipping and transport law. Second, the provisions of the harmonisation instruments could be beneficial for shipping and transport law from different points of view. First of all, some of these provisions could be very useful when developing future European shipping and transport law instruments. Secondly these harmonisation instruments could offer a useful tool for gap-filling. For example parties could contractually incorporate these instrument as to create a neutral gap-filling mechanism. Finally de lege ferenda, if these harmonisation instruments would result in an (optional) European instrument, there can be a direct impact of such instrument for topics that are still subject to national law. From this introduction it follows that there could come a role to the harmonization instruments. All authors examine for their field of expertise if the instruments could have any impact, and if so, what this impact would be. All three the aforementioned problems are addressed in some contributions: the impact on fields left outside the harmonisation, on topics not addressed in uniform law and finally on different interpretations of uniform rules. Consequently after reading this book, the reader will be able to answer the research question himself: Common core, PECL and DCFR, could they change shipping and transport law?edition: 1 nrpages: 222 status: publishe...|$|R
