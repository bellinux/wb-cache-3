Bacterial in-fection was the commonest type, accounting for 152 (67. 9070) of 224 infective episodes, followed by fungal and viral infections (15. 6 % and 14. 3 %, respectively). Gram-negative organisms (Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were the commonest bacterial organisms iso-lated, constituting 38 (76 %) of 50 positive cultures; infection with Staphylococcus was rare (10 %).

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of an impressive body of work on human immune responses against ¢larial infect-ions, the occurrence of a protective response to infection remains unclear. Here, we use a combined modelling and comparative data analysis framework to address this issue for human infections with the ¢larial parasite,Wuchereria bancrofti. By analogy with previous work, the analysis involves the comparison <b>of</b> observed ¢eld <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> with epidemiological <b>patterns</b> predicted by a mathematical model of parasite immunity. Unlike most other human helminths, which are transmitted by ingestion or dermal penetration, exposure to infection with lymphatic ¢lariasis can be measured explicitly in terms of vector mosquito biting rates, thereby also allowing, probably for the ¢rst time, examination of the suggested role of exposure in generating herd immunity to macroparasites. Observed ¢eld patterns in this study were derived from 19 di¡erent published studies, which gave parallel estimates of community exposure rates and the corresponding age^prevalence <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> while predictions <b>of</b> the epidemiological impact of herd immunity were obtained using a catalytic model framework. The results provide the ¢rst conclusive evidence to date that variations in the observed age^prevalence <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in ¢lar-iasis can be e¡ectively explained by the occurrence of an exposure-driven acquisition of herd immunity. We discuss this result in terms of implications for the newWorld Health Organization-led initiative for the global control of this parasitic disease...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying {{the factors}} that predict {{parasite}} outbreak and persistence is a major challenge for both applied and fundamental biology. Key to understanding parasite prevalence and disease outbreaks is determining at what age individuals show signs <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> {{and whether or not}} they recover. Age-dependent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> a host population by parasites can indicate among-individual heterogeneities in their susceptibility to, or rate of recovery from, parasite infections. Here, we present a cross-sectional study of avian malaria in a long-lived bird species, the mute swan Cygnus olor, examining age-related <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> parasite prevalence and modelling <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and recovery. One-hundred and fifteen swans, ranging from one to nineteen years old, were screened for infection with Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon parasites. Infections with three cytochrome-b lineages of Haemoproteus were found (pooled prevalence 67 %), namely WW 1 (26 %), which is common in passerine birds, and two new lineages closely related to WW 1 : MUTSW 1 (25 %) and MUTSW 2 (16 %). We found evidence for age-related infection in one lineage, MUTSW 1. Catalytic models examining <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and recovery in the population suggested that infections in this population were not life-long - recovery of individuals was included in the best fitting models. These findings support the results of recent studies that suggest hosts can clear <b>infections,</b> although <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> infection-related mortality in older birds remain to be studied in more detail. © 2013 The Author.

However, it re-emerged in 1993 along {{the western part of}} the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the border with North Korea (Chai et al., 1994; Chai, 1999). Since its re-emergence, the annual number of cases has grown exponentially, and totaled 16, 435 cases by the end of 2001 (National Institute of Health, 2001, 2002). By epidemiological and clinical studies, it has been suggested that the re-emerging malaria in South Korea originated from North Korea (Chai, 1999; Moon and Cho, 2001), however, molecular and genetic data are required to support this suggestion. Populations of malaria parasites exhibit significant genetic diversity (Rich et al., 2000).

40|$|The {{importance}} of social- and kin-structuring of populations for {{the transmission of}} wildlife disease is widely assumed but poorly described. Social structure can help dilute risks of transmission for group members, and {{is relatively easy to}} measure, but kin-association represents a further level of population sub-structure that is harder to measure, particularly when association behaviours happen underground. Here, using epidemiological and molecular genetic data from a wild, high-density population of the European badger (Meles meles), we quantify the risks <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> with Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of tuberculosis) in cubs. The risk declines with increasing size of its social group, but this net dilution effect conceals divergent <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> risk. Cubs only enjoy reduced risk when social groups have a higher proportion of test-negative individuals. Cubs suffer higher infection risk in social groups containing resident infectious adults, and these risks are exaggerated when cubs and infectious adults are closely related. We further identify key differences in infection risk associated with resident infectious males and females. We link our results to parent– offspring interactions and other kin-biased association, but also consider the possibility that susceptibility to infection is heritable. These <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> risk help to explain the observation of a herd immunity effect in badgers following low-intensity vaccination campaigns.

40|$|Urinary schistosomiasis, {{which is}} caused by the blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium, is a {{tropical}} disease infecting over 100 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection typically involves repeated re-infection with long-lived parasites, and field studies have demonstrated that protective immunity takes many years to develop in humans. In communities with endemic schistosomiasis, distinctive <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and schistosome-specific antibody responses are seen, including a peaked age-infection curve, a highly aggregated distribution <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> intensities among individuals, and an age-related switch in the subclasses of antibody produced. The antibody switch, which occurs naturally in older children, is also seen in younger children following treatment with the antihelminthic drug praziquantel, which kills adult worms. This study aimed to identify the important mechanisms underlying the slow development of protective immunity, using a mathematical modelling approach. Deterministic population-level and stochastic individual-based models were developed that describe how levels <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and antibody change with age for individuals living in endemic communities. These models were used to explore different hypotheses for the slow development of protective immunity: (1) that schistosome parasites actively suppress protective immune responses; (2) that dying worms provide the main antigenic stimulus for protective immunity and (3) that a threshold level of antigen must be experienced before a protective immune response is initiated. Models were assessed for their ability to simultaneously reproduce different robust <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and antibody responses identified in cross-sectional and post-treatment field data from Zimbabwe. It was found that significant immunosuppression by schistosomes was not consistent with population-level <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> intensity, including the peaked age-infection curve. In order to explain both age-related and post-treatment changes in infection intensity and antibody responses, including the antibody switch, protective antibody responses had to be stimulated by antigens from dying worms. Additionally, it was shown that these protective responses reduced worm fecundity rather than reducing rates of re-infection. An antigen threshold was found to be consistent with observed field patterns, but was not necessary to explain them. From a large number of possible models that were considered, a single model structure and a subset of parameter combinations were identified that were consistent with field data. This model was used to predict the longer-term impact of mass-treatment programmes upon the development of protective immunity, and the consequent effects on infection levels.
