25|$|For Scream 3, Beltrami {{employed}} seven orchestrators to aid {{in scoring}} the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film's score. Additionally, he experimented with new styles of sound production by <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted, unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically.|$|E
25|$|Sunshine, as {{with many}} South Atlantic Islands, is low, at a maximum of just 21.5%. This amounts to around 1,000 hours of {{sunshine}} annually. The local topography, however, also contributes significantly to the low insolation. A study published during the early 1960s indicated that sunshine <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> remained significantly obscured throughout the year and entirely obscured during June. It was estimated that the theoretical sunshine exposure minus obstructions would be around 14% at Bird Island and 35% at King Edward Pointor, in hourly terms, ranging from around 650 hours {{in the west to}} 1,500 hours in the east. This illustrates the effect the Allardyce range has in breaking up cloud cover.|$|E
25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in a dimly lit album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was good because it helped make them look younger. The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E

500|$|While Korn {{was looking}} for a place to record their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at the back door of the studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the output}} was an audio {{alternating}} current {{and not a}} direct current, the detector could only be used with earphones and not with the common <b>recording</b> <b>instrument</b> used in coherer radiotelegraphy receivers, the siphon paper tape recorder.|$|R

50|$|In 1893 André Blondel {{sought to}} solve the problem of {{integral}} synchronization, using the theory proposed by Cornu.

500|$|The {{revival of}} the {{observatory}} on the Gregorian Tower was initiated by the Barnabite Francesco Denza {{with the approval of}} Pope Leo XIII. High quality instruments were procured, partly with generous donations from Hicks of London, and the automatic <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> were procured from Richard in Paris. A four-inch equatorial, a three-inch transit instrument, and four pendulum clocks with two chronometers, were also procured from the observatory at Modena. In 1888, the gift of a 16 inch long telescope to Pope Leo XIII, became a part of the observatory. Father Denza joined the observatory in 1889 after it was upgraded with more modern instruments. The same year, a second tower was built some [...] away from the main Gregorian Tower, overlooking the Vatican Gardens behind St. Peter's Basilica on the south-west border. It was built to a diameter of [...] with a lower wall thickness of , which could bear the load of a 13-inch photographic refractor, newly procured from Paris. Augustinian Father Rodriguez was the expert meteorologist who held the post of director from 1898 to 1905. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII, promulgating the motu proprio Ut mysticam, designated the second tower as the seat of the newly established Vatican Observatory, a decision which required altering the roof to provide a flat terrace for astronomical observations.|$|E
500|$|Off {{the coast}} of Louisiana, the {{hurricane}} wrecked three boats, but all the occupants were safely rescued. While making landfall in Louisiana, Edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 9.7feet (2.9m) above normal at Cypremont Point near Morgan City. The highest winds reported by a land station were 69mph (111km/h) at Cameron, where a wind gust of 96mph (155km/h) was also reported. However, {{due to the lack}} of <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> near the hurricane's landing point, whether higher winds occurred there is not known, although likely. Rainfall was moderate across Louisiana, including amounts of over 8inches (200mm) in the southwestern portion of the state. A strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane, combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane's circulation, produced 16 tornadoes from Louisiana to Alabama. An F3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of Baton Rouge, causing heavy property damage totaling $2.5million (1971 dollars, $ in [...] dollars) along its intermittent 7mile (11km) path. The tornado also injured three people. An F2 tornado in Tangipahoa Parish caused $250,000 in damage (1971 dollars, $ in [...] dollars) along its 4mile (6km) path, while an F1 tornado in St. Martin Parish injured 6people on its 3mile (5km) path. The hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern Louisiana. About a month after Edith struck the United States, President Richard Nixon declared portions of Louisiana as a disaster area, which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens.|$|E

2500|$|The new tower {{provided}} the durable weather-resistant, vibration-free environment necessary for accurate instrument readings. [...] The {{first floor of}} the tower contains the director's office. [...] The weather bureau is on the second floor and a laboratory and access to the roof are found on the third floor. [...] Various wind gauges and other meteorological <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> are attached to the roof of the tower. [...] The observatory still retains barometers and other instrumentation dating from the late 19th century. [...] These instruments are used to calibrate the modern instrumentation to preserve the accuracy and integrity of the data base dating back to 1885.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{timing and}} firing system was on board Atlanta to direct photo planes, smoke rockets and {{hundreds}} of <b>recording</b> <b>instruments,</b> the synchronization of which was essential. The test shots resembled a small nuclear explosion, creating a shock wave {{on the water and}} an expanding shock condensation cloud. The fireball and mushroom cloud were present (but obviously no radiation or dangerous fallout was produced). The blast created an overpressure of 10 psi on the target, a moving wall of highly compressed air with maximum wind speeds of 294mph. An overpressure blast of that magnitude is equivalent to a [...] burst at roughly 8000 feet and is sufficient to be lethal and capable of destroying reinforced concrete buildings. Knowing the yield of the blast, this also implies the Atlanta was placed around 800 feet away from ground zero for that particular test. Two blimps were also destroyed high above ground, and a life size mannequin placed on the deck facing the blast was violently thrown over. The first test Bravo also produced a large amount of rock ejecta that caused secondary damage. To solve this problem, the second shot was placed over a five-foot mound of sand, and the last shot Delta was detonated over the previous crater that was back filled with 39,000 cubic yards of sand.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{well the}} reader should {{understand}} {{the conditions under}} which it would seem these messages were sent. Somewhere within the moon Cavor certainly had access for a time to a considerable amount of electrical apparatus, and it would seem he rigged up--perhaps furtively--a transmitting arrangement of the Marconi type. This he was able to operate at irregular intervals: sometimes for only half an hour or so, sometimes for three or four hours at a stretch. At these times he transmitted his earthward message, regardless {{of the fact that the}} relative position of the moon and points upon the earth's surface is constantly altering. As a consequence of this and of the necessary imperfections of our <b>recording</b> <b>instruments</b> his communication comes and goes in our records in an extremely fitful manner; it becomes blurred; it [...] "fades out" [...] in a mysterious and altogether exasperating way. And added to this is the fact that he was not an expert operator; he had partly forgotten, or never completely mastered, the code in general use, and as he became fatigued he dropped words and misspelt in a curious manner.|$|E
