40|$|The first WHO {{essential}} drugs list, {{published in}} 1977, {{was described as}} a peaceful revolution in international public health. The list helped to establish the principle that some medicines were more useful than others and that essential medicines were often inaccessible to many populations. Since then, the essential medicines list (EML) has increased in size; defining an essential medicine has moved from an experience to an evidence-based process, including criteria such as public-health relevance, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. High priced medicines such as antiretrovirals are now included. Differences exist between the WHO model EML and national EMLs since countries face varying challenges relating to costs, drug effectiveness, morbidity patterns, and rationality of prescribing. Ensuring equitable access to and rational use of essential medicines has been promoted through WHO's <b>revised</b> <b>drug</b> <b>strategy.</b> This approach has required an engagement by WHO on issues such as the effect of international trade agreements on access to essential medicines and research and development to ensure availability of new essential medicines...|$|E

Transitional Care {{was introduced by}} SPS in 2001 to support short-term prisoners (that is, those serving less than 4 years) and remand prisoners with an identified substance misuse problem. The main aim of Transitional Care was to facilitate access to pre-existing community services based on an individual's assessed needs. This was done through the provision of support during a 12 -week period immediately following a prisoner's return to the community. The Transitional Care arrangements were provided by Cranstoun Drug Services under contract to SPS. A research team from the University of Stirling and TNS Social Research was commissioned to evaluate the operation and effectiveness of the Transitional Care initiative. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods was employed in this study. This included the analysis of Transitional Care monitoring data; surveys of prisoners four and seven months following release; in-depth interviews with ex-prisoners in three {{areas of the country}} with different demographic characteristics and varying arrangements for the delivery of Transitional Care; and interviews with prison and community based staff associated with Transitional Care.

40|$|The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) {{has issued}} all prisons in England with a tool-kit to help health specialists provide vital talking therapies for inmates seeking to quit drugs. Node-link mapping was first {{designed}} to help students take better notes during lengthy college lectures. Now the NTA has adapted the technique to help drug workers when counselling prisoners and has funded 1, 000 kits for issue to prisons in England. Copies of the kit for use by drug workers in the community can be downloaded for free at the NTA's website NTA Chief Executive Paul Hayes said: "The NTA works with partners in drug treatment, health, councils, police, prisons, probation and social services to move people as quickly and safely as possible through treatment to recovery and re-integration in their local community. "Psychological and social interventions are central to recovery and tools like this are proven and effective in supporting better practice and improved interventions in drug treatment. " The prison toolkit is an adaptation of the tried and tested Routes to Recovery mapping tool which is used by clinicians and drug workers in the community. Based on the premise 'a picture is worth a thousand words',the tool offers the prisoner an opportunity to explore issues in their lives in an open, non-confrontational way enabling drug worker and patient to work towards more structured therapy focussing on family, health, offending and to measure change and progress. There is strong international evidence that when used as part of counselling, the technique increases the effectiveness of drug treatment. Studies on offenders out on probation in the US found patients stayed off opiates and cocaine for longer, missed fewer therapy sessions and felt more positive about their treatment and their relationship with their key worker. Rebalancing treatment to support drug free outcomes is a key strand of the new government's <b>revised</b> <b>drug</b> <b>strategy,</b> {{to be published in}} December.

The same year, 809 clandestine laboratories were detected nationwide;the highest number ever detected in Australia. In 2012-13, police made the second highest number of detections ever at 757. The report did not comment on whether this is due to an increase in police activity or drug availability. There is also no reference to harm caused by legislation or any indication of a review of drug laws. The new strategy is to operate for the next 10 years, to 2025, without questioning the underlying criminal punishment approach to illegal drug use.|$|R
