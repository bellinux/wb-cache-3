50|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made at better understanding the spatial ecology of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, including capture analysis and <b>radiotelemetry</b> studies. Since the recognition of the breeding population of pythons, researchers have made an effort to notate the capture history (date, location, and time) as well as characteristics (mass, length, sex, reproduction condition, and gut contents) of each animal to better characterize the python's activity patterns, spread, and ecology. More than 2,000 pythons have been captured since 2005, including hatchling pythons, gravid females, and adults in excess of 17.5 ft (5.33 m) in total length. Gut analyses indicate that captured pythons consume nearly any bird, mammal, or alligator found in the Everglades, including nationally endangered Key Largo woodrats (Neotoma floridana smalli) and wood storks (Mycteria americana). <b>Radiotelemetry</b> includes the use of small, surgically implanted radiotransmitters to track the movement patterns of captured and released animals over extended periods of time. A 2014 study suggests that Burmese pythons have navigational map and compass senses. In contrast to previous research that documented the poor navigational abilities of terrestrial snakes, the movement behavior of the Burmese python seems to be nonrandom. The movements of twelve adult Burmese pythons in Everglades National Park were tracked after they were translocated from their initial locations. Five of the six snakes that were displaced 21-36 km from their capture sites displayed oriented movement by returning to within 5 km of their original location.|$|E

5000|$|These turtles travel {{extensively}} {{over land}} to reach new habitats or to lay eggs. Pollution, habitat destruction, food scarcity, overcrowding, {{and other factors}} drive snappers to move; it is quite common to find them traveling far from the nearest water source. This species mates from April through November, with their peak laying season in June and July. The female can hold sperm for several seasons, using it as necessary. Females travel over land to find sandy soil in which to lay their eggs, often {{some distance from the}} water. After digging a hole, the female typically deposits 25 to 80 eggs each year, guiding them into the nest with her hind feet and covering them with sand for incubation and protection. Incubation time is temperature-dependent, ranging from 9 to 18 weeks. In cooler climates, hatchlings overwinter in the nest. The common snapping turtle is remarkably cold-tolerant; <b>radiotelemetry</b> studies have shown some individuals do not hibernate, but remain active under the ice during the winter. Hibernating snapping turtles do not breathe for, {{in the northern part of}} their range, more than six months since ice covers their hibernating site. These turtles can get oxygen by pushing their head out of the mud and allowing gas exchange to take place through the membranes of their mouth and throat. This is known as extrapulmonary respiration. If they cannot get enough oxygen through this method they start to utilize anaerobic pathways, burning sugars and fats without the use of oxygen. The metabolic by-products from this process are acidic and create very undesirable side effects by spring, which are known as oxygen debt.Although designated as [...] "least concern" [...] on the IUCN redlist, the species has been designated in the Canadian part of its range as [...] "Special Concern" [...] due to its life history being sensitive to disruption by anthropogenic activity.|$|E

Cows were ovariectomised following the third synchronised oestrus and then retreated to induce oestrus (Round 4). Oestrus was monitored by continuous visual observation and <b>radiotelemetry</b> between 24 and at least 60 h after removal of inserts at Rounds 1 – 4. Significant differences (P< 0. 001) were obtained between the mean number of mounts (42. 7 versus 17. 8), duration of oestrus (14. 4 h versus 10. 9 h), total duration of mounts (223. 9 s versus 33. 1 s), mean duration per mount (5. 6 s versus 1. 9 s), the number of mounts per hour (3. 5 versus 2. 0) and the interval to oestrus (41. 2 h versus 42. 8 h) between values determined by visual observation compared with <b>radiotelemetry,</b> respectively. The 95 % limits of agreement for all the characteristics of oestrus measured were wide although the efficiency of detection of oestrus for both methods of recording oestrus were high (97. 5 % (78 / 80) versus 93. 8 % (75 / 80), for visual observation and <b>radiotelemetry,</b> respectively; P= 0. 25).

40|$|Passage {{of adult}} Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss at dams in the Columbia River basin has {{historically}} been determined by visual fish counts and <b>radiotelemetry.</b> Increasingly, however, passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are being used for adult salmonid research and monitoring. Although both <b>radiotelemetry</b> and PIT tag technology provide accurate and cost-effective data under certain circumstances, neither alone meets all needs, and managers {{need to understand the}} strengths, weaknesses, and biases of each method. To evaluate the two tagging methods, we tagged over 3, 200 adult Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead during 2002 and 2003 with both a radio transmitter and a PIT tag as the fish migrated upstream past Bonneville Dam. We compared their performance in measuring upstream passage and fallback (i. e., downstream passage) behavior at each of four main-stem hydropower dams. Counts of fish passage at dams based on data from double-tagged fish were similar between methods (largest difference was 5. 1 %), but the two methods produced less consistent results for fallback behavior. Visual count escapement estimates based on PIT tags were 1 % higher on average than those based on radio tags, suggesting there would be little impact on the management of salmonid populations with a switch from <b>radiotelemetry</b> to PIT tag systems as the primary data source. We also analyzed a broader group of PIT-tagged (but not radio-tagged) fish to simulate the analysis one could expect from PIT tag data without <b>radiotelemetry</b> validation. When compared with PIT tag data from double-tagged fish, data from the PIT tag-only fish showed slight differences in the timing of peak passage.

40|$|<b>Radiotelemetry</b> is {{a widely}} used and {{informative}} tool in studies of animal ecology, behavior, and conservation. Over the past 50 years, many different methods {{have been used to}} outfit animals with radiotransmitters. <b>Radiotelemetry</b> studies on snakes typically require anesthesia and surgery to internally implant transmitters; however, internal implantation methods can increase snake mortality and infection rates, and may alter natural behaviors, thereby reducing data validity. We qualitatively compared 3 methods of external transmitter attachment (i. e., glue-only, tape-and-glue, and a subdermal stitch), and compared their utility for collection of spatial data from April to November 2012 and 2013 at Magnetawan First Nation near Britt, Ontario, Canada. Transmitters attached with glue-only and tape-and-glue methods fell off shortly after deployment because of environmental factors and snake shedding. Both methods also resulted in skin irritation and slightly impeded snake movements. Conversely, the subdermal stitch method was long lasting in both the field and lab, and did not cause significant skin irritation. Also, the subdermal stitch method did not affect movement or the rattlesnake's ability to rattle. Additional quantitative research is required to determine if the subdermal stitch method triggers immune responses, infections, or negatively affects snake fitness. Our results suggest that the subdermal stitch method may be a viable external attachment method for use in <b>radiotelemetry</b> of snakes. 8 page(s...|$|E

To compare the efficacy of Bup with that of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug indomethacin (Indo) for postsurgical recovery, male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were treated on the day of <b>radiotelemetry</b> implantation with Bup (0. 3 mg/kg SC) or Indo (1 mg/kg SC) followed by treatment with Indo (1 mg/kg PO) on the next day (Bup–Indo versus Indo–Indo). Responses were compared between treatments in mice implanted with a <b>radiotelemetry</b> device and those that did not undergo surgery. Changes in BW, FI, WI, Tc, and activity were examined throughout 14 d of recovery. Indo–Indo was more efficacious in inhibiting postsurgical BW, FI, and WI reductions, compared with Bup–Indo. Bup also reduced BW and FI in the absence of surgery, indicating a nonspecific effect of this drug on these variables. Indo–Indo treatment was associated with higher activity levels during lights-on–to–lights-off transition periods compared with that observed with Bup–Indo.

Collection of systolic blood pressure data by the indirect tail-cuff plethysmography method consistently shows increased pressures in low protein exposed rodent offspring compared to controls, but this technique has been criticised as the associated stress artefacts may confound the observed effects. Conversely, <b>radiotelemetry</b> systems allow unrestrained and continuous monitoring of blood pressure through the awake and sleep phases of the diurnal cycle. In this novel study, we directly compared blood pressure parameters in male offspring from low protein and control-fed dams measured simultaneously using tail-cuff and <b>radiotelemetry</b> systems.

Conversely, low protein males were relatively hypertensive at 8 weeks of age when measured by tail-cuff, but had significantly lower blood pressure than controls at 12 weeks of age when measured by telemetry. Heart rate and length of systole did not differ between the two groups. Individual stress protocols mimicking those imposed by tail-cuff plethysmography (novel environment, heat, restraint, inflation), caused similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate in control and low protein animals, ruling out an effect of enhanced pressor response to stress following prenatal protein restriction. Instead, an increase in peripheral vascular resistance in these animals is considered possible.
