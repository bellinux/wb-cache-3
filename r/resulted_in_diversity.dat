Little is known regarding the effect of nitrogen (N) deposition on the belowground microbial communities. This study aimed to examine the response of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to added N in semiarid temperate grassland. We studied the changes of AOB and AOA by using molecular techniques targeting amoA genes along a urea fertilization gradient, i. e., 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 g N m(- 2) year(- 1), in a 6 -year field experiment of semiarid temperate grassland, Inner Mongolia of China. AOB community responded to urea-N substrate clearly, and N addition rates 2 - 4 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) induced an increase in its abundances and the shift of its composition. However, AOA community remained unchanged and the highest N loading at 64 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) even decreased its abundance. Moreover, higher N loading rates (more than 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1)) significantly decreased the diversity of AOB but not AOA, {{as indicated by the}} decrease of its Shannon and Evenness indices. The relative long-term nitrogen loading of more than 2 - 4 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>diversity</b> loss of AOB in this semiarid temperate grassland.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} nature of HRM, {{and the effects of}} HR practices on employee attitudes, in the Nigerian public and private sector from an institutional perspective. The research was divided into 2 studies. Study 1 explored the influence of institutions on HRM in the public and private sector as well as examining the specific HRM techniques adopted in public and private sector organizations in Nigeria. Data for study 1 were collected from HR managers via questionnaires (n= 122) and in-depth qualitative interviews (n= 13) whilst study 2 data were collected from public and private sector employees (n= 521) drawn from organizations participating in study 1. Findings from study 1 indicate that mimetic and normative mechanisms such as the influence of consultants and professional socialization respectively influenced HRM in both sectors in the same way. Nevertheless, due to weak enforcement of labour legislation in the private sector, the influence of coercive mechanisms such as labour laws, trade unions and regulatory bodies had stronger influence in the public sector. This <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>diversity</b> in specific HRM practices adopted across organizations; with private organizations more likely to adopt practices that were characterised by informality, cost-cutting, low employee voice and neglect of labour legislation. Findings from study 2 indicate significant effects of HR practices on employee attitudes in both sectors. Although it was expected that procedural justice and HR attributions would account for differences in the effects of HR practices on employee attitudes between public and private sector employees, the hypothesized relationships for HR attributions were not supported. However, the effects of HR practices on affective commitment through procedural justice were higher in the public sector. This research highlights the link between the institutional environment and the specific HRM practices adopted by organizations and how this in turn influences employee perceptions of fairness in relation to attitudinal outcomes of HR practices...|$|E

Supreme Court has recently ruled its use constitutional. This paper investigates the implications of affirmative action, particularly race-conscious compared to race-blind admissions policy; explains how alternative programs are generally impractical; and provides {{a brief review of}} the history and legality of affirmative action in the United States. Discussion Selection based solely on academic qualifications such as GPA and MCAT scores does not achieve racial and ethnic <b>diversity</b> <b>in</b> medical school, nor does it adequately predict success as practicing physicians. However, race-conscious preference yields greater practice in underserved and often minority populations, furthers our biomedical research progression, augments health care for minority patients, and fosters an exceptional medical school environment where students are better able to serve an increasingly multicultural society.
