By increasing the ClX mixing ratio by 5. 0 ppbv, the temperature in this region is decreased by 5 to 10 K with a slight increase below 30 km. The local ozone depletion around 40 km due to added ClX is smaller compared with the estimate made by keeping the temperature fixed to the ambient condition.

The <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> of emitters to nano wires in the near field and change in their lifetimes due to small mode volume enclosures have been elucidated with the retarded solutions before.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> between two two-level atoms with arbitrarily polarized dipoles {{in the vicinity}} of a nanofiber. We present a systematic derivation for the master equation, the single- and cross-atom decay coefficients, and the dipole-dipole interaction coefficients for the atoms interacting with the vacuum of the field in the guided and radiation modes of the nanofiber. We study numerically the case where the atomic dipoles are circularly polarized. In this case, the rate of emission depends on the propagation direction, that is, the radiative interaction between the atoms is chiral. We examine the time evolution of the atoms for different initial states. We calculate the fluxes and mean numbers of photons spontaneously emitted into guided modes in the positive and negative directions of the fiber axis. We show that the chiral <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> modifies the collective emission of the atoms. We observe that the modifications strongly depend on the initial state of the atomic system, the radiative transfer direction, the distance between the atoms, and the distance from the atoms to the fiber surface.

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{cooperative}} emission of light by an ensemble of emitters, such as fluorescing molecules or semiconductor quantum dots, located near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon. The primary mechanism of cooperative emission in such systems is resonant energy transfer between emitters and plasmons rather than the Dicke <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> between emitters. We identify two types of plasmonic coupling between the emitters, (i) plasmon-enhanced <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> and (ii) plasmon-assisted nonradiative energy transfer, the competition between them governing the structure of system eigenstates. Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nm from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions. The crossover between two regimes {{can be observed in}} distance dependence of ensemble quantum efficiency. Our numerical calculations incorporating direct and plasmon-assisted interactions between the emitters indicate that they do not destroy the plasmonic Dicke effect.

The first experiment aimed at computing the rate of temperature change in the stratosphere due to longwave radiative transfer by CO 2, H 2 O and O 3 from Ramanathan's (1976) radiative-convective model applied to the troposphere-stratosphere circulation. The second experiment employs the Newtonian cooling approximation in which the rate of temperature change in the stratosphere by longwave radiative transfer is set equal to {{the product of the}} Newtonian cooling coefficient 'h' and the departure of the local temperature from a reference temperature. It is shown that the latitudinal temperature distribution of the lower stratosphere is maintained by the combined effects of dynamics, O 3 solar heating and the longwave <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> between troposphere and stratosphere.

40|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments {{rule out}} fermion dark matter {{that is a}} chiral representation of the electroweak gauge group. Non-chiral real, complex and singlet representations, however, provide viable fermion dark matter candidates. Although {{any one of these}} candidates will be virtually impossible to detect at the LHC, it is shown that they may be detected at future planned direct detection experiments. For the real case, an irreducible <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> to quarks may allow a detection. The complex case in general has an experimentally ruled out tree-level coupling to quarks via Z-boson exchange. However, in the case of two SU(2) _L doublets, a higher dimensional coupling to the Higgs can suppress this coupling, and a remaining irreducible <b>radiative</b> <b>coupling</b> may allow a detection. Singlet dark matter could be detected through a coupling to quarks via Higgs exchange. Since all non-chiral dark matter can have a coupling to the Higgs, at least some of its mass can be obtained from electroweak symmetry breaking, and this mass is a useful characterization of its direct detection cross-section.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in medical imaging is to ""see"" a tumour embedded into tissue, which is a turbid medium, by using fluorescent probes for tumour labeling. This problem, despite the efforts made during the last years, has not been fully encountered yet, due to the non-linear nature of the inverse problem and the convergence failures of many optimization techniques. This paper describes a robust solution of the inverse problem, based on data fitting and image fine-tuning techniques. As a forward solver the <b>coupled</b> <b>radiative</b> transfer equation and diffusion approximation model is proposed and compromised via a finite element method, enhanced with adaptive multi-grids for faster and more accurate convergence. A database is constructed by application of the forward model on virtual tumours with known geometry, and thus fluorophore distribution, embedded into simulated tissues. The fitting procedure produces the best matching between the real and virtual data, and thus provides the initial estimation of the fluorophore distribution.
