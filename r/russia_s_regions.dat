40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to explain <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> {{apparent}} acquiescence to the decision extending NATO membership to the Baltic States. Can the acquiescence be explained by internalization of norms stipulating the sovereign rights of the Baltic States in the Russian foreign policy paradigm? If changes in normative structures cannot account for <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> conduct, can rationalist theorizing {{shed light on the}} issue? Analysis of Russian foreign policy paradigm uncovers normative and ideational structures that are not compatible with the internalization of norms defining the sovereign rights of the former Soviet republics. In addition, conditions facilitating internalization of the new norms are absent, making it unlikely that it could account for Russian conduct. Findings of analysis of Russian foreign policy paradigm direct the account towards rationalist theorizing. Norms and ideas constituting Russian identity are found to be consistent with behavioral models specified by institutionalism, indicating that acquiescence {{is more likely to be}} a result of cost and benefit assessment by Russian policy makers, consistent with the calculative, pragmatic approach characterizing <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> foreign policy.

As a successor state to the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation {{was faced with a}} multiple of challenges. The re-emergence of Russia as a separate, independent entity compelled the Russian Federation {{to come to terms with}} its revived national identity and to redefine its national interests. <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the West lay at the core of its challenge to define what Russia is and how it should relate to the outside world. Opinion divided over whether Russia should rapidly integrate with Europe and return to the civilized community of nations or whether it should seek a strengthening of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> positions in the East and rather pursue its unique mission as a mediator between the East and West. Against this backdrop I will analyse <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> membership in the Council of Europe and its partial compliance to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) Protocol No. 6, which refer to the abolishment of the death penalty in peacetime. Employing constructivist insights, I argue that <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> partial compliance to Protocol No. 6 is explained by the lack of a coherent and widely accepted national identity, which is part of a wider, more fundamental identity debate that has lasted for centuries in Russia. Due to the different perceptions of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> identity among state actors, when these identities collide interests and consequently action will be in a competing and conflictual relationship to each other. Thus, norm compliance is challenged when identities overlap and their norms conflict. This, I argue, is evident in <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the European ideational community and the country s dealing with the death penalty issue. The more Russian state actors value the European identity of their state, the more they will seek to comply with norms incumbent upon European states, such as the strong European abolitionist norm. It follows that in the opposite case, actors will be more reluctant to abide by European norms, and thus norm violation is more likely. In my analysis, I explore whether it is right to fully dismiss rational explanations to <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> partial compliance. In this way I bring my case into the midst of the rational-constructivist debate in International Relations theory. Contributing to this debate I investigate whether an either or approach is the most productive way of explaining <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> ideational behaviour or whether rational and constructivist assumptions combined may shed new light on how to understand Russian compliance with international human rights norms or lack of such...|$|R

40|$|SummaryTranscription through {{immunoglobulin}} switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions</b> {{is essential}} for class switch recombination (CSR), but no molecular function of the transcripts has been described. Likewise, recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> is critical for CSR; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that intronic switch RNA acts in trans to target AID to <b>S</b> <b>region</b> DNA. AID binds directly to switch RNA through G-quadruplexes formed by the RNA molecules. Disruption of this interaction by mutation of a key residue in the putative RNA-binding domain of AID impairs recruitment of AID to <b>S</b> <b>region</b> DNA, thereby abolishing CSR. Additionally, inhibition of RNA lariat processing leads to loss of AID localization to <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> and compromises CSR; both defects can be rescued by exogenous expression of switch transcripts in a sequence-specific manner.

40|$|Class switch {{recombination}} (CSR) allows B {{cells to}} make effective protective antibodies. CSR involves {{the replacement of}} the μ constant region with one of the downstream constant regions by recombination between the donor and recipient switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions.</b> Although histone H 3 hyperacetylation in recipient <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> was recently reported to coincide with CSR, the relative histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation status of the donor and recipient <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> and the relationship between the generation of mutations and histone hyperacetylation in <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> have not been addressed.

40|$|AbstractImmunoglobulin class switch {{recombination}} joins a new constant (C) {{region to}} the rearranged and expressed heavy chain variable (VDJ) region in antigen-activated B cells (Figure 1 A) (reviewed in [1, 2]). Switch recombination is activated by transcription of intronic, G-rich and repetitive switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions</b> and produces junctions that are heterogeneous in sequence and {{position in the}} <b>S</b> <b>regions.</b> Switch recombination depends upon the B cell-specific cytidine deaminase, AID, and conserved DNA repair factors, including the mismatch repair heterodimer, MutSα (MSH 2 /MSH 6). In mice, ablation of Msh 2 or Msh 6, but not Msh 3, decreases levels of switch recombination and diminishes heterogeneity of switch junctions [3 – 7]. Here, we demonstrate that MSH 2 associates with transcribed <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> in primary murine B cells activated for switch recombination. Electron microscopic imaging reveals that MutSα binds in vitro to DNA structures formed within transcribed <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> and mediates their synapsis. MutSα binds with high affinity to G 4 DNA formed upon transcription of the <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> and also binds to U·G mismatches, initial products of DNA deamination by AID.

40|$|Antibody class {{switching}} occurs in mature B cells {{in response to}} antigen stimulation and costimulatory signals. It occurs by a unique type of intrachromosomal deletional recombination within special G-rich tandem repeated DNA sequences [called switch, or <b>S,</b> <b>regions</b> located upstream {{of each of the}} heavy chain constant (C(H)) region genes, except Cdelta]. The recombination is initiated by the B cell-specific activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which deaminates cytosines in both the donor and acceptor <b>S</b> <b>regions.</b> AID activity converts several dC bases to dU bases in each <b>S</b> <b>region,</b> and the dU bases are then excised by the uracil DNA glycosylase UNG; the resulting abasic sites are nicked by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE). AID attacks both strands of transcriptionally active <b>S</b> <b>regions,</b> but how transcription promotes AID targeting is not entirely clear. Mismatch repair proteins are then involved in converting the resulting single-strand DNA breaks to double-strand breaks with DNA ends appropriate for end-joining recombination.

We addressed this question by using an artificial DNA construct containing a constitutively transcribed � switch (S�) region and an � switch (S�) region driven by a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The construct was introduced into a switch-inducible B lymphoma line and the quantitative correlation between <b>S</b> � <b>region</b> transcription and class switching efficiency was evaluated. The level of S � transcription was linearly correlated with CSR efficiency, reaching a plateau at saturation. On the other hand, we failed to obtain the evidence to support involvement of either RNA–DNA heteroduplex or trans germline transcripts in CSR.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} difficulties encountered {{in international relations}} between Russia and the West, specifically Europe, {{in spite of their}} cultural and geographical proximity and the expectation that Russia and Europe would share values and interests following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The problem is addressed through focussing on a particular aspect of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> national and state identity greatpowerness. Greatpowerness - the self-perception that Russia always has been and still is a great power - is a significant part of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> self identity. The effects of Russian greatpowerness are examined through investigation of <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relations with three European international organisations the Council of Europe, the European Union, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe from the early 1990 s through to 2004. The particular issue through which these relationships are explored are the two Chechen wars of 1994 - 1996 and 2000 - 2004. Russian actions in Chechnya provoked frequent criticisms from the West, but were seen in Russia in the 1990 s as an internal matter, and as part of the international war on terrorism in the 2000 s. In both cases, they reflected in part <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> great power aspirations. There were particular sets of expectations from the Russian side based on its self-perception in each case. It is argued in the dissertation that this plays a part in understanding the difficulties and apparent inconsistencies encountered in <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the West. The dissertation contributes to explaining inconsistencies in Russian foreign policy behaviour towards the West which are not adequately accounted for by existing empirical and theoretical approaches. It begins with a discussion of definitions of being a Great Power and understandings of greatpowerness as an issue of self-perception in state identity. It then looks at Russian understandings of international relations, different Russian foreign policy schools and a series of factors which are persistent in Russian greatpowerness: sovereignty, ressentiment, isolationism, expansionism, imperialism, multilaterism and multipolarity. Next it sets the course of the two Chechen wars in the context of Russian political and international development. The main empirical section of the dissertation is taken up by the three case studies of the Council of Europe, the European Union, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, noting similarities and distinctions in each case as to how Russia experienced interaction with the three different organisations. The Council of Europe has adopted a rather pragmatic approach in its cooperation with Russia and hence, in spite of some difficulties, the relationship has been the best of the three. This cooperation has challenged Russian greatpowerness the least and expectations came closest to outcomes. Cooperation with the EU has been of a different nature since Russia is not a member state. Here the relationship has had good and bad periods, which have very much depended on how Russia has felt about its level of expectations met by outcomes. The Russian relationship to the OSCE was also full of ups and downs always with strongly power political reasons. Russian expectations were highest in regards to the OSCE. However it challenged Russian greatpowerness most and caused biggest disappointment. In conclusion, it is shown that Russian self-perception of greatpowerness and the aspiration to have its status as a Great Power recognised internationally provides one part of the explanation of the apparent inconsistencies while showing a form of consistency in <b>Russia</b> <b>s</b> relationship with the West...|$|R
40|$|Class switch DNA {{recombination}} (CSR) diversifies {{the biological}} effector functions of antibodies and {{is critical for}} the maturation of the antibody response. This process is initiated by AID-mediated introduction of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in the upstream and downstream switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions</b> that will be recombined as effected by intervention of Ku 70 /Ku 86 and the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway.

We have demonstrated that B cell deficiency of Rad 52, {{a critical component of}} the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway, resulted in increased CSR. Conversely, enforced Rad 52 expression impaired CSR. This elevation of CSR in Rad 52 −/− B cells was associated with increased recruitment of Ku 70 /Ku 86 to <b>S</b> <b>region</b> DSB ends. Indeed, Rad 52 competed with Ku 70 /Ku 86 for binding to blunt and staggered DSB ends, as shown by in vitro competition using purified Rad 52 and Ku 70 /Ku 86 molecules, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays involving anti-Rad 52 antibody (Ab) and anti-Ku 70 /Ku 86 monoclonal antibody (mAb).

It is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -mediated deoxycytosine deamination, yielding deoxyuridine (dU), and dU glycosylation by uracil DNA glycosylase (Ung) in antibody switch (<b>S)</b> <b>region</b> DNA. Here we showed that the translesion DNA synthesis polymerase Rev 1 directly interacted with Ung and targeted in an AID-dependent and Ung-independent fashion the <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> undergoing CSR. Rev 1 −/− Ung+/+ B cells reduced Ung recruitment to <b>S</b> <b>regions,</b> DNA-dU glycosylation, and CSR. Together with an <b>S</b> <b>region</b> spectrum of mutations similar to that of Rev 1 +/+ Ung−/− B cells, this suggests that Rev 1 operates in the same pathway as Ung, as emphasized by further decreased CSR in Rev 1 −/− Msh 2 −/− B cells. Rescue of CSR in Rev 1 −/− B cells by a catalytically inactive Rev 1 mutant shows that the important role of Rev 1 in CSR is mediated by Rev 1 ’s scaffolding function, not its enzymatic function...|$|R
40|$|International audienceClass switch {{recombination}} (CSR) occurs between highly repetitive sequences called switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions</b> and is {{initiated by}} activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). CSR is {{preceded by a}} bidirectional transcription of <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> but {{the relative importance of}} sense and antisense transcription for CSR in vivo is unknown. We generated three mouse lines in which we attempted a premature termination of transcriptional elongation by inserting bidirectional transcription terminators upstream of Sμ, upstream of Sγ 3 or downstream of Sγ 3 sequences. The data show, at least for Sγ 3, that sense transcriptional elongation across <b>S</b> <b>region</b> is absolutely required for CSR whereas its antisense counterpart is largely dispensable, strongly suggesting that sense transcription is sufficient for AID targeting to both DNA strands...|$|R

Like RAPD, restriction analysis of ITS+ 5. 8 <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> using six restriction enzymes (Msp l, Bsu 151, Hin 61, Hind lll, Hin fl and Taq l) also showed that restriction patterns from the same species generated similar patterns. From UPGMA cluster analysis of RAPD and PCR-RFLP of ITS+ 5. 8 <b>S</b> <b>regions,</b> Ganoderma species from the same host were clustered together. The results {{from the present study}} showed that RAPD and PCR-RFLP of ITS+ 5. 8 <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> could be used in characterization and taxonomic analysis of Ganoderma species from different hosts. Both techniques could also provide rapid procedure for differentiation of Ganoderma species in Peninsula Malaysia...|$|R

Revealed comparative advantage patterns are also determined using production data. Dynamic changes in comparative advantage patterns are identified using a methodology developed by Kreinin and Plummer (1994 a). Comparative advantage patterns and the degree of structural change in exports vary considerably across regions.

40|$|Ig {{heavy chain}} (IgH) class-switch {{recombination}} (CSR) replaces the IgH Cμ constant region exons {{with one of}} several sets of downstream IgH constant region exons (e. g., Cγ, Cε, or Cα), which affects switching from IgM to another IgH class (e. g., IgG, IgE, or IgA). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR by promoting DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within switch (<b>S)</b> <b>regions</b> flanking the donor Cμ (Sμ) and a downstream acceptor CH (e. g., Sγ, Sε, Sα) that are then joined to complete CSR. DSBs generated in Sμ frequently are joined within Sμ to form internal switch region deletions (ISD). AID-induced ISD and mutations have been considered rare in downstream <b>S</b> <b>regions,</b> suggesting that AID targeting to these <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> requires its prior recruitment to Sμ. We have now assayed for CSR and ISD in B cells lacking Sμ (Sμ−/− B cells). In Sμ−/− B cells activated for CSR to IgG 1 and IgE, CSR to IgG 1 was greatly reduced; but, surprisingly, CSR to IgE occurred at nearly normal levels. Moreover, normal B cells had substantial Sγ 1 ISD and increased mutations in and near Sγ 1, and levels of both were greatly increased in Sμ−/− B cells. Finally, Sμ−/− B cells underwent downstream CSR between Sγ 1 and Sε on alleles that lacked Sμ CSR to these sequences. Our findings show that AID targets downstream <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> independently of CSR with Sμ and implicate an alternative pathway for IgE class switching that involves generation and joining of DSBs within two different downstream <b>S</b> <b>regions</b> before Sμ joining...|$|R
