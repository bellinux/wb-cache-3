The speed and discontinuity of this process, together with the changing character and purpose of the process of regional cooperation, raise two crucial questions for the region. First, is there a need for regional cooperation and integration in SEE? Second, what type of cooperation is needed? The paper seeks to address these questions by discussing the challenges and opportunities resulting from recent developments in the region (‘EU distancing’, ‘regional ownership’, etc) and their implications for the perspective that the region can follow. In doing so, it attempts an analysis of the goals of regionalism in Southeast Europe and offers some policy proposals for its future.

40|$|Numerous {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} decision making framework of public agencies with multiple goals {{have been published in}} recent years. The central problem of the multiple goal decision process of public agencies is the problem of unvalued benefits stemming from projects which the agency could potentially implement. Regardless of the complexity of the problem, the fact remains that choices must be made between projects. As a result, several alternative procedures for analyzing the issue have been suggested. These may be subdivided into three more or less different approaches: (1) estimation of value indexes or weights for the arguments of the objective function, (2) constrained optimization models, (3) political decision procedures. The last alternative provides the setting for the discussion that follows. The object is to suggest procedures for incorporating better information in valued and non-valued benefits into public resource. Agency programs of the United States Forest Service are analyzed in terms of their valued benefits and their impact on regional employment. Given that there are significant dependencies in certain Colorado communities on the timber industry, how important is Forest Service timber-harvesting policy for these industries and communities? This question is the basis for the objectives of this thesis. These objectives may be stated as: 1. to quantify the cost of providing for regional income objectives via timber harvesting and investment, and 2. To determine the distribution of benefits from public timber harvesting-investment programs. Are the benefits accruing to particular local economies, or are they leaking out of the region? A present value model is used to value timber investment alternatives. When present values are negative and {{it can be argued that}} the investments were undertaken to provide for timber originating employment objectives. To analyze incidence of benefits, <b>regional</b> <b>ownership</b> of capital resources in lumber manufacturing and harvesting are first identified. The proportion of incremental income generated by timber investments which is allocated to non-resident capital is then identified by analysis of factor shares. Analysis of employment sustained by timber harvesting and investment confirmed the generally accepted conclusion that Forest Service timber policy can be an important factor in regional economies. The present value analysis indicated that timber investment alternatives in Colorado typically yield negative values at reasonable discount rates. The distribution of benefits from Forest Service timber policy is not limited to the local regional economies which are presumably of primary concern. Sixty-one percent of the capital int he lumber manufacturing sector of Colorado was found to be owned by outside interests. It was also found that at least ten percent of the harvesting in the state is carried out with non-local capital. When these results are combined with the finding that approximately twenty-four percent of the benefits or value-added by the lumber and wood products sector are allocated to capital it is seen that fifteen percent of the value-added in lumber manufacture and around two and one half percent of the value-added in harvesting are distributed to non-local individuals whose welfare is probably not a concern of decision makers...|$|E
40|$|Small {{states that}} lack {{capacity}} {{and act on}} their own may fall victim to international and domestic terrorism, transnational organized crime or criminal gangs. The critical {{issue is not whether}} small Caribbean states should cooperate in meeting security challenges, but it is rather in what manner, and by which mechanisms can they overcome obstacles in the way of cooperation. The remit of the Regional Security System (RSS) has expanded dramatically, but its capabilities have improved very slowly. The member governments of the RSS are reluctant to develop military capacity beyond current levels since they see economic and social development and disaster relief as priorities, requiring little investment in military hardware. The RSS depends on international donors such as the USA, Canada, Great Britain, and increasingly China to fund training programs, maintain equipment and acquire material. In the view of most analysts, an expanded regional arrangement based on an RSS nucleus is not likely in the foreseeable future. Regional political consensus remains elusive and the predominance of national interests over regional considerations continues to serve as an obstacle to any CARICOM wide regional defense mechanism. Countries in the Caribbean, including the members of the RSS, have to become more responsible for their own security from their own resources. While larger CARICOM economies can do this, {{it would be difficult for}} most OECS members of the RSS to do the same. The CARICOM region including the RSS member countries, have undertaken direct regional initiatives in security collaboration. Implementation of the recommendations of the Regional Task Force on Crime and Security (RTFCS) and the structure and mechanisms created for the staging of the Cricket World Cup (CWC 2007) resulted in unprecedented levels of cooperation and permanent legacy institutions for the regional security toolbox. The most important tier of security relationships for the region is the United States and particularly USSOUTHCOM. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative [CBSI] in which the countries of the RSS participate is a useful U. S. sponsored tool to strengthen the capabilities of the Caribbean countries and promote <b>regional</b> <b>ownership</b> of security initiatives. Future developments under discussion by policy makers in the Caribbean security environment include the granting of law enforcement authority to the military, the formation of a single OECS Police Force, and the creation of a single judicial and law enforcement space. The RSS must continue to work with its CARICOM partners, as well as with the traditional “Atlantic Powers” particularly Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom to implement a general framework for regional security collaboration. Regional security cooperation should embrace wider traditional and non-traditional elements of security appropriate to the 21 st century. Security cooperation must utilize to the maximum the best available institutions, mechanisms, techniques and procedures already available in the region. The objective should not be the creation of new agencies but rather the generation of new resources to take effective operations to higher cumulative levels. Security and non-security tools should be combined for both strategic and operational purposes. Regional, hemispheric, and global implications of tactical and operational actions must be understood and appreciated by the forces of the RSS member states. The structure and mechanisms, created for the staging of Cricket World Cup 2007 should remain as legacy institutions and a toolbox for improving regional security cooperation in the Caribbean. RSS collaboration should build on the process of operational level synergies with traditional military partners. In this context, the United States must be a true partner with shared interests, and with the ability to work unobtrusively in a nationalistic environment. Withdrawal of U. S. support for the RSS is not an option...|$|E
40|$|This {{evaluation}} of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores focuses on the success in accomplishing ecological, economic and social sustainability in population management {{during the period from}} 2007 to 2012, through objectives and actions in the implemented population management plans. The conclusions drawn in the evaluation are based on a logical framework which must in practice be seen as the logic behind the policy on large carnivores and associated development actions. Based on this framework, the evaluation highlighted the appropriateness, performance, efficiency and impact of the applied policy on large carnivores as well as the problems and threats of the current policy. The evaluation was performed for each species by examining the success of population management from the perspectives of ecological, economic and social sustainability. The investigation and consideration of conflicting objectives between various actors, with the view that the population management of large carnivores can be sustainably maintained, {{played a key role in}} the evaluation and, particularly, in the development proposals made. The investigation and consideration of the conflicts involved in the population management of large carnivores was in the focus of risk analysis group closely connected to the evaluation. The composition of this group varied by large carnivore species and the group deliberated over existing or potential future conflicts in the current policy on large carnivores as well as solutions for them. WOLVERINE As there is no valid population management plan in place for the wolverine, it was not possible to evaluate the success of measures taken in relation to the objectives set for them in the population management plan. However, where wolverines are concerned, a comparison was made in relation to the consultation with regional and national stakeholders that preceded the initial drafting of the population management plan. Existing research data and conflict points identified in the evaluation risk analysis also served as a point of reference. There is a long way to go towards achieving ecological, economic and social sustainability in the population management of wolverines. According to a minimum population estimate, growth in the wolverine population has been extremely moderate, and the wolverine population has been divided into two subpopulations: wolverines with habitats in the northern fells and those in the eastern forests. Specifying the size of the wolverine population is extremely challenging, and very little data has been gathered on the eastern forest wolverine. Roughly half of the wolverine population is found in the reindeer husbandry are, where it poses a great deal of economic problems. Indeed, the wolverine is the leading cause of damage to reindeer stock. Wolverine have been subjected to illegal killing and, without a population management plan or a special decree issued by the Ministry, it has not been possible to manage the wolverine population by means of a derogation procedure. There has been very little wolverine research conducted during the review period, with the primary focus being on damages to reindeer stock caused by wolverine. The lack and one-sidedness of information on wolverines have failed to meet the perceived needs of stakeholders. During the review period, damages caused by wolverine to livestock other than reindeer have been extremely minimal, primarily involving a few incidents of damage to sheep stock. On the whole, conflicts outside the reindeer husbandry area are rare, even though a nascent conflict between the wild forest reindeer and wolverines has been identified in the forest reindeer region. The biggest challenge facing wolverine population management is to put reindeer herders earning their livelihoods in regions of Fell Lapland with wolverine aggregations at the forefront of objectives and actions, thus committing them to the management of the wolverine population through rights and responsibilities. There should be a wide range of measures available, comprehensive and reliable methods for determining the population, an incentive-based damage compensation system, transplantations, derogations which are at least based on damages incurred but preferably also on population management, and other necessary financial incentives. LYNX The ecological strategic goal of lynx population management, i. e. the ecological sustainability of the lynx population, has been achieved through the application of existing population management measures. Within the reindeer husbandry area, the lynx population has shown a moderate proliferation and, in other areas of Finland, new habitats have formed together with strong, established lynx populations. At the same time, it has also been found that the ecological carrying capacity has not yet been reached. Growth in the lynx population has given rise to the use of special permits for population management, which have been allocated to achieve a more balanced distribution of regional lynx densities as well as to strengthen the economic and social sustainability of population management. Indeed, high lynx densities are precisely what cause conflicts from an economic and social sustainability standpoint. Damages to reindeer, sheep and hunting dogs as well as game taxation are substantial from an economic perspective. They also put a strain the ability of persons earning a livelihood and hunting to tolerate the presence of lynx. In the reindeer husbandry area, derogations for damages are granted for the specific purpose of preventing substantial economic damages. For many years, the touchstone of social sustainability in lynx population management has been the unreliability of the minimum population estimate for lynx. There have been challenges in determining the lynx population and an effort has been and is still being made in meeting these challenges in research and game management by developing a census method, investing in separate counts, and scaling population management derogations in order to cull regional population growth. Undoing the deep mistrust that has formed between this research and game management as well as the ‘field’ is a special challenge where all large carnivores are concerned. Unreliable lynx population estimates are also reflected in the questioning of the reliability of other large carnivore populations. A challenge in lynx population management is responding quickly to regional lynx problems. It is of the utmost importance to take the sense of insecurity and fear felt about the lynx into consideration, thus avoiding the risk of the lynx falling into disrepute as a pest. Instead, the status of the lynx as a valuable game animal should be promoted and preserved. The cornerstone of this approach is quota hunting. In recent years, population management derogations have served as an excellent tool for achieving economically and socially acceptable population management. BEAR The ecological sustainability of bear population management has been achieved by allowing the size of the bear population to grow within the dispersal zone in central parts of Finland and developing a population region in western parts of the country. Conversely, population management derogations have been used to address population growth in the reindeer husbandry area and the established population region in Eastern Finland. Finding a balance has been a challenge and, particularly in the dispersal zone, bear densities have been created. A local bear presence is revealed by the damage caused by bears. Bears are the biggest cause of damage to sheep stock and, of all the large carnivores, they are the only ones that cause damage to honeybees and crops. In order to improve the economic sustainability of bear population management, electrified fencing, among other things, has been erected to protect property. From a social sustainability standpoint, bears pose a challenge due to their large size and the sense of fear and insecurity this brings with it. The development of new surveying methods and, particularly, the SRVA (“official assistance in large game matters”) founded during the review period to provide official assistance in large game matters have contributed to the expulsion and killing of bears, especially those attempting to enter populated areas. Where bears are concerned, humans have a completely different concept of property than with other large carnivores. Bears are a major form of prey, and bear hunting has centuries-old traditions. Even today, bear hunting is based on derogations for population management, with derogations for damages being granted in very few cases. Bear hunting is also a team effort, with the use of hunting dogs adding a special nuance to the hunting experience. Regional and local bear ownership is evident in situations where there has been no desire to use all possible derogations for population management in a region with an established population. Responsibility is assumed for growth in the bear population, thus engendering a sense of <b>regional</b> <b>ownership.</b> Furthermore, suspected cases involving the illegal killing of bears are reported to the police with far greater frequency than the suspected illegal killing of other large carnivores. This might be an indication of the fact that the illegal killing of bear falls clearly outside the boundaries of what is considered the common good and there is no support for such activities. The challenge facing bear population management is to keep ecological, economic and social acceptance in balance, so that all these factors can be realised from a regional standpoint. This requires greater trust between research and game management as well as the ‘field’. However, there is positive development where bears are concerned, which is expected to continue into the future with the current array of actions in place. WOLF An unprecedented collapse in the ecological sustainability of the wolf population has been found. After the population management plan entered into effect, the wolf population for the entire country reached its peak in 2007, but has declined since then. The largest single collapse in the wolf population occurred in 2010, and the lowest population level was recorded in 2013, with a minimum population estimate of 120 individuals. This collapse in the wolf population has led to a situation whereby no derogations for population management have been granted for wolves – instead, all population management has been carried out through derogations for damages. The criteria for granting the derogations in question have been found to be challenging, with the capacity utilisation of granted derogations remaining low. Regulations on the killing of large carnivores provided for under the Police Act are applied in situations where human safety is threatened. This in itself has led to a situation where the value of wolves as prey animals has been taken away and the species is seen almost exclusively as a pest with which it is difficult to occupy the same area. In addition to ecological sustainability, the social sustainability of the wolf population has also collapsed. Local residents feel that they have no influence over managing their livelihoods or daily routines. The presence of wolves instils a sense of fear and insecurity. Wolves are the biggest cause of damages to hunting dogs, thus making hunting more difficult throughout Finland. This is seen as a problem of social acceptability. There is a deep mistrust between the field and research and game management. These differences have made the monitoring of the wolf population more difficult, also due to a failure to report follow-up observations and difficulty in tagging. The withholding of information on wolf observations also calls into question the minimum wolf population estimates. Questioning the position and knowledge of this research has created a situation in society where there is debate over who owns the correct information on wolves. Where wolf population management is concerned, there is great pressure to take active measures and make immediate adjustments. The biggest challenge facing future wolf population management is placing the rights and responsibilities of people living within wolf territories at the forefront of objectives and actions, committing them to the regional management of the wolf population through these objectives and actions. This requires complete transparency in all population management measures, from objectives to action. There should also be a wide range of measures in place, including comprehensive and reliable population management methods, population management derogations and substantial economic incentives. IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON LARGE CARNIVORES The objectives for the population management of large carnivores are set in accordance with the terms for achieving favourable conservation status, as stated in the Habitats Directive. This regulatory standard based on ecological sustainability sets the conditions for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, within which the objectives of the Finnish national policy on large carnivores together with actions taken are applied. Consequently, large carnivore management has been imposed in a top-down manner and has inevitably been lacking in terms of place-based policy. Ecological sustainability has not been based on a population-level approach, which would allow for a wider range of management measures to be taken. Local and regional views concerning the objectives and actions of the national policy on large carnivores have not influenced decision-making as desired. The multilateral conflict that arises around large carnivores is manifested in tensions between local communities, central government, rural and urban areas, laymen and researchers. The denial of national population management objectives and, on the other hand, increasing the level of mistrust between the field and the authorities and the field and researchers have made systematic population control impossible where wolves are concerned. A similar trend seems to be evolving with regard to the wolverine. The large carnivore actions taken have been called into question by citizens. People do not support large carnivore policy actions carried out by actors they do not trust. This can be seen in a lack of trust in the methods used in determining a population based on large carnivore observations and the process for granting derogations, compensations for damage and the adoption of preventive measures. Not only is the large carnivore data produced not trusted, it is also widely felt that local and regional views on the objectives of large carnivore population management are not reaching decision-makers. At worst, this mistrust culminates in the illegal killing of large carnivores, which is supported by a broad front. Using public law control measures, it is possible to more effectively discover illegal killing incidents and their perpetrators as well as impose harsher sentences on them. However, it is of the utmost importance to understand that the application of these enhanced measures will not influence the level of public support, which feels that illegal killing is justified. If the needs of people living in large carnivore regions are not met by public administration, they will be met by illegal actions taken in the field. The current array of actions will not achieve the set performance objectives or the large carnivore policy impact objectives unless the objectives behind these actions are changed. This change in objectives is seen as a way of gaining public approval and support for large carnivore policy measures. INTERDEPENDENCY OF ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS In large carnivore policy measures, equal consideration should be given to ecological, economic and social factors both in objectives and actions, stating the interdependency of these three perspectives. Large carnivore policy risks identified in risk analysis groups, which were used in support of this evaluation, showed a clear interdependency between the actions and processes that aim to achieve ecological, economic or social sustainability. The majority of the risks could be categorised as social risks, in addition to which some ecological and economic risks were found to have originated from a social risk phenomenon or, alternatively, could have posed social risks if the situation had remained unchanged. This demonstrates the clear social nature of the risks inherent in the current large carnivore policy, nearly half of which were considered probable and serious. The existing policy risks and problems highlighted in the evaluation have been set as objectives for the future large carnivore policy. When defining this future policy, the objective of ecological sustainability should not undermine the objective of social sustainability but should, instead, take into account the issue raised in this evaluation. According to this, exceeding the limits of social tolerance will lead to the failure of systematic population management based on an ecological objective. DEVELOPING THE OWNERSHIP OF LARGE CARNIVORES The current conservative, top-down approach to decision-making must be phased out. National, regional and local objectives and actions should be synchronised with one another. The primary goal of managing large carnivore populations must be to develop the psychological ownership of large carnivores, particularly at the local and regional level, but also at the national level. The psychological ownership of large carnivores is more effectively developed in situations where ownership involves a sense of community and responsibility. In developing psychological ownership, a sense of ownership is created through practical measures involving rights and responsibilities, thus affecting attitudes. As a natural resource, large carnivores should be considered property whose management carries with it both rights and responsibilities. Concrete responsibilities must be required and rights should be given regionally and locally, taking into account the differences specific to each species. All actions taken should be entirely transparent. Developing ownership requires trust through all structures and between actors. PLACE-BASED AND PROBLEM-BASED POPULATION MANAGEMENT When giving consideration to regional population management, regional diversity must be recognised and regional factors and needs must be taken into account. Conflicts involving large carnivores are local and depend not only on the presence of carnivores, but also on other game resources, livelihoods and infrastructure as well as cultural capital and traditions. Large carnivore policy actions should be targeted precisely, directly and quickly at local needs. Regional cooperation forums with the ability to respond quickly, along with regional or territorial population management plans, are considered key factors for problem-based solutions to large carnivore conflicts. Regional actions should stem from local needs and activate and involve local and/or regional stakeholders, depending on the species of large carnivore and the reason for the conflict. It is possible to integrate public funding and joint stakeholder volunteer work in population management actions...|$|E

Prior to the 2000 s, this market was characterised by two key features-high firm-level concentration on both the producer and consumer sides, and price determination through annually negotiated benchmark pricing between Australian mining and Japanese steel firms. However, owing to rapid growth in the Chinese steel industry and its emergence as the region's principal iron ore consumer, the Asia-Pacific iron ore market has been dramatically restructured during the last decade. This process has been accelerated since 2005 by Chinese governmental resource security policies, which have sought to address current record high iron ore prices through the use of foreign investment to sponsor new market entrants and the formation of an import cartel amongst the Chinese steel firms. This paper evaluates how these policies have driven restructuring in the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, through an analysis of the growth of China's steel industry, Chinese resource security policies aimed at lowering iron ore import costs, and their effects upon the <b>regional</b> market's <b>ownership</b> structure and price determination mechanisms. It argues that while Chinese investment and cartelisation policies have catalysed significant changes to the ownership and pricing structures of the Asia-Pacific iron ore market, they have carried only mixed benefits for the Chinese steel industry's resource security...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{provide a}} state profile of {{information}} technology (IT) sophistication in Missouri nursing homes. Method: Primary survey {{data were collected from}} December 2006 to August 2007. A descriptive, exploratory cross-sectional design was used to investigate dimensions of IT sophistication (technological, functional, and integration) related to resident care, clinical support, and administrative processes. Each dimension was used to describe the clinical domains and demographics (<b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> location, and bed size). Results: The final sample included 185 nursing homes. A wide range of IT sophistication is being used in administrative and resident care management processes, but very little in clinical support activities. Conclusion: Evidence suggests nursing homes in Missouri are expanding use of IT beyond traditional administrative and billing applications to patient care and clinical applications. This trend is important to provide support for capabilities which have been implemented to achieve national initiatives for meaningful use of IT in health care settings...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} financial integration and output volatility at micro and macro levels. Using a very large firm-level dataset (AMADEUS) from 16 European countries, we construct a measure of "deep" financial integration at the regional level based on observations of foreign ownership at the firm-level. We find a significant positive effect of foreign ownership on the volatility of firms' outcomes in static as well as dynamic empirical frameworks. This effect survives aggregation and carries over to regional output, leading to a positive association between deep financial integration and aggregate fluctuations. To identify the causal effect of financial integration on volatility we exploit variation in the transposition dates of the European Union-wide legislative acts from the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). We find that high trust regions located in countries who harmonized their capital markets sooner have increased levels of financial integration and volatility. firm volatility, foreign <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> integration, social capital, macro volatility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} why neither Maine, USA’s comparatively laissez faire economic {{and land use}} institutions, nor Dalarna, Sweden’s more heavily regulated economy, seems well designed to make tourism a powerful economic development engine. The paper focuses on three clusters of institutions that have {{a major influence on}} tourism’s scale,economic structure,and long-term sustainability. Labour laws and labour market institutions are important determinants of tourism employment, job quality, product mix, production methods, and <b>regional</b> competitiveness. Land <b>ownership</b> and property rights influence both the incentives facing landowners, tourists, and tourism busi-nesses and stresses on ecosystem carrying capacity. Commodity taxes affect the abso-lute and relative prices of various tourist servicesand, via feedback effects on demand, influence tourism’s aggregate scale, activity mix and transportation/location patterns. The paper employs institutional contrasts between Dalarna and Maine to frame hypotheses that will guide a larger comparative study of sustainable tourism in forest regions. Perhaps most controversially, we hypothesise that Sweden’s venerable right of common access (allemansrätten), as currently implemented, impedes sustainabl...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{examines the}} relevance of the perceived notions of localised production linkages, knowledge spillover and external technology transfer to the experiences of the growth of the ICT industry in China. The research is based on a major firm-level survey conducted in China’s three most important mega urban regions—Beijing, Shanghai-Suzhou and Shenzhen-Dongguan—where the bulk of the Chinese ICT industry is located. The results of the survey showed a distinct landscape of ICT industrial production in which each of the Chinese regions has functioned as the site of capital investment from different sources for different strategic interests. Despite a marked <b>regional</b> variation in <b>ownership,</b> industrial structure, market orientation and technological investment, firms in all regions have invariably reported internal development as the main source of core technology. A negative relationship existed between the level of technological innovation and external orientation in both capital investment and export production. No evidence has been found to verify the hypothesis that a higher level of technological innovation would co-exist wit...|$|R

She first flew in 1926 while serving in the United States Navy Nurse Corps. She became a licensed pilot in 1928, and quit her job as a nurse in 1935 to open the New Orleans Air College. She later instructed USAAF and U.S. Navy pilots at Meacham Field during World War II before marrying Mr. Whyte in 1946 and operating Aero Enterprise Flight School with him. Mrs. Whyte won 127 trophies in cross-country air racing, aerobatic competition and other flight contests, served as President of the Ninety-Nines, and was the first female inductee to the Order of Daedalians. After losing her pilot's license following an in-flight heart attack in a Cessna 150 she was piloting on December 12, 1988, Ms. Whyte sold the runway and taxiways at Northwest <b>Regional,</b> but retained <b>ownership</b> of most remaining airport facilities.

Using two main empirical approaches, Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis, the paper finds that foreign banks are not necessarily more efficient than their domestic counterparts. If anything, the regional banks that were acquired by global banks {{in a wave of}} acquisitions during 2005 - 07 can keep up with the local institutions. The efficiency of these acquired banks, however, is shown to have dropped during the acquisition year, recovering only slightly thereafter. Finally, it is important to account for the environment in which banks operate, as country-, sector- and firm-specific characteristics are found to have a considerable influence on bank efficiency.

40|$|We modeled future {{development}} in rapidly urbanizing El Dorado County, California, to assess ecological impacts of expanding urbanization {{and effectiveness of}} standard policy mitigation efforts. Using raster land cover data and county parcel data, we constructed a footprint of current development and simulated {{future development}} using a modified stochastic flood-fill algorithm. We modeled combinations of constraints from the 1996 County General Plan and parcel data—slope, stream buffers, oak canopy retention, existing development, public <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> clustering, and acquisition programs—and overlaid development outcomes onto the land cover data. We then calculated metrics of habitat loss and fragmentation for natural land cover types. Rural residential development erodes habitat quality much more than habitat extent. Policy alternatives ranging from existing prescriptions to very restrictive regulations had marginal impact on mitigating habitat loss and fragmentation. Historic land parcelization limits mitigation of impacts by the current General Plan prescriptions that only apply when a parcel requires subdivision before development. County-wide ordinances were somewhat more effective in preserving habitat and connectivity. These solutions may not offer enough extra protection of natural resources to justify the expenditures of “political capital ” required for implementation. Custom, parcel based acquisition scenarios minimized habitat loss and maximized connectivity. Better analysis of public policy and planning design {{may be a more}} effective “smart growth ” tool than generic policy prescriptions...|$|R
40|$|Xing Zhang, Tatsuo Oyama National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Japan&# 39;s {{health care}} system is {{considered}} one of the best {{health care system}}s in the world. Hospitals are one of the most important health care resources in Japan. As such, we investigate Japanese hospitals from various viewpoints, including their roles, <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> distribution, and characteristics with respect to the number of beds, staff, doctors, and financial performance. Applying a multivariate analysis and regression model techniques, we show the functional differences between urban populated prefectures and remote ones; the equality gap among all prefectures with respect to the distribution of the number of beds, staff, and doctors; and managerial differences between private and public hospitals. We also review and evaluate the local public hospital reform executed in 2007 from various financial aspects related to the expenditure and revenue structure by comparing public and private hospitals. We show that the 2007 reform contributed to improving the financial situation of local public hospitals. Strategic differences between public and private hospitals with respect to their management and strategy to improve their financial situation are also quantitatively analyzed in detail. Finally, the remaining problems and the future strategy to further improve the Japanese health care system are described.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{contribution}} of structural change to aggregate manufacturing and industrial productivity in China. Using shift-share techniques, this article examines three types of structural change: changes in the sectoral structure of production, changes in the ownership structure, {{and changes in the}} regional structure of production. Overall productivity growth was slow in the 1980 s, but accelerated dramatically from 1990 onwards. In 1980 s, we found evidence of a structural change bonus, with sectoral shifts contributing 24 % to overall productivity growth. However, when productivity growth accelerated in the 1990 s, the contribution of the shift effect dropped to a mere 3. 3 %. In contrast to sectoral changes, changes in the ownership structure in the early 1980 s contributed negatively to overall productivity growth. The contributions of ownership change turned positive after 1985, reaching 23 % of productivity growth in the period 1992 – 1997. Shifts in ownership explain a substantial part of productivity growth during the productivity boom. Like shifts in <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> shifts initially contributed negatively to productivity growth till 1992, and positively thereafter. However, the general contribution of regional shifts is lower than the contributions of sectoral and ownership shifts. Contrary to initial expectations, the regional analysis of productivity trends does not indicate regional divergence. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{formulations}} linking {{road traffic}} fatalities to vehicle <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> population, {{and economic growth}} continue to be developed {{against the backdrop of}} Smeed and Andreassen models. Though a few attempts were made, Smeed's law has not been fully tested in India. Using the 1991 – 2009 panel data from all states, this work (a) developed the generalized Smeed and Andreassen models; (b) evaluated if traffic fatalities were impacted by structural changes; and (c) examined if – in relation to the generalized model – the individual (time and regional) models are more relevant for application. Seven models (Smeed: original, generalized, time-variant, state-variant; and Andreassen: generalized, time-variant, state-variant) were developed and tested for fit with the actual data. Results showed that the per vehicle fatality rate closely resembled Smeed's formulation. Chow-test yielded a significant F-stat, suggesting that the models for four pre-defined time-blocks are structurally different from the 19 -year generalized model. The counterclockwise rotation of the log-linear form also suggested lower fatality rates. While the new government policies, reduced vehicle operating speeds, better healthcare, and improved vehicle technology could be the factors, further research is required to understand the reasons for fatality rate reductions. The intercept and gradients of the time-series models showed high stability and varied only slightly in comparison to the 19 -year generalized models, thus suggesting that the latter are pragmatic for application. Regional formulations, however, indicate that they may be more relevant for studying trends and tendencies. This research illustrates the robustness of Smeed's law, and provides evidence for time-invariance but state-specificity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Forests of the United States and Russia {{can play}} a {{positive}} role in reducing the extent of global warming caused by greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. To {{determine the extent of}} carbon sequestration, physical, ecological, economic, and social issues need to be considered, including different forest management objectives across major forest ownership groups. Private timberlands in the U. S. Pacific Northwest are relatively young, well stocked, and sequestering carbon at relatively high rates. Forests in northwestern Russia are generally less productive than those in the Northwestern U. S. but cover extensive areas. A large increase in carbon storage per hectare in live tree biomass is projected on National Forest timberlands in the U. S. Pacific Northwest for all selected scenarios, with an increase of between 157 - 175 Mg by 2050 and a near doubling of 1970 s levels. On private timberlands in the Pacific Northwest, average carbon in live tree biomass per hectare has been declining historically but began to level off near 65 Mg in 2000; projected levels by 2050 are roughly what they were in 1970 at approximately 80 Mg. In the St. Petersburg region, average carbon stores were similar to those on private lands in the Pacific Northwest: 57 Mg per hectare in 2000 and ranging from 40 to 64 Mg by 2050. Although the projected futures reflect a broad range of policy options, larger differences in projected carbon stores result from the starting conditions determined by <b>ownership,</b> <b>regional</b> environmental conditions, and past changes in forest management. However, an important change of forest management objective, such as the end of all timber harvest on National Forests in the Pacific Northwest or complete elimination of mature timber in the St. Petersburg region, can lead to substantial change in carbon stores over the next 50 years. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{somewhat}} neglected {{topic of}} attitudes to mining, as {{an influence on}} labour supply in the coal industry, {{is the subject of}} this thesis. By the 1940 s antagonism to mining was a nationwide phenomenon, although the regional experiences of miners and their families varied considerably between the wars. The study therefore starts at regional level before moving on to consider from a broader perspective the topic of changing attitudes to pit work. The first part of the thesis comprises a comparative study of the Somerset and Lothian (Mid and East Lothian) coalfields, two districts which have attracted little attention from historians. An overview of the industry in both areas is given in the opening chapter, where the <b>regional</b> characteristics of <b>ownership</b> and management are also discussed. The following three chapters focus respectively on change and continuity in the work place; life in the mining communities; the relationship between the miners' unions and the wider labour movement. The perspective shifts to national level in chapter five but the theme of regional influence on attitudes to pit work is carried forward by extensive reference to a Social Survey inquiry carried out in Scottish mining communities (including those of Mid and East Lothian) in 1946. Finally, the impact of the Second World War and of nationalisation are considered, before a survey and commentary on general attitudes to mining and miners over time. The conclusion reached is that post-nationalisation labour-supply problems had their origins in the decades before the Second World War. As the social and psychological isolation of the mining communities broke down over the inter-war period, circumstances within the industry and wider socio-economic change combined to erode the tradition of occupational inheritance and to promote the growth of negative or hostile attitudes to mining as an occupation. ...|$|R
