A consensus was reached by residents to not use the color red in the new flag, as it is used by the University of Utah, a rival to Provo's Brigham Young University.|$|E
5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively high current of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector. While it can be charged by an older USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500milliamps (0.5amps). As a result, if the iPad is in use while powered by a computer, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery <b>replacement</b> <b>process,</b> user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{mineralogy}} of triphylite {{and associated}} phosphates {{was investigated in}} the Nanping No. 31 pegmatite, southeastern China. Two types of triphylite were distinguished, based on their petrological features and chemical compositions. Triphylite-I occurs as small granular aggregates in fine grained white mica from zones III and IV, whereas triphylite-II occurs as veinlets or aggregates in the fractures and/or on the rims of primary montebrasite from zone IV. Various hydrothermal transformations were observed in both types of triphylite. Triphylite-I successively transformed to lazulite, wagnerite, fluorarrojadite-(BaNa) and fluorapatite, suggesting successive <b>replacement</b> <b>processes</b> during Mg-rich, Na-rich, and Ca-rich hydrothermal stages. Triphylite-II is mainly replaced by fluorapatite, anapaite, and ludlamite; these <b>replacement</b> <b>processes</b> result from cationic exchanges in combination with hydration, due {{to the presence of}} Ca-bearing fluids...|$|R

There are also fees charged on airline tickets sold, including passenger facility charges and federal taxes. Once the funding is nailed down, the Airport Authority will bid for the project. The replacement terminal is expected to encompass 355,000 square feet and the same number of gates (14). Also, air travelers will see more restrooms, additional restaurant and concession space, improved security screening areas and other enhanced passenger amenities.|$|E

25|$|Although {{not every}} claw-free graph is perfect, claw-free graphs satisfy another property, related to perfection. A graph is called {{domination}} perfect {{if it has}} a minimum dominating set that is independent, and if the same property holds in all of its induced subgraphs. Claw-free graphs have this property. To see this, let D be a dominating set in a claw-free graph, and suppose that v and w are two adjacent vertices in D; then the set of vertices dominated by v but not by w must be a clique (else v would be the center of a claw). If every vertex in this clique is already dominated by at least one other member of D, then v can be removed producing a smaller independent dominating set, and otherwise v can be replaced by one of the undominated vertices in its clique producing a dominating set with fewer adjacencies. By repeating this <b>replacement</b> <b>process</b> one eventually reaches a dominating set no larger than D, so in particular when the starting set D is a minimum dominating set this process forms an equally small independent dominating set.|$|E

[...] The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as [...] "roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an [...] "obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper.
