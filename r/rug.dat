5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven <b>rug</b> from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of <b>rug</b> such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of warp threads, leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
50|$|Oriental <b>rugs</b> can be {{classified}} by their region of origin, each of which represents different strands of tradition: Persian <b>rugs,</b> Pakistani <b>rugs,</b> Arabian <b>rugs,</b> Anatolian <b>rugs,</b> Kurdish <b>rugs,</b> Caucasian <b>rugs,</b> Central Asian <b>rugs,</b> Turkestanian (Turkmen, Turkoman) <b>rugs,</b> Chinese <b>rugs,</b> Tibetan <b>rugs</b> and Indian <b>rugs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arak <b>rugs,</b> {{otherwise}} known as Arak carpets, {{are made in the}} province of Arak, Iran. Technically, all <b>rugs</b> from Arak can be considered Arak <b>rugs</b> but those termed Sarouk are marked as of the best quality, while the more general term Arak is used for <b>rugs</b> of lesser quality. Meshkabad used to be the term for the worst quality <b>rugs,</b> but such <b>rugs</b> are now called mahal or Arak. Araks are much more coarsely knotted than the <b>rugs</b> of than Sarouk <b>rugs.</b> Their designs are quite similar, although rather more crudely executed, and often display bold floral medallions set against open fields.|$|R
50|$|In {{the study}} and erudition of oriental <b>rugs,</b> he will be best remembered for his books, Oriental <b>Rugs</b> and the Stories They Tell, and Armenian <b>Rugs</b> of the Gregorian Collection, done in {{collaboration}} with his daughter, Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire and his grandson, Douglas Christian. In Oriental <b>Rugs</b> and the Stories They Tell, he divided <b>rugs</b> into three major categories: tribal, village, and city <b>rugs.</b> He observed that {{it is often difficult}} for a novice to distinguish between a Sarouk, Isfahan or a Tabriz, but it is not difficult for the novice to distinguish between the innate characteristics of a village woven Bidjar and an intricate and highly stylized city woven Qum. Oriental <b>Rugs</b> and the Stories They Tell was a breakthrough in the study of <b>rugs,</b> because it made the study of <b>rugs</b> clear and accessible.|$|R
5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a <b>rug.</b> The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental <b>rug,</b> a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E

5|$|The {{meanings}} {{expressed in}} kilims derive {{both from the}} individual motifs used, and by their pattern and arrangement in the <b>rug</b> as a whole.

50|$|Kurdish weaving {{is renowned}} {{throughout}} the world, with fine specimens of both <b>rugs</b> and bags.

Exhibiting a wide variety, the Bijar <b>rugs</b> have patterns ranging from floral designs, medallions and animals to other ornaments. They generally have two wefts, and are very colorful in design. With an increased interest in these <b>rugs</b> in the last century, and a lesser need for them to be as sturdy as they were, new Bijar <b>rugs</b> are more refined and delicate in design.|$|R

5|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry {{is an important}} employer, mostly in the textile industry. One of its tradicional and high-end products are the Tapetes Beiriz, an handmade <b>rug</b> produced since 1918, which currently also produces contemporary rugs. The clothing industry balanced back from European Union's expansion to Eastern Europe and Globalization, by shifting to luxury clothing for high fashion brands or reinventing uniforms, with specific needs or complexity, {{as seen in the}} case of Damel.

Douglas Fairbanks mocked the phoniness of many pre-Code documentaries in his parody Around the World in 80 Minutes with Douglas Fairbanks, in one scene of which he filmed himself wrestling a stuffed tiger doll, then a tiger-skin <b>rug.</b> Opposing these films was the travelogue which was shown before features {{and served as a}} short saccharine form of cinematic tourism.|$|E
