Unlike the SBI test, no trends in test performance and specimen density have been found for wood floorings. (Ostman and Mikkola 2006) attributed this to the different influences on flame spread of the gases released {{as a result of the}} lower heat flux used in the <b>Radiant</b> <b>panel</b> <b>test.</b> The effect of this on flame spread will differ between wood species depending on e.g. the wood permeability.

Six rigid 16 -in-diam fiberglass-reinforced plastic ducts from five manufacturers were examined using laboratory-scale, large-scale, and full-scale fire tests. The laboratory-scale tests included the American Society for Testing and Materials E 162 <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> <b>test,</b> the E 2863 oxygen index test, and the standardized small-scale flammability test (S 3 FT) {{developed by the}} Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), U.

Ten-foot lengths of the same ducts were also subjected to a large-scale vertical fire test, and 20 -to 30 -ft lengths were tested in a full-scale in-mine fire test at the Bureau's Lake Lynn Laboratory mine. The data from the laboratory-scale <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> <b>test</b> and oxygen index test indicated that the ducts were fire-resistant, However, {{five of the six}} ducts failed the S 3 FT and vertical fire tests, and four of the ducts failed the full-scale in-mine tests with flame propagation rates that ranged from 3 to 10 ft/min. The results indicate the need for improved fire-resistant plastic ducts. The good agreement between the S 3 FT re-sults and the vertical and full-scale tests show that the S 3 FT provides a good indication of the flammability of fiberglass-reinforced plastic ducting under realistic fire conditions...|$|E

The different fire models employed in the two tests could be responsible for this discrepancy. As the former test has been validated by large-scale evalua-tions the use of ISO 5657 for the assessment of the burning behaviour of carpets is not to be recommended. Incorporation of the measurement of smoke emission and heat output in the NBS Flooring Radiant Panel, in addition to spread of flame, allows the assess-ment of additional flammability parameters using one, validated, fire model. All these three flammability parameters were highly significantly correlated. There was no correlation between the smoke emission results in the NBS Flooring Radiant Panel and in the NBS Smoke Density Chamber, probably because of the different fire models employed...|$|E

To accomplish this aim, considering the complexity and non-linearity of the applied mathematical models to perform the indirect measurement of the above mentioned quantity, the Monte Carlo method was applied. The use of this numerical approach allows to estimate the quality of the measurements within a high accuracy level and to evaluate deviations related with the GUM method since it provides an approximate solution for this specific metrological problem.

40|$|The thermoacoustic {{flashover}} detector is {{a device}} {{designed to be}} mounted on the helmet of a firefighter which creates a loud whistle when exposed to conditions {{that are consistent with}} flashover in order to provide firefighters with a warning and time to escape. The detector is based off a previous device designed at the University of Maryland which was operated using an electric band heater. This device was optimized by slightly altering the stack design and by the addition of approximately 0. 3 mL of water to the stack, yielding an activation temperature of 125 °C. Once the activation temperature was sufficiently lowered, the device was outfitted with copper fins which were designed to collect radiant heat from a propane-burning <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> and transfer it to the detector. When using four of these copper fins and exposed to a radiant heat flux of approximately 25 kW/m 2, the detector activated around 125 °C after 7 minutes. This was the first known activation of a thermoacoustic device to unconcentrated thermal radiation. The response time of the device was lowered after two more fins were added to the design. Once the detector was shown to work using radiant heat, it was tested at the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute (MFRI) at the University of Maryland using full scale fires in order to replicate the conditions in which it would be expected to operate. While the detector did not activate during the full scale <b>tests,</b> the <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> <b>tests</b> proved that the design is feasible and that some slight design changes are needed in order for the detector to operate in a real fire environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the U. S. and Canada have seen a steady {{increase}} in energy consumption. The U. S. in particular uses 25 % more energy than it did 20 years ago. With declining natural resources {{and an increase in}} fuel costs, it has become important to find methods of reducing energy consumption, in which energy conservation in space heating and cooling has become a widely researched area. One method that has been identified to reduce the energy required for space heating is the use of <b>radiant</b> <b>panels.</b> <b>Radiant</b> <b>panels</b> are beneficial because the temperature set points in a room can be lowered without sacrificing occupant comfort. They have therefore become very popular in the market. Further research, however, is required to optimize the performance of these panels so energy savings can be realized. An analytical model has been developed to predict the panel temperature and heat output for perimeter <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> systems with a known inlet temperature and flow rate, based on a flat plate solar collector (RSC) model. As radiative and convective heat transfer coefficients were required to run the model, an analytical analysis of the radiative heat transfer was performed, and a numerical model was developed to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient. Using the conventional radiative heat exchange method assuming a three-surface enclosure, the radiative heat transfer could be determined. Numerically, a correlation was developed to predict the natural convective heat transfer. To validate the analytical model, an experimental analysis was performed on <b>radiant</b> <b>panels.</b> A 4 m by 4 m by 3 m test chamber was constructed in which the surrounding walls and floor were maintained at a constant temperature and the heat output from an installed <b>radiant</b> <b>panel</b> was measured. Two <b>radiant</b> <b>panels</b> were tested; a 0. 61 m wide panel with 4 passes and a 0. 61 m wide panel with 8 passes. The <b>panels</b> were <b>tested</b> at 5 different inlet water temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C. The RSC model panel temperature and heat output predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results.
