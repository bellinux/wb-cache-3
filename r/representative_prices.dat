40|$|Energy {{prices have}} risen {{dramatically}} {{in the last two}} years, with changes also taking place in relative prices between energy sources. <b>Representative</b> <b>prices</b> paid for three major energy alternatives {{over the last five years}} are reported below in Table 1. Actual prices paid have also varied considerably depending upon when the fuel was purchased during the year and the supplier. The cost of natural gas (not reported here) and electricity, are complicated with total energy supply costs that depend upon both consumption and annual connect charges. Electricity rates also depend upon the frequency of interruption of service selected. The total cost for electricity for irrigation (including consumption and connect charges) averaged about 8. 8 cents per KWH in Nebraska in 2001. The rates reported in Table 1 are for anytime interruptible which is the most economical rate. The Southern Power rates reported in Table 1 are also some of the lowest in the state...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundOklahomaâ€™s tribal tobacco {{shops are}} {{distributed}} throughout the state, including in urban areas. During the time frame of this study, state excise tax rates for cigarettes varied by tribe and region, and took five distinct levels, ranging from 5. 75 cents to $ 1. 03 per pack. PurposeTo describe the pricing behavior of these smoke shops {{in a way that}} could support potential increases in the tribal taxation of cigarettes within the state. MethodsTwo waves (2010 and 2011) of site visits were conducted, covering nearly all tribal smoke shops in the northeastern quarter of the state, an area containing the city of Tulsa and 60 % of all tribal outlets. Researchers recorded <b>representative</b> <b>prices</b> and verified the tax rate paid (via tax stamp) for each shop. Data were analyzed in 2013. ResultsLower-taxed tribal cigarettes tended to be priced at discounts that were even greater than the differential in tax rates. For example, across waves, the average pack of Marlboros from a shop with a 5. 75 -cent tax stamp sold for 52 cents less than the same pack from a 25. 75 -cent shop and 60 cents less than from a 51. 5 -cent shop. The minimal inter-tribal price response to the discontinuation of large quantities of contraband cigarette sales suggests that inter-tribal price competition in the Tulsa area is not as intense as expected. ConclusionsAmple scope exists for either unilateral or coordinated cross-tribal tax and price increases that will increase tribal cigarette tax revenue collections and improve public health...|$|E

40|$|The EU is {{to revise}} {{the basis for the}} {{calculation}} of tariffs applied to cereals and rice. The existing system is based on US commercial exchange prices, but in recent years new exporters have started to sell grain at prices well below other 'world market' prices. This has led to abnormally high EU imports of cereals and rice. The new system of tariffs that the commission is proposing will be based on a more representative calculation of actual world-market prices. The new system may use fixed duties and tariff quotas, but will have to be negotiated with concerned exporters in the WTO. The Commission asserts that the EU has 'no intention to be more restrictive concerning access for cereals and rice to the EU market. ' The aim it claims is merely to 'improve the system to more accurately fulfil our WTO obligations and protect our rights'. The USA has complained about the new EU proposals, which it sees as restrictive. The Commission however sees it simply as an administrative measure designed to bring <b>representative</b> <b>prices</b> used for calculating import duties more into line with actual world-market prices. The Commission maintains that the new system will be WTO-compatible since it will be negotiated with the concerned trading partners. Comment: This EU measure follows high EU imports of cereals and demonstrates the willingness of the EU to revise its import regime whenever the implementation of the existing regime threatens the disruption of EU markets. Within the EU principles of liberalisation and open markets are always applied {{in the light of the}} practical realities.

40|$|A spreadsheet-based {{stochastic}} model {{was developed to}} track fruit numbers and fruit value for 1, 000 individual items grown in a farmer's field, sorted at a packinghouse with and without advanced inspection technology, distributed with and without repack, and sold at a retail store. The quantities generated at each step are value per unit volume in the production field and the respective price multipliers and passing fractions at the packinghouse, distribution center, and retail store. Values of these coefficients were set to reflect experience with the onion industry. It was assumed that about 30 % (with repackaging) to 40 % (without repackaging) of the fruit leaving the farmer's field would reach the consumer. The initial price per unit volume and pricing multipliers were configured to give <b>representative</b> <b>prices</b> at the production field and representative price per unit fruit at steps through the system to the consumer. The pass-through percentage was decreased an extra 10 % to 15 % with technology and up to 20 % with repack, with corresponding increases in subsequent steps to maintain the 25 % to 25 % total pass-through. Repacking and technology addition in the packinghouse tended to result in increased value at the retail level. Placing technology in the packinghouse {{did not result in}} increased value for the packinghouse. Vertical integration that included the packinghouse would be required to make it profitable to add sorting technology that increases quality by removing defective items. Both technology addition and repackaging reduce the total number of fruits reaching the consumer. The model suggests that the notion of early removal of fruits with latent damage to avoid increased distribution costs does not really benefit the consumer for the conditions modeled. Additional considerations such as food security are required for one to expect additional equipment adoption under current scenarios. Agribusiness,...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{mortgage}} prepayment and valuation models {{assume that}} two mortgage pools {{with the same}} observable characteristics should behave indistinguishably. However, even pools with apparently identical characteristics often exhibit markedly different prepayment behavior. The sources of this heterogeneity may be unobservable, but we can infer information about a pool from its prepayment behavior over time. This paper develops a methodology for using this information to calculate pool-specific mortgage-backed security prices. Knowledge of these prices is important both for portfolio valuation and for determining the cheapest pool to deliver when selling mortgage-backed securities. We find that unobservable heterogeneity between mortgage pools is statistically significant, and that pool-specific prices, calculated for a sample of outwardly identical mortgage pools between 1983 and 1989, may di#er greatly from any single <b>representative</b> <b>price...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} {{that there is no}} {{analytical}} formula for pricing arithmetic average Asian options. Hull and White (1993) proposed feasible tree-based algorithm to solve this problem, in which each node keeps an identical number of <b>representative</b> average <b>prices</b> calculated via equally-spaced placement between the range of the corresponding maximum and minimum arithmetic average prices, and the piece-wise linear interpolation method is applied to derive the corresponding continuation value of each <b>representative</b> average <b>price</b> in the backward induction phase. In this paper, the above classic algorithm is modified to minimize the interpolation error. First, the <b>representative</b> average <b>price</b> are determined by the zeros of Chebyshev polynomial to minimize the Lagrange interpolation error for each node. Second, the optimal allocation of the number of <b>representative</b> average <b>prices</b> is derived to further minimize the accumulated interpolation error for European arithmetic average options. Numerical results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model.
