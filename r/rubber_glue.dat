40|$|AbstractThe {{performances}} {{of a table}} tennis racket can be qualified with several adjectives like: fast, slow, stiff, adhesive, controllable, etc. These qualifications are subjective since they are relative to the sensory analysis made by each player. It appears that the noise produced at the ball impact on a racket has a great influence on the opinion that a player can give about a racket. Moreover, the sound emitted at the stroke can be appreciated differently among several players. Hence a good sound may give a positive a priori to the player racket appreciation. The work presented first demonstrates {{the correlation between the}} acoustic frequency spectrum and the vibration frequency spectrum of a racket following the ball impact. The analysis is first performed on the racket blades without <b>rubbers</b> <b>glued</b> on. The vibration modes that produce the sound at the ball impact were identified experimentally. It is shown that there are two essential modes responsible of the sound emitted. In second, comparisons were made between several rackets composed of different composite plywoods. Their influence on the sound emitted is shown experimentally. Indeed, depending on the wood essences of the different plies, their thickness and their fibers relative orientation the sound produced will be different. Then the influence of the <b>rubbers</b> <b>glued</b> on both blade sides is studied. The vibration modes are the same but the frequencies are lower. The sound can be qualified as sharp, long, clear, deep, hollow, and plain. Some correlations with the player appreciations are made...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{validation}} {{study of a}} quantitative retrospective exposure assessment method used in a follow-up study of workers exposed to benzene. Assessment of exposure to benzene {{was carried out in}} 672 factories in 12 cities in China. Historical exposure data were collected for 3179 unique job titles. The basic unit for exposure assessment was a factory/work unit/job title combination over seven periods between 1949 and 1987. A total of 18, 435 exposure estimates was developed, using all available historical information, including 8477 monitoring data. Overall, 38 % of the estimates were based on benzene monitoring data. The highest time-weighted average exposures were observed for the rubber industry (30. 7 ppm) and for <b>rubber</b> <b>glue</b> applicators (52. 6 ppm). Because of its recognized link with benzene exposure, the association between a clinical diagnosis of benzene poisoning and benzene exposure was evaluated to validate the assessment method that we used in the cohort study. Our confidence in the assessment method is supported by the observation of a strong positive trend between benzene poisoning and various measures, especially recent intensity of exposure to benzene.

30|$|Because {{of errors}} at the {{interface}} {{of the whole}} joint, there were gaps between the maximum joint width and the minimum joints width in different places along the joint. Epoxy resin and chloroprene <b>rubber</b> <b>glue</b> were brushed in the groove, making the groove depth less than 6  mm. According to preliminary measurements, {{the depth of the}} groove was reduced by 2  mm, and the compression strain calculated by the average value was approximately 52 %. At the same time, stress of the post-tensioning steel bars was monitored using strain gauges. The maximum stress loss of the steel bars before and after fastening the bolts was taken. As the post-tensioning steel bars were tensioned and the bolts fastened to a maximum value of 40  MPa and the minimum value of 10  MPa, the difference of displacement among the steel bars was 50 – 200  μm. Water injection by pressure pump was completed after tensioning to the presetting loading levels. Every pressure level was maintained up to 10 – 15  min. To observe whether there was leaking at the joint surface (Ministry of Housing and Urban Rural Development of People’s Republic of China 2012). During this period, the water pressure value was allowed to decrease due to permeable water absorption on the concrete surface. Waterproofing was judged to fail once water droplets exuded from the joints and the surrounding concrete surface upon repressing when water pressure was reduced. The design value of water resistance pressure of this test was 0.12  MPa. During the test, the water pressure in the interface was gradually increased to 0.06, 0.08, 0.1  MPa and the design value of 0.12  MPa. Results indicated that there were no leakages at the interface of the strip denoting waterproofing ability of the sealing rubber strip in the joint interface was qualified under the designed water resistance pressure of 0.12  MPa.|$|E
40|$|Children are {{constantly}} exposed to many chemicals via the products {{they come in}} contactwith in their everyday life. One chemical group is phthalates, the most commonly usedplasticisers in the world. Phthalates are used mainly in PVC plastic products like floors, toys,food containers and wallpaper {{but they are also}} used in <b>rubber,</b> <b>glue,</b> paint, cables etc. Sincethese chemicals are weakly chemically bound to the PVC they can leak and migrate to the air,food, water and skin. Children are exposed to phthalates mainly through food, but because ofthe hand to mouth behaviour they are also exposed via dust inhalation and dust ingestion. About ten years ago regulations of the most toxic phthalates in toys and child care productswere implemented in the EU and from February 2015 it is a general prohibition for the use ofDEHP (diethylhexyl phthalate), DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate), DiBP (diisobutyl phthalate) andBBzP (butyl benzyl phthalate). DiNP (diisononyl phthalate) is a relatively new phthalate andit has replaced DEHP to some extent in floors and toys. In phthalate free products DINCH(1, 2 -cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester) is one of the plasticizer replacingphthalates. The banned phthalates have been shown to cause adverse effects on reproductionand recent research also investigates links between phthalate exposure and asthma and allergysymptoms in children. More experimental animal studies are needed to further investigate theasthma and allergy correlation. In the present project dust samples were collected from 30 preschool indoor environments inthe Stockholm city area to evaluate the levels of the six substances mentioned and thephthalate DEP (diethyl phthalate). The main aim of this thesis project was to search forrelations and links between the phthalate concentrations in dust and parameters from theindoor environment in preschools. Studied parameters are e. g. construction year, floor type,cleaning routines and quantity of toys and furniture made of plastic or foam. The project wascommissioned by the Swedish EPA and performed at the Institute of Environmental Medicine(IMM) at Karolinska Institutet. A negative relation was found between dust phthalate (DEHP and DnBP) concentrationand construction year. Also rooms with old PVC floors had higher concentrations of DEHPand DnBP in dust than rooms with new PVC floors. There was also a trend that dust frompreschools with PVC floors had higher DiNP concentration than dust from preschools withother floor types. The preschools that used foam mattresses for resting had higher DiNPconcentrations than those with no foam mattresses. Most preschools had new foammattresses, which could indicate a more common use of DiNP in new mattresses or mattress 2 covers compared to old mattresses that contains more DEHP. The four Waldorf preschoolsthat participated had lower DiNP dust concentrations than the other preschools, which wasexpected since Waldorf orientation includes using as little plastic material as possible. Norelation was found between the phthalate dust concentrations and the quantity of toys made ofsoft plastic in the sampled area. Many preschools had made a plastic inventory where they removed old and soft plastic toysand material. Also many preschools recently replaced old foam mattresses used for resting. This could be due to the big chemical focus in the media and authorities and the brochuresthat have been sent out {{the last couple of years}} about what preschool can do to decrease thechemical exposure of children. This interest and awareness seen in the preschools waspositive and hopefully the trend spreads to more preschools. Since children spend a big part oftheir time at preschools it is an important mission for society and the government to decreasethe exposure to hazardous chemicals there. Hopefully what has been done so far is just thebeginning...|$|E
