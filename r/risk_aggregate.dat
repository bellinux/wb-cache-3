Based on both aggregate data and microeconomic data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, we find the welfare benefits of eliminating aggregate variation to be large â€“ an order of magnitude larger than those originally documented by Lucas (1987). The key difference is countercyclical variation in idiosycratic risk, which both amplifies the welfare cost of aggregate productivity shocks and imposes a cost of its own. The magnitude of these effects increases non-linearly in risk aversion. Our results, therefore, are consistent with the increasingly popular notion that distributional effects are an important aspect of understanding the welfare cost of business cycles...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} a two period general equilibrium {{model with}} individual <b>risk,</b> <b>aggregate</b> uncertainty and moral hazard. There is {{a large number of}} households, each facing two individual states of nature in the second period. These states differ solely in the household's vector of initial endowments, which is strictly larger in the first state (good state) than in the second state (bad state). In the first period each household chooses a non-observable action. Higher levels of action give higher probability of the good state of nature to occur, but lower levels of utility. Households' utilities are assumed to be separable in action and the aggregate uncertainty is independent of the individual risk. Insurance is supplied by a collection of firms who behave strategically and maximize expected profits taking into account that each household's optimal choice of action {{is a function of the}} offered contract. The paper provides sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium and shows that the appropriate versions of both welfare theorems hold.

We show that a heterogeneous-firm RBC model with quantitatively realistic countercyclically disperse innovations in the firm-level Solow residual and non-convex adjustment costs calibrated to the non-Gaussian features of the steady state investment rate distribution, produces investment dispersion that positively comoves with the cycle, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 58, compared to 0. 45 in the data.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the welfare gain from removing aggregate consumption fluctuations {{in an economy}} with idiosyncratic income shocks and incomplete consumption insurance, hence an economy where individual risk is substan-tially greater than per capita risk. In contrast to previous literature that studied the welfare cost of fluctuations in models with idiosyncratic shocks, we focus directly on consumption risk rather than income risk. We show that, because the welfare cost of consumption fluctuations is an increasing and convex function of the over-all level of risk that each individual faces, even removing {{only a small amount}} of aggregate fluctuation can lead to a large welfare gain. A number of papers have attempted to esti-mate the cost of aggregate fluctuations. The seminal paper by Robert E. Lucas, Jr. (1987) uses a representative agent economy. Lucas finds only a very small welfare improvement in removing aggregate consumption fluctuations of the size observed in US data. The welfare improvement is equivalent to about one-tenth of a percent of extra consumption at each date dur-ing the lifetime of an individual. Lucas recog-nized that because of uninsurable idiosyncratic consumption shocks, household risk is larger than per capita risk (see Lucas 1987, 29). His estimate of overall household consumption <b>risk</b> (<b>aggregate</b> plus idiosyncratic) is three times per capita risk. Removing this amount of fluctuation would give a welfare gain equal to 6. 8 percent of consumption at each date in Lucasâ€™s model. 1 But Lucas discounts this result because stabilization policies can be expected to eliminate no more 1 See Lucas (1987), Table 2 of his paper, the case with risk aversion equal to 10...|$|E

40|$|Any {{attempt to}} model an economy {{requires}} foundational {{assumptions about the}} relations between prices, values {{and the distribution of}} wealth. These assumptions exert a profound influence over the results of any model. Unfortunately, there are few areas in economics as vexed as the theory of value. I argue in this paper that the fundamental problem with past theories of value is that it is simply not possible to model the determination of value, the formation of prices and the distribution of income in a real economy with analytic mathematical models. All such attempts leave out crucial processes or make unrealistic assumptions which significantly affect the results. There have been two primary approaches to the theory of value. The first, associated with classical economists such as Ricardo and Marx were substance theories of value, which view value as a substance inherent in an object and which is conserved in exchange. For Marxists, the value of a commodity derives solely from the value of the labour power used to produce it - and therefore any profit is due to the exploitation of the workers. The labour theory of value has been discredited because of its assumption that labour was the only â€˜factorâ€™ that contributed to the creation of value, and because of its fundamentally circular argument. Neoclassical theorists argued that price was identical with value and was determined purely by the interaction of supply and demand. Value then, was completely subjective. Returns to labour (wages) and capital (profits) were determined solely by their marginal contribution to production, so that each factor received its just reward by definition. Problems with the neoclassical approach include assumptions concerning representative agents, perfect competition, perfect and costless information and contract enforcement, complete markets for credit and <b>risk,</b> <b>aggregate</b> production functions and infinite, smooth substitution between factors, distribution according to marginal products, firms always on the production possibility frontier and firmsâ€™ pricing decisions, ignoring money and credit, and perfectly rational agents with infinite computational capacity. Two critical areas include firstly, the underappreciated Sonnenschein-Mantel- Debreu results which showed that the foundational assumptions of the Walrasian general-equilibrium model imply arbitrary excess demand functions and therefore arbitrary equilibrium price sets. Secondly, in real economies, there is no equilibrium, only continuous change. Equilibrium is never reached because of constant changes in preferences and tastes; technological and organisational innovations; discoveries of new resources and new markets; inaccurate and evolving expectations of businesses, consumers, governments and speculators; changing demand for credit; the entry and exit of firms; the birth, learning, and death of citizens; changes in laws and government policies; imperfect information; generalized increasing returns to scale; random acts of impulse; weather and climate events; changes in disease patterns, and so on. The problem is not the use of mathematical modelling, but the kind of mathematical modelling used. Agent-based models (ABMs), objectoriented programming and greatly increased computer power however, are opening up a new frontier. Here a dynamic bargaining ABM is outlined as a basis for an alternative theory of value. A large but finite number of heterogeneous commodities and agents with differing degrees of market power are set in a spatial network. Returns to buyers and sellers are decided at each step in the value chain, and in each factor market, through the process of bargaining. Market power and its potential abuse against the poor and vulnerable are fundamental to how the bargaining dynamics play out. Ethics therefore lie {{at the very heart of}} economic analysis, the determination of prices and the distribution of wealth. The neoclassicals are right then that price is the enumeration of value at a particular time and place, but wrong to downplay the critical roles of bargaining, power and ethics in determining those same prices. <br /...|$|E
