40|$|Cross border {{recovery}} of maintenance and child support is a technical area, {{subject to a}} complicated regulatory framework {{which has been the}} subject to a number of recent reforms. The Maintenance <b>Regulation</b> (<b>Council</b> Regulation (EC) 4 / 2009) applies to EU member states but refers the question of applicable law to the Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the Law applicable to Maintenance Obligations which does not in apply in Denmark or the United Kingdom. This gives rise to two different procedures for recovery and enforcement within the EU. Further afield, the Hague Convention of 23 of November 2007 on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance is applied in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Norway and Ukraine and has been ratified by the EU as a regional organisation. The Convention also has two different mechanisms for recognition and enforcement – a mainstream approach and an alternative procedure. To add to the layers of procedural complexity the Hague Convention has a narrower substantive scope than the Maintenance Regulation...|$|E

Aim of my thesis is to provide systematic overview of legal rules directly applicable on recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements. The text is divided into eight main chapters, introduction and conclusion. The introduction of the thesis describes purpose of the text that is to compare particular regulations governing these questions and also defines basic terminology important for this topic. Following chapters focus on relevant regulations and have uniform structure. Opening of each chapter explains elementary characteristics of applicable regulation, reception of this regulation and its main goal. Next subchapters contain demarcation of the material competence of regulation, after that follows procedure of recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements. The chapter ends with relations to other instruments. Chapter Two concentrates on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgements pursuant to Brussels I <b>Regulation</b> (<b>Council</b> Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters) {{which is the first}} legal instrument in this area and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} trend of water-related disasters such as floods and droughts resulting from climate change, the integrated management {{of water resources}} is gaining importance recently. Korea has worked towards preventing disasters caused by floods and droughts, managing water resources efficiently through the coordinated operation of river facilities such as dams, weirs, and agricultural reservoirs. This has been pursued to enable everyone to enjoy the benefits inherent to the utilization of water resources, by preserving functional rivers, improving their utility and reducing the degradation of water quality caused by floods and droughts. At the same time, coordinated activities are being conducted in multi-purpose dams, hydro-power dams, weirs, agricultural reservoirs and water use facilities (featuring a daily water intake of over 100   000  m 3  day − 1) with the purpose of monitoring the management of such facilities. This is being done to ensure the protection of public interest without acting as an obstacle to sound water management practices. During Flood Season, each facilities contain flood control capacity by limited operating level which determined by the <b>Regulation</b> <b>Council</b> in advance. Dam flood discharge decisions are approved through the flood forecasting and management of Flood Control Office due to minimize flood damage for both upstream and downstream. The operational plan is implemented through the council's predetermination while dry season for adequate quantity and distribution of water...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of my thesis {{is to provide}} an {{in-depth}} analysis of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is currently one of the significant legal tools of environmental quality protection. In case any public or private project {{is likely to have}} a significant effect on the environment, it needs to pass through the EIA proceedings. This process precedes the development consent to the project. The original EU legal <b>regulation</b> (<b>Council</b> directive 85 / 337 /EEC amended by Directives 97 / 11 /EC, 2003 / 35 /EC and 2009 / 31 /EC) is described in the first part of the thesis. The main sources of this chapter are the judicial decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities that reflect the incorrect transpositions of the directive into the legal order of the individual member states. The second chapter is focused on specific attributes of the Czech legal regulation that is included in the legal act no. 100 / 2001 Sb. modified by further amendments. The regulation is divided into two parts: The first part, the assessment, is concluded by a non-binding opinion, while the second part is concluded by development consent or refusal, as based on particular legal regulations. The most severe issue of the Czech regulation is the insufficient ensurance of participation opportunities of members of the public [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Some councils {{nevertheless}} {{choose to}} regulate more than others, {{with the various}} approaches to animal management classified along two spectra, the methodological functioning of <b>council</b> <b>regulation</b> (educative to enforcement) and the ontological functioning of <b>council</b> <b>regulation</b> (process to outcomes).

30|$|In {{contrast}} to institutional ontology, the methodological function of animal management delineates {{different kinds of}} regulation and activity.
