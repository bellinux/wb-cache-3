5|$|In Part II, {{after his}} mentor's defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto {{integrates}} some of Orochimaru's remains {{into his body}} to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again. Kabuto then masters snake Sage Justu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the <b>Reanimation</b> Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win {{the war against the}} Ninja Alliance. However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the <b>Reanimation</b> Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself of how to live his life, coming to the conclusion to save Sasuke's life. In the aftermath of the War, Kabuto returned to run the orphanage where he was held when he was a kid together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{report the}} death and <b>reanimation</b> of Randall to the others, but also that he turned without being bit. Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) begs Daryl {{to go out and}} search for Rick and Shane. However, they too soon see the walker horde and start arming themselves. While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. As the group starts to {{dispatch}} walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into the barn, and set it ablaze. Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near the barn and allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn, but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the <b>reanimation</b> of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Kabuto's defeat and needing answers, Sasuke exposes Orochimaru's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated. Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student, Anko Mitarashi, Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto's flesh. Despite expressing {{no interest in the}} ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke's body, Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja, taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being into one of the White Zetsu clones placed on Sasuke. In his new body, Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back to life with the <b>Reanimation</b> Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants. Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama, out of curiosity to see his former apprentice's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories, Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju. After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended, among those caught under Madara's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed, Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Team Taka (minus Sasuke who returns to Konoha) supporting him as lab assistants, though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps tabs on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities.|$|E

George Stacy recognizes {{something}} off about Gwen's face and points his gun at her. It was revealed that Gwen was actually the Gwen Stacy of Earth-65 that assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen Stacy is kidnapped by Kaine and taken to Parker Industries to be studied.

25|$|The late Stephen Jay Gould {{was one of}} Knight’s most {{well-known}} fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the <b>reanimation</b> of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day”.|$|E
25|$|The game then {{proceeds}} to retell {{the events of}} the first Resident Evil.

5000|$|After Durin died, Khazad-dûm {{was ruled}} by [...] "many generations" [...] of his descendants, until the Balrog {{appeared}} in Moria. In this long line, Tolkien writes, there appeared occasionally [...] "an heir so like to his Forefather {{that he received}} the name of Durin." [...] More complete versions of the account of Durin's Folk make clear that the later Durins appeared scattered amongst many generations. These six further Durins were believed by the Dwarves to be reincarnations (or even <b>reanimations)</b> of Durin I, with memories of his earlier lives.|$|R
50|$|Durin I was {{succeeded by}} many generations of kings, among whom {{appeared}} six others also named Durin. These six were believed by the dwarves to be reincarnations (or even <b>reanimations)</b> of Durin I, with {{memories of his}} earlier lives. Durin VI was killed by Durin's Bane in 1980 of the Third Age. Durin did not again return to his people until Durin VII appeared in the Fourth Age, a descendant of Thorin III son of Dáin II Ironfoot, and a descendant in direct line from Durin the Deathless.

500|$|Later in 2002, Linkin Park {{released}} an album entitled <b>Reanimation.</b> It included {{the songs of}} Hybrid Theory remixed and reinterpreted by nu metal and underground hip hop artists. Contributors to the album included Black Thought, Pharoahe Monch, Jonathan Davis, Stephen Carpenter, and Aaron Lewis. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as strings and piano, both of which, along with the same elements of electronica from Hybrid Theory, are prominently included in the band's second studio album Meteora. As Shinoda explains {{the difference in the}} sound between Hybrid Theory and Meteora: [...] "That electronic element has always been there in the band – it's just that sometimes we bring it closer to the front." ...|$|E

Many of his works are generally {{considered part of the}} dark romanticism genre, a literary reaction to transcendentalism which Poe strongly disliked. He referred to followers of the transcendental movement as [...] "Frog-Pondians", after the pond on Boston Common, and ridiculed their writings as [...] "metaphor—run mad," [...] lapsing into [...] "obscurity for obscurity's sake" [...] or [...] "mysticism for mysticism's sake".

But then I turned my gaze upon myself, on what went on within me, and I remembered all those cessations of life and <b>reanimations</b> that recurred within me hundreds of times. I remembered that I only lived at those times when I believed in God.

500|$|With Hybrid Theory being Linkin Park's first album, Mike Shinoda, who {{had worked}} as a graphic {{designer}} before becoming a professional musician, has stated that the band had looked through books for inspiration on how to present themselves for the first time. The result was a winged-soldier which Shinoda illustrated himself. According to Chester Bennington, the idea of the soldier with dragonfly wings was to describe the blending of hard and soft musical elements by the use of the jaded looks of the soldier and frail touches of the wings. The art style was largely influenced by stencil graffiti, including early works by Banksy. The cover also features scrambled lyrics of the album's songs within the background, though the lyrics of [...] "One Step Closer" [...] are the most prominent. A different version of the soldier can be seen on some of the album's singles.

He possessed a unique Mangekyo Sharingan ability called Kotoamatsukami, which enables the user to completely subject other people under their control without their knowledge. The eye stolen by Danzo is later used by him to manipulate people for his benefits, including Mifune during the Kage Summit, but it is lost after he commits a suicide attack against Sasuke. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and used to take him out of Kabuto's <b>reanimation</b> jutsu.

However, the Jutsu can only function if the deceased soul is within the realm of Pure Land and not elsewhere in the afterlife like in the stomach of the Reaper. Though it was the Tobirama Senju who invented the <b>Reanimation</b> Jutsu for the purpose of creating an indestructible army used in suicide attacks, the jutsu was later completed by Orochimaru when he [...] revived Tobirama Senju and Hashirama Senju. Kabuto perfected the jutsu {{to the point where he}} is able to revive dozens of ninja in one execution, needing to focus all his mental energy to fully control them. People revived through this process are almost invulnerable to even the most fatal attacks, as they will simply regenerate any damage taken (although it takes some time for especially damaging attacks like Rasengan and they can also be paralyzed by specific attacks, such as poison). Having already died, the resurrected expel any basic needs living people required; they have unlimited chakra and power due to not needing to replenish them. In addition, they cannot be subjected to genjutsu jutsu that affect living things like the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
