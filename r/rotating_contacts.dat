50|$|High power, {{high current}} commutated {{equipment}} is now uncommon, {{due to the}} less complex design of alternating current generators that permits a low current, high voltage spinning field coil to energize high current fixed-position stator coils. This permits the use of very small singular brushes in the alternator design. In this instance, the <b>rotating</b> <b>contacts</b> are continuous rings, called slip rings, and no switching happens.|$|E
50|$|While some {{stepping}} switches {{have only}} one pole (layer of contacts), a typical switch has more; in the latter case, all wipers are aligned and move together. Hence, one input with multiple wires could be connected to one of multiple outputs, based on the receipt of a single set of pulses. In this configuration, the <b>rotating</b> <b>contacts</b> resembled the head support arms in a modern hard disk drive. Multipole switches were common; some had {{perhaps as many as}} a dozen poles, but those were less common.|$|E
50|$|After dynamos and motors {{were found}} to allow easy {{conversion}} {{back and forth between}} mechanical or electrical power, they were combined in devices called rotary converters, rotating machines whose purpose was not to provide mechanical power to loads but to convert one type of electric current into another, for example DC into AC. They were multi-field single-rotor devices with two or more sets of <b>rotating</b> <b>contacts</b> (either commutators or sliprings, as required), one to provide power to one set of armature windings to turn the device, and one or more attached to other windings to produce the output current.|$|E

50|$|The LVDT {{can be used}} as an {{absolute}} position sensor. Even if the power is switched off, on restarting it, the LVDT shows the same measurement, and no positional information is lost. Its biggest advantages are repeatability and reproducibility once it is properly configured. Also, apart from the uni-axial linear motion of the core, any other movements such as the rotation of the core around the axis will not affect its measurements. Because the sliding core does not touch the inside of the tube, it can move without friction, making the LVDT a highly reliable device. The absence of any sliding or <b>rotating</b> <b>contacts</b> allows the LVDT to be completely sealed against the environment.|$|E
50|$|Mercury-wetted slip rings, {{noted for}} their low {{resistance}} and stable connection {{use a different}} principle which replaces the sliding brush contact with a pool of liquid metal molecularly bonded to the contacts. During rotation the liquid metal maintains the electrical connection between the stationary and <b>rotating</b> <b>contacts.</b> However, the use of mercury poses safety concerns, {{as it is a}} toxic substance. If a slip ring application involves food manufacturing or processing, pharmaceutical equipment, or any other use where contamination could be a serious threat, the choice should be precious metal contacts. Leakage of the mercury and the resultant contamination could be extremely serious. The slip ring device is also limited by temperature, as mercury solidifies at approximately -40 °C.|$|E

40|$|Many {{components}} experience sliding or <b>rotating</b> <b>contact</b> {{with other}} parts or with their environments. Their performance often degrades during service because their dimensions are altered by wear. Furthermore, the friction at the contact surface wastes energy. To mitigate these problems, hard coatings may {{be applied to}} contact surfaces to increase their wear resistance, and surfaces are often covered with a lubricant to reduce friction. At Ames National Laboratory, a nanocomposite boron-aluminum-magnesium ceramic alloy coating (AlMgB 14 + TiB 2) has been developed that provides a superhard, wear-resistant surface that also has an exceptionally low coefficient of friction. Tests show that these boride coatings offer a combination of wear resistance and low friction unmatched by other hard mate - rials (e. g., tungsten carbide, cubic boron nitride, or diamondlike carbon) ...|$|R

In order to effectively control the growth of biofilms, it is necessary to investigate the structure of biofilms grown under different conditions.

40|$|Abstract: A four degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic {{mechanism}} {{can be used}} {{to manipulate}} objects in six DOF by using a gripper altered for two-point pivot grasping where the force of gravity is used for six DOF reorientation. We show that one pivot grasp is sufficient to rotate an ashlar-shaped object from known initial stable configuration into arbitrary final stable configuration. If the initial configuration is not given, robotic vision and a series of two consecutive pivot grasps are needed to achieve the desired final configuration. Two frames of different stable configurations of the same object suffice to perform the required reorientation of the object. A pivot gripper can be further modified by replacing its <b>contact</b> points with <b>rotating</b> <b>contact</b> planes which improves the gripping performance and stability considerably. The effectiveness of the reorientation algorithm along with determining position and orientation of objects lying in the robot workspace with robotic vision is tested in a work cell comprising a SCARA robot and a standard industrial FireWire camera...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} investigations of small bodies dynamics in a vicinity of giant planets. We used the most simple body model: gravitationally bounded, <b>rotating</b> <b>contact</b> binary {{affected by the}} tidal force acting from a planet. Spin variations of such binaries were extensively studied during planetary close encounters. Two main types of dynamical behaviour were observed: (i) huge but interim fluctuations of the angular velocity and (ii) permanent changes of a rotation during a close approach. The first type is observed mainly for fast rotators, while the second one was encountered in a population of slowly spinning objects with periods longer than 12 hours. Conclusions on usability of such crude physical body models in dynamical investigations and a comparison to previous results were attached. The results allow us to formulate a thesis explaining the phenomenon of creation of the extremely slow rotators and an observational excess of such type of objects...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} relatively low flexural natural frequencies {{due to their}} light structure and high excitation frequencies due to rotation and meshing at high operating speeds.
