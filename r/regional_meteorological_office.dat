40|$|Introduction: Drying {{process of}} {{agricultural}} products, {{fruits and vegetables}} are highly energy demanding and hence are the most expensive postharvest operation. Nowadays, the application of control systems in different area of science and engineering {{plays a key role}} and is considered as the important and inseparable parts of any industrial process. The review of literature indicates that enormous efforts have been donefor the intelligent control of solar driers and in this regard some simulation models are used through computer programming. However, because of the effect of air velocity on the inlet air temperature in dryers, efforts have been made to control the fan speed based ont he temperature of the absorber plate in this study, and the behavior of this system was compared with an ordinary dryer without such a control system. Materials and methods: In this study, acabinet type solar dryer with forced convection and 5 kg capacity of fresh herbs was used. The dryer was equipped with a fan in the outlet chamber (the chimney) for creating air flow through the dryer. For the purpose of research methods and automatic control of fan speed and for adjusting the temperature of the drying inlet air, a control system consisting of a series of temperature and humidity sensors and a microcontroller was designed. To evaluatethe effect of the system with fan speed control on the uniformity of air temperature in the drying chamber and hence the trend of drying process in the solar dryer, the dryer has been used with two different modes: with and without the control of fan speed, each in twodays (to minimize the errors) of almost the same ambient temperature. The ambient air temperature during the four days of experiments was obtained from the <b>regional</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Office.</b> Some fresh mint plants (Mentha longifolia) directly harvested from the farm in the morning of the experiment days were used as the drying materials. Each experimental run continued for 9 hours, startingat 8 : 00 am and terminating at 17 : 00. To determine the moisture content for the purpose of observing and recording the drying process, the drying materials were sampled with one hour time step. The moisture contentwas determinedin the laboratory using the well- known method of oven drying which is presented elsewhere. Results and discussion: Since the ambient air temperature during the four days of experimental runs was almost the same, the effect of ambient air temperature on the drying process was ignored. Considering the dryer inlet air temperature charts obtained in this study (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), it can be concluded that for those tests using the fan speed control system, the outlet air temperature of the collector during drying period associated with very little variations, is compared with the no control mode runs. At the beginning of the day and also during the hours {{at the end of the}} day, due to a decrease in the temperature of the absorber plate compared to the middle of theday, the fan speed is reduced as air passes slowly through the absorber plate and hence the temperature rises. But in the middle of the day, with increasing the temperature of absorber plate, the speed of the fan is increased to provide sufficient airflow and to prevent the absorber plate from warming up. Inexperiments without fan speed control, the fan works with no limitation, and the temperature of the inlet air was changed with the temperature change in the absorber plate. The fan speed control system in addition to lowering the temperature changes in the outlet air, also increased the average outlet temperature about 3 C, compared to the dryer without such a control system. During the twodays of experiments, the average ambient air temperature was 28 C and at the sametime the outlet air temperature was 40. 6 and 40. 8 C, respectively. In twodays of no control system, the average temperature of the ambient air was 28. 5 and 28 C and at the sametime the outlet air temperature was 38 and 37. 8 C, respectively. The results showed that with fan speed control mode the variation of inlet air temperature of the drying chamber was more limited and remained within the range of 39 to 42 and 40 to 42 °C during the two experimental days, respectively. However, without fan speed control, the system exhibited a wider variation of inlet drying air temperature and limited within the range of 33 to 44 and 32 to 43 °C. Furthermore, with fan speed control in a solar dryer, along with more uniformity in moisture content, the drying rate may speed up and with further decrease in final moisture content up to 8...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThese tropical cyclone Meteorology and Model Traits Knowledge Bases for the North Indian Ocean (NIO) complete the global coverage required for {{application of the}} Systematic Approach to tropical cyclone track forecasting introduced by Carr and Elsberry (1994). The database for the NIO Meteorological Knowledge Base includes 64 storms during 1991 - 2001. All of the 656 cases could be classified in three common synoptic patterns {{that have been found}} to apply in other basins, with no unique patterns. About 75 % of the cases are in the standard pattern. This preliminary Model Traits Knowledge Base includes only eight tropical cyclones during 2000 - 2001. The model forecast track errors are relatively small, and only 33 %, 62 %, and 70 % of the Navy global, <b>regional,</b> and UK <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Office</b> models, respectively, exceed 150 n mi at 72 h. Only 12 cases of large (> 225 n mi at 72 h) track forecast errors occur. Half of these large-error cases are associated with erroneous model predictions in the midlatitudes. One third of the large errors originate from improper model treatments of the tropical circulations, and the remaining two cases originate from erroneous initial cyclone positions. Since these are the same error sources as in other basins, the Systematic Approach has global application. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
