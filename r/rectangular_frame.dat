25|$|The Doctor dons {{a pair of}} dark tortoise-shell <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame</b> glasses, an {{affectation}} (along {{with his}} signature footwear) borrowed from the Fifth Doctor. He also occasionally sports a pair of Red-Cyan 3D glasses, both as a joke and for practical reasons. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers and a white/red version worn by Tennant when he co-hosted Comic Relief), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on Doctor Who.|$|E
25|$|The structure, {{located in}} the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam quadrangle, is typical of Mughal {{architecture}} of Shah Jahan's times. It is completely built of white marble that was brought from Makrana The façade is composed of cusped arches and engaged baluster columns with smooth and fine contours. The mosque has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame.</b> This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain {{with the exception of}} ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{where the}} quality of the road permitted, the range might be {{extended}} by the use of charrettes (carts). When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of bumps in the road. On their axle was mounted an open <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame</b> within which were slung the baskets holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations {{in the same way as}} those of mail coaches.|$|E

The south and north doors of the exonarthex of 1547 have <b>rectangular</b> <b>frames,</b> which indicate a transition period from Gothic to Renaissance. But, above them, on each wall is a tall window with a flamboyant Gothic arch. The whole west façade is without any openings, which indicates that the intention of the Metropolitan Roșca was from the beginning to reserve it for frescoes.|$|R

25|$|The Tomlinson coupler was {{developed}} by the Ohio Brass Company for mass transit applications, but eventually found use in some mainline railroad vehicles as well. It consists of two squared metal hooks that engage with each other in a larger <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame</b> with air line connections above and below. Since the coupler's development the manufacturing arm of Ohio Brass was purchased by WABCO which now manufacturers the line along with the N-type. The Tomlinson coupler is the most widely used fully automatic heavy rail coupling in North America having been adopted by the DC Metro, MBTA, PATCO Speedline, SEPTA Broad Street Subway, LA Metro, Baltimore Metro, Miami Metro, MARTA Rail and the New York City Subway for its R44/R46 fleet and all modern classes starting with the R142. For applications outside of rapid transit the coupler had to be significantly enlarged to meet the increased strength requirements first appearing in this capacity on the Budd Metroliner and later on the Illinois Central Highliner fleet. Its relative lack of strength is one reason the N-Type has been more successful in the mainline railroad arena.|$|E
25|$|The {{critical}} architectural innovation {{designed for}} this purpose consisted of a wooden skeleton called the gaiola pombalina (Pombal Cage), a flexible <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame</b> with diagonal braces enabling structures to withstand the overload and stress of an earthquake without coming apart. This wooden frame was erected atop walls with barrel vault arches on a masonry foundation, giving solidity and weight {{to the first floor}} of the buildings, intended for occupation by shops, offices and warehouses. All new structures in the downtown area were erected on pine log pilings driven into the sandy soil of the Baixa, to ensure the effective support of their weight. They were arranged according to their importance in a horizontal hierarchy based on proximity to the street (the uppermost storey would be reserved for poorer families with few possessions, usually having lower ceilings, communal balconies, smaller windows and smaller rooms). All the buildings had masonry firewalls separating them from each other. The standardization of façades, windows, doors, simple geometric patterns in the hallway tiles, etc. permitted accelerated progress of the works through the mass production of these elements on site.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectangular}} church comprises a nave and presbytery {{flanked by}} lateral corridors, with a sacristy {{to the left}} of the altar. The main facade faces west, defined by Tuscan pilasters crowned with pyramidal pinnacles over parallel-elliptical plinths. The central wall along the nave is decorated in blue and white azulejo tiles. This two-storey high facade and azulejo wall are broken by a frieze and cornices over finial cut-breaks, forming lateral volutes, which are topped by a vegetal-shaped frontispiece crowned by a rectangular Latin cross. At the centre of the frontispiece is a niche formed from semi-circular conch shell and decorated lateral frame. The niche is framed by a rectangular border and surmounted by an inverted fleur-de-lis motif. The first basalt image installed in the niche was later sold to the priests of the Society of Jesus, and later installed in the niche of a house of Fajã de Cima. On the first floor is a simple framed door and on the second-floor three rectangular windows framed by false corbels and terminated in a frieze and cornice. The central window is larger and flanked by two vertical friezes. The lateral panels are plastered and painted in white, corresponding to the northern bell-tower, and a false bell-tower to the south, marked by a belfry in mortar, painted to imitate stonework. Three doorways access the building: the larger central door occupies the main facade, with two lateral doorways underneath the real and false belfreys. The rectangular false belfry door is inset from the facade, and surmounted by a rectangular oculus, while the lattice-door under the real belfrey (with similar <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame)</b> sits flush on the facade.|$|E

500|$|In principle, sprang may be {{regarded}} as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children's game known as cat's cradle. [...] Sprang is made by preparing a set of warp threads either on a <b>rectangular</b> <b>frame</b> or between a pair of beams. [...] The craftsperson then generates a fabric by interlinking the warp threads. [...] Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows, sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves. [...] The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels: most sprang worked upon has too many fibers to keep in hand, so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions. [...] The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson's fingers. [...] Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings. [...] As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick. [...] Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too tight to continue work. [...] The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists. [...] In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting, this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture.|$|E
