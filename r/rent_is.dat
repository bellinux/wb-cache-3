In time, Peter graduates from high school, and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University), where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn, and girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson. As Peter deals with Harry's drug problems, and Harry's father is revealed to be Spider-Man's nemesis the Green Goblin, Peter even attempts {{to give up his}} costumed identity for a while. Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective captain George Stacy is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (#90, November 1970).|$|E

40|$|A major {{contribution}} of the public-choice school is the recognition by Gordon Tullock that contestable rents give rise to social losses because of unproductive resource use. Contestable <b>rents</b> usually <b>are</b> politically assigned privileges. Contestable <b>rents</b> can also <b>be</b> found outside of government decisions. We describe the example of rents in academia in different cultures. The primary empirical question regarding rent seeking concerns {{the magnitude of the}} social loss from the contesting of <b>rents.</b> Direct measurement <b>is</b> impeded by lack of data and indeed denial that rent seeking took place. Contest models provide guidance regarding social losses. We provide a generalized contest model. Social losses from <b>rent</b> seeking <b>are</b> diminished in high-income democracies because rent seeking usually takes place by groups seeking 2 ̆ 018 public good 2 ̆ 019 benefits. <b>Rents</b> <b>are</b> also less visible in democracies, because political accountability requires that <b>rents</b> <b>be</b> assigned in indirect non-transparent ways. These restraints are not present in autocracies, where <b>rent</b> seeking <b>is</b> also facilitated by corruption and by the need to influence a smaller number of decision makers.

The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E

40|$|Countries {{that rely}} on natural {{resource}} <b>rents</b> (that <b>is,</b> the revenue generated {{from the sale of}} natural resources) may suffer from a variety of social problems. This exploratory study reviews the natural resource extraction literature to derive a ‘natural resource rents–homicide’ hypothesis. Data for 173 countries for the years 2000 to 2012 are examined to determine if there is a correlation between natural resource rents and homicide rates. Multilevel growth models suggest that natural resource <b>rents</b> <b>are</b> positively correlated with homicide rates within countries (level 1) but not between them (level 2). Importantly, the correlation between natural resource <b>rents</b> and homicide <b>is</b> strongest when natural resource <b>rents</b> <b>are</b> lagged.
