5000|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1961 by Ditmar-Donaldson in Costa Mesa as a {{personal}} fishing boat for Gilbert C. Van Camp III, the CEO of the Van Camp Seafood Company and makers of [...] "Chicken of the Sea" [...] tuna. As a fishing boat, the Vantuna was configured for albacore fishing. The vessel held two large, 2500 gal live bait tanks and a 15-ton refrigerated fish hold. Metal racks attached to the stern provided platforms for fishermen close to the water's surface. They used long fishing poles with stainless steel leaders and barbless hooks. When large schools of albacore were located, live bait thrown into the water caused the fish {{to go into a}} feeding frenzy where they would bite anything, including the barbless hooks of the fishing poles. Fish that were hooked were quickly pulled onboard by the fisherman. The barbless hooks would easily fall out of the fish's mouth, and then the fish was moved into the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>hold.</b> Although this was his personal fishing boat, Mr. Van Camp took the fish he caught to the factory where they were used by his company.|$|E

Acta Horticulturae, (599), 443 - 450 Horticultural exports are of economic significance to New Zealand. Only through providing consistently high quality products to distant markets can New Zealand hope to command a premium price. New Zealand's two major horticultural exports, apples and kiwifruit, are transported to foreign markets by sea; either in refrigerated holds on-board cargo vessels or in refrigerated containers. Long transit times mean that conditions in these systems {{must be carefully}} controlled to ensure high quality product arrives at market. Effective distribution of air is a key consideration in transport systems. A mathematical model to describe the flow of air in marine transport systems was developed. The model {{was based on a}} resistance network framework, relying on simplification of the complex geometry within the refrigerated space to a discrete number of flow paths and points of convergence and divergence. Correlations quantifying the flow resistance of each channel were required. Some of these correlations were already available, and some were developed specifically for this purpose. A general method for predicting the flow resistance of enclosed conduits based on the Darcy-Weisbach, laminar and Colebrook equations was found to be sufficiently accurate for use. The flow resistance of horizontally vented horticultural packages was quantified and the cause of the flow resistance investigated. Entrance and exit effects were found to be significant, and a relationship between vent size and flow resistance was developed. Air interchange between a vented carton and the general refrigerated space was shown to be a significant mode of heat transfer. The effect of vent design on the rate of air interchange was found to be complex. Quantitative relationships between vent characteristics and rates of air interchange could not be developed; however, some general observations were made. Vent size, aspect ratio and alignment were all found to affect the rate of interchange. An existing method for determining in-package fluid velocities was refined to improve the accuracy of data and reduce the measurement time. A low-cost method for measuring airflows in transport systems was also developed utilising thermistors. These thermistor anemometers were used to monitor velocities in four shipments of fresh produce from New Zealand. Three of the four vessels monitored showed large variation in the circulation rate in the period between evaporator defrosts due to frosting. In some cases, frosting was severe enough to cause loss of delivery air temperature control. Management of defrosts was identified as an area of improvement in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>hold</b> management. Validation of the model developed was performed using four systems: a laboratory scale test-rig, a 40 ' container and two of the surveyed refrigerated holds. Airflow predictions were used with a heat transfer model to predict in-package temperatures. Comparison of measured and predicted flows and in-package temperatures showed good agreement given uncertainty of geometry and input data. The implications of altering a number of operational and design variables in both containers and refrigerated holds were investigated using the developed models. Increased circulation rates were found to increase cooling rates and reduce temperature variability in both types of systems; however, the magnitude of the benefit decreased with increasing circulation rate. Removal of the floor gratings and the use of pallet bases as an air distribution channel was found to increase temperature variability in both types of systems. The magnitude of the increase was small in a 40 ' container but substantial in a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>hold.</b> The correlations and models developed in this thesis provide useful tools to analyse and optimise the design and operation of refrigerated marine transport systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the following study was to evaluate the microbial efficacy of a Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) dip (3 vs. 30 seconds) treatment (pH = 1. 5) for further processed broiler parts including wings, leg quarters and breast halves. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. This {{study was conducted in}} response to the request by several poultry companies for a means to increase the shelf-life of further processed broiler parts. Therefore, 60 post-chill broiler carcasses were obtained from a local USDA-inspected poultry processing facility and were transported on ice to MCA Services (Rogers, AR). Upon arrival at the laboratory, the carcasses were held under refrigerated conditions (40 to 42 o F) for 24 hours to simulate transport to a further processing (cut-up) facility. After the 24 -hour <b>refrigerated</b> <b>hold</b> period, the 60 carcasses were each manually cut into six pieces including two wings, two leg quarters and two breast halves. The cut-up parts were then randomly divided into three groups including a control and two treatment groups. Within each treatment group a pair of wings, a pair of leg quarters or a pair of breast halves served as an individual sample. Thus, there were 20 samples {{for each of the three}} carcass parts within each of the three treatment groups. The treatment groups included the control which received no further treatment, a group which was subjected to a 3 -second room temperature dip in Precure™ (pH = 1. 5) and a group which was subjected to a 30 -second room temperature dip in Precure™ (pH = 1. 5). Parts in both of the dip treatments were allowed to drain for 30 seconds after dipping. All samples (two wings, two leg quarters or two breast halves) were placed into sterile poultry rinse bags and were then held refrigerated at 40 o F until microbiological evaluation was initiated (3 in accordance with USDA/FSIS standard laboratory procedures. The lower detection level was 1 colony forming unit per mL. All dipped parts were also observed for organoleptic properties and no negative qualities were observed. The Aerobic Plate Counts for the control parts were 2. 0 logs (wings), 2. 4 logs (leg quarters) and 1. 9 logs (breast halves). The group that was subjected to the 3 -second Precure™ dip had Aerobic Plate Count values of 0. 5 logs (wings), 0. 3 logs (leg quarters) and 0. 9 logs (breast halves). There was no recovery of Aerobic Plate Count from parts that were subjected to the 30 -second dip in Precure™. Thus, the 3 -second dip in Precure™ resulted in Aerobic Plate Count reductions of > 97 % for wings, > 99 % for leg quarters and > 89 % for breast halves while the 30 -second dip in Precure™ allowed for no recovery of organisms. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that the use of Precure™ (pH = 1. 5) as a dip treatment (3 to 30 seconds) for poultry parts will significantly improve the microbiological properties of poultry parts without adversely affecting the sensory attributes. Thus, the commercially available Precure™ treatment provides the processor with a very economical means of controlling the microbiological properties, and possibly extending the shelf-life, of further processed poultry parts...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} relationship between types of livestock {{and place in the}} context of Great Britain's expanding agro-pastoral empire. Specifically, it examines how the distribution and circulation of breeds of livestock native to the British Isles influenced understandings of kind and location-of the dynamic interaction between heredity, human influence and environmental conditions, and their various fluid effects on ovine and bovine diversity. Drawing on extensive archival work in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia, I trace both the national origins and imperial expansion of British breeds. As Britain industrialized in the early nineteenth century, breeders faced the need to convert the specificity of their animals into fungibility while maintaining the distinctive character of their breeds, seemingly incompatible aims that nonetheless guaranteed the economic viability of their stock. Thus they reoriented local variability towards market standardization, transforming regional types of cattle and sheep into geographically transposable, bulky, and quick-fattening beasts suited for increasingly sophisticated economies and industrialized production. Tension between standardization and specialization shaped the dispersal of breeds throughout the empire as well. Here, stockbreeders served two masters: the unfamiliar climates and topographies of Australia, New Zealand, and North America, which demanded local adaptations, and the British consumer, whose dinner table {{was the end of the}} line for the bulk of colonial beef and mutton. As they tried to balance local adaptation and metropolitan taste, breeders experimented with heredity, testing the limits of contemporary understandings of heritability and breed plasticity, and developed of new strains of livestock genetically derived from British breeds, but culturally, economically and environmentally hybrid. In the process, imperialism itself was instantiated in these animals. Bodies of sheep and cattle were remade to suit new lands and later to fill the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>holds</b> of ocean liners. The empire itself was recast as a vast apparatus for feeding Britons. This system, divested of its imperial trappings and disseminated still further, brings meat to tables around the world today. by Rebecca J. H. Woods. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Due to renewed {{interest}} in specialty cheeses, small-scale artisan and farmstead producers are manufacturing numerous varieties of cheese, including those that present higher risk such as surface-ripened soft cheeses, often using raw milk. The presence of pathogenic bacteria in raw milk on large scale dairy farms is well documented as the dairy farm itself {{can serve as a}} reservoir. To assess the risks {{associated with the use of}} raw milk in the manufacture of small-scale artisan cheese we evaluated overall milk quality and prevalence of four target pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7) in raw milk from 11 farmstead cheese operations in Vermont. Although overall incidence was low in comparison to other surveys, variation from farm to farm, independent of species, indicates that some operations practice strict hygienic controls and that additional effort is needed on others. Our data also suggest that if present, pathogen population levels in raw milk are extremely low. Although these pathogens are readily inactivated by pasteurization, pasteurized milk and milk products, including soft cheese, have been implicated in major outbreaks of L. monocytogenes infection as the result of post-processing environmental contamination. U. S. Standards of Identity permit the manufacture of these and other cheeses from raw milk, provided they are aged for a minimum of 60 days typically at a temperature no less than 35 °F (1. 67 °C) to provide safety. Of particular concern are the surface-mold-ripened soft cheeses due to the growth potential during aging and <b>refrigerated</b> <b>holding</b> following increases in pH. In a study on the growth potential of L. monocytogenes introduced as post process contaminants on surface-mold-ripened cheeses we demonstrate that holding cheese in compliance with U. S. Federal regulations supports pathogen growth from very low levels regardless of the whether the milk used was raw or pasteurized. Moreover, the 60 day aging rule encourages extended holding which could inadvertently contribute to risk. It is clear that the safety of cheeses within this category must be achieved through control strategies other than pasteurization or aging. Effective environmental monitoring and control of Listeria spp. within processing plants, including farmstead cheese operations, is considered paramount in reducing cross contamination of ready-to-eat foods. To assess the incidence and ecology of Listeria spp. in farmstead cheese processing environments we conducted environmental sampling in 9 different cheesemaking facilities over a 10 -week period while comparing three detection/isolation protocols. Results indicate that the use of detection/isolation methods incorporating dual primary enrichment with a repair step allowing for the recovery of injured Listeria enhances detection of Listeria spp., including L. monocytogenes, and that the addition of PCR increases sensitivity of detection while greatly reducing time to results. Our data indicate that the extent of farmstead cheese plant contamination with Listeria spp., notably L. monocytogenes, is comparatively low for dairy processing plants, especially those with contiguous farms and aids in the identification of control points for use in designing more effective control and monitoring programs. Overall the studies contained herein fill data gaps in the literature considering the threat of emerging pathogens in raw milk intended for farmstead cheesemaking, as well as the incidence and distribution of Listeria spp., including molecular subtypes, in small farmstead cheese processing environments over time. These data will help inform risk assessments which evaluate the microbiological safety of artisan cheeses, particularly those manufactured on farms...|$|R

Both these species are also caught by purse seine boats and by small live bait boats fishing in local waters, but their catches are minor and erratic. It is the steady deliveries of the larger bait boats throughout the year upon which the industry depends. In actual value of the product, tuna is second only to salmon on the entire Pacific coast. In tonnage landed, it ranks second in the fisheries of California. In 1936 the total pack of tuna approximated 2, 600, 000 cases. Virtually the entire catch of these two species is canned in southern California, with San Diego and San Pedro as the home ports of the fleet. Negligible quantities are sold to a limited fresh fish trade. There are five so-called tunas taken in California and each supports a fleet of more or less specialized boats which contribute to California's tuna pack. Descriptions of these fisheries may be found elsewhere, but the present account pertains exclusively to the live bait, hook and line fishery for yellowfin and skipjack followed by the larger boats. The tuna fleet comprises about 70 boats, built at a cost approaching $ 6, 000, 000. According {{to the size of the}} individual vessel, this fleet may be divided arbitrarily into two parts. Those under 90 feet are herein referred to as the "smaller tuna boats" and these will be discussed only incidentally. Those over 90 feet are designated as the "larger tuna boats," and the 50 vessels comprising this fleet are essentially the subject of this article. All statements and descriptions apply therefore to a representative average of this fleet. These tuna boats are the largest fishing vessels registered in this state and they were expressly designed and built to exploit the most extended fishery on this coast. On a single trip of perhaps seven or eight weeks they may travel a total distance of 6000 to 8000 miles and range 3000 miles from home. Necessarily, they are large for they must accommodate sufficient fuel capacity, a <b>refrigerated</b> fish <b>hold</b> that will carry a paying load, and a crew large enough to catch it. Their fuel capacity ranges from 10, 000 to 30, 000 gallons; their fish capacity from 150 to 350 tons; and the size of crew from 12 to 20 men, according to the size of the vessel. Almost any day at San Diego one of these tuna boats may be seen preparing for a trip. With all repairs completed, she proceeds to the fuel docks where the tanks are filled with diesel and lubricating oil. From here she proceeds to the icing dock. Three-hundred-pound blocks of ice are transferred from the waiting trucks to the conveyor and carried by this to the crusher overhead, from which they pour in an endless stream of fine particles to the blower beneath. This blower is used to distribute the ice uniformly to the farthest corners of the hold, thus eliminating much unnecessary shovelling. Meanwhile, loads of provisions and miscellaneous stores come aboard and the erstwhile trim tuna boat now takes on a dishevelled look of chaos, with crates and bales and boxes piled everywhere. Late in the afternoon order is restored and the vessel is deserted except for one or two who keep the engine watch, for with the taking on of ice an auxiliary is started to run the refrigerating plant and bait pumps, and one or the other auxiliary runs continuously for the duration of the trip. The sailing time is set and the remainder of the crew has gone ashore to spend the intervening time at home. Later in the evening the tuna boat will sail. With three long blasts on the whistle, a last farewell to the families and friends ashore, she heads for sea. The long trip has begun...|$|R
