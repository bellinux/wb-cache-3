40|$|In Chile swine {{trichinosis}} {{has presented}} a progressive decreasing {{in the last}} two decades of XX century. T. Spiralis pig infection descended from an average of 0. 683 per 1000 in 1980 - 1984 to 0. 315 in 1985 - 1989 andto 0. 115 in 1990 - 1996. In the particular case of Metropolitan Region this decreasing has been more marked: from an average of 0. 058 per 1000 in 1990 - 1994 to 0. 003 in 1995 - 1999. Between the end of June 1999 and middle January 2000 in MetropolitanRegion abattoirs T. spiralis was detected in 15 (4. 9 %) out of 306 swine from two pigsties located in El Monte (E. M.) and Padre Hurtado (P. H.) 45 and 30 km south-west from Santiago. In the same period another four pigs from the same premises were found infected in abattoirs of other regions. During inspection visits it was stated that both pig farms had deficient sanitary conditions. Phototrichinoscopy was positive in three out of five Rattus norvegicus collected in E. M. In pigsty PH the examination of diaphragm samples of 25 dogs and 17 cats resulted negative.

40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to assess the actual degree of oxidative degradation of the lipid fraction of 30 -day-ripened sausages using both commonly used investigations and nonconventional means, such as the high-performance size-exclusion chromatography analysis of polar compounds. Sausages made from pork shoulders from extensive and intensive <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> were considered. The obtained results showed {{a high degree of}} primary oxidative degradation of the sausage lipid fraction, as evidenced by oxidized triacylglyrerol and peroxide values, while a low secondary oxidation of fats was found, as evidenced by triacylglycerol oligopolymers and 2 -tiobarbituric acid test values. Moreover, the degree of oxidative degradation did not show any significant difference between the two types of sausage, although the samples prepared from extensively <b>reared</b> <b>pigs,</b> as compared with those from intensively <b>reared</b> <b>pigs,</b> showed significantly (p < 0. 001) higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids and significantly (p < 0. 01) lower amounts of saturated fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} {{fluorescent antibody}} {{test was used to}} detect the presence of Streptococcus suis type 2 in nasal and pharyngeal swabs taken from pigs in Papua New Guinea. The rate of carriage for the two sites in domesticated indigenous village pigs was 0. 5 and 2. 5 % respectively, compared to 39 and 43 % for intensively <b>reared</b> <b>pigs.</b> These findings were supported by the results of a serological survey, using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, in which 87 % of intensively <b>reared</b> <b>pigs</b> but only 8 % of village pigs were seropositive to S. suis type 2. It is proposed that in intensive piggeries S. suis type 2 is continually cycled between pigs. In village pigs, the low population density and harsh environmental conditions prevents this cycle of infection...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of feeding organic acids on {{performance}} and gut structure in the newly weaned pig. Pig performance and gut structure of pigs fed diets supplemented {{with a combination of}} 12 g/kg (6., 50 g/kg formic, 2. 55 g/kg propionic) acid and 500 FTU/kg phytase post-weaning was comparable with that of pigs fed diets medicated with 2. 1 g/kg Zinc Oxide (ZnO). Formic/propionic acid blend and phytase were used in combination without any interactions and phytase can be used to replace dicalcium phosphate in weaner piglet diets. Litter of origin has a significant effect on small intestine structure and should be considered when investigating {{the effect of}} dietary treatment on gut development in the newly weaned pig. Supplementing diets with 1. 5 g/kg butyrate in its sodium salt form, but not in its esterified form, stimulated gut development; as indicated by longer villi in the proximal small intestine on day 13 post-weaning. Both sodium butyrate and esterified butyrate improved growth rates and FCR and were successfully used in combination with ZnO. Supplementing post-weaning diets with 3. 1 g/kg ZnO was the most effective in stimulating feed intake, maintaining performance, enhancing gut development and reducing the incidence of scour in the newly weaned pig. Both indoor and outdoor <b>reared</b> <b>pigs</b> benefitted from ZnO supplementation in the first two weeks post-weaning. Outdoor <b>reared</b> <b>pigs</b> adapted better to the abrupt process of weaning, had a more developed distal small intestine post-weaning and outperformed their indoor reared counterparts due to their ability to maintain sufficient feed intakes. Feeding indoor <b>reared</b> <b>pigs</b> diets supplemented with esterified butyrate and/or ZnO post-weaning produced FCRssimilar to those of the outdoor <b>reared</b> <b>pig,</b> The positive effects on gut development and performance associated with ZnO highlights the value of medicating diets with pharmacological levels of ZnO in the critical period immediately following weaning.

40|$|The {{physiological}} and behavioural responses of slaughter <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> {{in either a}} barren environment or in an enriched environment (larger pens with straw bedding) to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport were studied. Enriched-reared pigs had higher salivary cortisol concentrations in the home pen before and after transport than barren housed pigs, {{but at the end}} of the lairage period salivary cortisol concentrations did not differ between enriched- and barren-housed <b>pigs.</b> In <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment, salivary cortisol concentrations increased significantly after transport and being in lairage, as compared to home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in an enriched environment, salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly change after any stage of preslaughter handling and transport as compared with home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In the truck, <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking, standing and manipulating other pigs than enriched-reared <b>pigs.</b> Moreover, <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking and fighting in lairage than enriched-reared pigs. Results showed that rearing conditions may affect the behavioural and physiological responses of pigs to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport. The tendency for increased manipulation of pen mates and fighting, and the significant increases in salivary cortisol in response to mixing at transport and being in lairage in <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment indicate that <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment are likely to experience more stress during common preslaughter procedures than <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in an enriched environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of <b>rearing</b> systems for <b>pig</b> production, as concerns performance, meat lipid content, the fatty acid profile, histidinic antioxidants, coenzyme Q 10, and TBARs. One hundred pigs were assigned to one of three treatments: intensively <b>reared</b> commercial hybrid <b>pig</b> (I), free range commercial hybrid pig (FR) or organically <b>reared</b> crossbred <b>pig</b> (O), according to organic EU Regulations. I pigs showed the best productive performance, but FR and O increased: C 20 : 1 n 9, Δ 9 -desaturase (C 18) and thioesterase indices in meat.

40|$|Background: In China, mosquito-borne {{diseases}} are {{most common in}} the sub-tropical area of Yunnan province. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine behaviors related to mosquito-borne diseases in different ethnic minority groups and different socioeconomic groups of people living in this region. Methods: A stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique with probability proportional to size was used in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan. Twelve villages were used to recruit adult (≥ 18 years old) and eight schools were used for children (< 18 years old). A questionnaire on behaviors and environment variables related to mosquito-borne diseases was devised. Results: Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) grouped 20 behaviors into three domains, namely, environmental condition, bed net use behaviors, and repellent use behaviors, respectively. The Han ethnicity had the lowest odds of <b>rearing</b> <b>pigs,</b> their odds being significantly lower than those of Yi and Yao. For bed net use, Dai and other ethnic minority groups were less likely to use bed nets compared to Yi and Yao. The odds of repellent use in the Han ethnicity was lower than in Yi, but higher than in Dai. The Dai group was the most likely ethnicity to use repellents. Farmers were at a higher risk for <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> and not using repellents. Education of less than primary school held the lowest odds of <b>pig</b> <b>rearing.</b> Those with low income were at a higher risk for not using bed nets and repellent except in <b>pig</b> <b>rearing.</b> Those with a small family size were at a lower risk for <b>pig</b> <b>rearing.</b> Conclusion: Different ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the study areas require different specific emphases for the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases...|$|R

40|$|Pigs have a {{need for}} {{manipulable}} materials to satisfy a range of behavioural needs, which can be different in different classes of pig. When these needs are not met, a range of adverse welfare consequences result, one of these being an increased risk for tail-biting in weaners and <b>rearing</b> <b>pigs.</b> The ability to control the risk of tail- biting is essential when aiming to avoid tail-docking. Based on available scientific information this Opinion identifies the multiple interactions between risk factors, welfare consequences and animal and non-animal-based measures on the two subjects requested (i) the absence of functional manipulable materials, for pigs at different stages in life and (ii) tail-biting, for weaners and <b>rearing</b> <b>pigs</b> only. An attempt is made to quantify {{the relationships between the}} identified interactions by carrying out a statistical analysis of information from available databases, those being an international dataset collected using the Welfare Quality® protocol, which was not designed to evaluate risk factors for tail-biting and therefore, it had limitations in fitness for this analysis, and a large Finnish dataset with undocked pigs. Based on the current state of knowledge, the AHAW Panel proposes two simple tool-boxes for on farm use to assess (i) the functionality of the supplied manipulable material and (ii) the presence and strength of risk factors for tail biting. Both proposed tool-boxes include a combination of the most important resource-based and animal-based measures. Further development and validation of decision–support tools for customised farm assessment is strongly recommended and a proposal for harmonised data collection across the range of European farming circumstances is presented.
