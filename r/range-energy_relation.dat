40|$|Purpose: This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} overview on properties and origin of nanodiamonds in primitive meteorites. Nanodiamond are a type of stardust, i. e. “pre-solar” grains that formed in the outflows or ejecta of stars. Design/methodology/approach: We summarize previously obtained results and include our results dealing with recoil loss from nanoparticles during radioactive decay of trace elements within them. Findings: Nanodiamonds in primitive meteorites have a mean size of ~ 2. 6 nm and an abundance reaching up to ~ 0. 15 % by weight. They contain trace noble gases, notably xenon, with an unusual isotopic composition. The latter {{is reminiscent of the}} p- and r-processes of nucleosynthesis that are thought to occur during supernova explosions. Our new results show that recoil loss during β decay of implanted 22 Na does not exceed what is expected from energy distribution and <b>range-energy</b> <b>relations</b> in matter. While a CVD origin for the diamonds appears likely (but is not assured), the noble gases were probably introduced by ion implantation. Research limitations/implications: The isotopic pattern of Xe contained in nanodiamonds indicates some unconventional types of element synthesis in stars or modification by secondary processes. Recoil loss from nanometer-sized grains during decay of unstable precursor nuclides has been suggested as an explanation, but our experiments do not support this idea. Originality/value: Other processes must be invoked for explanation of the isotopically unusual xenon trapped in meteoritic nanodiamonds.

Here we present results of modeling the atmospheric effects, especially production of odd nitrogen compounds and subsequent depletion of ozone, by solar protons associated with the Carrington event. This study combines approaches from two previous studies of the atmospheric effect of this event. We investigate changes in NOy compounds as well as depletion of O 3 using a two-dimensional atmospheric chemistry and dynamics model. Atmospheric ionization is computed using a <b>range-energy</b> <b>relation</b> with four different proxy proton spectra associated with more recent well-known solar proton events. We find that changes in atmospheric constituents are in reasonable agreement with previous studies, but effects of the four proxy spectra used vary more widely than found by one of those studies. In particular, we find greater impact for harder proton spectra, given a constant total fluence. We report computed nitrate deposition values and compare to measured values in ice cores.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of {{an investigation into the}} flux of cosmic ray muons underground at a depth of 7500 m. w. e. in the Kolar Gold Fields, South India. Muons from the decay of pions produced in the first high energy interactions of energetic cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere were observed to arrive from directions close to the vertical. The angular distribution, depth-intensity relation and electromagnetic interaction products of the muons are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the behaviour of these characteristics at very great depths. An examination is made {{of the way in which}} muons loose energy in various media and from this study the <b>range-energy</b> <b>relations</b> for muons in standard rock and sea water are constructed. A comparison of recent underwater and underground measurements at depths down to I 5 OO m. w. e, is made and it is shown that the sea level energy spectra derived from measurements under the two types of media are nearly identical and close to the spectrum given by Osborne et al. (1964). At angles close to the horizontal, muons were detected in the underground laboratory from the interactions of neutrinos with nucleons in the surrounding rock wall. Definite evidence was obtained, by means of a visual neon flash tube technique, that the neutrino interactions are mainly non-elastic in character, and that the rate of muons observed agrees well with theory, though on the presently available statistics it is not possible to decide whether or not the role played by the theoretically predicated intermediate boson is significant.

40|$|The track {{structure}} model of heavy ion cross sections {{was developed by}} Katz and co-workers in the 1960 s. In this model the action cross section is evaluated by mapping the dose-response of a detector to gamma rays (modeled from biological target theory) onto the radial dose distribution from delta rays about {{the path of the}} ion. This is taken to yield the radial distribution of probability for a "hit" (an interaction leading to an observable end-point). Radial integration of the probability yields the cross section. When different response from ions of different Z having the same stopping power is observed this model may be indicated. Since the 1960 s there have been several developments in the computation of the radial dose distribution, in the measurement of these distributions, and in new radiobiological data against which to test the model. The earliest model, by Butts and Katz made use of simplified delta ray distribution functions, of simplified electron range-energy relations, and neglected angular distributions. Nevertheless it made possible the calculation of cross sections for the inactivation of enzymes and viruses, and allowed extension to tracks in nuclear emulsions and other detectors and to biological cells. It set the pattern for models of observable effects in the matter through which the ion passed. Here we outline subsequent calculations of radial dose which make use of improved knowledge of the electron emission spectrum, the electron <b>range-energy</b> <b>relation,</b> the angular distribution, and some considerations of molecular excitation, of particular interest both close to the path of the ion and the outer limits of electron penetration. These are applied to the modeling of action cross sections for the inactivation of several strains of E-coli and B. subtilis spores where extensive measurements in the "thin-down" region have been made with heavy ion beams. Such calculations serve to test the radial dose calculations at the outer limit of electron penetration. We lack data from which to test these calculations in regions close to the path of the ion aside from our earliest work on latent tracks in plastics, though it appears that the criterion then suggested for the threshold of track formation, of a minimal dose at a minimal distance (of about 20 angstroms, in plastics), remains valid...|$|E

The agreement is quite good at 816 and 4110 m. w. e. but the observed intensity is higher by ~ 30 % at 1812 m. w. e. The integral sea-level muon intensities have been inferred from the <b>range-energy</b> <b>relation,</b> allowing for fluctuations in energy losses. From comparison with ɤ - ray cascade data it is shown the K/π ratio is sensibly constant at ~ 30 % over the range of primary energy 10 (^ 3) – 10 (^ 6 _) GeV. No significant non-Poissonian contribution to the distribution of time intervals between the arrival of successive events underground was noted indicating that the phenomenon of bursts of particles at short time intervals reported by Cowan et al (1964) has not been observed in the present experiment. The probability of electromagnetic interactions of muons in rock and lead was found to Increase (with increasing depth) demonstrating the growing Importance of energy losses by bremsstrahlung and direct pair production. Analysis of multiple penetrating particle events shows that they cfm be attributed to the production o muons (via pions) in extensive air showers, and to the nuclear interaction of muons in rock.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine by experimental methods a <b>range-energy</b> <b>relation</b> for protons in nickel, the energy range covered being between approximately 2 and 5 Mev. Nickel is often used for target backings and in other phases of nuclear research in which accurate values of particle energy absorption are required. Since no experimental data for ranges or energy loss in this metal were available in this energy range, it is apparent that such information would be very useful. The first determinations of ranges were carried out with monoenergetic alpha-particles produced by the disintegration of radioactive nuclei, this being the only source of high energy charged particles available at the time. Later, similar measurements were made with monoenergetic proton beams from particle accelerators. The method of determining the range of these particles in a particular substance was to introduce very thin layers of the material between the source and a detector until the transmission reached zero. Then a plot of the transmission as a function of the absorber thickness was obtained, from which the mean range, i. e., the range at which 50 % transmission occurred, was determined. Due to the inaccuracy in determining the thicknesses of the thin foils, a high degree of accuracy could not be obtained with this method. With the advent of charged particle accelerators which utilized analyzing magnets, a source of a variety of charged particles became available. Since the energy of the particle beam is variable, we are given a new and more easily utilized method of mean range measurements. One may now use a single foil of the absorbing material, and instead of using the absorber thickness as the variable, use the energy of the particle beam. A transmission curve is then obtained which gives the transmission as a function of the energy. This method is more accurate in that the thickness of only one thick foil must be determined instead of many thin foils as was necessary in the earlier method. If a sufficient number of data points are obtained, one may find an empirical relation between the ranges and energies of the particles. Then upon differentiation of this relation, the rate of energy loss of the particle may be determined. This energy loss may then be compared with existing theories, a treatment of which is given in the next section...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityEnergy {{levels are}} {{characterized}} by the following properties: excitation energy, Q, angular momentum, parity, level width, isobaric spin, magnetic moment and configuration. They may be studied experimentally by the following methods: (1) measurement of the energy spectra of nuclear reaction products, (2) measurement of peaks in the yield curve {{as a function of}} incident particle energy to obtain levels in the compound nucleus, (3) measurement of gamma ray intensity as a function of bombarding particle energy, (4) measurement of the maximum beta decay energy to locate levels in the residual nucleus, (5) measurement of input particle energy thresholds for production of neutrons, (6) measurement of angular distributions and angular correlations to find the spin and parity of a level. The accurate measurement of neutron spectra is difficult because the uncharged neutron must be detected by indirect means. Cloud chambers, proportional counters, threshold detectors, time-of-flight methods, and nuclear emulsions have all been used successfully. Nuclear emulsions detect neutrons by the track of developable silver halide crystals left by a recoil proton after being struck by a neutron. The range of the recoil proton and the angle it made with the incident neutron beam are measured. Knowledge of the range-energy curve for the emulsion and application of the laws of conservation of energy and momentum determines the energy of the incident neutron. The emulsion consists of a high concentration of silver halide crystals embedded in gelatin. The following is a description of the nuclear emulsion method: A beam of particles strikes a target, neutrons are emitted, and they are detected by plates placed at several different angles with respect to the incident beam. Development of the plates must be done soon after exposure, since the latent image fades rapidly. In this experiment, a combination of the two-solution and low temperature development techniques was used. The plates are scanned with a microscope and the following quantities are measured: (1) θ, the dip angle in the processed emulsion, (2) l, the projection in the x-y plane of the track length in the processed emulsion, and (3) φ the angle l makes with the x axis. φ and θ are measured {{at the beginning of the}} track. To avoid large errors, only tracks which fall within certain acceptance criteria are measured. This experiment required the following criteria to be satisfied: (1) if φ≤ 10 °, tan θ≤ 0. 075, (2) if 10 ° 15 ° it is not accepted, and (4) the track must lie wholly within the emulsion. Scanning is done in strips one field of view wide and about half the plate length long. At each x and y coordinate setting the entire depth of the emulsion is searched for tracks, then the x coordinate is changed by about half a field of view, and the process is repeated. Strips are separated by two or three fields of view so that overlapping does not occur. Length measurements are made in eyepiece scale divisions, which must be converted to microns by calibrating against a stage micrometer. The emulsion thickness must be measured daily since it varies with humidity. Neutron energies are calculated by converting the measured track length to length in the unprocessed emulsion, and then applying conservation of energy and momentum. The number of tracks obtained per energy interval as a function of energy is tabulated. Two corrections are needed because: (1) the neutron-proton scattering cross section is strongly energy dependent, and (2) the probability of the recoil proton escaping from the emulsion increases with energy. Results are plotted in histogram form. The Q value for each neutron group is calculated; the highest neutron energy group usually represents formation of the ground state, the next highest represents the first excited state, etc. The energy resolution of the nuclear emulsion method is limited by the following factors: (1) Range straggling of protons in the emulsion, (2) energy straggling of the beam in the target, (3) energy spread of the beam, (4) multiple scattering of the protons in the emulsion, (5) length and angle measurement errors, (6) finite target size and angular spread of neutrons incident on the emulsion. This experiment was performed to measure the mass of p^ 28, by means of the reaction Si^ 28 (p,n) p^ 28. The target, a suspension of natural silicon in polystyrene, was bombarded by protons from the Princeton cyclotron, with an energy of 17. 45 ± 0. 15 Mev. The target thickness corresponded to an energy loss of 100 kev for 17 Mev protons, so the average proton energy reaching the plates was 17. 4 ± 0. 2 Mev. Ilford C- 2 plates, 400 microns thick, were placed 4. 5 in. from the target in an evacuated scattering chamber. Plates were mounted at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 degrees. At each angle two plates were sandwiched together, emulsions facing, and wrapped in aluminun 1 and lead foils. The beam was collimated by graphite apertures and was stopped by a graphite cup, relatively far from the plates. Plates were scanned at 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The <b>range-energy</b> <b>relation</b> of Rotblat was used. Data was corrected for n-p scattering and geometry. Five hundred tracks were measured at 30 ° and 90 °, and 250 tracks at 60 °. The ground state of p^ 28 was resolved only at 30 °, and actually the peak found in the 30 ° spectrum is probably due to both the ground and first excited states in p^ 28. Q for the ground state is - 14. 71 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass defect of p^ 28 is 0. 68 ± 0. 22 Mev; the mass of p^ 28 is 28. 00073 ± 0. 00024 amu. The differential cross section at 30 ° for formation of the ground and first excited states of p^ 28 is 0. 27 ±. 018 mb/steradian. If one corrects for the Coulomb energy difference and the neutron-proton mass difference, the mass of p^ 28 is 9. 39 Mev greater than that of Si^ 28. This means that the ground state of p^ 28 probably corresponds to the lower of two levels in Si^ 28, located at about 9. 39 Mev. This is in excellent agreement with the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces. The reactions Si^ 29 (p,n) p^ 29 and Si^ 30 (p,n) p^ 30 were observed. No new levels were found in either p^ 29 or p^ 30...|$|E
