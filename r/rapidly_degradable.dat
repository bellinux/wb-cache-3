The primary reasons were the weight of kulhars and the higher per-unit cost. One estimate claimed procurement costs to be 40 paisas per kulhar and 7-10 paisas for coated-paper cups. There were also some vendor complaints that, because kulhars absorb liquids to some extent, buyers have to be given more tea per serving in a kulhar than in a disposable plastic cup.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to investigate the}} effects of synchronizing the dietary starch and crude protein (CP) degradation in the rumen on nutrient utilization, fermentation, and total tract digestibility in sheep. The four diets were formulated with different rates of starch and CP release in the rumen but with similar metabolic energy, starch, and CP. The diets were slowly degradable starch, slowly degradable protein; slowly degradable starch, <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> protein; <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch, <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> protein; and <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch, slowly degradable protein. The diets were fed to four cannulated sheep ad libi- tumin two equal portions, using a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Dry matter intake (DM) was not influenced by either the rate of starch or protein degradation. There was no significant effect of dietary treatment on the digestibility of DM, organic matter, starch, CP, neutral detergent fiber or acid detergent fiber in the rumen and total tract. Ruminal pH was greater for sheep fed slowly degrad- able starch diets than <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch (P< 0. 05). Ruminal total volatile fatty acid concentrations were not affected by treatments but the molar proportions of propionic acid were greater for sheep fed rapid- ly degradable starch diets than slowly degradable starch diets (P< 0. 05). The ratios of acetic acid (A) to pro- pionic acid (P) were higher for sheep fed slowly degradable starch diets than <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch diets (P< 0. 05). Ruminal ammonia-N concentrations were not affected from the degradability characteristics of protein. Rumen pH and A:P were higher in diets containing slowly degradable starch than in diets <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch. Propionic acid was higher in diets containing <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch than in diets con- taining slowly degradable starch.

40|$|Measuring the {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} highly hydrated biological materials is challenging {{because of their}} intrinsic softness and labile nature. In these materials, {{it is difficult to}} avoid prestress and therefore to establish precise initial stress and strain conditions for lumped parameter estimation using creep or stress-relaxation (SR) tests. We describe a method (ɛ˙M or epsilon dot method) for deriving the viscoelastic parameters of soft hydrated biomaterials which avoids prestress and can be used to <b>rapidly</b> test <b>degradable</b> samples. Standard mechanical tests are first performed compressing samples using different strain rates. The dataset obtained is then analyzed to mathematically derive the material's viscoelastic parameters. In this work a stable elastomer, polydimethylsiloxane, and a labile hydrogel, gelatin, were first tested using the ɛ˙M, in parallel SR was used to compare lumped parameter estimation. After demonstrating that the elastic parameters are equivalent and that the estimation of short-time constants is more precise using the proposed method, the viscoelastic behavior of porcine liver was investigated using this approach.

30|$|The {{first step}} is to design {{sustainable}} antibiotics, which are effective against target organisms but, after their use, are less toxic, and are <b>rapidly</b> and completely <b>degradable.</b> To develop sustainable antibiotics, two different approaches (subprojects) are applied within PharmCycle: First, a re-design of the existing antibiotics with chemical and in silico methods (“Benign by Design”). Second, sustainable peptide-based antibiotics are produced with biotechnological methods. In the second step, the environmental risk assessment for antibiotics in the framework of the authorization process and for monitoring purposes is improved. There is a lack of data for the environmental risk assessment of antibiotics on the European market. With more transparency of these data, the environmental risk assessment for active substances and for the class of antibiotics can be improved. The aim is to increase the data availability by applying the Aarhus convention and by providing legal access to environmental information. Beside other shortages in the environmental risk assessment required by the European legislation, the effects of antibiotics directly applied in marine aquacultures are not assessed by marine prokaryotic test systems. Therefore, a marine cyanobacteria test was developed, which is more sensitive to selected priority antibiotics than the marine eukaryotic algae test (DIN EN ISO 10253) required by the European Medicines Agency. Marine cyanobacteria are of high importance for the nitrogen cycle and primary production. Moreover, they seem {{to play an important role}} with respect to climate change. To reduce the emission of antibiotics used as human pharmaceutical products to the aquatic environment, the third step focusses on the main pathway, the wastewater. Investigations to improve the wastewater treatment of priority antibiotics and sustainable antibiotics are conducted by a combination of methods: activated sludge units, activated carbon adsorption, and membrane filtration systems.|$|R

To understand this complexity and to ease in planning, design {{and management of the}} composting plant, mathematical model for simulation is usually applied. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a mathematical model of organic substrate degradation and its performance evaluation in solid waste windrow composting system. The present model is a biomass-dependent model, considering biological growth processes under the limitation of moisture, oxygen and substrate contents, and temperature. The main output of this model is substrate content which was divided into two categories: slowly and <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> substrates. To validate the model, it was applied to a laboratory scale windrow composting of a mixture of wood chips and dog food. The wastes were filled into a cylindrical reactor of 6 cm diameter and 1 m height. The simulation program was run for 3 weeks with 1 s stepwise. The simulated results were in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results. The MC and temperature of model simulation were found to be matched with those of experiment, but limited for <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> substrates. Under anaerobic zone, the degradation of <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> substrate needs to be incorporated into the model to achieve full simulation of a long period static pile composting.

However, degradability (in the present study: readily biodegradability) was not taken into account in the categorization as ‘CLP’ or ‘not-CLP’, because excluding readily degradable components from the prediction would interfere with the planned comparison of experimentally observed and CA-predicted product toxicity.

40|$|Aggregating rumen {{degradation}} {{characteristics of}} different carbohydrate components into the term modeled <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> carbohydrates (mRDC) can simplify diet formulation by accounting {{for differences in}} rate and extent of carbohydrate degradation within and between feedstuffs. This study sought to evaluate responses of lactating dairy cows to diets formulated with increasing levels of mRDC, keeping the supply of other nutrients as constant as possible. The mRDC content of feedstuffs was calculated based on a simple rumen model including soluble, washable, and nonwashable but potentially degradable fractions, {{as well as the}} fractional degradation and passage rates, of sugar, starch, neutral detergent fiber, and other carbohydrates. The mRDC term effectively represents the total amount of carbohydrates degraded in the rumen within 2 h after ingestion. Fifty-two lactating Holstein cows (of which 4 were rumen fistulated) were assigned to 4 treatments in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Treatments were fed as a total mixed ration consisting of 25. 4 % corn silage, 23. 1 % grass silage, 11. 6 % grass hay, and 39. 9 % concentrate on a dry matter basis. Differences in mRDC were created by exchanging nonforage neutral detergent fiber-rich ingredients (mainly sugar beet pulp) with starch-rich ingredients (mainly wheat) and by exchanging corn (slowly degradable starch) with wheat (<b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> starch) in the concentrate, resulting in 4 treatments that varied in dietary mRDC level of 167, 181, 194, or 208 g/kg of dry matter. Level of mRDC did not affect dry matter intake. Fat- and protein-corrected milk production and milk fat and lactose yield were greatest at 181 mRDC and decreased with further increases in mRDC. Milk protein yield and concentration increased with increasing mRDC level. Mean rumen pH and diurnal variation in ruminal pH did not differ between treatments. Total daily meal time and number of visits per meal were smaller at 181 and 194 mRDC. Despite milk production responses, increasing dietary mRDC levels, while maintaining net energy and intestinal digestible protein as well as other nutrients at similar levels, did not influence rumen pH parameter estimates and had minor effects on feeding behavior. These results indicate that aggregating <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> carbohydrate content into one term may be a simple way to further improve predictability of production responses in practical diet formulation for lactating dairy cows. </p...|$|E

40|$|Intercropping legume with cereal is an {{extensively}} applied planting {{pattern in}} crop cultivation. However, forage potential and the degradability of harvested mixtures from intercropping system remain unclear. To investigate {{the feasibility of}} applying an intercropping system as a forage supply source to ruminants, two consecutive experiments (experiments 1 and 2) involving a field cultivation trial and a subsequent in vivo degradable experiment were conducted to determine the forage production performance and the ruminally degradable characteristics of a harvested mixture from an alfalfa/corn-rye intercropping system. In experiment 1, the intercropping system was established by alternating alfalfa and corn or rye with a row ratio of 5 : 2. Dry matter (DM) and nutrient yields were determined. In experiment 2, forages harvested from the different treatments were used as feedstuff to identify nutrient degradation kinetics and distribution of components between the <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> (a), potentially degradable (b) and the degradation rate constant (c) of 'b' fraction by in sacco method in Small-Tail Han wether Sheep. The intercropping system of alfalfa and corn-rye provided higher forage production performance with net increases of 9. 52 % and 34. 81 % in DM yield, 42. 13 % and 16. 74 % in crude protein (CP) yield, 25. 94 % and 69. 99 % in degradable DM yield, and 16. 96 % and 5. 50 % in degradable CP yield than rotation and alfalfa sole cropping systems, respectively. In addition, the harvest mixture from intercropping system also had greater 'a' fraction, 'b' fraction, 'c' values, and effective degradability (E value) of DM and CP than corn or rye hay harvested from rotation system. After 48 -h exposure to rumen microbes, intercropping harvest materials were degraded to a higher extent than separately degraded crop stems from the sole system as indicated by visual microscopic examination with more tissues disappeared.

40|$|High-production {{ruminants}} {{are commonly}} fed maize silage, which makes accurate evaluation of its nutritive value a key economic issue. However, {{evaluations of the}} rate and extent of ruminal degradation of starch and cell wall fractions from maize silage carry uncertainty {{due to the lack}} of a standardized method. Here, we investigated the effects of ensiling and sample conditioning on in situ-measured degradation of maize forage. Eight series of maize samples (two hybrids × two maturity stages × two methods of conservation [non-ensiled or fresh and ensiled]) were nylon-bagged in three conditionings: dried and ground to 1  mm (D 1), dried and ground to 4  mm (D 4), frozen and coarse-ground (FG). Disappearance of dry matter (DM), starch and fibre (aNDF) was measured in situ in cow rumen after different incubation times (2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 96  h). Effects of ensiling, sample conditioning, genotype, maturity and their interactions on DM, starch and aNDF degradation were analyzed using the SAS MIXED procedure. Effective dry matter degradability (ED 4 DM) was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) in silage than in fresh maize due to a significantly higher <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> fraction (a) (P< 0. 001). Effective starch degradability (ED 6 Starch) followed the same trend due to a higher silage degradation rate (P< 0. 01). Conversely, effective aNDF degradability (ED 2 aNDF) was lower in silage (P< 0. 001) than fresh maize due to the longer lag-time to degradation (P< 0. 001) and lower hemicellulose ((aNDF − ADF) /aNDF) fraction in silage. Effective DM degradability was higher (P< 0. 001) for D 1 samples than D 4 and FG samples, mainly due to the higher <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> fraction (a) (P< 0. 001) in D 1 than D 4 or FG samples. In relation to high degradation rate, starch degradability was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) in FG than D 1 and D 4 samples, whereas aNDF degradation was lowest in the FG samples. This study shows that ensiling maize increases starch degradability and decreases aNDF degradability compared to fresh plant. Alongside conservation method, fine-grinding samples (as D 1) led to high losses through the pores of the nylon bags, and these losses were correlated with high starch degradability, whereas coarse grinding (as FG) led to low aNDF degradability, probably due to insufficiently reduced particle sizes. In conclusion, using ensiled samples dried and ground to 4  mm (D 4) emerges as the appropriate method for in situ studies of starch-rich forages used as silages...|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of high fiber (NDF, ADF) forages on DM intake, digestibility and production using lactating cattle and steers. In vitro and in situ experiments explored the effect of inoculants, inoculant/enzyme, and various combinations of fibrolytic enzymes on DM disappearance, cell wall composition and changes in Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradation fractions. Cell walls of grasses contain high proportions of polysaccharides of low digestive value. The degradation of these cell walls by the rumen microbes is slow and incomplete especially in high fiber forages. Feed additives or processing that facilitate a faster breakdown of the forage cell walls may also increase the rumen turnover rate and the efficiency of feed utilisation through reduced grain supplementation. In the first experiment (chapter three) the feed intake and milk production potential of two napier grass varieties were evaluated. The possibility of using an all crop LAB inoculant in conserving napier grass as silage, was investigated using a late-cut barley silage crop, characterized by high ADF and NDF as a model. The preceding led to the use of a combined LAB inoculant and a fibrolytic enzyme additive on both early and late-cut barley. We also performed several experiments (chapter six and seven) whose main objective was to increase the DM solubility, reduce cell wall fractions and study the effect of enzymes on Cornell carbohydrate and protein fractions in various alfalfa hay, grass hay, barley silage, oat straw and fenugreek hay and straw. Overall the results from all the experiments showed that treating of high fiber (ADF and NDF) forages with inoculants or inoculant/enzyme products did not significantly alter their ensiling or feeding value. Animal performance (DM intake, digestibility and milk yield and composition) was not significantly improved when animals were fed inoculant or inoculant/enzyme treated forages. The use of combinations of various fibrolytic enzymes (additives) reduced the cell wall fractions ADF and NDF in both legume hay, grass hay, cereal silage and legume and cereal straws. These enzymes enhanced more DM disappearance in temperate grasses than in tropical grasses. Fibrolytic enzymes decreased the <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> protein and unavailable carbohydrate fractions but increased the <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> and the total available carbohydrate fractions. The causes of the inconsistencies in enzyme treatments on barley silage compared to alfalfa hay or other forages was elucidated by significant shifts in the Cornell carbohydrate and protein degradability fractions of treated forages. The use of fibrolytic enzymes as direct-fed additives or in ensiling forages holds the future for improving both the preservation and digestibility of both tropical and temperate high fiber forages.

We also examined the potential allelopathic effect on the two microalgae of culture filtrate of the three macroalga; culture medium filtrate initially exhibited no inhibi-tory effects when first added but inhibitory effects became apparent under semi-continuous addition, which suggested that continuous release of small quantities of <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> allelochemicals from the fresh macroalgal tissue were essential to effec-tively inhibit the growth of the two microalgae.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted using dried leaves of Alchornea cordifolia, Ficus capensis, Manniophytum fulvum and Albizza niopoides. In Experiment 1, dry matter (DM) degradation characteristics were investigated using the in sacco nylon bag technique in West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep, WAD goats and Bunaji steers. In Experiment 2, voluntary intake of the browse forage when fed as supplements to sheep at 0, 10 and 30 percent levels was measured. In Experiment 1, A. cordifolia and M. fulvum {{had significantly higher}} <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> DM fraction than A. niopoides and F. capensis. Averaged across browse species, the extent of DM degradation for sheep (58. 3 percent) {{was significantly higher than}} for goat (47. 7 percent) or cattle (44. 1 percent). Ranking order of browse species for the extent of DM degradation was: F. capensis > A. Cordifolia = M. fulvum = A. niopoides. In Experiment 2, as the level of supplementation increased from 10 to 30 percent, voluntary intake of A. niopoides and M. fulvum increased while voluntary intake of A. cordifolia and F. capensis declined. The results suggest that dried leaves of A. niopoides and M. fulvum are more acceptable to WAD sheep than those of A. cordifolia and F. capensis...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} that mimics washing {{in the in}} situ incubation technique, combined with an in vitro gas and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production technique, was used to verify the assumption that rumen degradation behaviour of material washed out of nylon bags is instantaneous and complete. In a 6 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments with three replicates, fractions of maize, barley, milo, yellow peas, lupins (a mixture of white and spotted lupins) and round-seeded brown faba beans were subjected to an in vitro incubation technique. Fractions were whole (WHO), non-washable (NWF), insoluble washable (ISWF) and soluble washable (SWF). In a manually operated in vitro fermentation system, another 24 samples of the same substrates were fermented for VFA and ammonia analysis. Except in lupins, ISWF in the concentrate ingredients was very rich in starch. SWF was relatively rich in ash, crude protein, soluble sugars, and a residual unknown fraction but contained only a negligible quantity of starch. Thus, the fermentation characteristics of ISWF were more like WHO and NWF than SWF. Total gas production of SWF was considerably lower than the other fractions. A very <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> fraction {{was seen in the}} first phase of degradation of SWF. The pattern of fermentation end-product formation for SWF differed from that of the other fractions. Copyright © 2007 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Nutritive {{value of}} winterfat forage (Eurotia ceratoides) was {{evaluated}} through chemical composition, in situ degradability and in vitro gas production techniques using three permanently fistulated adult Baluchi sheep. The CP, NDF, ADF, Ash, EE and NFC contents of winterfat forage was 19. 4, 54. 5, 41. 6, 9. 0, 1. 4 and 15. 7 %, respectively. The leaves had highest CP (27. 9 %DM) and lowest NDF (40. 7 %DM) levels among {{parts of the}} plant. Degradability characteristics of dry matter were measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hour incubation. The obtained results showed that DM fraction a (<b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable),</b> b (slowly degradable) and c (rate constant degradable) were 23. 2, 30. 5 and 8. 0 %, respectively. The rate of gas production of dry matter was measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hour after incubation. The obtained result showed that cumulative gas production sequentially of whole plant was 7. 6, 15. 8, 24. 6, 31. 6, 42. 2, 62. 09, 75. 2, 83. 6, 96. 52 and 104. 7 ml per each 1 g incubated samples.

40|$|Abstract. Main {{method to}} control insect pest is using {{synthetic}} insecticides, but {{the development of}} insect resistance to this products, the high operational cost, environmental pollution, toxicity to humans and harmful effect on non-target organisms have created the need for developing alternative approaches to control insect pest. Furthermore, the demand for organic crops, especially vegetables for the fresh market, has greatly increased worldwide. The ideal insecticide should control target pests adequately and should be target-specific, <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable,</b> and low in toxicity to humans and other mammals. Plant essential oils could be an alternative source for insect pest control because they constitute {{a rich source of}} bioactive chemicals and are commonly used as flavoring agents in foods. These materials may be applied to food crops shortly before harvest without leaving excessive residues. Moreover, medically safe of these plant derivatives has emphasized also. For these reasons, much effort has been focused on plant essential oils or their constituents as potential sources of insect control agents. In this context, Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family would rank among the most important families of plants. In the last few years more and more studies on the insecticidal properties of essential oils from Apiaceae family have been published and it seemed worthwhile to compile them. The focus of this review lies on the letha...|$|E
40|$|The aerobic {{degradation}} of phytoplankton debris collected in Dutch coastal waters on 2 days in 1991 (15 April and 8 May), representing 2 physiological {{stages of a}} phytoplankton spring bloom dominated by Phaeocystis sp., was studied in batch culture experiments. The bacterial production and the concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were monitored {{over a period of}} 102 d. Bacterial numbers and biomass were followed for 35 d. All experiments showed a rapid metabolic response of bacteria and a sharp decrease in the concentration of POC and DOC during the first days of the experiments. Thereafter bacterial production rates remained constant, and POC and DOC decreased slowly. Apparently, the phytoplankton debris consisted of a labile, <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> fraction and a refractory, slowly degradable fraction. The labile fraction comprised approximately 50 % of the debris, and was degraded with a bacterial carbon conversion efficiency of between 10 and 20 %. There were no indications that antibiotic compounds present in the algal debris inhibited the degradation. Acrylate, a proposed antibiotic compound which was present in the algal debris, was rapidly degraded in a control experiment. The percentage of the material that had been degraded after 102 d was highest in the experiment with material collected in May. It was concluded that during the early phase of the bloom, more refractory compounds are produced...|$|E
40|$|Rumen {{dry matter}} and fibre {{digestibility}} of brown midrib (BMR) sorghum forage silage (SF) {{in comparison to}} corn silage (CS) was determined in situ using 3 fistulated dry cows. The effect of replacing CS with SF on milk production was studied in a change-over design with 58 lactating Italian Friesian cows fed two diets with similar composition. CS had a higher (P< 0. 001) <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> dry matter (DM) fraction than SF (33. 1 vs. 23. 7, respectively), whilst the slowly degradable fraction was not different (46. 3 vs. 48. 7). Overall, the extent of DM rumen degradability was higher for CS. Rumen digestion rate of neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) tended to be higher (P= 0. 06) for SF than CS (3. 08 vs. 2. 49 %/h, respectively); however, effective rumen degradability of fibre was not different between silages. Neither milk yield (kg/d) and 4 %-fat corrected milk nor milk protein and fat contents were affected by treatment. Cows fed CS diet had lower (P< 0. 05) milk urea content compared with their SF counterparts (19. 9 vs. 21. 5 mg/dL,) suggesting a better nitrogen utilization at the rumen level. In conclusion, feeding a BMR sorghum forage resulted in milk yield and quality similar to corn silage. However, to obtain comparable milk production as corn silage, the SF-based diet had to be supplemented with more starch from corn meal...|$|E
40|$|Whole {{cotton seed}} (WCS) {{has become one}} of the major feed {{ingredients}} in TMR for dairy cattle in Korea, and WCS for feed use is mostly imported from abroad. Since this genetically modified oil seed is usually fed to the animal in raw state, its germination ability, if last long, often causes concerns about ecological disturbances. In the process of looking for effective conditions to remove germination ability of WCS this study had the objectives to evaluate the nutritional effects of gamma irradiation at doses of 8, 10 and 12 kGy on changes in nutrient contents, anti-nutritional factors, in vitro digestibility and ruminal degradability. No significant differences were found in proximate analysis of nutrients between raw WCS and gamma irradiated one. Glycine and threonine contents significantly increased when the WCS was exposed to gamma ray as compared to untreated WCS (p< 0. 05). As for fatty acid composition, no significant differences were observed with the irradiation treatment. Free gossypol in WCS was decreased (p< 0. 05) by gamma irradiation treatment. Of the 3 different levels of gamma irradiation, a dose of 12 kGy was found to be the most effective in reducing free gossypol concentration. Results obtained from in situ experiment indicated that gamma irradiation at a dose of 10 kGy significantly (p< 0. 05) lowered rumen degradability of both dry matter and crude protein as compared with raw WCS. However, there were no significant differences in <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> and potentiall...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic {{translation}} {{initiation factor}} 6 (eIF 6), a monomeric protein of about 26 kDa, {{can bind to}} the 60 S ribosomal subunit and prevent its association with the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eIF 6 is encoded by a single-copy essential gene. To understand the function of eIF 6 in yeast cells, we constructed a conditional mutant haploid yeast strain in which a functional but a <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> form of eIF 6 fusion protein was synthesized from a repressible GAL 10 promoter. Depletion of eIF 6 from yeast cells resulted in a selective reduction {{in the level of}} 60 S ribosomal subunits, causing a stoichiometric imbalance in 60 S-to- 40 S subunit ratio and inhibition of the rate of in vivo protein synthesis. Further analysis indicated that eIF 6 is not required for the stability of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Rather, eIF 6 -depleted cells showed defective pre-rRNA processing, resulting in accumulation of 35 S pre-rRNA precursor, formation of a 23 S aberrant pre-rRNA, decreased 20 S pre-rRNA levels, and accumulation of 27 SB pre-rRNA. The defect in the processing of 27 S pre-rRNA resulted in the reduced formation of mature 25 S and 5. 8 S rRNAs relative to 18 S rRNA, which may account for the selective deficit of 60 S ribosomal subunits in these cells. Cell fractionation as well as indirect immunofluorescence studies showed that c-Myc or hemagglutinin epitope-tagged eIF 6 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nuclei of yeast cells...|$|E
40|$|Ripening of {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) polluted dredged sediment {{can be considered as}} a bioremediation technique. Aerobic biodegradation of PAH and TPH was studied in five previously anaerobic-slurried sediments during a 350 -d laboratory incubation experiment. In addition, oxygen penetration and degradation of PAH and TPH were studied in three consolidated (physically ripened) sediments. All experiments were conducted in the laboratory at 30 °C. A double exponential decay model could adequately describe PAH and TPH degradation kinetics in the slurried sediments. First-order degradation rate constants for the <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> fractions (12 ¿ 58 %) were approximately 0. 13 and 0. 058 d¿ 1 for PAH and TPH, respectively, whereas the rate constants for the slowly degradable fractions were approximately 0. 36 × 10 ¿ 3 (PAH) and 0. 66 × 10 ¿ 3 d¿ 1 (TPH). Rate constants for the rapidly and slowly degrading fractions have the same order of magnitude as the mineralization rate constants of the rapidly and slowly mineralizing organic matter (OM) fractions in the sediments. Oxygen uptake by degradation of PAH and TPH was negligible compared to the oxygen uptake by sulfur oxidation and OM mineralization. In consolidated sediments, PAH and TPH degradation was limited to the oxygenated part. Amounts of PAH and TPH that degraded in the oxygenated parts of the consolidated sediments during 21 d of incubation were similar to the amounts that degraded during 21 d in the slurried sediments...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{characterize}} the rapidly labeled hybridizable RNA of L 5178 Y mouse leukemic cells which {{has been shown to}} have similar base sequences when synthesized in two different stages of the cell cycle. The size of rapidly labeled RNA molecules was heterogeneous. For labeling times of 20 min or less, the per cent of hybridization was maximal. With longer labeling times, the per cent of hybridization decreased as radioactivity appeared in long-lived species of low hybridization efficiency; the radioactivity profile resembled the optical density profile in sucrose gradients. The lifetime of newly synthesized hybridizable RNA was studied by pulse labeling exponentially growing cells and then “chasing” with nonradioactive uridine. The per cent of hybridization was studied as a function of chase time. Three RNA groups, which comprised different proportions of rapidly labeled hybridizable RNA, were distinguished. The short-lived group had a half-life of 10 min, much less than the values reported in the literature for messenger RNA of mammalian cells. The half-life of 1 - 1 ½ hr observed for a medium-lived group more closely corresponds to that of messenger RNA. A long-lived group had a half-life of approximately 20 hr. Specific activity measurements during chase indicate the presence of a “pool” of labeled uridine derivatives. The uridine of this pool appears to be nonexchangeable with but dilutable by exogenous uridine. A nontoxic concentration of actinomycin D was added to the chase media in an attempt to block the “pool effect”. A <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> RNA was demonstrable both by specific activity and per cent of hybridization measurements...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} effects of {{different}} colloid plasma substitutes on blood coagulation and postoperative blood loss. Relevant studies {{were obtained from the}} medical literature. Articles were selected that provided data on {{the effects of}} colloids on hemostasis and postoperative blood loss in humans. Studies comparing different colloids were looked for using MEDLINE and by searching through the references of studies as they were collected. Articles were reviewed and relevant data were extracted and partly presented in comparative tables. Dextran, gelatin, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) all can induce a specific decrease of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII:c. Blood coagulation is most impaired by dextran and high molecular weight HES, both associated with increased postoperative blood loss. The effects of HES on blood coagulation have been shown to depend on its molecular weight and rate of elimination. Detrimental effects have been shown for high molecular weight HES. Medium molecular weight (MMW) -HES {{with a high degree of}} substitution (HES 200 / 0. 62) and MMW-HES with high C 2 /C 6 hydroxyethylation ratio (HES 200 / 0. 5 / 13) are slowly degradable and have been shown to impair blood coagulation after repeated administration. <b>Rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> HES 200 / 0. 5 / 6 and gelatin-based plasma expanders appear not to impair hemostasis. However, based on the reviewed literature, all artificial colloids could potentially induce increased bleeding tendency after infusion of very large volumes and especially when given to patients with even mild forms of von Willebrand disease. In those circumstances, crystalloid solutions or alternatives such as plasma or albumin, although associated with other serious complications, could be considere...|$|E
30|$|Figure[*] 2 c {{shows that}} the {{temperatures}} of the composts with added starter culture and control increased quickly to thermophilic temperatures of 53 °C and 51.1 °C, respectively, on day 3 of composting due to the compost load size. The presence of an active microbial community also helps start the degradation process immediately and reduces the particle size (Sundberg and Jönsson 2005). The thermophilic phase of both composts lasted {{for a long period}} of 17 [*]days, probably due to the availability of easily degradable organic matter, energetic compounds (like protein) and large amounts of organic nitrogen in the waste (Pagans et al. 2006). With a large amount of waste, the high thermophilic temperatures worked on breaking down the proteins, fats and complex carbohydrates like cellulose and hemicelluloses. The compost with added starter culture achieved the highest temperature of 54.3 °C on day 8, which is slightly higher and one day earlier than the control (53.8 °C on day 9). The temperature of the mixtures began to decline on day 8 for mixture with starter culture and day 9 for control, probably due to convective loss (Palmisano et al. 1993) and a higher amount of readily degradable carbon. At the end of the process, heat was released progressively, causing the temperature for both mixtures to decrease and tended to meet the ambient temperature. This tendency was found with composting fish offal in reactors (Laos et al. 2002) and composting of green tea waste and rice bran (Khan et al. 2009), which implied that the <b>rapidly</b> <b>degradable</b> organic matter had been reduced (Sundberg and Jönsson 2005). The average temperatures of the compost with added starter culture and the control were not significantly different from the DMRT results.|$|E
