5|$|The team {{wanted the}} theme of the game to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> children; they {{initially}} considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. Although the framework of the story was completed prior to Studio Ghibli's involvement with the game, they still took part in many discussions regarding some ideas, including the game's final scenes.|$|E
5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on the ceiling, Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic {{presidential nomination}} in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, {{he did not}} announce his support, fearing that his message might not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E

5|$|Entering the {{hyperspace}} pocket, {{the group}} find the Elsa and investigate the area, encountering both Albedo and Virgil and learning that the Vessels of Anima powering their E.S. mecha {{are key to}} the Testaments' plans. They are then confronted by Mantel—who reveals himself as the Red Testament—and T-elos. T-elos almost kills KOS-MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to be a world within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS-MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall; her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U-TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered nearly everyone in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the Zohar, summoning the Gnosis and awakening U-DO; it was only Mizrahi's self-sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febronia—who tended {{him when he was}} injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her death—and follows her into the afterlife. The Red Testament also appears, revealing his true identity as Kevin and asking Shion to join him.|$|E
25|$|This {{sentiment}} did <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> {{the leadership}} of General Secretary Leslie Morris, who viewed the sentiments of the Popular Front {{in a much more}} favourable light than would be seen under {{the leadership of}} William Kashtan; it was under the stifling leadership of Kashtan that Ryerson made his final break with the CPC.|$|E
25|$|Owen Jones (15 February 1809 – 19 April 1874) was an English-born Welsh architect. A {{versatile}} {{architect and}} designer, {{he was also}} one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century.

He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Gay men {{who prefer}} anal sex may {{view it as}} their version of {{intercourse}} and a natural expression of intimacy {{that is capable of}} providing pleasure. The notion that it might <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> gay men with the same emotional significance that vaginal sex resonates with heterosexuals has also been considered. Some {{men who have sex with}} men, however, believe that being a receptive partner during anal sex questions their masculinity.|$|E
25|$|Candace Morales, a {{graduate}} student pursuing a Masters of Science in Education while concentrating in Reading, proposes that in a curriculum that utilizes Bless Me Ultima {{as a piece of}} multicultural literature, it must be timed appropriately. Specifically, she suggests teaching it to middle schoolers so that they have a diverse lens (that of a Chicano/a culture) to view their own development; to Morales, Antonio’s own pursuit of “knowledge, truth, and personal identity” will <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the students as well.|$|E

50|$|A {{qualitative}} {{interpretation of}} the wave resistance plot is that a displacement hull <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> a wave that has a crest near its bow and a trough near its stern, because the water is pushed away at the bow and pulled back at the stern. A planing hull simply pushed down on the water under it, so it <b>resonates</b> <b>with</b> a wave that has a trough under it, which has about twice the length and therefore four times the speed.|$|R
25|$|After 's {{ascension}} in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message {{began to}} <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured {{an invitation to}} the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.|$|E
25|$|Colombo is {{a charter}} city, with a Mayor Council form of {{government}}. Colombo's {{mayor and the}} council members are elected through local government elections held once in five years. For the past 50 years the city had been ruled by the United National Party (UNP), a right leaning party, whose business friendly policies <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the population of Colombo. However the UNP nomination list for the 2006 Municipal elections was rejected, and an Independent Group supported by the UNP won the elections. Uvais Mohamed Imitiyas was subsequently appointed Mayor of Colombo.|$|E
25|$|All {{microwave}} generators {{of the era}} worked along similar principles; electrons {{were pulled}} off a cathode towards an anode {{at the far end}} of a tube. Along the way, they passed one or more resonators, essentially hollow copper rings with a slit cut along the inner edge. As the electrons passed the slit, they caused the resonator to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> radio energy, which could be tapped off as a signal. The frequency could be adjusted by controlling the speed of the electrons (via the applied voltage) or by changing the dimensions of the resonator.|$|E

25|$|In August, 1929, the Chorschüler der evangelisch-reformierten Kirche Basel-Stadt ("Choir {{students}} of the Protestant Church of Basel-City"), which consisted of former choirboys whose voices had changed, was founded. The expansion of the choir to include changed voices had already been considered by January 1928, but the proposal did not <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> the older students; the consistory also refused {{it because of the}} unintentional competition it would create with the adult community and church choirs. Nevertheless, the choir students appeared at Hamm's Free Organ Recital in December, 1928, but the group was ultimately unable to survive (for the time being).|$|E
25|$|Smilin' Through (1941) was MacDonald's next Technicolor project. This 1919 stage play {{had been}} filmed {{a number of}} times. Its theme of reunion with {{deceased}} loved ones was enormously popular after the devastation of World War I, and MGM reasoned that it should <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> filmgoers during World War II. MacDonald played a dual role—Moonyean, a Victorian girl accidentally murdered by a jealous lover, and Kathleen, her niece, {{who falls in love}} with the son of the murderer. The original co-stars, James Stewart and Robert Taylor, dropped out to help in the military effort and were replaced by Brian Aherne and Gene Raymond.|$|E
25|$|Occupy Mexico did {{not achieve}} {{the level of}} {{popularity}} it gained in other areas. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} Mexico's Occupy protesters, which were focused on poverty and workers' rights, failed to <b>resonate</b> <b>with</b> a public enthralled by the violence of the Mexican Drug War. In contrast, an anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia during the time that the Occupy protests occurred, drew thousands onto the streets of Mexico City. The Occupy Movement was almost entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians. By late January 2012, most of the tents were empty and only a few protesters remained outside the Stock Exchange.|$|E
