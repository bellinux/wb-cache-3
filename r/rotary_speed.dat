By the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed: a second equatorial band was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was broken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into the planet Uranus; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun indicates, of course, the <b>rotary</b> <b>speed</b> of that Sun’s equatorial surface at the moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously explained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken up, settled into a moon:—three moons, at different epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings.|$|E

The available constant rate mechanical fertilizer spreaders on oil palm plantation {{were found to be}} susceptible to excessive fertilizer application. On the other hand, Variable Rate Technology (VRT) could be used to forestall the hazards of excessive fertilizer application. However, full knowledge of the operational variables of the metering system of a VRT applicator has become inevitable for proper utilization of this technology.

30|$|In CFD simulations, Bilgesu et al. (2002, 2007) {{were one}} of the first {{researchers}} to analyze cuttings transport parameters using CFD. The simulations show drillpipe rotation can improve the cuttings transport, and the effect is more pronounced for smaller particle size. Mishra (2007) found that hole cleaning efficiency is improved more significantly for small cuttings than for large cuttings as pipe rotation is increased, and pipe rotation at a fixed velocity can decrease pressure loss. Wang et al. (2009) indicated the solid flow becomes favorable, and the solid volume is reduced with the increase of <b>rotary</b> <b>speeds.</b> The correlation was also developed to estimate cuttings bed height.

40|$|Rotary {{drilling}} with roller {{cone bit}} is {{often accompanied by}} wide fluctuations of the weight on bit (WOB). In certain cases the WOB periodically reduces to null.

The present study models the interaction among the lift-off of the bit, the WOB variation, and the modulation of the amplitude of the lobes on the formation surface. The analytical model is used to obtain numerical results for a specific drillstring. From these results it is inferred that the <b>rotary</b> <b>speeds</b> corresponding to the axial resonant frequencies of the system, determined from {{the functions of the}} driving point mobility and impedance at the bit, are critical regarding the wide fluctuations of the WOB.

50|$|For {{the design}} engineer, the visible air gap that the sensor {{ends up with}} is {{primarily}} {{the result of the}} specific machine design, but is subject to whatever constraints are needed to register the <b>rotary</b> <b>speed.</b> If this means that the possible air gap has to lie within a very small range, then this will also restrict the mechanical tolerances of the motor housing and target wheels to prevent signal dropouts during operation. This means that in practice there may be problems, particularly with smaller pitched target wheels of module m = 1 and disadvantageous combinations of tolerances and extreme temperatures. From {{the point of view of}} the motor manufacturer, and even more so the operator, it is therefore better to look for speed sensors with a wider range of air gap.|$|E
50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its <b>rotary</b> <b>speed.</b> The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|E
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel slide protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel slide protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of <b>rotary</b> <b>speed</b> sensors that are used for wheel slide protection is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the wheel slide protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel slide protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|E

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the dynamics of}} a multistage rotary vane engine is given in terms of a simplified model for combustion driving torques, power dissipation, and torque transmission. Torque transmission is effected by conjugate gear pairs attached to each unit of the engine. An argument for the design of such pairs is presented so that unwanted torque fluctuations in a flywheel attached to a member of the pair can be significantly attenuated. It is suggested that a variant of simple Cosserat dynamics offers a useful modelling tool for discussing the complex interaction between interacting gear teeth. A quasi-stationary analysis is used to place bounds of a particular choice of conjugate gear coupling in the presence of such interactions. It is concluded that a multistage rotary vane engine with at least two units can be usefully coupled to a single flywheel via a well-defined conjugate gear system that attenuates unwanted torque fluctuations over a broad range of <b>rotary</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm).

In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected."

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was later}} described in Technica curiosa sive mirabilia artis (1664) by Gaspar Schott, who mistakenly claimed {{that it was}} a constant-velocity joint. Shortly afterwards, between 1667 and 1675, Robert Hooke analysed the joint and found that its speed of rotation was nonuniform, but that this property could be used to track the motion of the shadow on the face of a sundial. In fact, the component of the equation of time which accounts for the tilt of the equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic is entirely analogous to the mathematical description of the universal joint. The first recorded use of the term universal joint for this device was by Hooke in 1676, in his book Helioscopes. He published a description in 1678, resulting {{in the use of the}} term Hooke's joint in the English-speaking world. In 1683, Hooke proposed a solution to the nonuniform <b>rotary</b> <b>speed</b> of the universal joint: a pair of Hooke's joints 90° out of phase at either end of an intermediate shaft, an arrangement that is now known as a type of constant-velocity joint. Christopher Polhem of Sweden later re-invented the universal joint, giving rise to the name Polhemsknut in Swedish.|$|E
