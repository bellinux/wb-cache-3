25|$|The {{church has}} held congresses in 1951, 1956 and {{every four years}} since 1986. After Bochian, who retired in 1990, Emil Bulgar was {{president}} until 1994, when he was succeeded by Pavel <b>Riviş</b> Tipei, the present incumbent. Each congress, made up of community representatives and other church notables, elects a 21-member Church Council and a 7-member Executive Board, including the president. Pastors are trained in Bucharest at the Pentecostal Theological Institute and at the Betania Pentecostal Theological Faculty in Arad; the church also has three high school-level seminaries, two post-secondary schools, and schools for younger children. The church's first magazine, Glasul Adevărului ("The Voice of Truth"), was printed in Brăila in 1929; its name was changed to Cuvântul Adevărului ("The Word of Truth") two months later. Banned in 1937, it was revived as Buletinul Cultului Penticostal ("Newsletter of the Pentecostal Cult") in 1953 and restored to its interwar name in 1990. The church now has several other publications {{as well as a}} presence on radio, television and the Internet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story of}} Theophilus {{was one of}} the most popular written in any language. It {{describes}} how the young and ambitious archdeacon Theophilus, raised by his uncle in sixth century Antioch, is overcome by disappointment about his lack of promotion in the church. He consults a Jewish sorcerer and is taken to a meeting of devils. Theophilus renounces God in a written document and joins hands with Satan. He gains a position of high influence, and is happy with his power until he begins to repent the sin he has committed. Theophilus requests help from the Virgin Mary in order to reverse his contract with the Devil, and ultimately good trumps evil, and the contract is terminated. [...] Hrotsvitha supplements the story with her description of Theophilus in The Seven Arts:- De sophiae <b>rivis</b> septeno fonte manantis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMain task of this {{research}} is to make suggestions for further research on land cover change and to use land cover change analysis as indicator of micro-climate change in example of Lithuanian Baltic Sea coastal zone. Coastal zones are among those areas that have been subject to intense human pressure due to their natural resources. As a transitional zone, between land and sea, coastal zones hold some of the most valuable and productive habitats on earth. Huge amounts of energy circulate in these zones, which attracts all sort of human interest and activities (<b>Rivis</b> et al, 2016; Schlacher et al., 2014; Bicknell et al., Sperb et al., 2006). A large number of population lives near the coastal zone. Analysis on the land use and land cover change as a consequence on human livelihoods {{as well as on the}} environment is a matter of concern for sustainable development and management of natural resources. The Baltic Sea and coast is one of the most vital natural resources of Lithuania. Only a small part of the Baltic Sea coast belongs to Lithuania (~ 91 km.) and almost half of it belongs to the National park area and Natura 2000 or other prohibited area (State Cadastre of Protected Areas, 2014). Retrospective analysis of land cover dynamics and its driving force has been undertaken using satellite images of Landsat 5 TM year 1989, Landsat 5 TM year 2000 and Landsat 8 TM year 2014 and 2016 with 30 m spatial resolution of Lithuanian Western part. Analysis of building’s geodatabase (year 1997 and 2016) applied on orthophoto of Lithuanian Western part was made in order to identify socio-economic change and its difference’s impact to nowadays land cover change. In detail statistical, mathematical analysis of ongoing processes have been made using national statistical data and in field trips of most areas of interest. Results showed that during research period landscapes in terms of agriculture, urbanization and human behavior had changed the most. Further research will be carried out in terms of micro-climate change evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Disclosure of {{personal}} distress to others {{is linked to}} increased trust and intimacy between persons {{as well as to}} important psychological benefits for the individual such as reductions in stress and heightened life satisfaction (Laurenceau, Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998; Ward, Doherty, & Moran, 2007). Unfortunately, individuals who fear receiving compassion and expect negative consequences from self-disclosure may conceal their feelings, reducing their ability to garner support from others when needed. The current study aimed to determine whether, compared to two control conditions, inducing a self-compassionate mindset regarding a past negative experience would decrease perceived risks of disclosure and increase disclosure of the experience, especially among those high in fears of receiving compassion. Eighty-five female undergraduate students completed the Fears of Receiving Compassion scale (Gilbert, McEwan, Matos, & <b>Rivis,</b> 2011) online, and were subsequently invited into the lab and asked to recall a past negative experience. After completing measures of positive and negative affect, they were randomly assigned to write about their negative experience in one of three ways: a self-compassionate way, a self-esteem enhancing way, or a non-directive way (control condition). Participants completed post-manipulation affect measures, and were then informed they would have the chance to disclose their negative experience to another participant, in writing first and then in person. Participants rated how risky the disclosure felt, and then wrote a letter to another participant they presumed they would be meeting. Results indicated that writing about one’s negative experience self-compassionately resulted in lower negative affect and shame, as well as greater calm and relaxed feelings as compared to the control condition. For participants in the self-esteem condition, changes on these variables were either equivalent to or marginally different from controls. Although participants in the three conditions did not differ in perceived risks of disclosure or degree of disclosure within their letters, a significant condition by fears of receiving compassion interaction emerged, where there was a positive relationship between fears of receiving compassion and perceived risk of disclosure for participants in the self-esteem and control conditions, but no such relationship in the self-compassion condition. Findings are the first to indicate that self-compassion may reduce the perceived risk of disclosure for individuals who tend to expect negative consequences from disclosure. Implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|E
