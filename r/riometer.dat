5000|$|A <b>riometer</b> (commonly {{relative}} ionospheric opacity meter, although originally: Relative Ionospheric Opacity Meter for Extra-Terrestrial Emissions of Radio noise) is {{an instrument}} used {{to quantify the}} amount of electromagnetic-wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere. As the name implies, a <b>riometer</b> measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the <b>riometer</b> signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that some absorption events measured on <b>riometers</b> are actually due to backscatter of cosmic radio noise by E-region plasma waves (D'Angelo, 1976, 1978; D'Angelo and Mehta, 1980).

30|$|The PWING {{project was}} started in April 2016. The five types of instruments, i.e., all-sky airglow/aurora imagers, {{induction}} magnetometers, <b>riometers,</b> loop antennas, and EMCCD cameras were deployed mostly during the fiscal year of 2016 (April 2016 – March 2017) and started their automatic operation by March 22, 2017, except for the instruments at Nain, and all-sky imagers, <b>riometers,</b> and loop antennas at two Russian stations. The all-sky imagers measure invisible auroral/airglow emissions which correspond to electron and ion precipitations at low to middle energy ranges from eV to 10  keV. The <b>riometers</b> measure electron precipitation at a high energy range of ~  30 – 100  keV. The EMCCD cameras provide fast auroral images with a sampling rate of 100  Hz. The induction magnetometers measure Pc 1 /EMIC waves at frequencies {{of the order of}} Hz, which are related to the ion cyclotron instabilities. The loop antennas measure magnetospheric ELF/VLF emissions at frequencies of kHz, which are related to electron cyclotron instabilities.

At times aurorae resulted in complete failure of long distance radio communication to planes in the Arctic - a matter of considerable concern to the US Air Force at a time of tension with the Soviet Union. Riometers are still used today for ionospheric research and are typically located in polar and sub-polar areas.|$|E
50|$|Initially, riometers were single, wide-beam {{detectors}} and measured the cosmic noise absorption (CNA). Multi-beam riometers {{have also been}} developed, which have multiple narrow beams, typically formed by a Butler matrix on a phased antenna array. Each beam forms its own <b>riometer</b> and has its own quiet-day curve determination. These individual beams form pixels on the sky allowing simple images of cosmic noise absorption to be formed. More recently, interferometry {{has been used to}} provide all-sky, spatially-continuous imaging of CNA. It is also possible to use riometers to observe multiple frequencies (typically in the range 25-40 MHz). An inverse problem technique {{can be applied to the}} measurements to ascertain not just the absorption, but a model of the electron content as a function of sight distance.|$|E

In 1970 a new facility was built: the LABEL laboratory (LAboratory BELgrano), dedicated to further study of these phenomena. It was located some 250 m from the main house and other dependencies of the base, and it housed valuable scientific instruments for aurora australis observations, This activity ran across the penumbra and total darkness periods, from 15 March to 10 October. A tower equipped with all-sky cameras photographed the whole celestial hemisphere every minute in order to compose a continuous record of aurorae evolution.

However, the combination of two imaging <b>riometers</b> with overlapping beams allows {{an estimate of the}} height of peak CNA and so the associated energy to be made. We examine two methods for estimating the height of CNA using data from two imaging <b>riometers</b> in northern Fennoscandia; a 3 -D reconstruction of CNA using Occam's inversion and a technique based upon the triangulation of discrete absorption structures are developed. We compare these two methods with the results from a previously published technique. It is found that for the case studies and test phantoms the height triangulation and 3 -D reconstruction offer improvement over previous methods. These techniques are tested by comparison with data from the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar. Observations show good correlation between the estimates of peak height of CNA from EISCAT and from the triangulation and 3 -D reconstruction methods for this case. Three case studies are examined in detail, a slowly varying absorption, afternoon spike, and evening absorption spike event. Estimates of the characteristic energy are made. The substorm event had a characteristic energy of ∼ 5 keV, whereas the characteristic energy for the morning event was 17 – 20 keV. Analyses indicate the afternoon spike event having characteristic energy greater than 100 keV...|$|R

30|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} <b>riometer</b> absorption and geomagnetic variations (black and red lines) {{in the morning}} sector (Fig.  3) and in the post-noon sector (Fig.  8) at sites where both instruments are available demonstrates that the onset of energetic electron precipitation responsible for <b>riometer</b> bursts nearly coincides {{with the onset of}} PI and is slightly ahead (~ 1  min) of the MI. The peaks of the <b>riometer</b> absorption nearly coincide with the MI. In the night sector (TIX), the PI also coincides with the onset of the <b>riometer</b> absorption increase. The delay between the absorption onset and MI may signify either that the PI causes electron acceleration in the upper ionosphere or that the MI stimulates electron pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone in the equatorial plane. In the latter case, a time delay between the geomagnetic and <b>riometer</b> responses is caused by the difference of energetic (> 30  keV) electron velocity and Alfven velocity upon the propagation along a field line.|$|E

We find that roughly 95 % of the <b>riometer</b> pulsations occurred in the morning sector compared to 70 % in the magnetometer. Given a magnetometer pulsation at Gillam in the morning sector, there is a 70 % chance of there being a corresponding <b>riometer</b> pulsation. The morning sector probabilities at Rankin (geomagnetic (PACE) latitude 74 °) and Pinawa (61 °) are 3 % and 5 %, respectively. These statistics suggest there is a localized region in the pre-noon magnetosphere where Pc 5 band ULF activity can modulate high energy electron precipitation. We also find that <b>riometer</b> pulsations display a K p selection towards mid (i. e. 3 ? 4) activity levels which mimics the product of the K p dependence of high-energy electron fluxes on the dawn side (from CRRES) and all magnetic Pc 5 activity. A superposed epoch analysis revealed that the elevated electron flux needed to produce a <b>riometer</b> pulsation is most likely provided by substorm injections on the nightside. We also find that the amplitude of modulated precipitation correlates well with the product of the background absorption and the magnetic pulsation amplitude, again leading to the idea that a <b>riometer</b> pulsation needs both favorable magnetospheric electron flux conditions and large enough magnetic Pc 5 wave activity. We further separate our pulsations into field line resonances (FLRs), and non-field line resonances (non-FLRs), as identified in the Baker et al. (2003) survey. We find that FLRs are more efficient at modulating particle precipitation, and non-FLRs display an amplitude cutoff below which they do not interact with the high energy electron population. We conclude that the high energy electron precipitation associated with Pc 5 pulsations is caused by pitch angle scattering (diffusion) rather than parallel acceleration. We suggest two future studies that are natural extensions of this one. Keywords. Energetic Particles/Precipitating; Wave-Particle Interactions; Auroral Phenomen...|$|E

Conjugate observations between the ERG satellite and multi-point ground-based network are important for a comprehensive understanding of geospace because the ground-based network observations provide the data at different MLTs and invariant latitudes (Shiokawa et al. 2017). For example, Super Dual Aurora Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars provide the data for convection electric fields and ULF pulsations at different MLTs and latitudes. Magnetometer networks provide temporal-spatial distributions of EMIC (Pc 1) and Pc 3 –Pc 5 ULF waves as well as ionospheric currents. Very low frequency (VLF)/extremely low frequency (ELF) receivers observe the chorus/hiss waves. The optical imagers observe electron and proton auroras, which indicate precipitations of electrons and ions from a few hundred eV to a few tens of keV. <b>Riometers</b> observe cosmic noise absorption, which is a manifestation of tens of keV electron precipitations.

In the heart of the digital imaging <b>riometer</b> is a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which is used for the digital signal processing and digital beam forming, completely replacing the analog Butler matrices which have been used in previous designs. The reconfigurable nature of the FPGA has been exploited to produce tools for remote system testing and diagnosis which have proven extremely useful for operation in remote locations such as the Arctic and Antarctic. Different FPGA programs enable different instrument configurations, including a 4 × 4 antenna filled array (producing 4 × 4 beams), an 8 × 8 antenna filled array (producing 7 × 7 beams), and a Mills cross system utilizing 63 antennas producing 556 usable beams. The concept of using a Mills cross antenna array for riometry has been successfully demonstrated for the first time. The digital beam forming has been validated by comparing the received signal power from cosmic radio sources with results predicted from the theoretical beam radiation pattern. The performances of four digital imaging <b>riometer</b> systems are compared against each other and a traditional imaging <b>riometer</b> utilizing analog Butler matrices.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction of}} Alfven waves with the auroral acceleration region (AAR). The AAR is character-ized by an electric potential drop that supports a field-aligned upward current and the acceleration of precipitating electrons. An Alfven wave incident on the AAR from the magnetosphere partially reflects back and partially pen-etrates into the AAR. The rate of wave reflection/transmission {{is estimated to be}} critically dependent on the wave transverse scale. Magnetospheric Alfven waves penetrating into the AAR can produce oscillatory variations of the field-aligned potential drop, thus constituting a new mechanism of ULF modulation of electron acceleration. Esti-mates of the potential drop modulation by Alfven waves are provided within the “thin ” AAR approximation, which is valid {{for a wide range of}} wave and plasma parameters. The proposed mechanism will produce nearly simulta-neous ULF magnetic and riometric variations at auroral latitudes. Occurrence of the AAR-associated resonator in the auroral topside ionosphere between the bottom boundary of the AAR and the E-layer may cause oscillatory frequency dependence of electron acceleration modulations in the range around fractions of a Hz. Another feature of the mechanism considered is the critical dependence of the ratio between the magnetic and riometric signals on the transverse scale of the disturbance.

Imaging riometers have traditionally been used for studying energetic electron precipitation into the D region and have also recently been used to characterize mesospheric gravity waves.

The {{case study}} (November 24, 2006) of {{simultaneous}} multi-points Scandinavian observations of pulsating energetic electron precipitation (<b>riometer</b> absorption), Pc 5 range ULF geomagnetic pulsations {{as well as}} the burst of morning whistler-mode chorus emissions have been analysed and compared with the solar wind conditions. It was found that during the VLF chorus burst development (04 - 05 UT) there were observed two stable maxima (near 2 mHz and at 3 - 4 mHz) in geomagnetic pulsations spectra, however, the <b>riometer</b> pulsations spectra were time dependent. In the first half-hour interval, the maximum of pulsating <b>riometer</b> absorption coincided with 3 - 4 mHz geomagnetic pulsation maximum, but in the following half-hour interval- with 2 mHz ULF maximum. The spectra of the chorus intensity variations were relatively similar to the <b>riometer</b> ones. In the first discussed time interval, the solar wind dynamic pressure variations were turbulent in the large frequency range of ~ 1. 5 – 4. 0 mHz. However, in the second interval they demonstrated the quasi-monochromatic oscillations with the clear maximum at 2. 0 mHz. The same maximum was observed in the <b>riometer</b> and geomagnetic pulsation, and in VLF chorus total intensity variations. We interpret that as the VLF wave grow rate modulation by the compressional Pc 5 ULF waves exiting in the magnetosphere due to solar wind pressure oscillations.

40|$|Measurements from {{ground-based}} magnetometers and <b>riometers</b> at auroral latitudes {{have demonstrated}} that energetic (~ 30 - 300 keV) electron precipitation can be modulated {{in the presence of}} magnetic field oscillations at ultra-low frequencies. It has previously been proposed that an ultra-low frequency (ULF) wave would modulate field and plasma properties near the equatorial plane, thus modifying the growth rates of whistler-mode waves. In turn, the resulting whistler-mode waves would mediate the pitch-angle scattering of electrons resulting in ionospheric precipitation. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis by quantifying the changes to the linear growth rate expected due to a slow change in the local magnetic field strength for parameters typical of the equatorial region around 6. 6 RE radial distance. To constrain our study, we determine the largest possible ULF wave amplitudes from measurements of the magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit. Using nearly ten years of observations from two satellites, we demonstrate that the variation in magnetic field strength due to oscillations at 2 mHz does not exceed ± 10 % of the background field. Modifications to the plasma density and temperature anisotropy are estimated using idealised models. For low temperature anisotropy, there is little change in the whistler-mode growth rates even for the largest ULF wave amplitude. Only for large temperature anisotropies can whistler-mode growth rates be modulated sufficiently to account for the changes in electron precipitation measured by <b>riometers</b> at auroral latitudes...|$|R
