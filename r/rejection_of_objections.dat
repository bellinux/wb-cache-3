40|$|The Danish general {{election}} in 2001 changed {{the landscape of}} Danish politics profoundly. The elections mark the culmination of Anders Fogh Rasmussen’s chairmanship of Venstre - Denmark’s Liberal Party. Venstre won government and Anders Fogh Rasmussen became Prime Minister. The elections were won on a new pragmatic platform that was dissimilar to the Liberalist platform under former chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. With inspiration from corporate branding literature {{we have in this}} thesis analysed how Venstre has managed to change its political brand under Anders Fogh Rasmussens leadership. The thesis analyses the strategic vision, organisation culture, profiling and image of Venstre. We conclude that Venstre has been able to change its political brand due to a number of reasons. Firstly because of a clear strategic vision carried out with the use of strategic instruments, like ‘contract politics’ and ‘value politics’ to implement it. Secondly because of a well prepared launch of the strategic vision within the organisation. The organisation has supported the changes not least driven by a desire for the power of government. Thirdly because of a clear and targeted profiling of the new strategic vision. A profiling that has taken the rising importance of the media in to account. Fourthly because of the voters’ willingness to embrace the ‘new’ Anders Fogh Rasmussen and accept him as just a competent caretaker of the Danish welfare state, as the Social Democrats he inherited it from. Fifthly because of Anders Fogh Rasmussen’s <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>objections</b> to the new political course, that has served to underpin the strategic vision and the new political brand...|$|R

40|$|Evolution, and how {{to teach}} it, {{is perhaps the most}} {{controversial}} topic in American schools today. Biologists attest to the ubiquity of evolution, and assert that evolutionary explanations undergird their entire science and are of fundamental import. Yet, according to recent surveys (Gallup, 2008), 44 % of Americans say they do not accept evolution in any form, and a shockingly small number, only 14 %, say they believe in naturalistic evolution. A century and a half after the publication of the Origin of Species, there remains considerable cultural resistance to teaching this “controversial ” subject in schools. Many explanations have been proffered for this disconnect between scientific consensus and citizen acceptance. Prominent among these explanations is that conflict with religious belief is the principal cause <b>of</b> <b>objections</b> to evolution (Numbers, 1992; Scott & Branch, 2003; Witham, 2002). While acknowledging the importance <b>of</b> religious <b>objections,</b> this chapter proceeds from the assumption that another major cause <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> evolution is the cognitive difficulty of understanding the evolutionary process.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze factors related to <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and {{behaviors}} directed towards others in nursing home residents with dementia. Methods: The relationship of lack of understanding, depression, psychosis and pain with <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and behaviors directed towards others was explored using four assessments from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) within a period of 15 months on 1, 101 residents with dementia in Dutch nursing homes. Presence of depressive symptoms was ascertained using a validated MDS scale, and presence of lack <b>of</b> understanding, <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care, psychosis and pain through the individual MDS items. A structural equation modeling approach and latent growth models were used to investigate the longitudinal relationship between changes in <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and physical or verbal behaviors directed towards others, and changes in lack of understanding, pain, depression and psychotic symptoms. Results: Changes in lack of understanding predicted changes in <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care, and there was also a relationship between changes in depression and <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Changes of behaviors directed towards others were related to changes in lack of understanding and depression. Pain and behaviors directed towards others were unrelated, and psychosis was rather stable throughout. A mediation model suggested that the relationship of lack of understanding with behaviors directed towards others was mediated by <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Conclusion: These results indicate that lack of understanding and depression are important factors in development <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care and behaviors directed towards others. The relationship between lack of understanding and behaviors directed towards others is mediated by <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> care. Improvement in communication between residents and caregivers, and perhaps also effective treatment of depression may prevent or ameliorate these behaviors directed towards others...|$|R

40|$|Although {{nearly all}} domain {{experts agree that}} human CO 2 {{emissions}} are altering the world’s climate, segments of the public remain unconvinced by the scientific evidence.

We report a survey (N> 1100) of climate blog users to identify the variables underlying acceptance and <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> climate science.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} assessment {{focusing on the}} <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> eight N-nitrosamines by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was conducted for planned potable water recycling applications. The effects of feed solution characteristics, operating conditions, fouling, chemical cleaning and membrane characteristics on the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines were first examined at laboratory scale. Field sampling campaigns were carried out at full-scale water recycling plants to provide longitudinal and spatial insights to the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines. For the prediction <b>of</b> the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines by spiral-wound RO membrane systems, a mathematical model was developed based on the irreversible thermodynamic principle and hydrodynamic calculation. The model was validated with the results obtained from a pilot-scale RO system. The results reported here indicate that the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines by a given membrane increased {{in the order of}} increasing molecular weight, suggesting that steric hindrance was a dominating <b>rejection</b> mechanism <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines. The results also indicate that pH, ionic strength, and temperature of the feed solution can exert an influence on the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and in some cases other N-nitrosamines. An increase in the feed temperature led to a significant decrease in the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> all N-nitrosamines and the impact was more pronounced for the small molecular weight N-nitrosamines. In general, the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines increased when the membranes were fouled by tertiary effluent. The <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> low molecular weight N-nitrosamines was most affected by membrane fouling. From the results reported here, it appears that low molecular weight foulants present in the tertiary effluent can restrict the solute pathway within the active skin layer of membranes, resulting in the observed increase <b>of</b> solute <b>rejection.</b> Caustic chemical cleaning resulted in an increase in membrane permeability but caused a notable decrease in the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines. The impact of caustic cleaning was not permanent and could be significantly reduced by a subsequent acidic cleaning step. In general, the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> NDMA and N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA) increased with decreasing membrane permeability. The impact of membrane permeability became less important for higher molecular weight N-nitrosamines. In addition to the mean free-volume hole-radius of RO membranes which was measured by the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), other membrane parameters and properties such as the free-volume hole-radius distribution and thickness of the active skin layer can also play a role in governing the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> small and uncharged solutes by RO membranes. During the sampling campaigns at three full-scale water recycling plants, NDMA was detected in all RO feed samples varying between 7 and 32 ng/L. Overall <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> NDMA among the three RO systems varied widely from 4 to 47 %. Data presented here suggest that the feed temperature can influence <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> NDMA. A considerable variation in NDMA rejection across the three RO stages (14 - 78 %) was also observed. Overall N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) rejections were consistently high ranging from 81 to 84 %. On the other hand, overall <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) varied from negligible to 53 %, which was considerably lower than values reported in previous laboratory-scale studies. The developed model was able to accurately describe the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> N-nitrosamines under a range of permeate flux and system recovery conditions. The modelled Nnitrosamine rejections were in good agreement with values obtained experimentally using a pilot-scale RO filtration system. The modelling results also revealed that an increase in recovery caused a decrease in the <b>rejection</b> <b>of</b> these N-nitrosamines, which is consistent with the experimental results. Further modelling investigations suggested that NDMA rejection by a spiral-wound system can drop from 49 to 35 % when the overall recovery increased from 10 to 50 %. The model developed from this study can be a useful tool for water utilities and regulators for system design and evaluating the removal of N-nitrosamines by RO membranes...|$|R
