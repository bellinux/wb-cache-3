He not only understood but intensely enjoyed an artist who imitated cocks crowing and pigs squeaking. But the people who pretended that they were somebody else, and that the painted picture behind them was real, bewildered him. In his presence I realized how very sophisticated the natural man has to become before the conventions of the theatre can be easily acceptable, or the purpose of the drama obvious to him.|$|E

40|$|When a {{material}} {{is exposed to}} cavitation for a long time, the surface is eroded like a sponge, {{which is one of}} the evidences of cavitation damage. However, the mechanism of the spongelike surface formation remains unclear. A magnesium oxide single crystal is useful to understand the fundamental mechanisms of cavitation erosion. In this study, magnesium oxide single crystal (100) surfaces were polished with four grades of emery paper to prepare test specimens. The test specimens were exposed to vibratory cavitation. Many dislocation rows with various lengths which intersect the specimen surface at 45 degrees were observed uniformly on a (010) or (001) cross section for an as-cleaved specimen. On the other hand, the dense dislocation rows were localized at the roots of surface irregularity for <b>rough</b> <b>specimens.</b> The depht of surface roughness increases with exposure time and the acceleration is higher for <b>rougher</b> <b>specimens.</b> It is concluded that the dense dislocation rows initiated at the roots of irregular surface is responsible for the growth of the spongelike eroded surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of measurement of the thickness of uniform thin films on solid substrates by null ellipsometry is severely limited when the substrate is rough. It is impossible to separate these two effects experimentally with the null ellipsometer, {{and there is no}} theoretical basis or generally used model available to separate these effects. Thus, a dual rotating‐compensator Mueller matrix ellipsometer has been constructed to carry out film thickness measurements on rough substrates. Measurements were made on a set of specially prepared specimens of 8630 steel, roughened by grit blasting with aluminum oxide. Grit sizes and blasting pressures were varied to produce 11 different roughness values ranging from 0. 01 to 1. 295 μm Ra, as measured with a stylus tracer device. Upon each of the 11 roughness groups, films of magnesium fluoride were overlaid to thicknesses of 89, 180, 254, and 315 nm. One set of specimens was left uncoated. Experimental results for film thickness measurements on rough surfaces matched the ideal (for smooth surfaces) form well for roughnesses up to 0. 13 μm Ra, at most angles of incidence. For <b>rougher</b> <b>specimens,</b> significant deviations in results were observed for all but the largest angles of incidence. The nonideal data were attributed to the cross‐polarization effects of surface geometry, and apparent depolarization. The resolution of thickness measurements was 1 nm for polished specimens, and decreased continuously to 10 nm for the <b>roughest</b> <b>specimens</b> examined. ...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} of ordinary samples with {{more or less}} rough surfaces is an everyday problem in industrial NDE. Contact techniques require flat or other regular (e. g., cylindrical) surfaces of negligible roughness {{with respect to the}} acoustic wavelength. Immersion techniques are less susceptible to surface topography, but they still require that the surface radius be larger than the beam diameter and the surface roughness be comparable or less than the wavelength in the immersion fluid. This difference {{is due to the fact}} that in immersion inspection surface irregularities do not significantly reduce the energy transmission into the specimen but rather randomize the field through incoherent scattering. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of ultrasonic {{inspection of}} a <b>rough</b> <b>specimen</b> by the immersion method. The probability of detection of a given flaw is ultimately limited by the signal-to-noise ratio produced at the receiver. The flaw signal results from coherent reflection from a single, relatively large and strong scatterer. In comparison, the noise is incoherent scattering from a large number of randomly distributed, relatively small and weak scatterers such as material inhomogeneities or geometrical irregularities. Surface roughness can substantially reduce the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to an otherwise similar smooth sample. First, surface roughness attenuates the coherent flaw signal much more than the incoherent material noise [1, 2]. Second, surface roughness increases the overall noise level by adding another incoherent component to the material noise. This paper discusses the adverse effect of the excess surface noise on ultrasonic flaw detection in rough samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{roughness}} of machined surfaces such {{as those}} in bearings and gears is characterized by asperities which cover a wide spectrum of wavelengths and heights. When the height of the asperities becomes comparable to the lubricant film thickness, the roughness is known to influence friction and wear behaviour. This thesis reports an experimental investigation into the effect of roughness on the film thickness and friction in EHD contact. This work focuses on the particular roughness case of ridges oriented parallel to the rolling-sliding direction, such as the ones produced on raceways during the manufacturing process of rolling element bearings. To carry-out this research a ball-on disk test rig was used to model the contact between the ball and the ring of a ball bearing. The disks were made of glass to enable the lubricant film thickness to be measured through an optical technique based on optical interferometry. The ball specimens were made of AISI 52100 steel and they were roughened with a cutting tool, resulting in longitudinally oriented roughness ridges showing a dominant wavelength and amplitude. The friction was measured through a torque meter attached to the ball shaft. A duo-chromatic system using two LEDs was developed {{in order to be able}} to measure the film thickness over a wider range of film thickness. A novel procedure was also introduced to enable the film thickness in rough EHD contacts to be measured accurately. The film thickness and the friction produced by specimens with various amplitude and wavelength were measured under pure rolling and rolling-sliding conditions. The roughness was found to have a big influence on both film build-up and friction. In particular, under the same operating condition, a <b>rough</b> <b>specimen</b> will generate a thinner minimum film and a higher friction compared to a smooth specimen. At the top of the asperities, a micro-EHD film was found to form. As suggested by friction and pressure measurements, the conditions in this micro film are severe enough to reach the limiting shear stress of the lubricant. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{friction}} and film thickness in elastohydrodynamic contacts of machined, rough surfaces, where roughness {{is dominated by}} longitudinal ridges parallel to the rolling/sliding direction. A ball-on-disc tribometer was used to simultaneously measure {{friction and}} film thickness in rough contacts {{as well as with}} nominally smooth specimens for comparison. The studied rough surfaces were selected so that the influence of the root-mean-square roughness and roughness wavelength can be assessed. Friction and film measurements were taken over a range of slide–roll ratios and speeds and with two lubricating oils with different viscosities, hence covering a wide range of specific film thicknesses. The measurements with the nominally smooth specimens show that friction is strongly influenced by thermal effects at high SRRs and that the transition from mixed/boundary to full EHD lubrication occurs at lambda ratios greater than three. At low speeds, the <b>rough</b> <b>specimens</b> are found to generate higher friction than the smooth ones for all the roughness structures considered, and this is shown {{to be related to the}} thinner minimum film thickness. Comparison of friction in rough and smooth contacts shows that the total friction in rough contacts can be divided into two components: one that is equivalent to friction in smooth contacts under the same conditions and is dependent on the slide–roll ratio, and the other that is due to the presence of roughness and is independent of the slide–roll ratio under the conditions tested. Further analysis of the minimum film thickness on tops of roughness ridges indicates that even after the full lift-off, an effect of the roughness on friction persists and is most likely related to the local shear stress in the micro-EHD contacts on the top of roughness ridges. At even higher speeds, the difference in friction between the <b>rough</b> and smooth <b>specimens</b> vanishes...|$|R

His sermons, which made a great impression, were published in that year under the title, Some Modern Difficulties Respecting the Facts of Nature and Revelation. He was much gratified to receive an invitation from his old college, St John's, to sit for a fellowship, but was obliged to decline the honour as on 12 September 1861 he had married Mary Lydia Sale, the daughter of his former vicar. He was soon afterwards appointed to the living at St John's, Fitzroy Square, London. His income was small and the parish was a drab one, but his preaching attracted well-to-do people from other parts of London, who took sittings in his church. This, however, did not lead to any neglect of the poorer members of his congregation. He opened classes for young men and himself took the classes in English, the Greek Testament and political economy.

During the fretting fatigue test of these specimens in air, adhesion occurred in the smoother surface specimen but did not occur in the <b>rougher</b> surface <b>specimen.</b> As a result, the fretting fatigue strength decreased when adhesion occurred. Therefore, it can be considered that adhesion resulted in the reduction of the fretting fatigue strength in smoother specimens in air and in 0. 12 MPa hydrogen.

The purpose of this research was to investigate foam flow properties by performing simple experiments to determine the drag charateristics of simple-shaped bodies moving through foam;A rotating tank apparatus was built and used as the equivalent of a wind tunnel in aerodynamic testing. Foam with consistent properties was produced and models of various shapes were suspended in the moving foam. The drag on the model moving through the foam was obtained by using a simple strain gauge force balance. The foams were made from liquid soap, water, and air.

40|$|Chestnut blight {{is caused}} by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica and infects American {{chestnut}} trees (Castanea dentata) throughout the United States and Canada. Once a major tree species, American chestnut trees filled Eastern and Midwestern forests. The fungus arrived from Asia with the import of Japanese chestnut trees in the late 19 th century. By 1913, the disease had wiped out enough trees to warrant investigation by the USDA. It was during this initial investigation that scientists discovered that Japanese and Chinese varieties of chestnut showed some resistance to the fungus. Although they showed signs of infection, the trees own defenses kept the disease from becoming fatal. This is likewise the case with many of the hybrid species that have recently been developed. Unfortunately, the American chestnut was not resistant and by 1940, over three and a half billion trees had been lost to the disease. The species continues to survive by pushing up sprouts from the root systems as root and root collar tissue may be unaffected by the fungus. Although sprouts growing from roots in the forest under-story may survive until they reach a few inches in diameter, most are overcome by the blight before they become mature enough to produce nuts. The chestnut blight fungus causes cankers, dieback, and ultimately death of aboveground parts of American Chestnut. Formation of cankers and death of the branches or stems may occur in a single season. Symptoms and Signs The disease first becomes apparent as cankers developing on stems of any size.

30|$|We {{postulate}} {{that bright}} illuminated spots are likely nitrogen molecules excited by an electric discharge or spark at faulting. Before the faulting, piezoelectric quartz minerals in the specimen under stress produces a piezoelectric field, which is neutralized by associated bound charges (Yoshida et al., 1997). At the faulting, the direct piezoelectric field disappears immediately, but bound charges would be slow to dissolve, which causes an electrostatic discharge, {{such as the}} creeping discharge in the close vicinity of the specimen. Control by the grain sizes on brightness of the luminescence would be consequence of the texture itself and strain concentration in the specimen. Strain is localized {{in the area of}} the future faulting plane (Yanagidani et al., 1985). Large strain would induce a large piezoelectric effect, especially when large grains are present, and an alignment of bright spots at the rupture plane is therefore a consequence of highly strained zones in the <b>specimen.</b> <b>Rough</b> surface created at the fault plane is also favorable in inducing electric discharge or spark. The absence of luminescence with wet samples is explained by this while piezoelectricity of quartz works even in the wet specimen, as water being a good conductor would enable charges to move away and inhibit charge buildup.|$|R

Both the spot welding and CFRP specimens showed good applicability of NAUT. For the spot welding specimen, the ultrasonic transmittance was highest at the spot-welded part, regardless of the thickness and location of the specimen. For the CFRP specimen, the waveforms of a defective part and a defect-free part were compared, and the existence of delamination was discovered through the increase and decrease in the amplitude.

Moreover, phase analysis was performed by X-ray diffraction in order to corroborate the chemical characterization and to identify the different calcium phosphate phases as a function of current density. The results showed that at 2 m/cm 2 current density, the coating is composed of an octacalcium phosphate: Ca 8 H 2 (PO 4) 6 and its amorphous phase called OCPam.

They had a readiness with their hands that reminded me of Molly Seagrim and other heroines in Fielding's novels. For example, I have seen a woman meet a man in the street, and, for no reason perceptible to me, suddenly clutch him by the hair and cuff his ears,--an infliction which he bore with exemplary patience, only snatching the very earliest opportunity to take to his heels. Where a sharp tongue will not serve the purpose, they trust to the sharpness of their finger-nails, or incarnate a whole vocabulary of vituperative words in a resounding slap, or the downright blow of a doubled fist. All English people, I imagine, are influenced in a far greater degree than ourselves by this simple and honest tendency, in cases of disagreement, to batter one another's persons; and whoever has seen a crowd of English ladies (for instance, {{at the door of the}} Sistine Chapel, in Holy Week) will be satisfied that their belligerent propensities are kept in abeyance only by a merciless rigor on the part of society. It requires a vast deal of refinement to spiritualize their large physical endowments. Such being the case with the delicate ornaments of the drawing-room, it is the less to be wondered at that women who live mostly in the open air, amid the coarsest kind of companionship and occupation, should carry on the intercourse of life with a freedom unknown to any class of American females, though still, I am resolved to think, compatible with a generous breadth of natural propriety. It shocked me, at first, to see them (of all ages, even elderly, as well as infants that could just toddle across the street alone) going about in the mud and mire, or through the dusky snow and slosh of a severe week in winter, with petticoats high uplifted above bare, red feet and legs; but I was comforted by observing that both shoes and stockings generally reappeared with better weather, having been thriftily kept out of the damp for the convenience of dry feet within doors. Their hardihood was wonderful, and their strength greater than could have been expected from such spare diet as they probably lived upon. I have seen them carrying on their heads great burdens under which they walked as freely as if they were fashionable bonnets; or sometimes the burden was huge enough almost to cover the whole person, looked at from behind,--as in Tuscan villages you may see the girls coming in from the country with great bundles of green twigs upon their backs, so that they resemble locomotive masses of verdure and fragrance.

The extruded material was found to have better fatigue strength than the forged material, although the cyclic stress-strain response was similar for both. The forged material was tested in T 5, T 6 and T 7 tempers, showing no significant difference in fatigue strength. Surface roughness was created by circumferential grinding of cylindrical test specimens, and the surface topography was measured using a white light interferometry microscope. The measurements proved to be accurate, although errors were observed for certain surface features. Residual stresses were quantified by X-ray diffraction. Compressive residual stresses of around 150 MPa were found in both <b>rough</b> and smooth <b>specimens.</b> Load cycling did not significantly alter the surface residual stresses. Stress solutions ahead of all major surface grooves were found using a linear elastic material model. Estimates of cyclic stresses and strains were calculated in the notch roots using different Neuber corrections of the linear solution. The results were compared to finite element analysis employing a bilinear kinematic hardening model. A generalized version of the Neuber correction was found to be within 20 % of the nonlinear finite element results. Several empirical models for the notch sensitivity factor were investigated. These were found to be unable to describe the notch influence on fatigue life and initiation life. In order to follow this approach, it was recommended that different test specimens should be used where the short fatigue crack growth could be monitored. It was shown that microstructural fracture mechanics theories could be used to estimate the fatigue limit of rough surfaces. In some cases, initiation from material defects or weaknesses would override the influence of surface geometry. In one specimen, the initiation appeared to have started as at a de-bonded grain, while in other cases, initiation was thought to have started at larger second phase particles embedded in notch roots. Further work in this area should focus on statistical descriptions of surface roughness, inherent material defects, and their interaction.

40|$|Application of Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) in the {{construction}} industry is desired due to its advanced properties such as high resistance to corrosion, high tensile strength and low density. Many researchers have conducted various investigations on application of FRP for retrofitting, reinforcing and prestressing of concrete structures. As tendons work at high stress levels, fatigue will be a detrimental factor influencing their performance. This project was aimed at investigating the fatigue behavior of Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) tendon prestressed concrete beams. The research included three parts, bond strength, prestress loss and fatigue behavior of prestressed beams. In the first part, the bonding properties between GFRP tendon and concrete were studied. Circular specimens with GFRP rods embedded in center of cement mortar discs were prepared and tested to determine the bond performance of GFRP tendon. The second part was to study the prestress loss of GFRP when used as prestressing tendon. It is generally assumed that prestress loss of GFRP tendon would be smaller than that of steel due to its lower stiffness. Beams with GFRP rod as prestress tendon were made and tested to verify this assumption. The last part was to investigate the fatigue behavior of GFRP tendon prestressed beams by comparing with steel tendon prestressed beams. Beams prestressed by GFRP tendon and steel tendon were prepared and tested at various loading levels for comparison. Test results showed that surface condition has great influence on bond strength while mortar composition only has limited effect. Comparing with smooth surface steel rod, smooth surface GFRP rod possessed slightly smaller bond strength. While sand blasted rough surface GFRP had great improvement for about 100 % increase in bond strength. However, reinforcement was required to be added in the <b>rough</b> surface GFRP <b>specimens</b> to prevent the formation of radial cracks during the push-out test. Two beams prestressed with rough surface GFRP tendon and smooth surface steel tendon respectively were monitored for prestress loss. The results showed that the rough surface GFRP tendon had a slightly higher strain loss than the smooth surface steel tendon. However, with a much lower Young’s modulus, in the scale of about one fourth of the steel tendon, the rough surface GFRP tendon had only about one fourth of prestress loss of steel tendon. Fatigue behaviors of GFRP tendon and steel tendon prestressed beams are similar, especially in lower loading levels. Fatigue tests showed that the GFRP tendon prestressed beams had a lower fatigue strength than steel tendon prestressed beams. The GFRP tendon and steel tendon prestressed beams failed quickly when loaded at 60 % and 80 % of their ultimate strength respectively. All prestressed beams loaded with maximum cyclic load not exceeding more than 10 % of their predicted cracking loads had fatigue life more than two million cycles...|$|R
