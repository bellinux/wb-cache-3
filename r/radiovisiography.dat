40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{accuracy}} of the <b>Radiovisiography</b> (RVG) with conventional Radiographic in canal length estimation in vitro for root canal treatment. Forty-single-rooted teeth were endodontically assessed and working lengths were determined using both conventional intra-oral dental film and <b>Radiovisiography</b> (RVG) 1 R 1 X 70 intra-oral x-ray system. Measurement assessment was done by two observers. The actual pre-measured lengths of the files and roots were unknown to the observers. Result showed that both conventional radiography and RVG showed a significant greater length than the true length. These differences are statistically significant (P< 0. 05) but of limited clinical significance. In conclusion RVG is of equal value to conventional radiography in root canal length determination. It was concluded that RVG has the advantage of low radiation dose and rapid image production and recommended to be used during endodontic therapy. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{bone mass}} estimation, through imaging methods, {{is widely used}} in metabolic"ndiseases {{diagnosis}} and treatment. One of these methods is called &quot;optical densitometry&quot; which estimates bone density by measuring {{the intensity of the}} transmitted light on different parts of a radiographic image. Digital radiography systems act similarly by determining grey levels of the image. The aim of this study is comparing two different methods of optical densitometry and a digital system densitometry known as <b>radiovisiography.</b> 45 samples, containing urografin with three different concentrations, were imaged, by both radiovisiogrphy (RVG) and conventional film systems. To determine the densitometry of films and <b>radiovisiography</b> images, optical densitometry and bone densitometry option of the RVG software, were applied respectively. Data were analyzed and compared for their reliability (repeatability) and correlations with concentration. In RVG densitometry system, the correlation with concentration is moderate (r= 0. 42) and intra samples and intra group reliability are 97. 68 % and 88. 19 %. Moreover, in conventional optical film densitometry, correlation with concentration (r= 0. 987) is high, intra samples and intra group reliability is high, intra samples and intra group reliability are 99. 97 % and 99. 84 %, respectively. According to the results, it is suggested that conventional film optical densitometry is more precise and reliable than RVG densitometry...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on 14 teeth {{in order to}} evaluate a new technique for radiation dose reduction during endodontic therapy. After examination of the preoperative film, usually available in the patient file, an apex locator (Root ZX) {{was used to measure}} the working length. Complete chemomechanical debridement was then performed, and the master cone was evaluated by a digital imaging system (<b>RadioVisioGraphy</b> (RVG)). Obturation was performed when measurements of the electronic device and RVG were comparable. A postoperative image was made by the RVG system to evaluate the final obturation. A clinical and radiographic follow-up examination (follow-up period: 6 to 8 months) revealed satisfactory apical healing. These results indicated that a successful obturation technique can be performed by a single radiation exposure, using the RVG unit for master cone evaluation. This technique may be useful in medically compromised patients who need not to be exposed to excessive or repeated radiation during endodontic therapy. King Saud Universit...|$|E

40|$|Statement of Problem: One of the {{problems}} associated with the treatment of periodontal diseases is caused through the extension of disease toward furcation area. Several techniques in Conservative, Resective and Regenerative categories have been suggested for the treatment of furcation involvement. "nPurpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the results of the treatment of grade II furcation involvement in mandibular molars using an allograft material named 'Dynagraft' (a type of demineralized bone matrix) and the coronally positioned flap. Materials and Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial study, twelve patients (9 females and 3 males), aged 25 to 40, suffering from bilaterally grade II furcation involvement of mandibular molars who referred to dental faculty Tehran University of medical Sciences, were investigated. The molars of one side were treated by Dynagraft whereas those of the opposite side underwent the CPF method. Measurements of the probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), keratinized gingiva (KG) and horizontal probing depth (HPD) were recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 months after surgery. In order to investigate the bone radiographic changes, <b>radiovisiography</b> at the mentioned periods in addition to clinical investigation, were performed. For statistical analysis, Paired West was used. "nResults: The mean PPD reduction three months and six months after the operation were 1. 75 mm and 2. 25 mm, respectively in the Dynagraft (test) group whereas 1. 26 mm and 1. 27 mm in the CPF (control) group (P&lt; 0. 005). The mean attachment gain three months and six months after the operation were 1. 1 mm and 1. 5 mm respectively in the test group, and 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm in the control group (P&lt; 0. 005). The mean KG reduction three months and six months after the operation were 0. 5 mm and 0. 6 mm respectively in the test group and those of the control group were 1. 1 mm and 1. 1 mm. The mean HPD reduction three months and six months after the operation were 1. 55 mm and 2 mm respectively in the test group (P&lt; 0. 005) and 0. 55 mm and 0. 55 mm in the control group (PO. 01). <b>Radiovisiography</b> of the mentioned areas three months and six months after the operation confirmed the changes obtained from clinical measurements, showing appreciable reconstructive results (Bone filling) in the test group as compared with the control group.

40|$|AIM : To analyse the {{prevalence}} of anatomical variations of mandibular premolars in Chennai population. METHODOLOGY : It was observed, during the routine treatment of mandibular premolars that aberrations were becoming common. This necessitated an encompassing study on 500 patients, evaluating the occurrence of these aberrations. The parameters of this study included sex predilection, unilateral/ bilateral occurrences, and comparison of the incidence of anatomical variations in mandibular first and second premolar canal configuration. The study pattern was designed to observe these premolars using <b>Radiovisiography</b> (RVG) in different angulations to highlight the anatomical aberrations. The results were subjected to statistical analysis, which were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) statistical program version 10. 0. 5. Descriptive statistics were computed for all the variables. RESULT : The present study revealed high incidence of anatomical aberrations in mandibular premolars among Chennai population.

40|$|Statement of problem: Digital {{measurement}} of RVG may improve diagnostic interpretation of radiographs {{in terms of}} accuracy, {{although it has been}} shown that validity of linear measurements of interproximal bone loss could not be improved by basic digital manipulations. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of <b>RadioVisioGraphy</b> (RVG) in the linear {{measurement of}} interproximal bone loss in intrabony defects. Materials and Methods: Thirty two radiographs of 56 periodontally diseased teeth exhibiting interproximal intrabony defects were obtained by a standardized RVG technique and Intrabony defect depths were determined by linear measurement analysis of RVG. The following four distances were assessed intrasurgically: the cemento enamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar crest, the CEJ to the deepest extention of the bony defect (BD), the occlusal plane to the BD and the OP to the AC. Comparison between RVG measures and intrasurgical estimates were performed using paired t-test. Results: The radiographic measurements overestimated interproximal bone loss as compared to the intrasurgical measurements: CEJ-BD measurement by RVG was 6. 803 ± 3. 589 mm and intra-surgically was 6. 492 ± 3. 492 (P< 0. 000).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the efficacy of digital and conventional radiographic methods in diagnosis of horizontal alveolar bone loss. Materials and Methods: In this diagnostic study 48 radiographs of 104 teeth with periodontal disease that exhibited horizontal alveolar bone loss were obtained by digital and conventional radiography technique in Zahedan faculty of dentistry in 2007. The depth of intrabony defects was determined by linear measurement analysis of <b>radiovisiography</b> (RVG) and coolis. The distance from cemento enamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar crest was assessed intra-surgically. The comparison between RVG measurement, conventional radiographic measurements and intra-surgical estimates were performed using paired t-test and P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The distance between CEJ and alveolar crest by RVG method was 3. 53 ± 1. 47 mm while it was 3. 56 ± 1. 58 mm by intrasurgical method and 2. 9 ± 1. 47 by conventional radiography. No statistically significant difference was seen between digital radiographic and intra-surgical measurements (P= 0. 42). The difference between digital and conventional radiographic measurements was statistically significant (p= 0. 001). Conclusion: This study showed that the result of digital radiographic measurement was closer to the intra-surgical gold standard. Digital radiographic method was more sensitive than conventional radiography to detect horizontal alveolar bone loss. That’s why we recommend digital imaging as a more useful method than conventional radiography for evaluating the horizontal alveolar bone loss...|$|E

40|$|Background: Accurate {{working length}} {{determination}} is a pre-requisite {{for a successful}} endodontic treatment. Even with improved systems of working length measurement, different readings may be recorded in different electrolytes present in the canal. The purpose of this in vivo/ex vivo comparative {{study was to determine}} the accuracy in measuring the working length of root canal using Direct Digital Radiographic Method (<b>Radiovisiography</b> or RVG) and ProPex electronic apex locator in the presence of three different irrigating solutions: 0. 9 % normal saline, 2 % chlorhexidine, 3 % NaOCl solutions. Materials and Methods: Forty single-rooted human teeth scheduled for extraction with mature apices were selected for this study. Measurements were performed by using RVG and ProPex in the presence of irrigating solutions. After extraction of the teeth, light microscope was used to confirm visually the relationship of the tip of the endodontic file to the apical foramen, and actual lengths were determined by reducing 0. 5 mm from this length. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA test and Tukey-HSD post hoc procedure. P < 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: No significant difference was found between overall mean electronic working length and digital radiographic length; however, prediction error (P < 0. 05) was significant with respect to different irrigants. Among the irrigating solutions, chlorhexidine gluconate had the smallest distance to the actual lengths, whereas NaOCl had the greatest. Conclusion: Electronic apex locator ProPex yielded best result in the presence of chlorhexidine, whereas the largest error was demonstrated with NaOCl indicating that higher electroconductive irrigating solutions affect the precision of multi-frequency apex locators...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the Working length in primary teeth {{endodontics}} using intra oral digital <b>radiovisiography</b> and apex locator with conventional method for accuracy. Materials and Methods: This in vivo study was conducted on 30 primary teeth which were indicated for pulpectomy in the patients of the age group of 5 - 11 years All experimental teeth had adequate remaining tooth structure for rubber dam isolation and radiographicaly visible canals. Endodontic treatment was required due to irreversible pulpitis or pulp necrosis. A standardized intraoral periapical radiograph of the tooth was taken using conventional method by paralleling technique. The distance between the source and the tooth, tooth and the films were standardized using X-ray positioning device. During the pulpectomy procedure, the working length was determined by digital radiograph and apex locator. The measurements were then compared with the conventional method of root canal measurement technique for accuracy Result: From the results obtained we can conclude that Working length determined in primary molars using digital radiography and Apex locator did not show any significant difference in the mean working length measurements when compared with the conventional radiographic method. Conclusions: Apex locator is comparable to conventional radiograph in determining the working length without radiation in the primary teeth. Intraoral digital radiography is the safest method in determining the working length with significant reduction in radiation exposure. Hence, both the techniques can be safely used as alternatives to conventional radiographic methods in determining working length in primary teeth...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the clinical performance of International Caries Detection and Assessment System II (ICDAS II) (a ranked visual scale), <b>radiovisiography</b> (RVG) (a digital radiography device), and an alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) device {{for the detection}} and assessment of occlusal caries in primary teeth. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five molars were assessed using all three systems under standardized in vivo conditions. They were then extracted and also assessed by examiners in vitro. Downer′s histological scoring criterion was the validation gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver-operator curves were calculated for enamel caries and dentine caries. Repeatability was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The performances of the systems between in vivo and in vitro settings by the same examiner were also compared. Statistical Analysis: SPSS version 17. 0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was {{used to analyze the}} data. Comparison of the performance of all three systems for all caries and dentine caries using receiver operating characteristic curves was calculated using a range of cutoffs. Reliability was assessed using ICC method. Results: ICDAS II system showed the highest validity and repeatability for assessing occlusal caries in the primary molars. RVG was less accurate than the ICDAS II for detecting caries lesions confined to enamel. However, when dentine was involved, RVG was found to be as effective as ICDAS II. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the study, the in vivo results of ICDAS II and RVG were satisfactory and comparable to those obtained in vitro, with ICDAS II performing better.

40|$|Introduction: The {{science of}} dental {{implantology}} has evolved exponentially {{in the recent}} past but the intricacies in the selection of implant site, size and angulations has always been challenging to the clinician and {{it is very difficult to}} meet these challenges without dental imageology. Aims: To compare panoramic radiography with computed tomography (CT) and <b>radiovisiography</b> to analyze the relative advantages and disadvantages of these modalities. Materials and Methods: Total 27 sites in 20 patients of mandibular posterior molar edentulous areas were radiographed with four different radiographic methods. The implant sites were selected and the height of the available bone, the mean width of the available crestal bone and density were measured using all the three techniques (except density which was measured on CT alone). Comparison of all the values obtained with the three imaging modalities was done and data tabulated for statistical analysis. The one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc analysis using least significance method (LSD) was used to test the differences between each group using the SPSS software version 16. Results: The mean value of vertical measurements using conventional OPG, panoramic CT, RVG, and paraxial CT was found to be 19. 32, 18. 43, 19. 09, and 16. 81 mm, respectively. The mean value of density of the bone using paraxial CT was found to be 631. 23 HU with a standard deviation of 123. 14. The mean value of width of the crestal bone below the height of the crest using paraxial CT was found to be a maximum of 14. 03 mm and a minimum of 5. 86 mm. Conclusion: The overall results suggested that the paraxial view of CT was better in assessing the parameters of implant site when compared to the other three modalities...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Intrabony {{periodontal}} defects {{are important}} problems in periodontology {{and up to}} now several ways have been suggested for their treatment. Treatment with enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) {{has been shown to}} enhance periodontal regeneration. There is limited information available from clinical trials regarding the performance of EMD in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. This study was designed to compare the clinical and radiographic effects of EMD treatment to that of open flap debridment (OFD) for two and three walled intrabony defects. Materials and Methods: 18 patients were included in this clinical trial which have 24 two and/ or three intrabony defects. Defects were randomly divided into two groups (test and control). Defects in test group were treated with flap surgery plus EMD and in control group with open flap debridment. At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow up, clinical and radiographic measurements were performed. Data were analyzed using Greenhouse-Geisser test with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: At 3 and 6 months, mean probing pocket depth reduction was greater in the test group (EMD) (4. 33 mm and 4. 70 mm) compared to the OFD group (2. 54 mm and 3. 09 mm). Mean values for clinical attachment gain in the EMD group after 3 and 6 months were 4. 29 mm and 4. 98 mm, and in OFD group were 2. 83 and 2. 82 mm respectively. Radiographic bone gain measured by <b>radiovisiography</b> technique was greater in the EMD group compared to the OFD group (4. 66 mm in EMD and 1. 11 mm in OFD group after 3 months and 5. 78 mm in EMD and 1. 39 mm in OFD group after 6 months). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, treatment with flap surgery and EMD compared to open flap debridment, produced more favorable clinical improvements in two and three walled intrabony defects...|$|E
