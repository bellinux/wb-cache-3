A related FORTRAN program was&# 13; developed, allowing the study of a large range of complex refrigerant circuit configurations. This model predicts the&# 13; dynamic behavior of a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>coil</b> under dry and frosting conditions. Comparisons were made based on the&# 13; frost mass accumulation and pressure drop across the coil and the results were found to agree reasonably well with&# 13; experimental results reported in the literature.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of environmentally damaging synthetic refrigerants {{due to their}} ODP or GWI potential by natural refrigerants such as CO 2 is now up in the research agenda. Moreover, current energy supply concerns make of efficiency another first priority issue to dictate new stringent design criteria for industrial and commercial equipment. Heat exchangers {{are the most important}} components in refrigeration systems where they are used as evaporators or condensers and their design and operation have a considerable impact on overall system performance. Hence, it is important to better understand their thermal and hydrodynamic behaviour in order to improve their design and operation. Numerical simulation represents a very efficient tool for achieving this objective. In this paper, a new modeling approach, accounting for the heat transfer the hydrodynamics of the problem and intended to predict the dynamic behaviour of a <b>refrigeration</b> <b>coil</b> under dry conditions is proposed. A related FORTRAN program was developed, allowing the study of a large range of complex refrigerant circuit configurations. The equations describing these aspects are strongly coupled, and their decoupling is reached by using an original method of resolution. Circuits may have several inlets, outlets, bifurcations and feed one or several other tubes inlets. The coil was subdivided into several elementary control volumes and its analysis provided detailed information in X, Y and Z directions. Validation was performed with data from a CO 2 secondary refrigeration loop test bench built in CanmetENERGY Laboratories. These data were predicted satisfactorily over the operating range corresponding to refrigeration applications. Exemplary simulations were then performed on an evaporator typically employed in supermarkets, showing the effect of circuiting on operation and performance. Even though circuiting is common practice in refrigeration this simulation shows that care must be exercised in making the selection. A two-circuit configuration was chosen for analysis in this investigation. In terms of capacity and heat transfer, it was shown that the two circuits were well balanced in terms of pressure drop and heat transfer capacity. Low CO 2 pressure drop resulted in reduced temperature glide as compared to a single circuit. Heat exchangers Refrigeration Simulation Carbon dioxide Modeling Circuiting...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} using a heat pipe installed in the air conditioning unit of a supermarket to increase the level of dehumidification of the inside air. This dehumidification is expected to reduce the energy consumption of the refrigeration system due to an improved efficiency of the heat transfer at the display case. This increase in efficiency will be due to reduced frost buildup on the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>coils.</b> Chapter two includes a physical and psychometric analysis of the heat pipe, proving that for any system where direct evaporation dehumidification is used, at any given time when dehumidification is being performed, the addition of a heat pipe will increase the amount of moisture being removed by the cooling coil. For this thesis, a heat pipe was installed in a supermarket in Worcester, Massachusetts. Over a period of the summer from the beginning of June to the end of October, various air temperatures and relative humidities, refrigeration line temperatures, pressures, and mass flows, and compressor power consumption were monitored for fifteen minute periods. The monitoring period included two months before the installation and three months after the installation to determine changes in the air system and refrigeration system due to the presence of the heat pipe. Chapters two through five describe the equipment, site and strategy used in the analysis. Chapter six describes the results of the monitoring, and Chapters seven and eight give the results of the air system and refrigeration system models. The systems were modelled using monitored data and engineering equations to predict humidity levels and power consumption based on ambient conditions. The analysis was unique in that a heat pipe application had never been previously studied in a Northeast location, since the mild summers made dehumidification less of an issue than in Southern states. This study was also considerably more in depth than previous studies (summarized in Chapter 2), for which savings estimates do not account for large potential errors. This study concluded that potential savings estimates (0 - 8 % reduction in supply air humidity, - 1 % reduction in refrigeration power) were within statistical error (9 % for specific humidity, 4 % for refrigeration power), and therefore inconclusive. Further studies with superior equipment and modelling strategies are needed to substantiate heat pipe dehumidification. by Eric M. Oliver. Thesis (M. S.)

Small diameter coils can withstand higher pressures required by the new generation of environmentally friendlier refrigerants. They have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{formation}} of frost on a forced convection <b>refrigeration</b> <b>coil,</b> operating below the freezing temperature {{is known to}} have the effect of imparing the efficiency of a refrigeration system, This investigation was directed toward the study of the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop for a frosted coil. The experiment was conducted with a finned tube coil having staggered tube arrangement, The experimental equipment was so designed that the frost accumulation on the test coil could be measured with a platform scale. A chilled solution of 30 percent by weight of ethylene glycol and water supplied the cooling for the test coil. Tests were run at constant air flow rates of 585, 685 and 775 CFM. In each test the inlet air was maintained approximately at 32 ° F with a specific humidity of 0. 003 lbs of moisture per lb of dry air; the supplied antifreeze solution was kept at about 14 ° F with a flow rate of 1, 853 lbs per hr. Sufficient data were recorded, during each test, to determine the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air static pressure drop through the test coil at various frost accumulations. It was observed that the overall coefficient of heat transfer at constant air flow rate increased slightly as frost first accumulated on the test coil and then decreased after the peak had been reached as the frost continued to increase. The air pressure drop increased continuously with increasing frost accumulation on the test coil. For each increment of frost weight per square foot of coil surface the magnitude of the air pressure drop was found to be greater at the higher air flow rates. The agreement between {{the results of the present}} investigation and the one previously made on the coils having in-line tubes arrangement suggested that the behavior of the overall coefficient of heat transfer and the air pressure drop were independent of coil geometry. For a system with a fixed capacity and design conditions the decrease in overall coefficient of heat transfer, during the heavy frosting, would lower the system efficiency by the reduction in the coefficient of performance of the refrigeration system. The increase in pressure drop at increasing frost accumulation on the coil surface would have a direct effect on lowering the system capacity by reducing the air flow in the system. The limited information made available by this investigation was not enough to cover the wide range of operating conditions and heat exchangers encountered in practice. More extensive research would be necessary to provide sufficient information for a better design of the refrigeration systems when the {{formation of}} frost on the heat exchanger surface could not be avoided...|$|R
40|$|In CO 2 {{transcritical}} <b>refrigeration</b> cycles fin-and-tube <b>coils</b> {{are still}} considered as possible gas cooling devices, {{due to their}} lower cost when compared with recent aluminium minichannel heat exchangers. In spite of the very high working pressures, an “off-the-shelf” coil with four ranks of 3 / 8 ” copper tube and louvered fins was found suitable to work with high R 744 pressures and has been studied as a gas-cooler in a test rig built for testing CO 2 equipment operating with air as a secondary fluid. The test rig consists of two closed loop air circuits acting as heat sink and heat source for gas-cooler and evaporator respectively. The tested refrigerating circuit consists of two tube-and-fin heat exchangers as the gas-cooler and the evaporator, a back-pressure valve as the throttling device, a double-stage compound compressor equipped with an oil separator and an intercooler. A full set of thermocouples, pressure transducers and flow-meters allows measurement and recording of all the main parameters of the CO 2 cycle, enabling to perform heat balance both air-side and refrigerant-side. Tests were focused on two different gas-coolers, with continuous and cut fins, and on two different circuit arrangements. Tests on each heat exchanger were run at three different inlet conditions, both for CO 2 and air. A simulation model was developed {{for this type of}} heat exchanger and three models (Dang and Hihara 2004, Gnielinski 1976, Pitla et al. 2002) proposed for the carbon dioxide supercritical cooling heat transfer coefficients were implemented and compared in the code. The model results are compared with the experimental data for the finned coil: emphasis is given to the effect of heat conduction through fins between adjacent tube ranks on the system efficiency. In the paper, the experimental results for transcritical carbon dioxide entering the gas cooler at 87. 0 °C (7. 911 MPa), 97. 6 °C (8. 599 MPa), 107. 8 °C (9. 102 MPa) with air inlet temperature 20. 3 °C, 21. 5 °C and 23. 0 °C respectively are presented. By using a coil with fins modified to reduce the heat conduction, a 3. 7 % to 5. 6 % heat flux improvement was gained. This improvement can be clearly translated in terms of Coefficient Of Performance, since a low value of the CO 2 temperature at its outlet increases the cooling capacity. Considering a reference cycle with the same operating conditions, a 5. 7 % to 6. 6 % increase of COP can be obtained...|$|R
