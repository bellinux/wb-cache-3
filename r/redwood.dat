5|$|By 1958, SR-201 between US-40 west of Magna and SR-68 (<b>Redwood</b> Road) was a two-lane highway through rural Salt Lake County. The rural {{landscape}} {{changed by the}} time SR-201 intersected 300 West and entered urban Salt Lake County, the highway becoming a four-lane road. The route remained this way until the intersection of 1300 East (SR-181), where the route reverted to a two-lane configuration. By 1965, {{a time when most}} U.S. Routes in the city were being replaced by Interstate Highways, all two-lane portions of the road east of 1300 East were widened to at least four lanes; an interchange between US-40, US-40A and future I-215 was being built at the mouth of Parley's Canyon. From under-construction I-15 west to <b>Redwood</b> Road, the old route of SR-201 was being superseded by a six-lane freeway directly to the south. All construction was complete by 1970 with interchanges at 900 West and <b>Redwood</b> Road; the new freeway extended west to 2700 West.|$|E

They used the abundant <b>redwood,</b> which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. <b>Redwood</b> boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E
