There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of <b>refugees</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E

5|$|From Aquileia, Alboin {{took the}} Via Postumia and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid {{succession}} Tarvisium (Treviso), Vicentia (Vicenza), Verona, Brixia (Brescia) and Bergomum (Bergamo).
