40|$|The modular {{combination}} of optical microscopes with digital holographic microscopy (DHM) {{has been proven}} to be a powerful tool for quantitative live cell imaging. The introduction of condenser and different microscope objectives (MO) simplifies the usage of the technique and makes it easier to measure different kinds of specimens with different magnifications. However, the high flexibility of illumination and imaging also causes variable phase aberrations that need to be eliminated for high resolution quantitative phase imaging. The existent phase aberrations compensation methods either require add additional elements into the reference arm or need specimen free <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> <b>or</b> separate <b>reference</b> holograms to build up suitable digital phase masks. These inherent requirements make them unpractical for usage with highly variable illumination and imaging systems and prevent on-line monitoring of living cells. In this paper, we present a simple numerical method for phase aberration compensation based on the analysis of holograms in spatial frequency domain with capabilities for on-line quantitative phase imaging. From a single shot off-axis hologram, the whole phase aberration can be eliminated automatically without numerical fitting or pre-knowledge of the setup. The capabilities and robustness for quantitative phase imaging of living cancer cells are demonstrated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Question: The {{formation}} of large woody debris (LWD) piles during floods has significant impacts on riparian succession through pioneering plants often establishing {{in association with}} wood. We assess the importance of LWD for seed regeneration of riparian plants after a century-scale flood disturbance in a semi-arid environment. Location: The Sabie River within Kruger National Park in the semi-arid northeast of South Africa. Methods: Our approach was to quantify the riparian soil seed bank, to record the frequency of establishment of riparian plants in woody debris piles, and to conduct experimental outplantings of common riparian trees in plots with and without LWD. Results: We found the abundance and diversity of seedlings were higher in soils taken from wood piles than from open <b>reference</b> <b>areas,</b> and most seedlings were herbaceous species. Surveys indicated that numbers of seedlings recorded within woody debris were significantly greater than in open <b>reference</b> <b>areas</b> <b>or</b> within established vegetation. Seedling establishment in various cover-types also varied for different riparian tree species. Experimental out-planting of seedlings of two riparian tree species (Philenoptera violacea and Combretum erythrophyllum) revealed that, after 433 days, planted seedlings survived only in woody debris piles. Conclusion: LWD formed after a large flood creates heterogeneous patches that may influence post-disturbance regeneration of riparian vegetation by providing a variety of environmental niches for seedlings establishment. We suspect that higher seedling survival in LWD is due to increased moisture (particularly in the dry season) and nutrients, and protection from seasonal flooding and herbivory...|$|R

40|$|Control of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is {{a global}} problem for livestock-based {{extensive}} agriculture, conservation, recreation, game management and forestry. Bracken is controlled primarily by application of asulam or by cutting. The success of bracken control may be dependent upon ecological variables (such as habitat type and latitude) and methodological variables (such as number and timing of treatments). We synthesised the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of bracken control interventions {{in order to identify}} knowledge-gaps and provide an evidence-base to support decision making where bracken control is a problem. Objective The primary objective was to assess evidence on the impact of asulam on bracken abundance and to determine why the impact might vary. A secondary objective was qualitative assessment of the impact of other bracken control interventions on bracken abundance. Study Inclusion Criteria Studies were included if they fulfilled the following relevance criteria; • Subjects(s) studied – Pteridium aquilinum (except where it occurred in a woodland context). • Interventions – Herbicides, Mowing or cutting, handpulling, rolling, use of livestock (cattle, sheep, ponies) or burning with control of bracken as an objective, and combination of techniques. • Outcome(s) – Any change in the abundance of bracken including frond density, cover, frequency, above or below ground biomass. • Comparator – appropriate controls (e. g. untreated <b>reference</b> <b>areas)</b> <b>or</b> pretreatment comparators. • Type of study – any primary studies.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic scintigraphic images allow {{functional}} {{exploration of the}} considered organ and thus a good comprehension of the pathological phenomenon. There are two different approaches to analyse such images series; by following the activity of a region of interest or by computing parametric images. Both approaches may require the detection of an area of interest. This paper presents two methods of analysis of synchronised dynamic scintigraphic images of the heart based on an automatic detection of the left ventricle. The first method follows the time activity of the left ventricle and computes the ventricular ejection fraction. The second method computes a parametric image called “covariance image ” where each pixel represents a covariance coefficient that indicates if the corresponding point in {{the heart and the}} <b>reference</b> <b>area</b> evolve <b>or</b> not in the same direction.

40|$|The {{advent of}} a shale oil {{processing}} industry in Port Curtis region (approximately 15 Ian northwest of Gladstone) {{in addition to}} existing industries provided the impetus to establishment of 15 'Sentinel' monitoring sites to assess potential effects of industrially-sourced gaseous outfalls from the Gladstone airshed on natural vegetation. To provide a baseline for widespread regional natural disturbances a further 5 sites ('Reference') were established some 40 - 50 Ian southwest of Gladstone in the Kroombit Tops area. In addition to using passive gas gels to monitor gaseous outfalls of S 02, N 02, 03, bioindicators monitored included foliar health indices (leaves per I m of branch, average leaf weight and a chlorosis - necrosis score), soil and litter associated invertebrate assemblages and lichen cover. Gaseous outfalls of S 02 and N 02 at Sentinel sites were 2 to 15 times greater than concentrations at Reference sites but 0 3 was similar. Significant changes in average leaf weight, mostly with a declining trend as typical of effects of gaseous outfalls on vegetation {{and an increase in}} variability of invertebrate assemblages in 2001 were found. Significant changes in numbers of leaves per branch (no consistent increasing or decreasing trend) and the chlorosis - necrosis score were also found. The latter bioindicator actually declined and this is the reverse of the predicted response to effects of gaseous outfalls on vegetation and suggests an improvement in vegetation health. There was no clear linkage between these patterns in change in leaf weight and gaseous outfalls within the Sentinel area. Two lines of evidence point to the significant declines in average leaf weight and increases in vertebrate assemblage variability within Sentinel sites being a response to a widespread regional drought in 2001 and 2002. Firstly, similar patterns of declining leaf weight were observed in the regional <b>Reference</b> <b>area</b> relatively remote from Port Curtis where levels of S 02 and N 02 concentration are substantially lower. Secondly, response of two types of vegetation ('closed', > 70 % canopy cover typical of dry rainforest and 'open', 30 - 70 % canopy cover typical of sclerophyll woodlands and forests) differed with closed canopy vegetation consistently showing significant declines in average leaf weight irrespective of location whereas most open canopy vegetation sites were non-significant except those associated with ridge-tops in the Sentinel area. Within the Sentinel area only closed vegetation showed an increase in invertebrate assemblage variability in 2001. Dry rainforest vegetation is known to suffer seasonal water stress in the late dry season and a greater vulnerability to drought effects could explain the patterns of change in the bioindicators monitored. The usefulness of dry rainforest vegetation as a way of internally calibrating for drought effects by acting as a sentinel vegetation type for natural disturbance of this kind needs to be more widely tested. If this ability is confirmed for this vegetation type, then it may offer a more cost-effective protocol for testing for natural drought effects compared with regional <b>reference</b> <b>areas,</b> <b>or</b> they may provide an opportunity to have some ability to calibrate for regional effects of droughts where regional reference sites are lacking...|$|R

Ordering sites by richness maximizes nestedness indices; however, ordering by other criteria such as <b>area</b> <b>or</b> isolation may be more ecologically interpretable. We surveyed birds in true fragments (35 in all), and in "reference areas" in large extant forest blocks (30 locations), of the same range of areas (10, 20, 40, 80 ha). The avifauna was divided into "bush birds"– species dependent on forest and woodland, and "open country" species.

Ordering by area in all cases was not significantly less nested than ordering by richness. Ordering by area in fragments was significantly greater than in <b>reference</b> <b>areas,</b> but the differences in standardized nestedness indices were small (< 15 %). We identified those birds that had distributions among fragments that conformed strongly with area, those that were more randomly distributed and some species that were more likely to occupy the smallest fragments. Among the latter was a hyperaggressive, invasive, colonial native species (noisy miner Manorina melanocephala). A suite of small, insectivorous birds were more likely to strongly conform with expected distributions in relation to area, which was consistent with observations of their vulnerability to the effects of the noisy miner in smaller fragments. <br /...|$|R
