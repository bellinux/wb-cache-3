40|$|Farmers in Ampara region {{depend on}} massive {{quantities}} of synthetic fertilizers. Now {{there is a}} tendency to produce and use compost fertilizer in agriculture among several farmers in this region. However their quality is not comparable with the synthetic ones. The following study was undertaken to determine the parameters of the compost prepared by individuals and units operating in this region, in terms of chemical composition andtheir nutrient contentand compare their relative nutrient index value. As an initiative, a total of six representative compost samples from this region were collected during April 2016. pH, EC, moisture content, WHC, NPK values, OC and sand content were analyzed by standard methods. Results revealed that none of the samples collected were satisfying all the standardparameters, may be due to the use of different feed stock as raw material, hence different composition and different time periods allowed for maturity by the different producers. However, one sample (sample no. 5) satisfied most of the standard quality parameters, such as pH of 6. 5, EC of 0. 476 dS m- 1, moisture content of 22 %, 59. 12 % of WHC, 0. 5789 % of potassium content, 20. 03 % of OC, 0. 8967 % of total nitrogen content, a C/N ratio of 22 : 1 and with a nutrient index of 1. 75. Phosphorus and sand content of almost all the samples were deviating from <b>recommended</b> values. <b>Sample</b> <b>number</b> 5 was obtained from a farmer, who has undergone trainings in preparing compost fertilizer. Other samples showed deviation, from the acceptable range of measured parameters mainly due to the usage of improper ratio of feedstock and unhealthy maintenance of conditions throughout the composting period.

40|$|The Iowa State University Plant and Insect Diagnostic Clinic {{analyzes}} {{soil and}} root samples for plant-parasitic nematodes. The results of samples associated with corn that were submitted from 2000 through 2010 were summarized. One or more genera of plant-parasitic nematodes {{were found in}} 92 % of the samples. Spiral nematode and root-lesion nematode were most commonly found. Other nematodes recovered were dagger, lance, needle, pin, ring, and stunt nematodes. Nematodes recovered at damaging population densities were dagger, needle, ring, and spiral nematodes. An average of 15 samples were submitted per year from 2000 to 2004. <b>Sample</b> <b>numbers</b> increased nearly threefold since 2005, but overall <b>sample</b> <b>numbers</b> were low every year from 2000 through 2010.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{implement}} a wireless sensor network in process automation system it is needed to specify the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> for the sensors. Because of the hardware and power supply limitations, wireless sensors are applied to discrete event control system. In wireless sensor network the highest <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is restricted {{in comparison to the}} wired one.

Trees, aged 5 to 9 years, were sampled {{across a range of}} sites in southern Australia. Simulated core samples were removed at six fixed heights easily accessible from the ground (0. 5, 0. 7, [...] . 1. 5 m) and at seven percentage heights (0, 20, 30, [...] . 70 %). Whole-tree values, calculated from percentage height data, were correlated with the core data to determine the optimal sampling height. Core samples were found to be good predictors of whole-tree pulp yield for E. globulus, with simulated cores taken from the <b>recommended</b> <b>sampling</b> height (1. 1 [*]m) explaining more than 50 % of {{variation in}} whole-tree pulp yield. Results for E. nitens were variable with large site differences apparent. On high quality sites, core <b>samples</b> from the <b>recommended</b> <b>sampling</b> height (0. 9 [*]m) were good predictors of whole-tree pulp yield, explaining around 60 % of the variation. On poor quality sites, cores were poor predictors of whole-tree pulp yield. Radial orientation of cores was not important and predicted pulp yield was not related to tree size, basic density or fibre length. To estimate stand mean pulp yield to an accuracy of ± 1 % would require sampling 6 trees of E. globulus and 4 trees for E. nitens using either multiple discs or core samples. A single sampling height (1. 1 [*]m) is <b>recommended</b> for <b>sampling</b> for basic density, fibre length, fibre coarseness and predicted pulp yield in E. globulus.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{underway}} profilers, sampling the water-column to obtain sound speed corrections {{is no longer a}} detriment to hydrographic survey efficiency. Instead, the challenge has become deciding how many casts are necessary to maintain a desired level of multibeam sounding accuracy, while not needlessly overworking the profiler.

40|$|Abstract Background The urinary {{proteome}} {{has been}} widely used for biomarker discovery. A urinary proteome database from normal humans can provide a background for discovery proteomics and candidate proteins/peptides for targeted proteomics. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} define the minimum number of individuals required for sampling to represent the normal urinary proteome. Methods In this study, inter-individual and inter-gender variations of urinary proteome were taken into consideration to achieve a representative database. An individual analysis was performed on overnight urine samples from 20 normal volunteers (10 males and 10 females) by 1 DLC/MS/MS. To obtain a representative result of each sample, a replicate 1 DLCMS/MS analysis was performed. The minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> was estimated by statistical analysis. Results For qualitative analysis, less than 5 % of new proteins/peptides were identified in a male/female normal group by adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> exceeded nine. In addition, in a normal group, the percentage of newly identified proteins/peptides was less than 5 % upon adding a new sample when the <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> reached 10. Furthermore, a statistical analysis indicated that urinary proteomes from normal males and females showed different patterns. For quantitative analysis, the variation of protein abundance was defined by spectrum count and western blotting methods. And then the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> for quantitative proteomic analysis was identified. Conclusions For qualitative analysis, when considering the inter-individual and inter-gender variations, the minimum <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is 10 and requires a balanced number of males and females in order to obtain a representative normal human urinary proteome. For quantitative analysis, the minimal <b>sample</b> <b>number</b> is much greater than that for qualitative analysis and depends on the experimental methods used for quantification. </p...|$|R
