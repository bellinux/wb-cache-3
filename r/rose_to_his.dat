5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit {{the back of his}} head into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

25|$|Young {{was born}} into a naval family, with his father, James Young, and his half-brother, James Young also serving in the navy and rising to flag rank. William Young served on a variety of ships and <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own {{commands}} during the American War of Independence. Using his connections to continue in service during the years of peace, he was almost immediately given command of a ship on the outbreak of the wars with the France and served initially in the Mediterranean during the siege of Toulon, at the reduction of Corsica, and at the battles of Genoa and Hyères Islands. Promoted to flag rank soon after these events, he returned to England and joined the Board of Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch what a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Stone, distinguished himself while serving as squad leader of the 1st Platoon. The 1st Platoon was on a combat patrol mission just west of Landing Zone Liz when it came under intense automatic weapons and grenade fire from a well concealed company-size force of North Vietnamese regulars. Observing the platoon machinegunner fall critically wounded, Sgt. Stone remained in the exposed area to provide cover fire for the wounded soldier who was being pulled to safety by another member of the platoon. With enemy fire impacting all around him, Sgt. Stone had a malfunction in the machinegun, preventing him from firing the weapon automatically. Displaying extraordinary courage under the most adverse conditions, Sgt. Stone repaired the weapon and continued to place on the enemy positions effective suppressive fire which enabled the rescue to be completed. In a desperate attempt to overrun his position, an enemy force left its cover and charged Sgt. Stone. Disregarding the danger involved, Sgt. Stone <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> knees and began placing intense fire on the enemy at pointblank range, killing 6 of the enemy before falling mortally wounded. His actions of unsurpassed valor were a source of inspiration to his entire unit, and he was responsible for saving the lives of a number of his fellow soldiers. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|E

25|$|On 14 January 1908 at {{the annual}} College Colston society dinner George Alfred Wills <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and {{dramatically}} announced the news that his father, Henry Overton, was to donate £100,000 to the cause promoting {{the creation of the}} University providing that a Royal Charter was obtained within two years. Records note that the room began to cheer after the announcement was made. This announcement caused further funds to be promised by those attending the University. The day ended with the University endowment fund standing at five times greater than it had at the start with the University scheme attracting more in 24-hours than it did in its entire history. The raising of such large firms meant that the Privy Council could not argue that the creation of what were then disparagingly known as 'Lilliputian' Universities would in any way result in a decrease in the standard of British universities. H.O. Wills had little contact with the College apart from {{the fact that he had}} sent his son Harry to classes there. He died in 1911 after becoming the first Chancellor of the University of Bristol. The Wills Memorial Building was built by his two surviving sons in memory at a cost of £500,000. The impact of the Wills family upon the University can also be founding in the naming of the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory built by George in memory of his brother which cost some £200,000 and the building of Wills Hall, a hall of residence for the University in Stoke Bishop. Unlike many of the supporters of the University the Wills were not Liberals or Quakers but Congregationalists.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America, in {{the name}} of Congress, takes pride in {{presenting}} the Medal of Honor (Posthumously) to Private First Class Leonard C. Brostrom, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action as a rifleman with an assault platoon of Company F, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, which ran into powerful resistance near Dagami, Leyte, Philippine Islands, on 28 October 1944. From pillboxes, trenches, and spider holes, so well camouflaged that they could be detected at no more than 20 yards, the enemy poured machinegun and rifle fire, causing severe casualties in the platoon. Realizing that a key pillbox {{in the center of the}} strong point would have to be knocked out if the company were to advance, Private First Class Brostrom, without orders and completely ignoring his own safety, ran forward to attack the pillbox with grenades. He immediately became the prime target for all the riflemen in the area, as he rushed to the rear of the pillbox and tossed grenades through the entrance. Six enemy soldiers left a trench in a bayonet charge against the heroic American, but he killed one and drove the others off with rifle fire. As he threw more grenades from his completely exposed position he was wounded several times in the abdomen and knocked to the ground. Although suffering intense pain and rapidly weakening from loss of blood, he slowly <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and once more hurled his deadly missiles at the pillbox. As he collapsed, the enemy began fleeing from the fortification and were killed by riflemen of his platoon. Private First Class Brostrom died while being carried from the battlefield, but his intrepidity and unhesitating willingness to sacrifice himself in a one-man attack against overwhelming odds enabled his company to reorganize against attack, and annihilate the entire enemy position.|$|E

He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet to defend the corner, and broke into laughter after the following exchange: ...|$|E

500|$|Disraeli {{delivered}} the budget on 3 December 1852, {{and prepared to}} wind up the debate for the government on 16 December—it was customary for the Chancellor to have the last word. A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, {{and then as a}} force, [...] "I face a Coalition... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions." [...] His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down. The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen, with Gladstone as his Chancellor. Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} decade, the most {{fruitful}} of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss {{was greeted by}} an [...] "overwhelming ovation". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling [...] "dishonoured and dispirited." [...] This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim that followed the first performance of the complete Má vlast cycle in November: [...] "Everyone <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and the same storm of unending applause was repeated after {{each of the six}} parts... At the end of Blaník [...] the audience was beside itself and the people could not bring themselves to take leave of the composer." ...|$|E
500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!" ...|$|E

500|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{was part}} of an {{offensive}} plan to break through German resistance in northeastern France, as far as Saint-Dié-des-Vosges. In the area of Genevreuille on 15 September 1944, Murphy narrowly escaped death from a mortar shell hit that killed two others and wounded three. Although his resulting heel wound was not serious, he received his first Purple Heart. By this point, all but Murphy and two others of Company B's original group had either been killed or taken off the lines with wounds. General O'Daniel moved the 15th Infantry, 3rd Division to the Moselle and the Cleurie river valley in late September. Stone quarries dotted the hills and provided good defensive positions for the Germans. The 15th was met with fierce resistance north of St. Ame at the heavily fortified multi-tunneled L'Omet quarry. On 2 October at L'Omet, Murphy advanced alone to the location of a machine gun manned by a unit of German soldiers. Within [...] of the machine gun nest, he <b>rose</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet. [...] "The Germans spot me instantly", he recalled. [...] "The gunner spins the tip of his weapon toward me. But the barrel catches in a limb, and the burst whizzes to my right". Murphy lobbed two hand grenades at the men, killing four and wounding three. He was awarded the Silver Star for this action. The 15th achieved success in its continued attack when Germans began evacuating the quarry on 5 October. On that date, Murphy, while carrying a SCR-536 radio, advanced alone for [...] towards the Germans while they continually fired directly at him. Around [...] from the Germans' location, he relayed firing orders by radio to the artillery, and remained at his position alone for an hour directing his men. When Murphy's men finally took the hill, 15 German combatants were killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star.|$|E
