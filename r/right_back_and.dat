5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, {{the second}} quarter featured three turnovers, and at half time, Penn State led 6–3 with two field goals from senior kicker Sam Ficken. On Penn State's first drive in the second half, Allen Robinson returned and caught a screen pass, which he ran for 25 yards, and then a 51-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13–3. On the ensuing drive, however, Syracuse came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> scored a touchdown via a Jerome Smith 10-yard run. Early in the fourth quarter, Ficken made his third field goal of the day, a career-long 46 yards. Later in the quarter, Hackenberg threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Eugene Lewis to make the score 23–10. When only down by 6 points, Syracuse got the ball around their own 45-yard line with {{a little over two}} minutes left, but turned the ball over via an interception with under two minutes to play.|$|E
25|$|A {{versatile}} and well-rounded player who {{is regarded as}} one of the best midfielders of his generation, Gerrard was capable of playing in a number of positions. A hardworking box-to-box player, he was usually deployed as a central midfielder, but he had also been used as a second striker, a holding midfielder, an attacking midfielder, a <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> a right winger.|$|E
25|$|Radulovics {{started her}} career in her {{hometown}} club as a youngster and turned professional by ŽRK Radnički Belgrade, with them she won the EHF Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. Later she moved abroad to Spanish side BM Sagunto, followed by a switch to the Hungarian championship. First, she was signed by Caola SE, where her exceptional skills quickly became clear and despite playing for a rather low-table team, Radulovics won the top scorers' award in 1995. Her impressive performances were enough for Dunaújváros to move on the <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the recently crowned EHF Cup Winners' Cup champions have secured her services {{after the end of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|Finnan {{made his}} Liverpool debut against Chelsea on 17 August 2003. His first season was {{disrupted}} by injury, but in 2004–05, he {{established himself as}} the first-choice <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a firm fan favourite. The season was a highly successful one for Finnan. He scored his first and only goal for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion, played in the League Cup final, {{and was in the}} starting eleven as Liverpool won the Champions League Final, though a thigh injury meant he was substituted at half time. Finnan's goal against WBA meant that he had scored in each of the five highest divisions of English football, a record he shares with Jimmy Willis.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} at San Jose, United had no {{break in the}} {{schedule}} with another road game 4 days later. The team did catch somewhat of a lucky break as they were playing winless Toronto FC. Head Coach Ben Olsen had a few surprises in store, as he bolstered the defense by putting Andy Najar at <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> moving Woolard to centerback. Bill Hamid was back in goal {{for the first time}} since United's season opener. Hamid's slot as the team's starting goalkeeper had gone to Joe Willis based on Willis' strong performances while Hamid was with the USA's U23 team in that team's failed effort at Olympic qualifying. After a defensive first half, with few chances for either team, United broke through on a long strike by Chris Pontius in the 55th minute. Hamdi Salihi once again came off the bench and closed out the scoring in a 2-0 win with his second goal in two games, this one coming on an acrobatic overhead scissors kick.|$|E

25|$|Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski {{provided}} all {{the third}} quarter scoring off a 34-yard field goal to cut the Colts lead to 13–10. In the 4th quarter, Manning ran in a play from the Patriot one-yard line to give the Colts a 20–10 lead. However, the Patriots came <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and,</b> {{with the aid of}} a 33-yard reception from Donte' Stallworth, the Pats got their first touchdown of the half off a 4-yard catch by Wes Welker. Forcing a punt by the Colts, Kevin Faulk then gave the Patriots a 24–20 lead off a 13-yard reception to give the Patriots their first lead of the half. The Patriots then stopped a drive by the Colts when Peyton Manning was hit by Jarvis Green and fumbled the ball into the hands of Rosevelt Colvin with just under three minutes to go. On third and ten with no timeouts left for the Colts, the Patriots ended any hope for Indianapolis when Welker made a big 12-yard catch to give the Patriots a first down. The Patriots were able to kneel the ball after that to finish off the Colts and the Colts fell to 7–1, losing their first game of the season.|$|E
25|$|Washington State (WSU) got {{the ball}} to start the game, but on the second play of the game, Connor Halliday threw an {{interception}} to Max Morgan of Colorado State (CSU), but Nolan Washington stripped Rashad Higgins on the ensuing play, giving WSU the ball <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> they subsequently scored on a Halliday pass to River Cracraft. On CSU's ensuing drive, they were faced with a fourth down during which they punted from their end zone; the punt was blocked, setting WSU up at the six-yard line. After a roughing the passer penalty and then a holding penalty on consecutive plays, both against CSU, Halliday threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Gabe Marks. After the ensuing kickoff, ESPN aired a series automobile and insurance commercials that were amongst the most viewed of the early bowl season. On the next drive, CSU {{was faced with a}} fourth down and short, and looked like they would punt, but at the last moment called an audible and rushed up the middle for a first down. The next play, quarterback Garrett Grayson threw a 63-yard pass to Charles Lovett, making the score 14–7. CSU had WSU stopped with a sack, however after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave WSU a first down, Halliday threw a touchdown pass to Theron West on the next play. CSU subsequently drove down the field, and kicked a field goal. WSU finished the quarter with a three-and-out.|$|E
500|$|Courtney {{primarily}} plays as a <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> is {{a versatile}} player, also {{being able to}} play at left back and centre back. He is an attacking player and has pace and athleticism. Courtney said of his play [...] "I can run for 90 minutes {{up and down and}} get forward quite well, as well as getting back. I'm strong, quick and quite good in the air for my height" [...] in 2010. York manager Martin Foyle described him as [...] "exciting" [...] and said [...] "He's got the energy to get forward".|$|E

50|$|Towell re-signed on {{loan for}} Hibs on 25 August 2011, on a deal due to run until June 2012. He played the first match {{of his second}} loan spell only 3 days later, {{starting}} as Hibs lost 2-0 to Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Towell started to find first-team opportunities limited after new manager Pat Fenlon made several siginings in the January transfer window. Two <b>right</b> <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> two central midfielders came in with one other <b>right</b> <b>back</b> going out. However, Fenlon said that once Towell had got his fitness levels up he would {{be back in the}} first team picture.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} for his {{capacity}} to play in many different positions on the field. Pablo already played as a Left Wing <b>Back,</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Back,</b> <b>Right</b> Wing <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> as defensive midfielder, his original position.

500|$|Smith {{primarily}} plays as a centre back. He {{has been}} praised for his organisational skills {{and ability to}} communicate, Mills describing him in 2010 as [...] "somebody on the pitch to organise with a big mouth". He has been recognised for his goalscoring ability for a defender; in 2005, he was described by the Worcester News as [...] "often a predator in the opposition's penalty box". He has also had spells playing at <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> in defensive midfield; in the latter role [...] "every attribute he has is geared to that job", said Worcester assistant manager Andy Morrison in 2006. He was described in 2003 by the Evening Press as being [...] "cool on the ball, quick in the tackle and strong in the air". After signing for Worcester in 2005, Preece rated him as being [...] "good on the ball, aggressive in the air, {{got a lot of}} pace and reads the game very well". He was recognised by the Worcester News as a [...] "calm and assured presence in defence that breeds confidence throughout the team" [...] in 2007. According to the Nottingham Post, he established himself as [...] "a tough, uncompromising player with a winning mentality" [...] at Tamworth, and these qualities led to Mansfield manager David Holdsworth signing him in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|King, {{who also}} {{competed in the}} Virginia Slims of Houston during the same week, won in {{straight}} sets, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In the first set, she fell behind 3–2 when Riggs broke her serve. [...] In a 2015 interview, she said {{that most people do}} not remember that she was initially behind in the first set, and it looked bad for her in the early going. At this point, King realized that she [...] "had to win" [...] given the importance of the match, and broke <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> again in the tenth game to close out the set. She had learned from Court's loss and was ready for Riggs' game. Rather than playing her own usual aggressive game, King mostly stayed at the baseline, easily handling Riggs's lobs and soft shots, making him cover the entire court as she ran him from side to side and beat him at his own defensive style of play. After quickly failing from the baseline, where he had intended to play, Riggs dropped his comedic effect and showed a more serious demeanor, as he was forced to change to a serve-and-volley game.|$|E
