60|$|In a bake-shop was a mill for {{grinding}} the grain, and the furnaces {{for baking}} the bread: {{and they say}} that here, in the same furnaces, the exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not found time to <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> the <b>ovens</b> the last time he left his shop, because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry.|$|R
50|$|After dry roasting, peanuts are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> {{as quickly}} as {{possible}} and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches 30℃.|$|R
30|$|Accumulation of A. sarcoides was {{analyzed}} through daily samples of cell dry weight, where samples were filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/F), rinsed, and dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C.

50|$|On {{a culinary}} level, bread is {{commonly}} used as gamosa, a utensil, {{at the same time}} providing carbohydrates and protein to the Egyptian diet. Egyptians use bread to scoop up food, sauces, and dips and to wrap kebabs, falafel, and the like in the manner of sandwiches. Most pita breads are baked at high temperatures (450 °F or 232 °C), causing the flattened rounds of dough to puff up dramatically. When <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven,</b> the layers of baked dough remain separated inside the deflated pita, which allows the bread to be opened into pockets, creating a space for use in various dishes.|$|R
50|$|Typically, large ovens {{are used}} for the {{annealing}} process. The inside of the oven {{is large enough to}} place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired conveyor furnaces are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven.</b> Once <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven,</b> the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as quench hardening. Typical methods of quench hardening materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of brine (salt water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water air bubbles form {{on the surface of the}} object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of air bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. Quench hardening is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys.|$|R
50|$|A Dutch baby pancake, {{sometimes}} called a German pancake, a Bismarck, or a Dutch puff, is a sweet popover that is normally served for breakfast. It {{is derived from}} the German Pfannkuchen. It is made with eggs, flour, sugar and milk, and usually seasoned with vanilla and cinnamon, although occasionally fruit or another flavoring is also added. It is baked in a cast iron or metal pan and falls soon after being <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven.</b> It is generally served with fresh squeezed lemon, butter, and powdered sugar, fruit toppings or syrup. A basic batter incorporates 1/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup liquid per egg.|$|R
50|$|The {{mixture is}} placed into a lined mold, covered, and cooked {{in a water}} bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine. Pâté and terrine are {{generally}} cooked to 160°F (71°C), while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120°F (59°C). After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact {{the contents of the}} terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend.|$|R
50|$|The {{meat and}} fat are then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> {{and left to}} cool. When cool, the meat can be {{transferred}} to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept {{in the refrigerator for}} up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.|$|R
25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes. Drelies, a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with soft-boiled eggs and vinegar when <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven,</b> and served hot.

30|$|Once {{the samples}} were cut and ground flat and parallel, they were washed with water to <b>remove</b> any debris <b>from</b> sample preparation. They were then {{immersed}} in distilled water under vacuum of about 100 kPa for 24  h. Samples were {{taken out of the}} water and were weighed after their surface water had been removed. The samples were then placed into a laboratory oven at 105 °C and dried until a constant mass was observed. Subsequently, they were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> and held in a dessicator until further characterization was implemented. Sample lengths and diameters were measured to within 0.01  mm.

50|$|As a spekkoek {{commonly}} {{has more}} than 18 layers, baking it requires patience and is a very labour-intensive process. The batter is mainly made of butter, flour and sugar with an approximate ratio of 1:1:2. Each layer is made by pouring {{a small amount of}} batter into a baking tin, which is then put into an <b>oven</b> and grilled <b>from</b> above until the layer has turned golden from the heat. The tin is then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> and the process repeated to build up the remaining layers. Dutch ovens with a charcoal fire on top of the lid are said to produce the best results, while electric ovens are superior to gas ovens as cakes bake much faster in the former.|$|R
30|$|To {{simulate}} real-life {{applications of}} MPCM in buildings, a simple mass loss analysis was conducted.

5000|$|The {{interior}} of a cut of meat will still increase in temperature 3-5 °C (5-10 °F) after it is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> an <b>oven</b> or other heat source. The meat {{should be allowed to}} [...] "rest" [...] for a suitable amount of time (depending {{on the size of the}} cut or steak) before being served, which makes the meat easier to carve and its structure firmer and more resistant to deformation; its water-holding capacity also increases and less liquid is lost from the meat during carving. The whole meat and the center will also continue to cook slightly as the hot exterior continues to warm the comparatively cooler interior. The exception is if the meat has been prepared in a sous-vide process, as it will already be at temperature equilibrium.The temperatures indicated above are the peak temperature in the cooking process, so the meat should be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the heat source a few degrees cooler.|$|R

5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary heat-treatable steels did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> and positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|R
40|$|Prime rib is {{generally}} prepared by cooking to low temperatures for long times {{to attain the}} desired tenderness and juiciness. Destruction of Salmonella spp. in blade tenderized prime rib was examined by following cooking procedures commonly used by chefs. Beef ribs (boneless) were inoculated with Salmonella spp. to attain initial surface levels of about 5. 75 log 10 CFU/cm 2. The ribs were blade tenderized (one pass) using a Ross blade tenderizer. Each was split into two equal sections. One half was cooked to a target internal temperature of 110 {{and the other half}} to 120 °F, then tempered at room temperature for up to 60 min and placed in a holding oven (120 °F) for up to 120 min.

30|$|All {{the samples}} were {{prepared}} in a Hobart mixer. The ingredients were mixed for about 4  min. The fresh geopolymer pastes were cast into standard 50  mm plastic cube moulds and compacted using a vibrating table. The specimens were subjected to heat curing. In this regard, all moulds were sealed to minimize moisture loss and placed in an oven at 70  °C for 24  h. At the end of heat curing period, the specimens were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven</b> and kept undisturbed until being cool and then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the moulds and left in the laboratory at ambient temperature until the day of testing. Compressive strength of all specimens was measured according to AS 1012.9 (2014) using a loading rate of 0.33  MPa/s. For each mix, at least three specimens were tested in order to check the variability of performance under compression. The volumetric shrinkage of pastes was determined by measuring the length of three sides of the cubes before and after heating at respective elevated temperatures. The difference in volume changes indicates the volumetric shrinkage and six specimens were {{used to measure the}} volumetric shrinkage for each series. Similar method was also used to determine the mass loss of geopolymer pastes after exposed to respective elevated temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Interdiffusion {{parameters}} are often extracted from depth {{profiles of the}} interface of annealed thin films by measuring the annealing time of the sample {{as well as the}} distance over which interdiffusion took place. The annealing time is usually taken as the time from the moment the sample enters the oven to the exact moment the sample is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>oven.</b> However, diffusion does not start and stop at these points, as the temperature of the sample does not change instantaneously. Any calculation performed with the instantaneous and therefore erroneous time will result in incorrect diffusion parameters extracted from the depth profiles. The influence of the extended heating period is studied by solving Fick's second law numerically and employing three distinct heating profiles in the calculations, namely instantaneous, actual, and linear. The results indicate a clear difference between the first two calculated depth profiles. Using these calculations and some experimental results, a method that employs linear heating and cooling of a sample is proposed for studying the interdiffusion of fast diffusing elements (with low activation energies).
