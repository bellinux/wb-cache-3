Upon his return to the United Kingdom, Freeman-Thomas joined the Liberal Party and in 1900 was elected to the British House of Commons to represent the borough of Hastings. He then served as a junior lord of the Treasury in the Liberal Cabinet that sat from 1905 to 1906. Though he lost in the 1906 elections, Freeman-Thomas returned to the House of Commons by winning the by-election for Bodmin, and, for some time, served as a secretary to the prime minister, H. H. Asquith. For his services in government, Freeman-Thomas was in 1910 elevated to the peerage as Baron Willingdon of <b>Ratton</b> in the County of Sussex, and the following year was appointed as Lord-in-Waiting to King George V, becoming a favourite tennis partner of the monarch. His father-in-law was promoted to an Earl at the coronation, in the same year.|$|E

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos do cultivo de Crotalaria juncea semeada nas entrelinhas da soca de cana-de-açúcar, na produtividade de colmos, no índice de área foliar e no acúmulo de N em cana de açúcar. A leguminosa foi semeada em faixas em delineamento em blocos ao acaso, com nove tratamentos e quatro repetições. O tratamento em que duas linhas de crotalária foram semeadas aos 51 dias após o corte da cana e cortada aos 110 dias após sua semeadura obteve produtividade média estatisticamente similar à daquela constatada no monocultivo da cana-de-açúcar com adubação de cobertura e com controle de plantas daninhas, mas {{superior}} à do tratamento em monocultivo não adubado e sem controle de plantas daninhas. Nos tratamentos consorciados com a leguminosa foram obtidos maiores teores de nitrogênio foliar do que naqueles em monocultivo. The {{objective in}} this work was to evaluate {{the viability of the}} sowing of Crotalaria junceae L. in the inter-row of sugarcane <b>rattons,</b> and its effects on the productivity of stalks, leaf area index and accumulation of N. Strips of the crotalaria were sown between the sugar cane rows in randomized block design with nine treatments and four repetitions. The treatment in which the crotalaria was sown 51 days after the cut of the sugar cane and cut 110 days after sown gave average yield statistically similar to that observed in the monoculture of sugar cane without top dressing and with weed control. However, this average yield was higher than the obtained for the unfertilized treatment in sugar cane monoculture, but without weed control. In treatments with legume inter cropping there were higher leaf nitrogen contents than those in sugar cane monoculture...|$|R
