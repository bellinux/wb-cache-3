50|$|WDS {{may also}} be {{considered}} a <b>repeater</b> <b>mode</b> because it appears to bridge and accept wireless clients {{at the same time}} (unlike traditional bridging). However, with the repeater method, throughput is halved for all clients connected wirelessly. This is because wifi is an inherently half duplex medium and therefore any wifi device functioning as a repeater must use the Store and forward method of communication.|$|E
5000|$|Channel 5 and 35 are the {{designated}} emergency channels in Australia, Vanuatu and Malaysia, {{and are not}} to be used except in an emergency. Making an emergency call involves switching the radio to Channel 5 with duplex on, and trying again with duplex off if there's no response. In New Zealand channels 5 and 35 are not emergency channels, they are available for general use in duplex (<b>repeater)</b> <b>mode.</b> In New Zealand, if you use UHF PRS for emergency, you rely on someone listening on the same channel. Scan all channels for activity before requesting assistance.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the player}} completes songs or other games modes within the career, they earn [...] "Rocksmith points", similar to {{experience}} points, which unlock additional features. New venues, {{shown in the}} background of the main gameplay screens and having subtle influences on the sound of the guitar or bass, and new guitars and basses become available, as well as additional game modes. Some of these modes in the game are designed to help the player practice specific techniques. Technique Challenges, for both guitar and bass, give practice to some of the common tricks for the two instruments, such as hammer-ons/pull-offs, Chords, and Power Chords for guitar, and two-finger plucking and syncopation for bass. Each song can also be played in a Riff <b>Repeater</b> <b>mode,</b> where the player can select a specific section of song to practice and perfect, with options on controlling the speed and note density level. A [...] "Guitarcade" [...] becomes available after completing one of the Technique Challenges, which incorporates that technique into a mini-game element, such as [...] "Ducks", a Galaga-like shoot-em-up, where the player must get their fretboard positions correct to fire on targets approaching in various lanes. Finally, the player can gain access to a free play mode, which uses amplifier modeling to simulate the sound of a guitar as played through stage equipment. The modeling supports a variety of virtual hardware components, such as effects pedals and amplifiers, which can also be unlocked through career mode. Each song includes a custom sound bank referred to as an [...] "authentic tone" [...] designed to make the player's guitar sound as close to the original guitar tone of the song as possible, though they can override these with the virtual pedals and amplifiers.|$|E

SSB/CW operations usually use horizontal polarization for most contacts. VHF/UHF contests are conducted by the ARRL several times each year to encourage operations across all ham bands.

40|$|Global on-chip {{interconnects}} are a {{limiting factor}} in modern high performance VLSI systems due to cross-talk noise, signal delay and wire bandwidth constraints. This dissertation addresses these limitations with {{a fundamental change}} in signaling technique â€“ the use of current-mode band-limited pulses. This work is intended to establish the theoretical basis for the proposed current-mode and band-limited signaling scheme while formulating its impact on signal delay, bandwidth and cross-talk noise both analytically and experimentally. A simple yet accurate closed-form delay expression for inverter driven on-chip interconnects with arbitrary receive-end termination is presented. The solution can be used for both resistive and capacitive termination to adequately model current and voltage mode sensing schemes. The model is extended to consider fast input slope and input-to-output capacitance effects of a CMOS inverter. A test chip fabricated in AMI P EXON & 026 WHFKQRORJ LV XVHG WR H[SHULPHQWDOO YHULI WKH SURSRVHG PRGHO Further analysis shows that the model can be used for sub-micrometer process to accurately estimate delay and bandwidth performance of long on-chip interconnects. Additionally, a new power dissipation model for current-mode signaling is developed to understand the design tradeoffs between current and voltage sensing. Based on the results and derived formulations, a comparison between voltage and current <b>mode</b> <b>repeater</b> insertion for long global deep sub-micron interconnects is presented. The performance of band-limited pulse signaling for cross-talk noise reduction in high-density on-chip interconnects is addressed. The proposed signaling scheme uses reduced edge-rate pulses to minimize the effect of high frequency components on crosstalk noise. A simple low-overhead adjustable slew-rate driver/repeater is designed to generate the band-limited pulses. In order to assess the various design tradeoffs imposed by the proposed signaling scheme, a comparative analysis is presented to evaluate performance in cross-talk noise, driver/receiver power dissipation and propagation delay. A test chip with on-chip cross-coupled interconnect test patterns is fabricated in AM...|$|R
