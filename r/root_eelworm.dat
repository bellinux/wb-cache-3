5000|$|Cereal cyst {{nematode}} (CCN) [...] (syn. Cereal <b>root</b> <b>eelworm</b> and Oat {{cyst nematode}}) is a plant pest caused by Heterodera avenae, Heterodera bifenestra, Heterodera hordecalis, Heterodera latipons, and Heterodera gotland {{in the following}} hosts: Avena sativa, Hordeum vulgare, Secale cereale, Triticum aestivum, and X Triticosecale.|$|E
5000|$|Globodera pallida is {{a species}} of {{nematode}} in the family Heteroderidae. It is well known as a plant pathogen, especially of potatoes. It is [...] "one of the most economically important plant parasitic nematodes," [...] causing major crop losses, and is a model organism used to study the biology of cyst nematodes. Its common names include potato cyst nematode, white potato cyst nematode, pale potato cyst nematode, potato <b>root</b> <b>eelworm,</b> golden nematode, and pale cyst nematode.|$|E
40|$|Oostenbrink {{presents}} evidence {{showing the}} role of the migratory <b>root</b> <b>eelworms,</b> mostly species of Pratylenchus, Paratylenchus and Hoplolaimus, in causing damage to agricultural and horticultural crops in Holland. In Holland there appear to be seven species of Pratylenchus, viz., P. pratensis, P. penetrara, P. thornei, a species close to P. scribneri and three species close to P. minyus. Tylenchorhynchus spp. and Rotylenchus erythrinae were also found. The damage done by these eelworms is often considerable...|$|R
40|$|Thousands {{of plants}} of tuber-forming {{species of the}} genus Solanum were tested for {{resistance}} to the potato-root eelworm. Much attention was given to breeding for resistance by using resistant andigenum lines in crosses with S. tuberosum. In 1952 {{for the first time}} large numbers of resistant andigenum seedlings (numbers CPC 1673 and 1685) could be crossed among themselves and with susceptible potato varieties. The explanation of the observed segregations into resistant and susceptible was based on the hypothesis that resistance was due to one dominant gene H and that a tetraploid inheritance scheme could be applied. Resistant offspring of CPC 1673 was tested at the Estaci√≥n Experimental Agricola de la Molina, Peru. All the resistant offspring were severely attacked by the potato- <b>root</b> <b>eelworms</b> occurring in the soil of 'Maco Farm'. Therefore the Peruvian parasite, at least in one place, is of a different race from that. in the Netherlands. In Scotland an aggressive race of the parasite had been found in some places. This race multiplied profusely in resistant potato varieties derived from CPC 1673. It was advised that the legal restriction in the Netherlands against growing potatoes on the same field be provisionally maintained. <p/...|$|R
