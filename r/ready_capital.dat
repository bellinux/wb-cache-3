60|$|Nothing could {{counterbalance}} this, but a {{much greater}} demand for labour; and such an increased demand, in consequence of the opening of our ports, is at best problematical. The check to cultivation has been so sudden and decisive, as already to throw {{a great number of}} agricultural labourers out of employment;(12*) and in Ireland this effect has taken place to such a degree, as to threaten the most distressing, and even alarming, consequences. The farmers, in some districts, have entirely lost the little capital they possessed; and, unable to continue in their farms, have deserted them, and left their labourers without the means of employment. In a country, the peculiar defects of which were already a deficiency of capital, and a redundancy of population, such a check to the means of employing labour must be attended with no common distress.

50|$|While {{innovation}} is important, {{it is not}} a happenstance occurrence as a natural harbor or natural resources are, but a deliberate, concerted effort of markets, institutions, policymakers, and effect use of geographic space. In global economic restructuring, location has become a key element in establishing competitive advantage as regions focus on their unique assets to spur innovation (i.e., information technology in Silicon Valley, CA; digital media in Seoul, South Korea). Even more, thriving metropolitan economies that carry multiple clusters (i.e., Tokyo, Chicago, London) essentially fuel national economies through their pools of human capital, innovation, quality places, and infrastructure. Cities become “innovative spaces” and “cradles of creativity” as drivers of innovation. They become essential to the system of innovation through the supply side: <b>ready,</b> available, abundant <b>capital</b> and labor; good infrastructure for productive activities, and diversified production structures that spawn synergies and hence innovation. In addition they grow due to the demand side: diverse population of varying occupations, ideas, skills; high and differentiated level of consumer demand; and constant recreation of urban order especially infrastructure of streets, water systems, energy, and transportation.|$|R

40|$|CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) are {{securities}} {{backed by}} pools of mortgage loans on {{commercial real estate}} properties. The primary attractiveness of the CMBS market is that it provides liquidity and diversification to commercial real estate investors and <b>ready</b> access to <b>capital</b> for commercial lenders. CMBS are structured such that a master servicer oversees {{the administration of the}} underlying loans and the distribution of the cash flows to the tranche investors. One of these functions involves the administration and disposition of troubled loans. When a loan in a CMBS deal fails to perform as expected, the master servicer sends the loan to a “special servicer. ” The special servicer has wide latitude to foreclose on the loan or modify the loan terms in an effort to maximize the cash flows to the CMBS investors. Since the first-loss investors have the most at stake when a loan fails to perform, these investors often control the appointment of the special servicer. In fact, the special servicer often holds a portion of the first-loss piece in order to properly align the incentives of the investors and the special servicer. As such, the special servicer may not be concerned with the borrower's position, but rather may undertake action...|$|R

To provide equity capital for young and risky businesses business angels are motivated not only by economic motives (the change to gain profit), but as well by their endeavor to help enterprises with unique business idea. Business angels can invest individually or become a part of business angels networks. The term “business angels” is quite unknown in Slovakia.

Leaseback has experienced an explosive growth in Europe, {{in the first decade of}} this century, especially during the years of economic prosperity. The value of leaseback in Europe has grown from 6. 9 billion EUR in 2004, up to 46 billion EUR in 2007, i. e. during the four years the value was increased for 567 %.

40|$|Abstract According {{to several}} {{researchers}} finance is scarce, scarcer {{for small businesses}} than for big enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that want to start exporting and sales or manufacturing abroad need <b>capital</b> to get <b>ready.</b> Which <b>capital</b> structure and financial costs do they have, and which forms of finance do they actually use for that purpose. New american research by Mansi, Reeb (2002) has suggested, {{that there is a}} positive connection between leverage and a negative one between financial costs and internationalization, and that a non-linear model better describes this connection. This study has gathered data in two ways: Through a questionnaire from 37 SMEs and balance sheet figures from totally 166 manufacturing SMEs. In order to examine, whether the company was active on the international market, 200 SMEs in south Sweden were asked, if they exported to, produced or sold on any other market than their home market. From the balance sheet I collected data about leverage, financial costs and other important figures. Some of the results were interesting. Firstly there is a financial gap for external financing especially for venture capital but also for bank loans. Though average leverage tends to a negative development from export to foreign establishment, multiple regression models show a slightly negative connection with internationalization, which is against the modern theory of internationalization. The non-linear model performs some percent better than the linear one. Financial costs rise through the different steps of internationalization, but the multiple regression models cannot confirm any statistical connection. The pecking order for financing is as follows: Internally generated funds, IGF, bank loans and owners capital. This order was constant for financing all company activities, export or activities abroad. The percentage of choices for all activities tends to similarity with other studies of financing behavior like Cressy, Gandemo, Olofsson (1996) : IGF 75, 7 %, bank loans 64, 9 % and owners capital 54, 1 %. Important factors to determine the choice of finance in this study are: Control aversion, preferences towards internal and external finance and capital structure. My conclusions are several but most importantly, that this study deals with small businesses, which have financial problems regarding bank loans and above all venture capital. The problems tend to aggravate along the internationalization process, maybe in most cases temporarily. I suggest, that new financial possibilities must be created to strengthen business development in the targeted direction. Since research on the subject is not very advanced, I would recommend more and larger studies in this field...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} an astounding increase in new {{real estate financing}} techniques, including mezzanine loans. These new financings are not directly secured by real estate and do not even directly involve land. In the real estate industry, mezzanine financing typically refers to a loan secured principally by the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s equity in other entities. Both economically and legally, {{the value of the}} mezzanine borrower 2 ̆ 7 s collateral derives solely from its indirect ownership of the underlying property. This article provides {{a detailed description of the}} legal structure of mezzanine loans. In addition, this article evaluates the hazards, legal risks and uncertainties inherent in mezzanine financings and the way in which the market fails to adequately take these factors into account. This article shows that mezzanine lenders face significant risks both at the origination of their loans and later on if there is an event of default. At loan origination, lenders are faced with complex rules for the creation, attachment and perfection of liens on their collateral. Later on, a mezzanine lender is faced with other risks if the mezzanine borrower defaults and the lender must actually foreclose upon its collateral. In this article, Professor Berman also argues that the recent subprime mortgage crisis offers a cautionary tale for many of the hazards that may be looming in the near future for the mezzanine loan market, that mezzanine lenders must better understand and evaluate these hazards, and that the legal system needs to produce clearer rules on these non-traditional financings. In particular, Professor Berman contends that mezzanine lenders ought to proceed with caution - to tighten up their underwriting standards, strengthen their loan documentation, and review the <b>ready</b> availability of <b>capital</b> to questionable projects...|$|R
50|$|Cairnes' {{exposition}} {{of the natural}} or social limit to free competition, and of its bearing on the theory of value: He {{points out that in}} any organised society there can hardly be the <b>ready</b> transference of <b>capital</b> from one employment to another, which is the indispensable condition of free competition; while class distinctions render it impossible for labour to transfer itself readily to new occupations. Society may thus be regarded as consisting of a series of noncompeting industrial groups, with free competition among the members of any one group or class. Now the only condition under which cost of production will regulate value is perfect competition. It follows that the normal value of commodities-the value which gives to the producers the average and usual remuneration will depend upon cost of production only when the exchange is confined to the members of one class, among whom there is free competition. In exchange between classes or non-competing industrial groups, the normal value is simply a case of international value, and depends upon reciprocal demand, that is to say, is such as will satisfy the equation of demand. This theory is a substantial contribution to economical science and throws great light upon the general problem of value. At the same time, it may be thought that Cairnes overlooked a point brought forward prominently by Senior, who also had called attention to the bearing of competition on the relation between cost of production and value. The cost to the producer fixes the limit below which the price cannot fall without the supply being affected; but it is the desire of the consumer-i.e. what he is willing to give up rather than be compelled to produce the commodity for himself that fixes the maximum value of the article. To treat the whole problem of natural or normal value {{from the point of view}} of the producer is to give but a one-sided theory of the facts.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{stimulated by}} globalization, {{technological}} innovation and intensifying international competition, {{there has been}} a growing trend towards the increasing institutional and geographical concentration of financial systems and markets. At the same time, there has been mounting academic and policy interest in the financing problems faced by new and small firms, which are widely considered to suffer from a 'funding gap'. These twin developments provide the motivation for this paper, which seeks to throw some theoretical and empirical light {{on the question of whether}} the spatial organization of the financial system impacts on the flows of capital to small firms across regions. Is it the case that a heavily spatially-centralized financial system, like that in the UK, militates against the <b>ready</b> access to <b>capital</b> by new and small firms in peripheral regions, while a more decentralized financial system, like that in Germany, results in a more even regional distribution? The paper first discusses this question theoretically in the context of the regional finance literature. It then compares capital market structures and the regional distribution of equity for SMEs in the UK and Germany. This comparison lends some support to the view that capital markets do not function in a space-neutral way, and that a highly centralized system like that in the UK may well introduce spatial bias in the flows of capital to SMEs. It also shows, though, as the case of Germany illustrates, that the actual impact of the geographical organization of capital markets depends on, and is mitigated by, other institutional and regulatory conditions. Our analysis suggests while a geographically decentralized financial system with sizable and well-embedded regional/local clusters of institutions, networks, agents, and markets could be advantageous in various ways, regional/local capital markets also face a number of major challenges and problems. The paper indicates the need for more research in this somewhat neglected area. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|IndonesiaÃ†s {{fisheries}} exports {{rose from}} 2 206 t in 1970 to 598 385 t in 1996 with a subsequent export value rise from US$ 0. 69 billion to US$ 1. 78 billion. The surplus {{in the balance}} of trade (BOT) was US$ 1. 59 billion in 1996. The fisheries exports were predominantly shrimp, tuna, skipjack and demersal fishes. Large scale fisheries operations are prevalent in the Java Sea. The dominant fishing gear is hook-and-line (40 %), gillnet (31 %), traps (10 %), seine net and lift-net (6 %), purse seine (1 %), shrimp net with BED (0. 04 %) and others (6 %). The large scale fisheries e. g. purse seine, tuna long line, shrimp trawl and fish net use larger vessels, while most of the large scale fisheries utilize boats between 5 - 30 GT. Small scale fisheries exploit the coastal waters resulting in overcrowding in the Java Sea. In terms of production and technological efficiency, the combination of manpower inputs, total volume of fuel/day and total number of vessels are not optimal either for small or large scale vessels. It is recommended in the large scale fisheries that the volume of fuel/day should be increased, while the total number of boats should be reduced. Conversely the use of fuel/day for large scale fisheries should be increased. Expanded use of fuel/day for large scale vessels would increase offshore operations, which would lessen the fishing pressures in near-shore waters. In the northern part of Java, large scale fisheries do not generate any discards or by-products because most of the fishers utilize the fish captured for family consumption, local market or commercial export purposes. Budget analysis, using the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), payback period (PP) and benefit-cost analysis (B/CA), showed that almost all vessels are profitable and <b>ready</b> for new <b>capital</b> investment, except for Danish seine A vessels. Results using the Schaefer surplus yield production model indicate that the existing total fishing effort remains lower than the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level in the inshore waters. The utilization rate in 2001 is currently 99. 4 %. It is recommended that an in-depth study be conducted using simultaneous equation modeling that will integrate the Schaefer model, demand function, production, taxation policy and the feasibility constraints into one general model.
