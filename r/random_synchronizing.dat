We express {{the condition that}} an automaton is synchronizing in terms of linear algebra, and obtain upper bounds for the reset thresholds of automata with a short word of a small rank. The results are applied to make several improvements in the area. We improve the best general upper bound for reset thresholds of finite prefix codes (Huffman codes) : we show that an n-state synchronizing decoder has a reset word of length at most O(n ^ 3 n). In addition to that, we prove that the expected reset threshold of a uniformly <b>random</b> <b>synchronizing</b> binary n-state decoder is at most O(n n). We also show that for any non-unary alphabet there exist decoders whose reset threshold is in (n). We prove the Černý conjecture for n-state automata with a letter of rank at most √(6 n- 6). In another corollary, based on the recent results of Nicaud, we show that {{the probability that the}} Černý conjecture does not hold for a <b>random</b> <b>synchronizing</b> binary automaton is exponentially small {{in terms of the number}} of states, and also that the expected value of the reset threshold of an n-state <b>random</b> <b>synchronizing</b> binary automaton is at most n^ 3 / 2 +o(1). Moreover, reset words of lengths within all of our bounds are computable in polynomial time. We present suitable algorithms for this task for various classes of automata, such as (quasi-) one-cluster and (quasi-) Eulerian automata, for which our results can be applied.

40|$|A {{nucleation}} {{model for}} the breakdown phenomenon in freeway free traffic flow at an on-ramp bottleneck is presented. This model, which can explain empirical results on the breakdown phenomenon, is based on assumptions of three-phase traffic theory in which the breakdown phenomenon is related to a first-order phase transition from the "free flow" phase to the "synchronized flow" phase. The main idea of this nucleation model is that <b>random</b> <b>synchronized</b> flow nucleation occurs within a metastable inhomogeneous steady state associated with a deterministic local perturbation in free flow, which can be considered "deterministic vehicle cluster" in free flow at the bottleneck. This deterministic vehicle cluster in free flow is motionless and exists permanent at the bottleneck due to the on-ramp inflow. In the nucleation model, traffic breakdown nucleation occurs through a random increase in vehicle number within this deterministic vehicle cluster, if the amplitude of the resulting random vehicle cluster exceeds some critical amplitude. The mean time delay and the associated nucleation rate of speed breakdown at the bottleneck are found and investigated. The nucleation rate of traffic breakdown {{as a function of}} the flow rates to the on-ramp and upstream of the bottleneck is studied. The nucleation model and the associated results exhibit qualitative different characteristics than those found earlier in other traffic flow nucleation models. Boundaries for speed breakdown in the diagram of congested patterns at the bottleneck are found. These boundaries are qualitatively correlated with numerical results of simulation of microscopic traffic flow models in the context of three-phase traffic theory. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

BackgroundWe hypothesized that frequency domain analysis of a filtered wide bipolar atrial electrogram describes the global organization of atrial fibrillation (AF) and should vary over time. Timing burst pacing to periods of high organization of AF should promote regional atrial conduction block and terminate AF. MethodsNine dogs were conditioned with rapid atrial pacing for 48 h. Electrogram recordings were made from a wide right atrium (RA) to left atrium (LA) bipole and digitally filtered. A fast-Fourier transform was performed every 0. 5 s on a sliding 2 -s window, and the organization index (OI) was calculated as a ratio of the area of the first four harmonic peaks to the total power of the spectrum. Organization indexes > 0. 5 indicated more organized AF activity. Right atrium and LA burst pacing (burst) (cycle length 50 ms, 9. 9 ms, 9. 9 mA, 1 to 4 s) was performed through decapolar catheters.

40|$|Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consist of}} a large number of small and low cost sensor nodes powered by small {{batteries}} and equipped with various sensing devices. Usually, for many applications, once a WSN is deployed, probably in an inhospitable terrain, it is expected to gather the required data for quite some time, say for years. Since each sensor node has limited energy, these nodes are usually put to sleep to conserve energy, and this helps to prolong the net work lifetime. There are two major approaches to sleep scheduling of sensor nodes, viz. (i) <b>random</b> (ii) <b>synchronized.</b> Any sleep scheduling scheme has to ensure that data can always be routed from source to sink. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for sleep scheduling of sensor nodes using a tree and an energy aware routing protocol which is integrated with the proposed sleep scheduling scheme. The tree is rooted at the sink node. The internal nodes of the tree remain awake and the leaf nodes are made to sleep. This provides an assured path from any node to the sink node. The tree is periodically reconstructed considering the remaining energy of each node with a view to balance energy consumption of nodes, and removes any failed nodes from the tree. The proposed approach also considerably reduces average energy consumption rate of each node as we are able to put more number of nodes to sleep in comparison to other approaches. Additional fault-tolerance is provided by keeping two paths from each node towards the sink. The most important issue that must be solved in designing a data gathering algorithm for wireless sensor networks (WSNS) is how to save sensor node energy while meeting the needs of applications/users. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware routing protocol (EAP) for a long-lived sensor network. EAP achieves a good performance in terms of lifetime by minimizing energy consumption for in-network communications and balancing the energy load among all th...|$|R

The alloy film composition is chosen to be x = 0. 61, near the kinetic solubility limit {{at the growth temperature}} of 500 degrees C. Three sets of experiments are carried out: a - 60 V substrate bias is applied either continuously, in synchronous with the full HIPIMS pulse, or in synchronous only with the metal-rich-plasma portion of the HIPIMS pulse. Alloy films grown under continuous dc bias exhibit a thickness-invariant small-grain, two-phase nanostructure (wurtzite AlN and cubic Ti 1 -xAlxN) with random orientation, due primarily to intense Ar+ irradiation leading to Ar incorporation (0. 2 at. %), high compressive stress (- 4. 6 GPa), and material loss by resputtering. Synchronizing the bias with the full HIPIMS pulse results in films that exhibit much lower stress levels (- 1. 8 GPa) with no measureable Ar incorporation, larger grains elongated in the growth direction, a very small volume fraction of wurtzite AlN, and <b>random</b> orientation. By <b>synchronizing</b> the bias with the metal-plasma phase of the HIPIMS pulses, energetic Ar+ ion bombardment is greatly reduced in favor of irradiation predominantly by Al+ ions. The resulting films are single phase with a dense competitive columnar structure, strong 111 orientation, no measureable trapped Ar concentration, and even lower stress (- 0. 9 GPa). Thus, switching from Ar+ to Al+ bombardment, while maintaining the same integrated incident ion/metal ratio, eliminates phase separation, minimizes renucleation during growth, and reduces the high concentration of residual point defects, which give rise to compressive stress.

However, {{there has been no}} work that analyzes Barring Factor Enabled-Extended Access Barring (EAB-BF), an alternative mechanism that was considered during the standardization process.

In this regard, for the first time, we develop a novel analytical model for EAB-BF to obtain its performance metrics. Results obtained from our analysis and simulation are seen to match very well. Furthermore, we also build an eNodeB energy consumption model to serve the IoT RACH requests.

Results obtained reveal that the optimal performance of EAB-BF is better than that of EAB-BB. Furthermore, we also show that not only all the three 3 GPP-proposed EAB-BF settings considered during standardization provide sub-optimal QoS to devices, but also result in excessive eNodeB energy consumption, thereby acutely penalizing the network.
