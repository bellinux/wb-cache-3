To meet the particular demands of efficient communication in WMSN, a cross-layer design (CLD) approach is proposed in this paper.

An application layer power-congestion-distortion (P-C-D) optimized transmission policy was proposed for multi-path and <b>realtime</b> multimedia <b>communication.</b> Simulation results showed optimal trade-offs can be made between available routes and transmission opportunities such that communication power is minimized under an end-toend distortion constraint. ...|$|R

We pro-pose a simple and yet effective mechanism to detect and reduce channel-caused packet losses by adjusting the retry limit parameter of the IEEE 802. 11 protocol. Since retry limit is left configurable in the IEEE 802. 11 standard, and does not require cross-layer coordination, our scheme can be easily implemented and incrementally deployed.

Parametric power function is used for equalizing this ratio.

Also, an online version can be easily implemented using forgetting factors without lookahead buffer.

Our mechanism considers a wireless ad-hoc network composed of nodes equipped with multiple network interfaces to each of which a different wireless channel can be assigned. By embedding information about channel usage in control messages of OLSRv 2, each node obtains a view of topology and bandwidth information of the whole network. Then, a source node determines a logical path on which application QoS requirements are satisfied. Through experiments on a simulator, our mechanism could achieve the packet delivery ratio of about 95 % at the end-to-end delay of about 10 ms. In addition, realtime traffic was more evenly distributed over the whole network. Index Terms—ad-hoc network, QoS routing, multi-channel, multi-interface...|$|R
