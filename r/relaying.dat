40|$|Abstract – The paper {{studies the}} {{capacity}} of the OFDM and the OFDMA <b>relay</b> networks. Two <b>relay</b> schemes, amplify-and-forward (AF) <b>relay</b> and decode-and-forward (DF) <b>relay</b> are analyzed and compared for both OFDM and OFDMA <b>relay</b> networks. A <b>relay</b> node selection algorithm is proposed for OFDMA <b>relay</b> network. Numerical results show that under small <b>relay</b> power transmission, AF outperforms DF while the opposite is true when the <b>relay</b> transmission power is high. It is also shown that OFDM <b>relay</b> always outperforms OFDMA <b>relay</b> network, however as the number of <b>relay</b> nodes increases, the gap between the two decreases. I...|$|R

In order to evaluate the relative performance characteristics of the two different <b>relay</b> types, a number of simulation studies were carried out, using several traffic conditions and <b>relay</b> models.

After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B.

5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in <b>relaying</b> messages between his companions and his company commander.

The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E

30|$|Two {{different}} strategies are studied regarding <b>relay</b> selection: {{it is either}} performed before resource allocation, depending on average channel gains. In this case, <b>relayed</b> sources are cell edge users, and a <b>relayed</b> source chooses only one <b>relay.</b> In the second method, <b>relay</b> selection is dynamically performed in each RB, depending on its channel gain. Then, any user may become a <b>relayed</b> source or a <b>relay,</b> and a <b>relayed</b> source may choose different <b>relays</b> on different RB. The RB and power allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize the total consumed power, while achieving a target data rate for all users, whether they are <b>relayed</b> source, <b>relays</b> of non <b>relayed</b> sources. Dual Lagrange decomposition is adopted for theoretical resolution and an iterative algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution.|$|R

5|$|From about 1970, Hubbard was {{attended}} aboard ship {{by the children}} of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or <b>relaying</b> his verbal commands to {{other members of the}} crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959.

On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E
30|$|Interference coordination: A {{cellular}} network may {{consist of a}} number of <b>relays</b> deployed for specific coverage needs. One example is installation of <b>relays</b> in an office building consisting of many floors, wherein a <b>relay</b> is deployed on each floor. All the <b>relays</b> may then utilize the same licensed frequency band for access links. Thus, interference situations may arise if the <b>relays</b> are closely placed or if users of one <b>relay</b> move to another <b>relay</b> cell. Interference coordination is then necessary. This coordination is handled according to the frame structure in Figure 1 by scheduling different sets of <b>relays</b> in each time slot. To do this, a set of non-interfering <b>relays</b> is defined as a <b>relay</b> set. Thus, a <b>relay</b> is first included in a <b>relay</b> set and then the <b>relay</b> set is scheduled on a time slot. This means that potentially interfering <b>relays</b> are orthogonalized by being scheduled on different time slots. At the same time, care should be taken to avoid possible <b>relay</b> to macro-user interference. Therefore, we enforce that the <b>relay</b> transmitters are silent during the dedicated frames (time slots) assigned to macro-users.|$|R

Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued <b>relaying</b> and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn. Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964. In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.|$|E

As for the <b>Relay</b> 2, this is possible if the <b>Relay</b> 3 has more antennas than the intended receiver and if <b>Relay</b> 3 does not interfere with both intended receivers from <b>Relay</b> 1 and <b>Relay</b> 2, i.e., STA 1 and STA 2, respectively. For example if STA 2 is outside its coverage range or if <b>Relay</b> 3 is equipped with enough antennas to cancel interfere towards both STA 1 and STA 2.
