5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve <b>reconciliation</b> <b>with</b> the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest.

While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.|$|E

5|$|Spanish Americans in royalist areas {{who were}} {{committed}} to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements.

The intention was to restore Royalist finances by using the remaining vessels of the fleet to conduct a campaign of organised piracy against English shipping across the region.

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of <b>reconciliation</b> <b>with</b> Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E

The exiles, unlike the ethnic Rwandans who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial eras, were seen as refugees by their host countries and began almost immediately to agitate {{for a return to}} Rwanda. Their aims differed; some sought <b>reconciliation</b> <b>with</b> Kayibanda and the new regime, some affiliated with the exiled King Kigeli and others wished to oust the new PARMEHUTU regime from power and establish a socialist republic.|$|E

Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>with</b> Katanga.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A gene {{tree for}} a gene family is often {{discordant}} with the containing species tree {{because of its}} complex evolutionary course during which gene duplication, gene loss and incomplete lineage sorting events might occur. Hence, it is of great challenge to infer the containing species tree from a set of gene trees. One common approach to this inference problem is through gene tree and species tree reconciliation. Results: In this paper, we generalize the traditional least common ancestor (LCA) reconciliation to define a reconciliation between a gene tree and species tree under the tree homomorphism framework. We then study the structural properties of the space of all reconciliations between a gene tree and a species tree {{in terms of the}} gene duplication, gene loss or deep coalescence costs. As application, we show that the LCA reconciliation is the unique one that has the minimum deep coalescence cost, provide a novel characterization of the <b>reconciliations</b> <b>with</b> the optimal duplication cost, and present efficient algorithms for enumerating (nearly-) optimal <b>reconciliations</b> <b>with</b> respect to each cost. Conclusions: This work provides a new graph-theoretic framework for studying gene tree and species tree reconciliations...|$|R
