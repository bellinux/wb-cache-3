50|$|Standard {{heat pipes}} are {{constant}} conductance devices, where the heat pipe operating temperature is {{set by the}} source and sink temperatures, <b>the</b> thermal <b>resistances</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source to the heat pipe, and <b>the</b> thermal <b>resistances</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heat pipe to the sink. In these heat pipes, the temperature drops linearly as the power or condenser temperature is reduced. For some applications, such as satellite or research balloon thermal control, the electronics will be overcooled at low powers, or at the low sink temperatures. Variable Conductance Heat Pipes (VCHPs) are used to passively maintain {{the temperature of the}} electronics being cooled as power and sink conditions change.|$|R

5|$|At 00:00 on 5 December, two {{companies}} of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti.

Although two Canadian infantry companies now occupied Villa Rogatti, German Panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences {{on the outskirts of}} the town. However, C Company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 361st Panzergrenadier Regiment (361.

Tiberias fell on 16 June, followed by Mount Tabor and Kawkab al-Hawa soon thereafter. Safad with its Templar fortress seemed out of reach, so the Ayyubids marched south to Ascalon. Facing stubborn <b>resistance</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Crusader garrison, an Egyptian flotilla was sent by as-Salih Ayyub to support the siege and on 24 October, Fakhr ad-Din's troops stormed through a breach in the walls and killed or captured the entire garrison.
