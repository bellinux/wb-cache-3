5|$|The 12th century Pantokrator monastic complex (1118–36) {{was built}} with {{imperial}} sponsorship as three adjoining churches. The south church, a cross-in-square, has a <b>ribbed</b> dome over the naos, domical vaults in the corners, and a pumpkin dome over the narthex gallery. The north church {{is also a}} cross-in-square plan. The middle church, the third to be built, fills the long space between the two earlier churches with two oval domes of the pumpkin and <b>ribbed</b> types over {{what appear to be}} separate functional spaces. The western space was an imperial mausoleum, whereas the eastern dome covered a liturgical space.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead enamelwork. In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminum, instead of the original <b>ribbed</b> lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rib</b> tips are short, meaty {{sections}} of <b>rib</b> {{attached to the}} lower end of the spare <b>ribs,</b> between the <b>ribs</b> and the sternum. Unlike back <b>ribs</b> or spare <b>ribs,</b> the structure of the <b>rib</b> is provided by dense costal cartilage, not bone. <b>Rib</b> tips are cut away from the spare <b>ribs</b> when preparing St. Louis style spare <b>ribs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Short <b>ribs,</b> by definition, are not {{the entire}} length of <b>rib.</b> When the <b>rib</b> bone is cut into a 3 to 6 in length, left as a section of meat (a [...] "plate") {{containing}} three or four <b>ribs</b> or cut into individual <b>ribs</b> with meat attached, the short <b>rib</b> is known as an [...] "English cut". They may also be known as barbecue <b>ribs,</b> braising <b>ribs,</b> or fancy cut <b>ribs.</b> A section of short <b>ribs</b> from the plate (<b>ribs</b> six through eight, with their intercostal muscle) is known as a [...] "short plate". <b>Rib</b> short <b>ribs</b> are almost always sold as a plate.|$|R
50|$|The terms true {{and false}} <b>rib</b> {{describe}} <b>rib</b> pairs that are {{directly or indirectly}} attached to the sternum. The phrase true <b>rib</b> (costae verae), or fixed <b>rib,</b> refers to the first seven, or vertebrosternal, <b>rib</b> pairs. The phrase false <b>rib</b> (costae spuriae), or vertebrochondral <b>ribs</b> refers to the eighth-to-twelfth pairs of <b>ribs.</b> The eighth-to-tenth pairs of <b>ribs</b> connect to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilages of the <b>ribs</b> above them. Their elasticity allows ribcage movement for respiratory activity.|$|R
5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is <b>ribbed,</b> and which remains wrapped {{around the base of}} the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving <b>ribbed</b> or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such <b>ribbed</b> domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{stainless}} steel cladding is <b>ribbed</b> and riveted {{in the shape of}} sunbeams, with many triangular windows. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>ribs.</b> Form-ribs, plate-type <b>ribs,</b> truss <b>ribs,</b> closed-ribs, forged <b>ribs</b> and milled <b>ribs,</b> where form-ribs are used for light to medium loading and milled <b>ribs</b> offer the {{greatest}} strength.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the carcass}} is {{cut across the}} bone to create strips of meat with {{multiple}} <b>rib</b> bones, the short <b>rib</b> {{is known as a}} [...] "flanken cut."

5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally <b>ribbed</b> spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its resemblance to the jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a <b>ribbed</b> undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|The {{style that}} {{developed}} from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, {{is now known as}} Gothic. It was characterised by pointed arches, <b>ribbed</b> vaults and flying buttresses. It was brought to Britain by the Cistercians, whose abbeys retained thick walls, but pierced them with lancet arches with slender pointed arches. This style became characteristic of the early Gothic in Britain and can be seen at Dundrennan Abbey, begun around 1142, which resembles religious foundations in northern England. The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral, which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.|$|E

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} <b>ribbed</b> calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and <b>ribbed</b> domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of <b>ribbed</b> tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E

40|$|An earlier {{model for}} the study of <b>rib</b> cage {{mechanics}} was modified so that <b>rib</b> deformity in scoliosis could be better represented. The rigid <b>ribs</b> of that model were replaced by five-segment deformable rits. Literature data on cadaver <b>rib</b> mechanical behavior were used to assign stiffnesses to the new individual model <b>ribs</b> so that experimental and model <b>rib</b> deflections agreed. Shear and tension/compression stiffnesses had little effect on individual <b>rib</b> deformation, but bending stiffnesses had a major effect. Level-to-level differences in mechanical behavior could be explained almost exclusively by level to level differences in the <b>rib</b> shape. The model <b>ribs</b> were then assembled into a whole <b>rib</b> cage. Computer simulations of whole <b>rib</b> cage behaviors, both in vivo and in vitro, showed a reasonable agreement with the measured behaviors. The model was used to study <b>rib</b> cage mechanics in two scolioses, one with a 43 [deg] and the other with a 70 [deg] Cobb angle. Scoliotic <b>rib</b> cage deformities were quantified by parameters measuring the <b>rib</b> cage lateral offset, <b>rib</b> cage axial rotation, <b>rib</b> cage volume and <b>rib</b> distortion. <b>Rib</b> distortion was quantified both in best-fit and simulated computer tomography (CT) scan planes. Model <b>rib</b> distortion was much smaller in best-fit planes than in CT planes. The total <b>rib</b> cage volume changed little {{in the presence of the}} scolioses, but it became asymmetrically distributed...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates <b>ribbed</b> him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender <b>ribbed</b> posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick <b>ribbed</b> chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{brought with}} them {{architectural}} styles from their own duchy, where austere stone churches were preferred. Under the early Norman kings this style was adapted to produce large, plain cathedrals with <b>ribbed</b> vaulting. During the 12th century the Anglo-Norman style became richer and more ornate, with pointed arches derived from French architecture replacing the curved Romanesque designs; this style is termed Early English Gothic and continued, with variation, {{throughout the rest of}} the Middle Ages. In the early 14th century the Perpendicular Gothic style was created in England, with an emphasis on verticality, immense windows and soaring arcades. Fine timber roofs in a variety of styles, but in particular the hammerbeam, were built in many English buildings. In the 15th century the architectural focus turned away from cathedrals and monasteries in favour of parish churches, often decorated with richly carved woodwork; in turn, these churches influenced the design of new chantry chapels for existing cathedrals.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, shortly before he designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground floor with a window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a <b>ribbed,</b> vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School {{is in the same}} style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor. It also has a canted apse on the west end, and a lean-to porch. The building was listed on 3 October 1974, and is currently classed as Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Dumpford, a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst, is Terwick Mill. It is a grade II* listed structure, and {{consists}} of two mills, side by side. They were operational until 1966. The north mill is a timber-framed building, clad with weatherboarding, dating from the sixteenth century. The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750. Although it has {{been converted into a}} house, it still contains two iron waterwheels, one for each mill, and its machinery. The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635. The adjacent mill house, parts of which date from the eighteenth century, is also a listed building. The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton, and is crossed by Trotton Bridge, dating from the early 1600s, which has five <b>ribbed</b> arches. The river then turns to the east again at Chithurst, where Abbey House, an L-shaped timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, and the parish church, much of which dates from the eleventh century, are located on the north bank. An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} <b>rib</b> {{geometric parameters}} of individual <b>ribs</b> of 14 modern human subjects (7 males and 7 females) {{in comparison to}} the reconstructed <b>ribs</b> of the Kebara 2 skeleton which was taken from the reconstruction of a Neandertal thorax by Sawyer & Maley (2005). Three-dimensional (3 D) models were segmented from CT scans and each <b>rib</b> vertex cloud was placed into a local coordinate system defined from the <b>rib</b> principal axes. <b>Rib</b> clouds were then analysed using best fitting ellipses of the external contours of the cross-section areas. The centroid of each ellipse was then used to measure the centroidal pathway between each slice (<b>rib</b> midline). Curvature of the <b>ribs</b> was measured from the mid-line of the <b>ribs</b> as the sum of angles between successive centroids in adjacent cross sections. Distinct common patterns were noted in all <b>rib</b> geometric parameters for modern humans. The Kebara 2 reconstructed <b>ribs</b> also followed the same patterns.
