25|$|Law 16: The result. The side which scores {{the most}} runs wins the match. If both sides score {{the same number}} of runs, the match is tied. However, the match may <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before the innings have all been completed. In this case, the match is drawn.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{contestant}} has either answered all five questions or <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> the host reveals {{how many people}} in the survey matched each of his/her answers. The board is then cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.|$|E
25|$|The first opening title sequence, used in {{the first}} five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ra's mask. The Stargate SG-1 {{producers}} had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before the premiere of Season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film. Ra's mask had been created in the feature film's model shop and had originally been filmed with a motion-control camera. Partly because Ra's mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show's move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated, a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for Seasons 1-5. This version uses action shots of the original cast.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the sets}} in the episode {{were created by}} Corey Kaplan. Roe, meanwhile, {{was in charge of}} the cinematography. Spotnitz complimented Rob Bowman's {{direction}} in this episode. However, he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel, reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice. He explained, [...] "It was one of those cases where you just <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> sorry to say". He later expressed a desire to one day go back and amend the effect.|$|E
500|$|By early 1989, {{the title}} of Mr. Wiggles had been retired as the band {{switched}} to the intentionally risqué [...] " [...] Daddies". Derived from a jive phrase the band had heard on a vintage race record, the name intended to reflect the group's jazz and blues influences {{as well as an}} edgy punk irreverence in the same vein as the Butthole Surfers, though the decision was ultimately made on impulse, as the members had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to figure out a name to put on their posters and doubted their longevity past a handful of shows. The band played their first show as the Cherry Poppin' Daddies at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall on March 31, 1989.|$|E

500|$|Brangwyn Hall in Swansea {{was used}} as the museum. Haynes wanted the museum to feel [...] "massive and eerie", and coached Blackwood to [...] "live in the moment". The opening {{sequence}} featuring young Amelia is filmed from her height, and was inspired by Steven Spielberg films in which people would look at things in awe. During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled with things that would seem like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night. The exhibits also included historical anomalies which were the result of history collapsing, such as penguins on the Nile. Though Blackwood appeared as the seven-year-old version of Amy in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the episode marked the first time Gillan and Blackwood—who are actually cousins—acted together. Gillan initially found this [...] "weird", but she commented that they quickly got used to it. The two versions of Amy were purposely dressed in similar colours. The cold open ends with Amy telling her younger self [...] "Okay kid, this is where it gets complicated" [...] after she has been revealed in the Pandorica. Moffat, after viewing the rushes, ordered the sequence to be reshot as Gillan had said [...] "really complicated", which conveyed a different meaning. As they had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> filming in the museum, all of the shots looking into the Pandorica were filmed three weeks later in the Pandorica chamber set.|$|E

Small, local groups of Hunt Monitors, made up of independent, private individuals, also engage in regular hunt monitoring. In 2011 the League Against Cruel Sports complained that [...] "On several occasions over the last few years, we have provided what we believed to be good evidence to Devon & Cornwall Police, but the police haven’t even moved from the starting blocks by interviewing suspects.

[...] If the Aggies win a home football game, the freshmen in the Corps of Cadets chase them around Kyle Field behind the 20 yard line, and, once they are captured, carry them across campus and toss them into Fish Pond, a fountain full of cold water. [...] A Yell Practice follows after the last Yell Leader has been thrown in. [...] Meanwhile, the Aggie fans follow the Aggie Band as they leave Kyle Field and congregate in front of the A YMCA Building for another Yell Practice. [...] The soaking-wet Yell Leaders then join the crowd, pacing back and forth across the steps of the YMCA building as they lead the fans in a yell practice against the following week's opponent.|$|E
2500|$|After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, {{appeared}} in a spoof of The Bourne Ultimatum, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon {{on the red carpet}} one time and before he could finish the interview he said, [...] "Sorry, we are out of time." [...] The most recent encounter was titled [...] "The Handsome Men's Club" [...] which featured Kimmel, along with the [...] "Handsome Men", who were: Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Lenny Kravitz, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Keith Urban, John Krasinski, Ethan Hawke, Josh Hartnett, Tony Romo, Ted Danson, Taye Diggs, Gilles Marini, and Ben Affleck, speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than Matt Damon, stating that they had <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. Jennifer Garner also makes a surprise appearance.
