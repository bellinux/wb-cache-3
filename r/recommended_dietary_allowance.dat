5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not {{confirmed}} that boron {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult dietary intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20 mg/day.|$|E
5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E

25|$|Lutein is {{a natural}} part of human diet when orange-yellow fruits and leafy green {{vegetables}} are consumed.

No <b>recommended</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>allowance</b> currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10mg/day.

Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54mg/day, respectively. For women, 10% consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement, for men fewer than 3%.|$|E

40|$|You’re {{probably}} {{familiar with}} the RDAs for vitamins and minerals. But now there are new values: the Dietary Reference Intakes. For decades, the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowances</b> (RDAs) {{have been the only}} levels established for vitamins and minerals. In the 1990 s, however, new terms were developed describing nutrient guidelines. You can see and hear about these new terms in the news, so here’s a brief explanation of the new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). DRIs: Reference values for nutrient-intake to be used in planning and evaluating the diets of healthy individuals. They include the familiar <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowances</b> (RDAs), and 3 new values: Adequate Intake (AI) ...|$|R

25|$|Women {{in other}} {{disciplines}} looked for ways to apply their expertise to the war effort. Three nutritionists, Lydia J. Roberts, Hazel K. Stiebeling, and Helen S. Mitchell, developed the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> in 1941 to help military and civilian groups make plans for group feeding situations. The RDAs proved necessary, especially, once foods began to be rationed. Rachel Carson worked for the United States Bureau of Fisheries, writing brochures to encourage Americans to consume {{a wider variety of}} fish and seafood. She also contributed to research to assist the Navy in developing techniques and equipment for submarine detection.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} a minimal acceptable intake of approximately 1.3mg/day. These values {{are considered to}} be adequate and safe for most of the general population. In North America, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) set the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> (RDA) for copper for healthy adult men and women at 0.9mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin C megadosage {{is a term}} {{describing}} the consumption or injection of vitamin C (ascorbate) in doses comparable to the amounts produced by the livers of most other mammals. Such dosages correspond to amounts well beyond the current <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> of 90 mg/day, and often well beyond the Tolerable upper intake level of 2000 mg/day. Oral dosages are usually divided and consumed in portions over the day. Injections of hundreds of grams per day are advocated by some physicians {{for the treatment of}} certain conditions, poisonings, or recovery from trauma. People who practice vitamin C megadosage may consume many vitamin C pills throughout each day or dissolve pure vitamin C crystals in water or juice and drink it throughout the day.|$|E

25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population. The USA joins these three in not publishing a <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV) based on the AI. For choline, as shown in Reference Daily Intake, 100% of the Daily Value is 550mg.|$|E
500|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} trace element, necessary for plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is [...] "typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms" [...] after iron {{and it is the}} only metal which appears in all enzyme classes.

In the U.S., the <b>Recommended</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>Allowance</b> (RDA) is 8mg/day for women and 11mg/day for men.
