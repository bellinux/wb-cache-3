Expression of the barley HVA 1 gene regulated by the rice actin 1 gene promoter led to high-level, constitutive accumulation of the HVA 1 protein in both leaves and roots of transgenic rice plants. Second-generation transgenic rice plants showed significantly increased tolerance to water deficit and salinity. Transgenic rice plants maintained higher growth rates than nontransformed control plants under stress conditions. The increased tolerance was also reflected by delayed development of damage symptoms caused by stress and by improved recovery upon the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> conditions. We also found that the extent of increased stress tolerance correlated with the level of the HVA 1 protein accumulated in the transgenic rice plants. Using a transgenic approach, this study provides direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that LEA proteins {{play an important role in}} the protection of plants under water-or salt-stress conditions.

To understand {{the process by which}} antimicrobial susceptibility is governed in environmental bacteria, it is necessary to consider the ecology of microorganisms as well as the potential impact of environmental conditions (Macfarlane et al. 2000). Just like many microorganisms, P. aeruginosa is frequently exposed to environmental stresses such as UV radiation, acid stress (pH), nutrient starvation and oxygen limitation related to organic pollution (Poole 2012 a). These stresses elicit a variety of specific and highly regulated adaptive responses that not only protect the bacterium from the offending stress, but also alter gene expression patterns (Wood and Ohman 2009) and cell physiology in ways that it can profoundly influence antimicrobial susceptibility (Macdonald and Kuehn 2013). According to Poole (2012 b), the physiological changes in a bacterium exposed to environmental stresses are often transient but occasionally permanent depending on the adaptive changes in the genetic architecture of the microorganism. McMahon et al. (2007) added that some pathogens continued to express higher levels of antibiotic resistance after <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> suggesting that in some cases sublethal stress may induce stable increases in antibiotic resistance.|$|E

In experiments conduffcted on MEMS thin-film mirrors it is demonstrated that post-release out-of-plane deformation of such structures can be reduced using this ion beam machining method.

In this study, we characterized the subcellular localization of C 9 ORF 72 to processing bodies (P-bodies) and its recruitment to stress granules (SGs) upon stress-related stimuli. Gain of function and loss of function experiments revealed that the long isoform of C 9 ORF 72 protein regulates SG assembly.

40|$|Cells are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} a variety of physiological and environmental stresses that can lead to protein aggregation and/or denaturation, and eventually cell death. In order to ensure survival, cells have evolved a stress response that monitors, detects, and responds to changes within the cellular environment. The stress response is characterized by the up-regulation of heat shock protein (hsp) genes whose products can mediate the assembly and/or degradation of misfolded or aggregated proteins within the cell. This stress-induced upregulation of heat shock protein encoding genes is under the regulation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF 1) and its associated proteins that together form {{what is known as the}} HSF 1 heterocomplex. In eukaryotic cells, HSF 1 exists as a non-DNA binding monomer in the absence of stress. Upon exposure to stress, HSF 1 undergoes trimerization and acquires the ability to bind heat shock elements (HSEs) located upstream of all hsp genes and after further modification, can become converted into a transcriptionally active form. Following prolonged stress or after <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> HSF 1 loses its ability to bind DNA and transcription ceases in a process termed attenuation. Several studies have suggested that the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of HSF 1 are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events and by chaperone-based folding mechanisms similar to those involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid receptors. Protein phosphatase 5 (PP 5) has been identified as a member of the glucocorticoid receptor chaperone complex and its phosphatase activity has been shown to regulate the maturation and activation of the receptor. It has been suggested that PP 5 may regulate HSF 1 in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoid receptors however it has not yet been determined how PP 5 interacts with the HSF 1 heterocomplex or if PP 5 functions to regulate HSF 1 -DNA binding and/or HSF 1 transactivation. Utilizing the Xenopus model system, I tested the hypothesis that PP 5 regulates the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of HSF 1 through interactions with the HSF 1 heterocomplex. Increasing the activity of PP 5, either through the elevation of PP 5 protein levels or by activating endogenous PP 5, resulted in decreased HSF 1 -DNA binding as well as accelerated attenuation after the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Conversely, inhibiting the phosphatase activity of PP 5 using okadaic acid or by immunotargetting, where an antibody recognizing PP 5 was microinjected into the nuclei of oocytes, resulted in delayed HSF 1 attenuation. Transcription assays performed using activated PP 5 also demonstrated that PP 5 acts to decrease HSF 1 -mediated transcription. Immunoprecipitation and gel mobility supershift assays were also used to show that PP 5 interacts with the HSF 1 heterocomplex and PP 5 -HSP 90 binding mutants illustrated that PP 5 may exert its repressive effects independently of binding directly to HSP 90...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{identification}} of fl-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) as the injurious substance contained in the sweet pea Lathyrus odoratus other compounds having similar effects on the connective tissue of young rats have been synthesized (1 - 3). The mechanism by which these various substances damage connective tissue has not been described. Also to be explained is the rather selective action of these agents on connective tissue at sites <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and the modification of the injury following <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stress</b> (4 - 6). The active compounds are of three types: aminonitriles, mercaptoamines, and semicarbazides. Although structurally dissimilar it is plausible that their similar biological effects result from their ability to combine and inactivate, either directly or after metabolic alteration, an enzyme. To investigate this hypothesis {{it was decided to}} study the action of aminoacetonitrile (AAN) on the cytochrome C oxidase extracted from rat connective tissue and rat myocardium. Materials and Methods Cytochrome C oxidase was prepared from fresh rat myocardium following the procedur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractToxic {{byproducts}} from infected RBC cause rheological alteration and RBC aggregation. Malaria culture supernatant has {{the ability}} to exhibit RBC aggregation. Ammonium sulfate fractionation and immunodepletion of methemoglobin from culture supernatant confirms methemoglobin as a major aggregant. In vitro treatment of RBC with methemoglobin induces irreversible high order RBC aggregates, resistant to shear stress and physical forces. Methemoglobin-mediated ROS generation in the external micro-environment to develop oxidative stress close to RBC membrane seems to be responsible for initiating and forming high order RBC aggregates through phosphatidyl-serine externalization. <b>Removal</b> <b>of</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> through antioxidant treatment abolishes high order RBC aggregate formation. In conclusion, we discovered a novel pathway of methemoglobin-mediated RBC aggregation and its potential role in patho-physiological effects during malaria...|$|R
