40|$|Objective: To {{highlight}} the registration issues for nurses {{who wish to}} practice nationally, particularly those practicing within the telehealth sector. Design: As {{part of a national}} clinical research study, applications were made to every state and territory for mutual recognition of nursing registration <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> for telenursing cross boarder practice for a period of three years. These processes are described using a case study approach. Outcome: The aim of this case study was to achieve registration in every state and territory of Australia without paying multiple fees by using mutual recognition provisions <b>and</b> the cross-border <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> policy of the nurse regulatory authorities in order to practice telenursing. Results: Mutual recognition <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> for cross-border practice was granted unconditionally in two states: Victoria (Vic) and Tasmania (Tas), and one territory: the Northern Territory (NT). The remainder of the Australian states and territories would only grant temporary registration for the period of the project or not at all, due to policy restrictions or nurse regulatory authority (NRA) Board decisions. As a consequence of gaining <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> the annual cost of registration was a maximum of 145 per annum as opposed to the potential 959 for initial registration and 625 for annual renewal. Conclusions: Having eight individual nurses Acts and NRAs for a population of 265, 000 nurses would clearly indicate a case for over regulation in this country. The structure of regulation of nursing in Australia is a barrier to the changing and evolving role of nurses in the 21 st century and a significant factor when considering workforce planning...|$|R

50|$|Inclusionary zoning (IZ), {{also known}} as inclusionary housing, is an American term which refers to {{municipal}} and county planning ordinances that require a given share of new construction to be affordable by people with low to moderate incomes. The term inclusionary zoning indicates that these ordinances seek to counter exclusionary zoning practices, which aim to exclude low-cost housing from a municipality through the zoning code. There are variations among different inclusionary zoning programs. Firstly, they can be mandatory or voluntary. There are also variations among the set-aside requirements, affordability levels coupled with the period of control. In order to encourage engagements in these zoning programs, developers are awarded with incentives for engaging in these programs, such as density bonus, expedited approval <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> <b>waivers.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper breaks {{somewhat}} {{with the}} tradition of the recent past by limiting (if not eliminating) autobiographical detail. Some particulars, however, are essential to the story in that they show what drew me into this profession and set the broad themes for my presidential address. I came to this country in 1971, fresh out of Cambridge with a BA degree in economics, under the sponsorship of Ross M. Robertson of the Indiana University School of Business. My original intent was to do an MBA and Ross had arranged a tuition <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>and</b> a small graduate research assistantship for me. It did not, however, take me long to discover that I was not MBA material [...] temperamentally, at least. Consequently, {{at the end of the}} Fall semester that first year, I switched into an obscure joint Ph. D. program at Indiana in Economics and Business. Money was tight and my search for support led to me to the door of Fred Bateman who at the time had two ongoing NSF projects and employed an army of research assistants. I became one of them and that is where this narrative really begins...|$|R
40|$|Background. Jurisdictions use {{economic}} development incentives to pursue {{goals and objectives}} set forth in an {{economic development}} policy. Incentives can be provided {{in a variety of}} forms, including cash, debt financing, credit enhancement, tax <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> <b>waivers,</b> credits <b>and</b> rebates. To accomplish objectives established in an economic development policy, agreements often include performance requirements the recipient must fulfill as a condition of the incentive extended by the jurisdiction. For this reason, {{it is the responsibility of}} the jurisdiction to evaluate the performance requirements of individual incentives as well as the cumulative impact of those incentives and agreements to ensure that the jurisdiction’s economic development objectives are realized. Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) makes the following recommendations to finance officers about ways to monitor economic development projects and program performance. For the purposes of consistency, transparency, and accountability, a clearly defined monitoring process should be a part of every economic development policy. Objectives of the monitoring process should include periodic evaluations of individual project performance by incentive and an evaluation of the cumulative costs, benefits, and degree of goal attainment of the jurisdiction’s overall program. The finance officer should be responsible for reporting the fiscal impact on the jurisdiction of each incentive used and the cumulative impact of all incentive...|$|R

40|$|In 2003 – 04 {{over half}} a million {{students}} attending the 109 California community colleges received about one billion dollars in financial aid to help meet their college expenses. Nearly all of the aided students received Board of Governors <b>Fee</b> <b>Waivers</b> to cover their enrollment fees. Less than one-half of the aided stu-dents also received federal Pell grants to help cover other educa-tion expenses, such as books and supplies, food, housing, and transportation costs, while enrolled. Both {{in terms of the}} number of students served and the total aid funds provided, the federal Pell grants and the Board of Governors <b>Fee</b> <b>Waivers</b> are the most important financial aid programs for California community college students. Both programs are need-based, which means that eligibility is primarily determined by income, and most of the awards go to lower income students. Pell grants require the student to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This long and complicated applica-tion form is used to calculate an index called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC index, which is largely based on family or personal income and assets (but considers other factors as well), is used to determine eligibility for Pell grants and other federal student aid programs. The federal aid application is also used to qualify applicants for a Board of Governors (BOG) <b>Fee</b> <b>Waiver.</b> However, students may choose to file the shorter <b>and</b> separate BOG <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> application instead of the federal form to qualify for a <b>fee</b> <b>waiver.</b> Since it is shorter and less complicated than the FAFSA, some students file only the BOG <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> application <b>and</b> skip the federal aid application...|$|R
