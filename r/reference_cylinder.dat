Powders were mechanically mixed and green compacted to ∼ 80 % theorical density in a series of cylindrical fixtures (steel tubes). The compacted arrangements were explosively consolidated using ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) to form stacks of two-phase systems. As result, successfully consolidated cylindrical monoliths of 50 mm (height) x 32 mm (in diameter) were obtained. By taking advantage of the use of SWC (shock wave consolidation) and WEDM (wire-electric discharge machining), the heterogeneous systems were machined in a highly efficiency rate. The sample cuts used for characterization and mechanical properties testing, require the use of less that 10 cc of each monolith, in consequence there was preserved an average of 60 % of the obtained system monoliths. Consolidated test cylinders of the pure Al and two-phase composites were characterized by optical metallography and TEM. The light micrographs for the five explosively consolidated regimes: aluminum powder, nano and micron-sized Al/Al 2 O 3 systems, and the nano and micron-sized Al/SiC systems exhibit similar ductility in the aluminum grains. Low volume fraction systems exhibit small agglomerations at the grain boundaries for the Al/Al 2 O 3 system and the Al/SiC system reveal a well distributed phase at the grain boundaries. Large and partially bonded agglomerations were observable in the nano-sized high volume fraction (21 %) systems, while the micron-sized Al/ceramic systems exhibit homogeneous distribution along the aluminum phase grains. TEM images showed the shock-induced dislocation cell structure, which has partially recrystallized to form a nano grain structure in the consolidated aluminum powder. Furthermore, the SiC nano-agglomerates appeared to have been shock consolidated into a contiguous phase regime bonded to aluminum grains in the nano-sized Al/SiC systems. ^ Mechanical properties were measured from the pure Al powder reference monoliths showing that the starting Al powder had a Vickers hardness of ∼ 24 HV 25; in contrast to pure Al explosively consolidated <b>reference</b> <b>cylinders</b> that had a residual hardness of ∼ 43 HV 25. Average Rockwell hardnesses were also compared with room temperature stress-strain data measured for tensile specimens cut from the test cylinders. The results were compared with rule-of-mixtures formalisms applied to these novel two-phase systems. Correspondingly the Rockwell hardness for 21 % SiC and Al 2 O 3 mixtures in Al increased by ∼ 60 %, from the Al reference (single-phase) monolith; while the elongation declined by ∼ 60 %. The prominent Al intergranular-like fracture within the 21 % (volume) SiC or Al 2 O 3 phase regime was observed by SEM. At 21 % (volume) SiC a distinct 2 -phase Al/SiC regime was formed with fracture occurring prominently in the SiC consolidated phase. The fracture surface features are somewhat characteristic of the signature variation in the stress-strain diagrams. The aluminum ductile-dimple fracture characteristics, the failure around the SiC particles and particle agglomerates producing the discontinuous yield-like phenomenon and the poor mechanical behavior of the nano-sized Al/SiC systems are characteristic of the significantly different fracture features. ...|$|R

An electromagnetic valve was used to sample pre-combustion gases from the running engine. The valve proved to be very robust {{and was able to}} sample greater than 30 mass under all test conditions. The concentration of either oxygen or carbon dioxide, the mass ow rate of the fuel, and the intake and exhaust temperatures were used to calculate the scavenging ef ciency, trapping ef ciency, trapped mass, and concentration of combustion products. A modi ed de nition of delivery ratio, based on a <b>reference</b> trapped <b>cylinder</b> mass, was used for all scavenging calculations. Good agreement was found between scavenging parameters calculated using the trapped oxygen concentration and those calculated using the trapped carbon dioxide concentration. Carbon monoxide was found to be a poor indicator of scavenging, because CO production continued after combustion. Oxides of nitrogen were theoretically good indicators of scavenging, but experimental problems with sampling were not resolved, and the NOx data were not considered to be reliable. Tests were performed with a variable delivery ratio and: a constant air/fuel ratio, a constant fueling rate, or with fueling controlled by the engine control unit. Scavenging and trapping ef ciency were shown to be strongly a function of delivery ratio. Scavenging ef ciency increased with increasing delivery ratio, and trapping ef ciency decreased. Tests were also run at constant delivery ratio with a variable air/fuel ratio or a variable engine speed.

40|$|A new coastal {{background}} {{site has}} been established for observations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the central Namib Desert at Gobabeb, Namibia. The location of the site was chosen to provide observations for a data-poor region in the global sampling network for GHGs. Semi-automated continuous measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, atmospheric oxygen, and basic meteorology are made at a height of 21 m a. g. l., 50 km from the coast at the northern border of the Namib Sand Sea. Atmospheric oxygen is measured with a differential fuel cell analyzer (DFCA). Carbon dioxide and methane are measured with an early-model cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS); nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide are measured with an off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS). Instrument-specific water corrections are employed for both the CRDS and OA-ICOS instruments in lieu of drying. The performance and measurement uncertainties are discussed in detail. As the station {{is located in a}} remote desert environment, there are some particular challenges, namely fine dust, high diurnal temperature variability, and minimal infrastructure. The gas handling system and calibration scheme were tailored to best fit the conditions of the site. The CRDS and DFCA provide data of acceptable quality when base requirements for operation are met, specifically adequate temperature control in the laboratory and regular supply of electricity. In the case of the OA-ICOS instrument, performance is significantly improved through the implementation of a drift correction through frequent measurements of a <b>reference</b> <b>cylinder...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this project}} the {{applications}} of terrestrial laserscanner for recording characteristics {{of quality of}} standing trees are examined. Furthermore it is investigated to what extent inhomogeneous bark structures, for example, branch scar, blind conk etc. can be recognized and so indicate the inner wood quality of a tree. The effects of the outward wood defects are explained by means of stems which were finished to sliced veneer. The interesting parameters are, for example, the expected block-, or rather, the loglength, the ovality in different heights, {{the volume of the}} log as well brachiness, numbers and shape of the branch scars. This method of measurement hopes to contribute to the sustainability in value and enable approximate through-cut calculations of standing trees. This problem was exemplarily investigated by analyzing seven logs of the tree species European beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus spec.) and wild cherry (Prunus avium). To detect the outward wood defects on the scanned trees the laserscans were unwound and analyzed. Firstly the trees were identified in the laserscanner data, and for every trunk, the diameters were calculated of the log ends. These diameters were averaged and yielded the diameter of the <b>reference</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which constitutes an ideal trunk. The scan coordinates were converted into picture coordinates by means of different transformation matrices. The result of this cylindrical unwinding is a 2 D-picture for every scanned tree. These pictures were applied to another analysis software, which enabled an semiautomatic wood defect detection and classification. The software works with different image algorithms as well as with a neural network, so that the recognition rate of the software can be improved by reading of training data records, and furthermore, learn from each additional picture analysis. The result of the analysis was the corresponding classification of ever...|$|E
40|$|An {{autonomous}} instrument {{based on}} off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy {{has been developed}} and successfully deployed for measurements of carbon monoxide in the troposphere and tropopause onboard a NASA DC- 8 aircraft. The instrument (Carbon Monoxide Gas Analyzer) consists of a measurement cell comprised of two high-reflectivity mirrors, a continuous-wave quantum-cascade laser, gas sampling system, control and data-acquisition electronics, and data-analysis software. CO measurements were determined from high-resolution CO absorption line shapes obtained by tuning the laser wavelength over the R(7) transition of the fundamental vibration band near 2172. 8 cm � 1. The instrument reports CO mixing ratio (mole fraction) at a 1 -Hz rate based on measured absorption, gas temperature, and pressure using Beer’s Law. During several flights in May–June 2004 and January 2005 that reached altitudes of 41, 000 ft � 12. 5 km�, the instrument recorded CO values with a precision of 0. 2 ppbv (1 -s averaging time) and an accuracy limited by the <b>reference</b> CO gas <b>cylinder</b> (uncertainty � 1. 0 %). Despite moderate turbulence and measurements of particulate-laden airflows, the instrument operated consistently and did not require any maintenance, mirror cleaning, or optical realignment during th...|$|R
5000|$|Lycoming {{is a major}} US {{manufacturer}} of civilian aircraft engines that power over one half of general aviation aircraft. They have developed and currently produce a series of flat-4 and flat-6 aircraft engines, and one flat-8 engine. The configuration is expressed in the engine's model numbers as the letter [...] "O", standing for [...] "opposed" [...] in <b>reference</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> arrangement. Franklin produced horizontally opposed flat aircraft engines beginning in the 1930s. The Franklin O-335 {{was used in the}} Bell 47 light helicopter. Continental Motors continues to manufacture flat-4 and flat-6 air-cooled aircraft engines — their initial model, the Continental A-40, appeared in 1931. Flat engines largely replaced the historically more popular radial engines in small aircraft after World War II because they were less expensive to manufacture. Radial engines have inherently good cooling, but their large frontal area increases drag. It is not difficult to design flat-6 and flat-8 engines from flat-4 designs by adding more cylinder pairs with a new crankshaft. In an air-cooled opposed-cylinder layout engine there can be cooling problems on flat-six designs, with the middle cylinder pairs. The flat-6 is smoother running than a flat-four design. Porsche adapted their 911 6 cylinder horizontally opposed air-cooled engines to become the Porsche PFM 3200 aero engine in late 1985 but, after low sales and a US$75 million investment, production ceased in 1991 - [...] "homebrew" [...] conversions of the Corvair flat-six air-cooled automobile engine have been used for powering examples of the Pietenpol Air Camper homebuilt monoplane aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, biodiesel {{has become increasingly}} important as it shows significant environmental benefits. The aim of this project is to analyze the behavior {{of different types of}} biodiesels in a diesel engine, and compare this with the behavior of conventional diesel. Biodiesel changes the emission characteristics in a diesel engine in different ways, {{depending on the type of}} biodiesel. In this project two different types of biodiesels are used, a first generation biodiesel and a second generation biodiesel. These have different fuel properties such as cetane number, energy content, viscosity and density. To analyze how these fuels change the exhaust gas characteristics and engine performance, the focus has been on experiments using a modern turbocharged diesel engine. Simulations were also done to study the experimental findings in more detail. The difference in emission characteristics when using biodiesel are most often seen as increased NOx emissions and decreased PM emissions, but this is not always the case. The experiments in this project yielded lower NOx emissions for both types of biodiesel, and higher PM emissions for the first generation biodiesel. The results from the experiments are thoroughly discussed in this report, with <b>reference</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> pressure curves, the heat release rate curves and the fuel properties. The simulations were done using two different surrogate fuels for conventional diesel, n-heptane and a mixture of n-decane and 1 methylnaphthalene. But also methyldecanoate as a surrogate for biodiesel. The simulations showed that the two diesel surrogates simulated diesel with varying accuracy, both in engine performance and engine emissions. Proper biodiesel simulations in a diesel engine were not obtained and biodiesel was therefore simulated in an HCCI engine model instead...|$|R
