Based on finite element method, the influence of fastener stiffness match on the vertical dynamic relative displacement of switch rail and dynamic gauge widening were analyzed. The result shows that: the design concept of 'soft upper and rigid lower ' can effectively decrease the vertical relative displacement of switch rail, and avoid the load of switch <b>rail</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> and {{ensure the safety of}} structure strength; It also could slow down dynamic gauge widening and serpentine movement amplitude, and improve the safety and stability of train; To ensure the safety of train, the design conception of “soft upper and rigid lower ” should be applied for the subway switch...|$|E
50|$|Signals set to {{stop for}} the diesel light rail cars are {{positively}} enforced via Intermittent Inductive Automatic Train Stop. The system is similar (but not identical) to the German Indusi system, where signal aspects are transmitted to moving trains from wayside devices. The inductive train stop devices are placed by the running <b>rails</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the absolute signals. Train's emergency brakes are automatically engaged if a stop signal overrun occurs and interlockings are designed with sufficient overlap for trains {{to come to a}} complete stop before conflicting with other traffic.|$|R

For some years, Britain {{has been said}} to have the highest <b>rail</b> fares <b>in</b> Europe, with peak-time and season tickets {{considerably}} higher than other countries, partly because <b>rail</b> subsidies <b>in</b> Europe are higher. However, they are also able to obtain some of the cheapest fares in Europe if they book <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> or travel at off-peak times.|$|R
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{has become}} an {{important}} wireless data communication tool in recent years. As much as we want to ensure data integrity and the robustness of the RFID transponder, Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) influence on the transponder can jeopardize it. Current practice put the ESD protection in the package. However at pad level, the ESD protection is usually small dimensioned to reduce input capacitance. Hence extra ESD protection co-constructed at internal circuit VDD-VSS <b>rail</b> is necessary <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> process due to thinner gate oxide. In this paper, we have developed an internal ESD protection circuit and implemented it in our previously developed 13. 56 MHz RFID transponder employing TSMC 0. 18 mu m process. The circuit has a capability to sustain 2 -KV of HBM positive mode ESD voltage, which is suitable for RFID applications. The additional power consumption for the clamp circuit is only 15. 12 nW...|$|R

40|$|On {{railroad}} tracks, {{in order}} to improve a riding comfortability and a noise suppression, the introduction of long <b>rail</b> is <b>advanced</b> <b>in</b> recent years. However, because a long rail is concluded on the long section, the elasticity of the rail accompanying a temperature change is restrained and consequently an axial stress generates. In case of the big axial stress, there is a possibility of causing a buckling and a tension fracture <b>in</b> railroad <b>rail.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we carried out the basic examination for applying a surface SH-wave acoustoelastic method to the stress measurement as an axial stress management of railroad long rails. This method is able to measure the stress of metallic materials nondestructively, even if the initial value, an acoustic anisotropy by the texture, is unknown. A T-type surface SH-wave sensor was improved for the railroad rail and the residual stress measurement in a 50 kgN rail being used for long rails of conventional lines was tried. As the result, it was demonstrated that this sensor was able to measure the residual stress nondestructively by comparing with a strain gage testing. Moreover, {{in order to}} measure the axial stress of a long rail, the side of head of the rail has been found out as a suitable measurement point which is unaffected by residual stress. On the other hand, considering the effect of thickness of the rail, {{it was found that the}} axial stress in a railroad long rail would be able to measure accurately by compensating acoustoelasticity coefficient...|$|R
