Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon {{that they can}} no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts to expose Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> his FBI file leaked.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942 Puttick was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{governors}} of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 {{the state constitution}} was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.|$|E

5|$|The French {{corvette}} {{had been}} struggling to catch up during the night and did not arrive until dawn approached, revealing the flagship in a damaged state and the British vessel even more stricken. Sailing directly at Ceylon, the corvette was able to manoeuvre around the frigate and place herself in a raking position, from which her cannon could cause heavy damage and casualties to Ceylon without reply. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> his ship destroyed, the wounded Gordon surrendered (although {{it is not clear}} whether Victor opened fire or not before the British surrender). Victors men boarded Ceylon and Gordon and his officers, including Abercromby, were taken to Vénus as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

5|$|Election {{reform is}} {{a focus of}} the Wildrose Alliance. The party proposes to set fixed {{election}} dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time. It would allow more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province's Senators <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> them appointed by the Prime Minister. The party also plans to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA. The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care, which it claims will remain compliant with the Canada Health Act, as well as controls on government spending. Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties, believing climate change science remains inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Starting with Final FantasyVIII, {{the series}} adopted a more photo-realistic look. Like Final FantasyVII, full motion video (FMV) {{sequences}} would have video {{playing in the}} background, with the polygonal characters composited on top. Final FantasyIX returned to the more stylized design of earlier games in the series, although it still maintained, {{and in many cases}} slightly upgraded, most of the graphical techniques used in the previous two games. Final FantasyX was released on the PlayStation 2, and used the more powerful hardware to render graphics in real-time instead of using pre-rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look; the game features full 3D environments, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> 3D character models move about pre-rendered backgrounds. It is also the first Final Fantasy game to introduce voice acting, occurring throughout the majority of the game, even with many minor characters. This aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to the character's reactions, emotions, and development.|$|E
5|$|The 1st King's, still roled as 15th (King's) Parachute Battalion, {{remained}} in India {{with responsibility for}} the area around Meerut, north-east of New Delhi. After reconverting to standard infantry, the battalion departed for Liverpool in late 1947. In April 1948, the 2nd King's deployed to the British Mandate of Palestine for two weeks. The battalion carried out internal security duties in the prelude to Israel's establishment for two weeks before its return to Cyprus. When the army reduced its strength, the 2nd King's chose to be absorbed by the 1st <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> its lineage terminated. On 6 September 1948, the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment, Major-General Dudley Ward. The battalion was posted to West Germany shortly afterwards and moved to West Berlin in February 1951.|$|E

5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that could shoot back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E

Ten days after the World's Fair closed, the citizens of St. Louis chose to buy the 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage for $3,500, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>have</b> it dismantled and returned to Washington, D.C.
