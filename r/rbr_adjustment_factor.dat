40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{process in}} construction cost estimation {{is the appropriate}} adjustment of costs to reflect project location. Unfortunately, location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> from adjacent locations, {{referred to as the}} nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> was evaluated against an established cost index database and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors.</b> When compared with NN and other alternative location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25 - 40 % reduction of the median absolute error.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundAdjustment of {{body weights}} for {{systematic}} environmental effects such as dam age and litter size {{is essential for}} accurate prediction of breeding values in meat sheep and often accomplished by pre-adjusting records using simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors,</b> which are derived as ratios of least-squares means of weights of lambs in target and reference classes. However, increasing use of multibreed genetic evaluations that incorporate data from both purebred and commercial flocks has generated concerns regarding the ability of simple additive or multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> to properly correct for environmental effects in flocks that differ widely in mean performance. Thus, consistency of <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> across flocks and systematic effects {{of the level of}} flock performance on these factors were evaluated using data from the US National Sheep Improvement Program. MethodsWe used birth and weaning weights of lambs from 29 flocks that had at least 500 records per flock and represented several terminal-sire sheep breeds. Effects of lamb sex, dam age class and litter size on birth weights, and of dam age class and combined effects of type of birth and rearing on weaning weights were evaluated. Interactions between these effects and flock were assessed. Bias associated with different adjustment protocols was evaluated for high- and low-performance flocks. ResultsEffects of litter size and differences between yearling and adult dams varied (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) among flocks. For weaning weights, additive <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were not associated with the level of flock performance, but multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were strongly and inversely related to flock means for weaning weights (W). Flock-specific <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> (F[*]=[*]αWβ) reduced bias in adjusted weaning weights associated with differences in flock performance. By contrast, simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were appropriate to adjust birth weights. ConclusionsDifferences in weaning weights among single, twin, and triplet lambs were inversely related to the level of flock performance. Use of simple multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> led to <b>adjustment</b> bias when applied across flocks with large differences in mean performance.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the joint effects of age at calving and month of calving on lactation milk yield and to compute appropriate <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> for milk yield. A total of 29 315 edited lactation records of Zimbabwean Holstein dairy cows collected from 1979 to 1994 by the Zimbabwe Dairy Herd Improvement Association (ZDHIA) were used. The data were divided into two sub-sets. The first set of 16 073 records was used to develop multiplicative age-month <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> and for determination of genetic parameters. The second data set with 13 242 records was used for verification of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors.</b> This was done to test the effectiveness of multiplicative age-month <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> which were developed in this study. An Animal Model was run in the Average Information — Restricted Maximum Likelihood (AIREML) software package. The multiplicative <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> for lactation milk yield varied with age at calving and month of calving. The factors were highest in young cows (1. 21), decreasing with increasing age at calving and were lowest (0. 89) at mature age (72 to 84 months). After 72 to 84 months the <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> started increasing. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>factors</b> were also highest (1. 21) in summer (December, January and February) and lowest (0. 89) in winter (May, June and July). Heritability estimates were highest for first lactation cows and were low for later lactation cows. The heritability estimates were similar for both adjusted and unadjusted records. The heritability estimates for the unadjusted records were 0. 38, 0. 26, 0. 24 and 0. 21 for first, second, second and over, and all combined lactations, respectively.
