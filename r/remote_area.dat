30|$|Participation in FDCs may be {{understood}} {{for many reasons}} including a lack of LDC provisions in regional and <b>remote</b> <b>areas,</b> family preference for FDC rather than LDC services or families in regional and <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> needing flexible hour care (e.g., weekends, evening/overnight care, holiday care) due to work circumstances (e.g., mining operating 24 / 7). For many reasons FDC is more convenient for people in regional and <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> reflecting relatively higher numbers than in cities (see Table 2). Further {{research is needed to}} identify the specific reasons for these choices, as there are potential policy implications directed to prevent disadvantages for families and children living in regional and <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> of Australia.|$|R
5|$|Groups of anti-Rwandan {{government}} rebels {{like the}} FDLR, {{and other foreign}} fighters remain inside the DRC. The FDLR which is the greatest concern, was some 6,000 strong, in July 2007. By late 2010 the FDLR's strength however was estimated at 2,500. The other groups are smaller: the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, the Ugandan rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces in the <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> of Mt Rwenzori, and the Burundian Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E

40|$|Teachers are the {{determining}} factor in whether the implementation of education is successful. Research has shown that teachers make the biggest contribution to student achievements. In the midst of limited school facilities and infrastructure, especially in <b>remote</b> <b>areas,</b> the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role is even more important. However, various research {{studies show that the}} teacher absentee level in <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> in developing countries is still quite high. This occurs because teachers in <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> have to deal with many complex problems, including limited facilities within the school, difficulties in accessing the school because of the terrain surrounding the school, lack of transportation facilities, and high cost of transportation. The disproportionate size of the problems faced by teachers, in comparison with the incentives they receive, can lead to teachers being demotivated and can decrease the performance of teachers in carrying out their jobs. Thus, {{it is very important that}} a satisfactory incentive is given to teachers in <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> so that education in <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> does not continue to be left behind in comparison with more developed areas...|$|R

However, poor access to the <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> {{and the lack of}} accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.|$|E
5|$|After losing {{half its}} strength, No. 38 Squadron {{remained}} at Changi and conducted supply and aeromedical evacuation flights throughout Malaya {{to support the}} British-led forces there. The squadron's aircraft were also occasionally used to mark targets ahead of bombing raids and to drop propaganda leaflets. From April to July 1951, No. 38 Squadron and an attached flight from No. 41 Squadron RNZAF was stationed at RAF Kuala Lumpur, and was the main unit tasked with dropping supplies to Commonwealth forces in the field. The squadron made another deployment to Kuala Lumpur between November 1951 and February 1952. In February 1952, No. 38 Squadron successfully parachuted 54 personnel from the British 22nd Special Air Service Regiment into a <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> near the Malaya-Thailand border.|$|E
5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until {{the coming of}} the railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, it sought to employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a work ethic and leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians. This mixture failed to stabilize the <b>remote</b> <b>area,</b> which lacked formal social, political, and economic organization in the years from the Gadsden Purchase to the Civil War.|$|E
40|$|Our study {{reviewed}} {{policies in}} 8 high-income countries (Australia, Canada, United States, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Croatia and Estonia) in Europe, Australasia and North America {{with regard to}} hospitals in rural or <b>remote</b> <b>areas.</b> We explored whether any specific policies on hospitals in rural or <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> are in place, and, if not, how countries made sure that the population in <b>remote</b> or rural <b>areas</b> has access to acute inpatient services. We found that {{only one of the}} eight countries (Italy) had drawn up a national policy on hospitals in rural or <b>remote</b> <b>areas.</b> In the United States, although there is no singular comprehensive national plan or vision, federal levers have been used to promote access in rural or <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> and provide context for state and local policy decisions. In Australia and Canada, intermittent policies have been developed at the sub-national level of states and provinces respectively. In those countries where access to hospital services in rural or <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> is a concern, common challenges can be identified, including the financial sustainability of services, the importance of medical education and telemedicine and the provision of quick transport to more specialized services...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the <b>remote</b> <b>area,</b> technology {{available at the time}} and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been the}} shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board the plane, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with caribou being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s.

5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara.
