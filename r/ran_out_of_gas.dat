25|$|It was 21 {{years before}} the Greys again made it as far in the playoffs. In 1960-61, they {{finished}} first in the Central Junior B Hockey League and rolled to the championship by defeating the Hamilton Bees and the Siskins, avenging the 1940 loss. Owen Sound then eliminated the St. Marys Lincolns in a semifinal series but <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the Sutherland Cup final against the St. Michael's Buzzers, losing in four straight games. To this day, the Greys have never {{made it back to}} the Sutherland Cup final.|$|E

She put him and his sister in the car she was driving at the time, a silver 1998 two-door Acura Integra, and headed for Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue. She later stated that around the 2600 block of 112th Street N.E. in that city, a long undeveloped section of the road that follows a tall concrete noise barrier around the curve of the Washington State Route 520 expressway, just west of its interchange with Interstate 405, she <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012 at Phoenix, Harvick led {{part of the}} race, battling former rival Kyle Busch, but Denny Hamlin led {{the rest}} of the race on the last pit stop. Harvick tried to close on Hamlin, but scored a second-place finish after he <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> with two laps to go, leaving Hamlin the race winner. He managed to cross the finish line holding off the pack for second place. Although winless, Harvick made the Chase through consistency. At the second stop at Phoenix, Harvick avoided a chaos filled race to collect his only win of the season, and the 19th of his career.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September, Li {{successfully}} {{qualified for}} the 2013 WTA Tour Championships, as the fifth qualifier. She won all three of her round robin matches against Sara Errani, Jelena Janković and Victoria Azarenka, thus qualifying for the semifinals for the first time. Upon beating Petra Kvitová her ranking rose to a new career high of world No. 3, the highest-ever ranking for a female tennis player from an East Asian and Asian country and overtaking Maria Sharapova and Agnieszka Radwańska. In the final she made a strong start, blasting 10 winners en route to winning the first set against Serena Williams, but <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> at 3-all in the second, losing nine {{games in a row}} to lose the match.|$|E

25|$|Prefontaine set the American {{record in}} the 5000 meters at the 1972 Olympic Trials in Eugene on July 9. An underdog at the 1972 Olympics in Munich in September, Prefontaine {{took the lead in}} the 5,000 m final during the last mile and ended the slow pace of the first two miles, {{negative}} splitting the race. In second place {{at the start of the}} bell lap, he fell back to third with 200 meters to go. Lasse Virén took the lead in the final turn over silver medalist Mohammed Gammoudi. Prefontaine <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> with 30 meters to go as Britain's hard-charging Ian Stewart caught him from behind and moved into third place within ten meters of the finish, depriving Prefontaine of an Olympic bronze medal.|$|E
25|$|Harvick {{then went}} on to collect four {{straight}} Top 10 finishes at Daytona, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Indianapolis. Upon returning to Pocono, his day ended quickly as he blew an engine just 20 laps into the race. He ended up in the 42nd position. It was his first DNF since the previous year's Duck Commander 500 at Texas. He nearly won the Cheez-It 355 at Watkins Glen, but <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> on the last corner. This allowed Joey Logano, who was second at the time, to win the race. Harvick was able to cross the finish line, scoring a third-place finish. He {{then went on}} to finish second in the Pure Michigan 400 the following week, and at the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol as well. During Labor Day Weekend at Darlington in the Bojangles' Southern 500, he finished fifth after leading 44 laps. The first race of the Chase took place at Chicagoland. Harvick finished 42nd after getting a flat tire and spinning into the wall due to contact with Jimmie Johnson a few laps earlier on a restart. A confrontation did take place, after Harvick met with Johnson and punched him in the chest. Harvick dominated next week at Loudon, leading 216 of 300 laps. However, he <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> allowing Matt Kenseth to win. Harvick finished 21st, putting him in danger of being eliminated from the Chase. The following week at Dover International Speedway, Harvick dominated a majority of the race to earn third win of the season, leading 351 of 400 laps in the process. That win allowed Harvick to clinch a spot into the next round of the Chase, after narrowly avoiding being eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Though Edwards {{finished}} 11th at Chicago and 9th at New Hampshire {{to start}} the Chase, his Chase chances were ended with a 35th-place finish at Dover caused by an ill-handling car. He then had a fifth-place finish at Kansas, 10th place at Charlotte, a 17th place at Talladega, and 12th place at Martinsville. At Texas, Edwards started on pole and battled Jimmie Johnson for the lead on several restarts, before his engine blew up and he finished 37th. At Phoenix, Edwards and Johnson nearly wrecked each other in turn 1 mid-race but both cars continued on. Edwards <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> with 2 laps left leading. Edwards finished 21st. He ended {{the season with a}} 12th-place finish at Homestead, and a 13th-place finish in the final points standings.|$|E

25|$|In the Daytona 500, Earnhardt started 9th. His car {{hung around}} mid-pack {{for most of}} {{the first quarter of the}} race. After a six-hour and 22-minute red flag, Earnhardt's car came alive, taking the lead with 70 laps remaining. He led 54 of the last 70 laps and he held off Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski to win his second Daytona 500, just 10 years after his first one. The {{following}} week at Phoenix, Earnhardt continued his momentum, finishing 2nd to Kevin Harvick. At Las Vegas, Earnhardt gambled on fuel in the remaining 40 laps, but he <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> while leading on the last lap, finishing 2nd to eventual race winner Brad Keselowski. At Bristol, he was strong early, and had a chance to become the first driver since Richard Petty to start a season with four straight Top 2 finishes, until tire problems forced him to make an unscheduled stop, leaving him to finish 24th, four laps down.|$|E
25|$|Busch's No. 51 {{was parked}} on lap 99 by NASCAR after Busch drove away from track workers that were tending to his car, which {{had run out}} of gas and crashed on the back straightaway after being {{accident}}ally spun out by Jamie McMurray. He had been leading the race before the accident and soon the medical assistance arrived. Busch exited the car but realized that his fuel tank was not completely empty and tried to drive it to the garage for repairs. As a medical bag was dragged with the car and slipped off NASCAR ordered Kurt to stop his car for the medical assistance but Busch did not put his helmet back on after he exited the car and could not hear any orders over the radio. His car <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> just in turn 4 and NASCAR officials picked him up and parked the No. 51 team {{for the remainder of the}} race. Busch said goodbye to his team members since he was to drive the No. 78 car for a multi-year deal after the race and when asked about the incident, Busch said that he ignored the order because he did not have his helmet on and could not hear his crew chief's order to stop. NASCAR investigation that week proved that this appeal was true and therefore they did not penalize Busch any further after the parking.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Burton {{opened the}} season by winning the second Gatorade Duel {{qualifying}} race, edging out his Richard Childress Racing teammate Clint Bowyer. After that, Burton's season went downhill. He was leading the Daytona 500 halfway when his engine gave out. He nearly won the Coca-Cola 600 but got spun out on the final restart. Though wanting another caution, the yellow flag never came out because NASCAR {{wanted to see the}} race finish under green, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. was leading when the accident occurred. His teammate Kevin Harvick passed Earnhardt Jr. within the last 500 yards of the race, because Dale Jr. <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas.</b> This led to controversy because fans were speculating that NASCAR wanted Earnhardt to win and go back to victory lane in {{the first time in three}} years. Burton's first top 10 came in the twenty first race at Watkins Glen International. Burton missed the 2011 Chase but had a strong run at the fall race at Talladega, leading on the last lap and out of turn four being pushed by Clint Bowyer. At the tri-oval, Bowyer slingshotted to Burton's outside and won by a hood, giving Richard Childress his 100th win as a team owner, Bowyer redeeming his 0.002 second loss to Jimmie Johnson at the track in the spring. In 2012, Burton gained the sponsorship in Wheaties, BB and EnerSys. The 31 team also switched crew chiefs too, and Drew Blickensderfer became the crew chief. After a dismal 2012, Blickensderfer was released 4 races early and Luke Lambert became Burton's crew chief in 2013. Shane Wilson became interim crew chief until the end of 2012. Burton had 6 Top 10's in 2012 including a dramatic 2nd-place finish at Daytona in July after saving his car from spinning on the final lap. At the AdvoCare 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, Burton would make his 1,000th career NASCAR start, the sixth driver in NASCAR history to do so.|$|E

500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> {{on its way to}} victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? You have to ask yourself that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E
