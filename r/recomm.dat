40|$|Background Stem cell {{transplantation}} {{has become as}} a novel treatment  for end-stage kidney, lung, heart, liver diseases and several hematologic disorders. Improved survival of transplant recipients has raised awareness of post-transplant complications. One of these complications is transplant-related osteoporosis. Methods  In this manuscript we review prevention methods for transplant-related osteoporosis according to the literature. Results Transplant-related osteoporosis is due to both pre-transplant and post-transplant factors. The most common pre-transplant factor is low bone mineral density related to the underlying disease. The most common post-transplant factor is consumption of immunosuppressive regimens. Bone loss is most rapid in the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation with subsequent slowing thereafter, due {{to a reduction in}} immunosuppressive dose and resolution of pretransplant conditions that were deleterious to skeletal health. For prevention of this problem it is <b>recomm</b> ended to measurement of bone mineral density before transplantation. Also all patients should receive counseling about quit smoking, early mobilization after transplantation, regular weight-bearing exercise and fall prevention. Patients should receive 1000 mg/day of calcium and 800 units/day of vitamin D before transplantation. Higher vitamin D doses should be given for patient with vitamin D deficiency. The lowest prednisone dose compatible with graft survival is recommended. Conclusion  It is necessary to consider preventive measures for reduce transplant-related osteoporosis.

40|$|The Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship {{provides}} a framework for antibiotic stewardship for outpatient clinicians and facilities that routinely provide antibiotic treatment. This report augments existing guidance for other clinical settings. In 2014 and 2015, respectively, CDC released the Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs and the Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes. Antibiotic stewardship is the effort to measure and improve how antibiotics are prescribed by clinicians and used by patients. Improving antibiotic prescribing involves implementing effective strategies to modify prescribing practices to align them with evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management. The four core elements of outpatient antibiotic stewardship are commitment, action for policy and practice, tracking and reporting, and education and expertise. Outpatient clinicians and facility leaders can commit to improving antibiotic prescribing and take action by implementing at least one policy or practice aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing practices. Clinicians and leaders of outpatient clinics and health care systems can track antibiotic prescribing practices and regularly report these data back to clinicians. Clinicians can provide educational resources to patients and families on appropriate antibiotic use. Finally, leaders of outpatient clinics and health systems can provide clinicians with education aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing and with access to persons with expertise in antibiotic stewardship. Establishing effective antibiotic stewardship interventions can protect patients and improve clinical outcomes in outpatient health care settings.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this report is to present the {{findings}} of a five-day course for AKEPT – the Malaysian Leadership Academy in the Ministry of Higher Education. The course was held from March 24 - 28 th, 2014, for over 50 lecturers, professors, deputy deans and deans from Malaysian universities. Design/methodology/approach: Senior lecturers and professors deliberated for the first three days on the futures of higher education in Malaysia. They presented their scenarios and <b>recomm</b> ndations to the deans. The deans used these findings to articulate their own preferred futures in the last two days. The future-oriented discussions were framed by the “six pillars” futures approach (Inayatullah, 2008; Inayatullah, 2015; Inayatullah and Milojevic, 2015). Findings: The core of their recommendation consisted of a move by 2025 from the current fragmented university governance structure to a streamlined consortium model. Instead of the factory, a collection of linked longhouses or “rumah panj ng” was offered as a way forward. This new model would have two immediate benefits: considerable cost savings and enhanced mobility for students and professors. Research limitations/implications: This case study presents scenarios and strategies. Limitations include the willingness of the Ministry to act on these recommendations. However, as this course was part of a number of foresight processes in Malaysia, even if these particular recommendations do not realize, they are steps in creating an ecology o foresight and of possible university transformation. Practical implications: This study links causal layered analysis, scenarios and visions to recommendations {{in the context of a}} multi-year foresight process. Social implications The study includes valuable discussions by leading Malaysian thinkers and administrators on the futures of the university. Originality/value: This was one of the few workshop-oriented interventions used the anticipatory action learning “six pillars framework”. It is especially valuable as it is the third year of futures intervention in higher education. The study contrasts with traditional expert-based forecasting in Asia...|$|E

40|$|Tickborne rickettsial {{diseases}} {{continue to}} cause severe illness {{and death in}} otherwise healthy adults and children, despite the availability of low-cost, effective antibacterial therapy. Recognition early in the clinical course is critical {{because this is the}} period when antibacterial therapy is most effective. Early signs and symptoms of these illnesses are nonspecific or mimic other illnesses, which can make diagnosis challenging. Previously undescribed tickborne rickettsial diseases continue to be recognized, and since 2004, three additional agents have been described as causes of human disease in the United States: Rickettsia parkeri, Ehrlichia muris-like agent, and Rickettsia species 364 D. This report updates the 2006 CDC recommendations on the diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases in the United States and includes information on the practical aspects of epidemiology, clinical assessment, treatment, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention of tickborne rickettsial diseases. The CDC Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, in consultation with external clinical and academic specialists and public health professionals, developed this report to assist health care providers and public health professionals to 1) recognize key epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of tickborne rickettsial diseases, 2) recognize that doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected tickborne rickettsial diseases in adults and children, 3) understand that early empiric antibacterial therapy can prevent severe disease and death, 4) request the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic tests and understand their usefulness and limitations, and 5) report probable and confirmed cases of tickborne rickettsial diseases to public health authorities.

40|$|During {{atmospheric}} re-entry and hypersonic flight, a {{bow shock}} forms around the vehicle leading edge. The air becomes super-heated {{as it passes}} through the shock, ionizes and forms a plasma sheath. This sheath prevents transmission of electromagnetic waves with frequencies {{similar to those used}} for radio communications. This phenomenon {{is referred to as the}} “communications blackout. ” In this dissertation, hypersonic communications blackout is studied, and a method for ameliorating the blackout is presented. A plasma source was designed and built for the purpose of simulating a re-entry plasma sheath. The plasma number density in a re-entry plasma sheath ranges from 10 ^ 14 m− 3 - 10 ^ 18 m^− 3. A helicon source was chosen to simulate the conditions during atmospheric re-entry because it produces high-density plasma while maintaining that density downstream of the source. For this reason, and because the electron temperature downstream of the source (1 eV- 6. 5 eV) is of a similar order of magnitude as that found during re-entry (0. 4 eV- 1 eV), the helicon source was deemed appropriate. The Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory helicon source was found to produce an upstream ion number density of 2. 5 x 10 ^ 19 m^− 3. Downstream, where experiments with the plasma amelioration system were performed, the number density ranged from 0. 55 × 10 ^ 17 m^− 3 - 3. 3 × 10 ^ 17 m^− 3, which represent altitudes between 65 km and 75 km. After characterizing the helicon plasma source, the amelioration system was placed downstream. The re-entry and hypersonic vehicle plasma communications (<b>ReComm)</b> system consists of a single solenoid electromagnet with two electrodes perpendicular to the magnetic field. The crossed fields direct plasma away from a region surrounding an antenna, creating a “window” in the sheath through which radio signals can pass. Langmuir probe, hairpin resonance probe and signal attenuation measurements show that the system is effective at reducing the number density to 80 % of that measured when no fields are present. However, the system did not perform as expected. The majority of the reduction occurred with only the presence of the magnetic field. Possible explanations were studied using both analytical methods and COMSOL to model the fields. The shape of the magnetic field itself contributed greatly to the plasma number density reduction...|$|E
40|$|When a novel {{influenza}} A virus with pandemic potential emerges, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) {{often are}} the most readily available interventions to help slow transmission of the virus in communities, which is especially important before a pandemic vaccine becomes widely available. NPIs, also known as community mitigation measures, are actions that persons and communities can take to help slow the spread of respiratory virus infections, including seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. These guidelines replace the 2007 Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 d Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions ([URL] Several elements remain unchanged from the 2007 guidance, which described recommended NPIs and the supporting rationale and key concepts {{for the use of}} these interventions during influenza pandemics. NPIs can be phased in, or layered, on the basis of pandemic severity and local transmission patterns over time. Categories of NPIs include personal protective measures for everyday use (e. g., voluntary home isolation of ill persons, respiratory etiquette, and hand hygiene); personal protective measures reserved for influenza pandemics (e. g., voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members and use of face masks in community settings when ill); community measures aimed at increasing social distancing (e. g., school closures and dismissals, social distancing in workplaces, and postponing or cancelling mass gatherings); and environmental measures (e. g., routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces). Several new elements have been incorporated into the 2017 guidelines. First, to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs, the latest scientific evidence available since the influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm 09 pandemic has been added. Second, a summary of lessons learned from the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic response is presented to underscore the importance of broad and flexible prepandemic planning. Third, a new section on community engagement has been included to highlight that the timely and effective use of NPIs depends on community acceptance and active participation. Fourth, to provide new or updated pandemic assessment and planning tools, the novel influenza virus pandemic intervals tool, the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, the Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework, and a set of prepandemic planning scenarios are described. Finally, to facilitate implementation of the updated guidelines and to assist states and localities with prepandemic planning and decision-making, this report links to six supplemental prepandemic NPI planning guides for different community settings that are available online ([URL] citation for this article: Qualls N, Levitt A, Kanade N, et al.

Twenty participants from various ministries attended. Between 25 June and 7 Jul y 1988, a National Workshop on Agricultural Planning and Sector Analysis was held in the s ame venue. It included an introduction to the use of CAPPA, with practical computer demonst rations. As a result, CAPPA is now recognized as a potentially useful tool for agricultur al planning in Jordan, and the project provided the assistance of two international consulta nts to begin the application of the software in the preparation of the 1990 - 1994 Five-Year Develo pment PlanThe project also conducted an assessment of Jordan's trained manpowe r needs for agricultural planning and project analysis. This showed that, although over a third of professional employees working in agricultural planning and project analysis in the main public and semi-public institutions had attended training courses in these subje cts, there were many significant gaps in the training of this category of employees and, as a re sult, agricultural planning has suffered from a scarcity of well-trained manpower. On -the-job training had also been inadequate. It was concluded that the relatively small n umber of graduates in agricultural economics meant that the need for adequate training pr ogrammes had increased; refresher courses for those who graduated in the 1960 s and 1970 s wer e needed, and more on-the-job training for those who had graduated in the 1980 s was <b>recomm</b> endedAlthough it was the original intention that a project supporting agr icultural policy analysis and planning be formulated for the consideration of UNDP, it was agreed that this should not be done until a second project funded by the FAO Technical Coope ration Programme, TCP/JOR/ 8951, `Assistance in Agriculture Policy Analysis', was comple ted, so that its findings might be taken into accountIt was recommended that training in this sector become a continuous process, which would require the development and application of supporting policies and m easures, including an appropriate personnel policy.

40|$|Has Technical update: Technical {{update on}} HIV- 1 / 2 {{differentiation}} assays. 2016. This document updates recommendations for HIV testing by laboratories in the United States and offers approaches for reporting test results to persons ordering HIV tests and {{to public health}} authorities. The recommended algorithm is a sequence of tests used in combination to improve {{the accuracy of the}} laboratory diagnosis of HIV based on testing of serum or plasma specimens. In brief, testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 antibodies and HIV- 1 p 24 antigen. All specimens reactive on this initial assay undergo supplemental testing with an immunoassay that differentiates HIV- 1 from HIV- 2 antibodies. Specimens that are reactive on the initial immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the antibody differentiation assay proceed to HIV- 1 nucleic acid testing for resolution. CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) have issued these recommendations based on HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of December 2012 and scientific evidence, laboratory experience, and expert opinion collected from 2007 through December 2013. These recommendations do not include the rapid HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 antigen/antibody combination test approved by the FDA in August 2013 (for which evidence of performance in the algorithm was insufficient) or HIV- 2 nucleic acid tests, which lack FDA approval. Because none of the assays in the recommended algorithm are FDA-approved for use with oral fluid or dried blood spot specimens, these updated recommendations do not supersede previous recommendations for testing of dried blood spots or oral fluid for HIV- 1 using the FDA-approved immunoassay and HIV- 1 Western blot for these specimen types.
