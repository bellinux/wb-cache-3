The forestland {{is an area of}} secondary growth trees such as earleaf acacia, eucalyptus, yemane, ipil-ipil, mahogany and narra. [...] On the ridges above 700 m are areas of Benguet pine forests mixed with montane Dipterocarp trees. The open grasslands occupying the flat areas near Pantabangan Lake primarily consist of cogon grass, samon and talahib. Alibangbang trees also grow abundantly in the reserve. In February 2014, the smallest species of the Rafflesia parasitic plant, the Rafflesia consueloae, was discovered within the reserve on Mount Pantaburon and Mount Balukbok near the Pantabangan and Masiway hydroelectric dams.|$|E
