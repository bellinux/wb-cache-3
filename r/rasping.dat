5|$|Blacklock, racing {{under his}} {{name for the}} first time, started the 1818 season much earlier than he had done the {{previous}} two seasons, with his first race coming on 18 May at the York Spring Meeting in a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each over two miles. He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's <b>Rasping,</b> who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from <b>Rasping,</b> with Hornby in third and Whiff last of the four runners.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rasping</b> {{advertising}} call {{is readily}} {{distinguished from the}} hwitt-hwitt-hwitt of spotted crake, the monotonous clockwork tak-tak-tak-tak-tak of striped crake, or the quick-quick of Baillon's crake. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{call of the}} nelicourvi weaver is a high-pitched, very {{distinct}} chizz-chizz-chizz, {{which is}} more metallical and <b>rasping</b> when the birds are in feeding groups. Other calls that can be heard when the birds are at the nest include tsrrreee, tiang-tiang, and chet. The song, which is produced while being at the nest sounds like chiz-chizz-chswriissssiszz.|$|E

40|$|A spring-mounted <b>rasp</b> bar sheller for com is {{described}} herein. The sheller comprises {{a plurality of}} spaced apart <b>rasp</b> bars mounted on a combine or sheller cylinder. Each of the <b>rasp</b> bars has studs secured thereto which extend therefrom through the cylinder backing plates. Springs are mounted on the studs behind the backing plates for yieldably urging the <b>rasp</b> bar inwardly towards the backing plate. Centrifugal force causes the <b>rasp</b> bar to move out radially towards the concave as the cylinder is rotated. During shelling, impact forces on the <b>rasp</b> bars deflect them radially inwardly. Filler plates are also disclosed for preventing the com from becoming lodged between the backing plate and the <b>rasp</b> bars...|$|R

5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, <b>rasping</b> small pieces of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the St. Leger, Blacklock faced St. Helena over the same course and {{distance}} in the Gascoigne Stakes, which he won easily. Twenty-four hours later, Blacklock lost to The Duchess in the Doncaster Club Stakes over two miles. On 8 October at Richmond he won a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each, beating four rivals, with Boroughman finishing second. Later in the day Blacklock won the Dundas Stakes, beating <b>Rasping,</b> D.I.O and Shepard into second, third and fourth respectively.|$|E
5|$|While the Arctic tern {{is similar}} to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are {{slightly}} different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and <b>rasping</b> than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by <b>rasping</b> the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles. The same day he also walked over for a sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the St. Leger course. Twenty-four hours later he beat <b>Rasping</b> to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor Syntax in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor Syntax had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about half a mile from the finish, when Doctor Syntax joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor Syntax to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized <b>rasping</b> mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
50|$|The Bronze Age and the Iron Age had {{various kinds}} of files and <b>rasps.</b> Archaeologists have {{discovered}} <b>rasps</b> made from bronze in Egypt, {{dating back to the}} years 1200-1000 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered <b>rasps</b> made of iron used by the Assyrians, dating back to the 7th Century BC.|$|R

25|$|Adults {{can make}} <b>rasping</b> sounds with their wings and can emit high pitched {{squeaking}} sounds that are audible to humans.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{commonly}} feed on {{the blood}} of mammals. They are able to reopen wounds that are almost completely healed. Mouthpart morphology in the genus ranges from sponging mouthparts to mouths with <b>rasping</b> teeth. Many species have enlarged prestomal teeth. The metathoracic spiracle is covered in long, thick setae. The average male Hydrotaea is 6.5-8.5mm and the average female is 5.75-7.5mm. They are very light brown to bluish black with large, red eyes and plumose antennae.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the more}} ancient {{lineages}} of gastropods, the radula is used to graze by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates. Limpets scrape algae from rocks using radula equipped with exceptionally hard <b>rasping</b> teeth. These teeth have the strongest known tensile strength of any biological material, outperforming spider silk. The mineral protein of the limpet teeth can withstand a tensile stress of 4.9 GPa, compared to 4 GPa of spider silk and 0.5 GPa of human teeth.|$|E

5000|$|When a RAM {{is acting}} as a <b>RASP,</b> {{something}} new has been gained: unlike the RAM, the <b>RASP</b> has the capacity for self-modification of its program-instructions (the state-machine instructions are frozen, unmodifiable by the machine).

25|$|Kali means joy or fun and games. This is {{also known}} as Koladi, Kolkali, Kambadi Kali and Kolaattam. Sticks one foot length are held in each hand and beaten to make a sharp, <b>rasping</b> sound as the dance {{proceeds}} with unique steps, twisting and turning. It is danced by both men and women, during festivals, auspicious days and weddings. The special qualities of the dance are quickness, alertness, while being careful not to hurt the other dancers by the swinging 'kol'. Earlier, the 'kols' were brightly painted and decorated with brass rings, bells etc. The dancers used to wear ankle-bells. However, no special dress or make up was used for this dance.|$|E
25|$|After {{three weeks}} of age, Maguari stork nestlings develop {{defensive}} behaviour if their nest is approached by an intruder; which is not known for nestlings of other stork species. They crouch forward, partially spread their wings and erect the black feathers on their head, neck and back; followed by a shrill, <b>rasping</b> scream and an attempt to grab a persistent intruder with their bill. In many other stork species, akinesia lasts {{throughout much of the}} nestlings’ early life, and the constantly white plumage makes them appear as eggs to potential chick predators. However, in maguari stork nestlings, akinesia ceases much earlier, and the unusual aggressiveness of the young has probably developed as a specialised anti-predator strategy in compensation for the young chicks’ inability to leave the nest due to their slow-developing hallux and the vulnerable position of the nest on the ground. However, at 25–35 days old, the hallux is sufficiently developed to allow the chicks to leave ground nests in search of food. Chicks also occasionally beg for food from their parents outside the nest, but parents have never been observed to feed their young outside the nest.|$|E
25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. It was three shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and slid the ball into an empty net. It got worse for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a <b>rasping</b> effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on with an effort drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when he swept home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E

500|$|The red-billed tropicbird {{usually only}} calls near {{breeding}} colonies, where it joins in with groups of other adults, numbering from 2 to 20, in circling above {{the sea and}} making loud, harsh [...] kreeeee-kreeeee-kri-kri-kri-kr screams.

500|$|Most {{molluscs}} are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders. [...] For those grazing, two feeding {{strategies are}} predominant. Some feed on microscopic, filamentous algae, often using their radula as a 'rake' to comb up filaments {{from the sea}} floor. [...] Others feed on macroscopic 'plants' such as kelp, <b>rasping</b> the plant surface with its radula. [...] To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.|$|E
