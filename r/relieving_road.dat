50|$|Long-term {{plans call}} for {{upgrading}} higher-quality roads and integrating the road system into the European grid. The focus is on improving road connectors with the neighbouring countries and domestic connections linking Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas and Varna. Bulgaria has delayed building some key highway connections since the 1990s, but European Union membership is a strong incentive for completion. A 114-kilometer link between eastern Bulgaria and the Turkish border is scheduled for completion in 2013. As of 2004, two international highways passed through Bulgaria, and a major highway ran from Sofia to the Black Sea coast. Proposed international corridors would pass from north to south, from Vidin to the border with Greece and from Ruse to the border with Greece, and west to east, from Serbia through Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Edirne (Turkey). The Vidin-Calafat bridge was completed in 2013, <b>relieving</b> <b>road</b> and railroad traffic to Romania.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2006 a {{proposal}} was announced {{to open a}} new station at Dalcross, which would serve Inverness Airport and also provide park-and-ride facilities for commuters to Inverness, <b>relieving</b> <b>road</b> congestion to the east of Inverness, and so helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The proposal was still open in 2010, and it was specified that the station could have one platform {{on the north side of}} the line, 150 m long, enough for a six-car Class 170 train. The proposed location of the station was given as having an eastern end at an overbridge at 136 mi (...) , extending westward to 136 mi. There was also the possibility of providing a passing loop, which could not extend further west than the level crossing; a second platform would be built on the south side of the loop. In February 2011, Keith Brown, the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure in the Scottish Government, stated that discussions on the proposed station (and another at [...] ) were being held between Transport Scotland and Network Rail. A £170 million infrastructure upgrade project for the line, funded by Transport Scotland, was announced in 2014. Provision for station reopenings here and at Kintore were included in the plans, along with signalling & track improvements, relocation of the station at [...] and platform extension works along the route.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand the congestion relief impacts of public transport. It is suggested in this research that none of the existing measures of traffic congestion provides information {{on the extent to which}} traffic congestion is relieved by public transport. In addition, previous studies related to traffic congestion relief have not quantified the relationship between the presence of public transport and the amount of traffic congestion of a city. The research develops a new measurement index which can be used as a relative measure of the city-wide congestion relief impacts of public transport. The proposed research framework consists of three main components: a congestion relief valuation framework that compiles relevant evaluation research and explores mode shift; an experimental modelling approach that analyses changes in congestion measures as a result of alternative public transport scenarios; and a relative measure development method that constructs a congestion relief index for expressing the city wide congestion relief impact of public transport in a generalised form. An examination of secondary evidence demonstrating changes in mode split associated with changes in public transport suggests that about one third of existing public transport users would contribute to additional car trips if public transport were removed. This includes all car drivers and half of the car passengers. A comparative assessment of international research valuing the congestion relief benefits of public transport reveals that congestion relief impacts are valued at between 4. 4 and 151. 4 Australian cents (2008 value) per marginal vehicle-kilometre of travel with an average of 45. 0 cents. Valuations are higher for circumstances with greater degrees of traffic congestion and also where both travel time and vehicle operating cost savings are considered. Experimental transport modelling analysis has been performed to understand the spatial distribution of congestion relief and the effects of different public transport modes. In addition, a new measure called the congestion relief index (CRI) has been developed for use as a comparative index of the congestion relief impact of public transport in cities. The proposed CRI integrates a number of different dimensions of city and transport characteristics into a single measure. The lessons learned from this study include (i) public transport plays a significant role in <b>relieving</b> <b>road</b> traffic congestion in cities; (ii) the wider significance of public transport in relieving congestion outside the central location of the metropolitan area challenges the traditional view that public transport and its impact on congestion is an issue only for central cities; (iii) public transport modes differ in their contribution to congestion relief, but the particular characteristics significantly influencing this impact include patronage, trip length, and spatial coverage; (iv) large-scale public transport systems in large cites provide significant high congestion reduction benefits in comparison to a small-scale systems in small cities; (v) the underlying dimensions of elements affecting the congestion relief impact of public transport in cities can be classified into three broad categories – (1) the public transport-oriented factor, (2) the car-deterrence factor, and (3) the urbanform factor; (vi) the car-deterrence factor has the strongest influence on public transport congestion relief, followed by the public transport-oriented factor and the urban-form factor; (vii) high congestion relief impacts are obtained in cities characterised by high public transport availability and patronage, high urban density and low car ownership and use...|$|E

50|$|Criticisms of {{the plan}} include adding yet more lanes to already-oversized highways, and adding traffic to smaller roads by putting exits on them. Another major {{criticism}} is that it fails to consider commuter rail, light rail, or any other rail system seriously as an alternative. There are already state-owned rail tracks running CSX freight trains parallel to I-75, and Georgia Northeastern Railroad tracks branching off parallel to I-575, which would cost far less {{in terms of both}} money and disruption from construction. Though cleaner-burning natural gas buses would likely be used, there are no plans that call for them to be trolleybuses with an overhead double-catenary system, such as in Seattle and Vancouver. Part of the problem is also that Georgia's constitution prohibits state gasoline tax money from being spent on anything except roads, which makes other alternatives like trains very difficult to fund, even though their entire intent is to <b>relieve</b> <b>roads.</b> This was further worsened when the state sales tax was removed on gasoline and the gas tax was raised instead.|$|R

40|$|Russia has a {{well-developed}} {{and powerful}} transportation system. However, the entire transpon infrastructure {{was designed to}} meet the needs of a closed and centralized economy. It has become clear that the current road network does not fillfill Russia's social and economic needs. The growth of Russia's road network has fallen far behind motorization rates and the growing demand for road transportation. This gap is a result of the low level of investment in road infrastructure, especially during the last decade. The lack of an adequate stock of roads is particularly evident in Moscow, leading to extremely high traffic congestión, with adverse consequences in terms of wasted time, air pollution, noise, climatic effects, etc. Increased investment in road infrastructure is necessary to reduce Moscow's road congestión. To this end, in addition to increasing public investment, it would be helpful to involve the prívate sector by means of public-private partnerships (PPP). This paper analyses the issues surrounding road concessions and the challenges and difficulties of using a PPP model in Russia. First, the study analyses data on the evolution of the road network and of transport demand in Russia over the last decade. These data illustrate the difficulties of maintaining the road network and of responding to the growing transport demand. Then the paper reviews the challenges of PPP projects aimed at improving the road network, focusing on two recently granted motorway concessions near Moscow. Finally, prospects for further development of public-private partnerships to <b>relieve</b> <b>road</b> congestión in the Russian capital are explored...|$|R
