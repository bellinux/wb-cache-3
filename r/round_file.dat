It came with a crimped magazine tube that allowed it to be loaded with only two shells in the magazine. One additional round placed in the chamber brought its total capacity to three shells.

The dimples pressed into the magazine tube can be removed with a <b>round</b> <b>file</b> from the inside, allowing the magazine to accept 4 shells instead of just 2.|$|E
50|$|Steeling helps {{maintain}} sharpness. This process realigns the edge, correcting for dulling causes {{such as a}} rolled edge. A sharpening {{steel is}} a type of hardened cylindrical rod used similarly to honing stones. For example, a butcher steel is a <b>round</b> <b>file</b> with the teeth running the long way, while a packer steel (used in the meat packer's industry) is a smooth, polished steel rod designed for straightening the turned edge of a knife, and is also useful for burnishing a newly finished edge. Because steels have a small diameter they exert high local pressure, and therefore affect the knife metal when used with very little force. They are intended for mild steel knives that are steeled several times a day, but are not well suited for today's tougher and harder blade steels. Diamond steels are now available that have an industrial diamond coating and can remove blade metal as well as straighten, therefore used correctly they can re-profile a knife instead of just honing.|$|E

40|$|The file {{cutting edges}} {{are the most}} {{important}} parameter that influence the performance of the filing operation. The practice shows that the most efficient way of generating these cutting edges is by penetration, by blow, of a cutting tool, which creates a plastic deformation on the file body. The penetration depth is probably the most important factor of the final quality of a file. In the existing machines of files manufacturing, this depth is manually adjusted by the operator, using specific mechanism. This means that files are manufactured on an empirical basis, relying on subjective factors, that do not allow to keep constant quality level of the production. In a research work, being developed in the University of Minho, it is intended to eliminate the subjectivity factors by the means of the evolution of the present “all-mechanical” system to a “mechatronic” one. In this paper, which is related with that research work, it presented a study of a round files production machine, regarding the identification, as well as the categorisation, of the operating parameters that affect the cutting edges production. They are, as well, defined and quantified those factors that influence the final quality of a <b>round</b> <b>file...</b>|$|E

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and <b>round</b> <b>files</b> for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
60|$|A small dark-coloured ant {{sometimes}} migrates {{in countless}} numbers. One day, at Bahia, my attention was drawn by observing many spiders, cockroaches, and other insects, and some lizards, rushing {{in the greatest}} agitation across a bare piece of ground. A little way behind, every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant. The swarm having crossed the bare space, divided itself, and descended an old wall. By this means many insects were fairly enclosed; and the efforts which the poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death were wonderful. When the ants came to the road they changed their course, and in narrow files reascended the wall. Having placed a small stone so as to intercept one of the lines, the whole body attacked it, and then immediately retired. Shortly afterwards another body came to the charge, and again having failed to make any impression, this line of march was entirely given up.

30|$|The {{reusability}} of biocatalyst is a {{key factor}} for {{the efficiency of the}} whole-cell bioconversion in industrial application. Due to the highest volumetric productivity from 2  M l-Glu as the substrate, cycling of the recombinant E. coli cells was investigated using 2  M crude l-Glu as the initial concentration (Fig.  6 b). In cycle 1, all l-Glu was converted to GABA in 5  h with a yield of 204.87  g L− 1. In cycle 2, the complete conversion only lasted 4  h with a yield of 205.13  g L− 1. However, in cycle 3, the conversion time was increased to 6  h to achieve over 99  mol% conversion. Notably, cells disruption were observed during the bioconversion, and about 10  % or more cell loss after completion of each <b>round</b> (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Fig. S 4). Thus, one batch of cells could be reused for at least three cycles at a conversion yield over 99  mol% using 2  M crude l-Glu, and the total GABA production reached 614.15  g L− 1 within 15  h. The high production and productivity of our bioconversion is a promising cost-effective resource for GABA in industrial application.|$|R

40|$|My thesis, Nursing Rounds and Their Importance from Nurses and Patients Points of View, {{is divided}} into a {{theoretical}} and practical part. The theoretical part consists of three main chapters. The first chapter describes nursing as a field of science; the second deals with the nursing process in connection to nursing rounds; and the third presents nursing rounds. Nursing rounds {{are very important to}} provide patients with high quality care. They enable patients to get more information about their illnesses, following examinations, nursing processes, rehabilitation, etc. There is a continuous contact between nurses and their patients that is why nursing rounds are important for both, patients and nurses. The practical part deals with nursing rounds. The aim of this work was to find out if nursing rounds are practised at standard wards in Písek Hospital, Inc.; investigate about their importance for nurses and clients; and see patients opinions on these rounds. There were three hypotheses: Hypothesis no. 1 : Nursing rounds are not usually practised at wards; Hypothesis no. 2 : Nurses do not consider these rounds to be important; Hypothesis no. 3 : Patients/ clients are not sufficiently informed about nursing <b>rounds.</b> The <b>file</b> for my questionnaire research was created by nurses and patients of standard wards (surgery, internal medicine, orthopaedic, gynaecology- obstetric, urologic, and neurological ward) in Písek Hospital, Inc. There were two different questionnaires; one of them contained 19 questions for nurses, and the other one 15 questions for patients. According to the results, hypotheses 1 (nursing rounds are not usually practised at standard wards in Písek Hospital, Inc.) and 3 (most of the patients do not know the term nursing round and have never heard about it) proved valid.

The individual household method (IHM) {{was developed by}} Evidence for Development as a reliable, standardised method of collecting and using household income data that is suitable for operational use. IHM work involves both in-person data collection {{and the use of}} specialised analytical software, open-IHM, which can be used to manage complex household data and produce reports, models and predictions to inform policy-making. This data set includes anonymised data from project areas Masumbankunda, Malawi; Karonga, Malawi; Tigray, Ethiopia; Assela, Ethiopia. Please also see related file on Qualitative Impact Assessment (QUIP) data which includes some qualitative data collected from a sub-sample of the same households included in this study (only <b>Round</b> 2 <b>files</b> - <b>Round</b> 1 households were not from the same sample set). Project description: How can the impact of development activities intended to benefit poor men, women and children caught up in complex processes of rural transformation best be assessed? The research set out to develop and evaluate a protocol for impact assessment based on self-reported attribution without the use of comparison groups as an alternative to experimental or quasi-experimental designs based on statistically inferred attribution. The three year project, starting in September 2012, was led by James Copestake at the University of Bath, and conducted in collaboration with three NGOs - Self Help Africa, Farm Africa, and Evidence for Development. It was jointly funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Department for International Development DFID. The research piloted the approach with four projects: two in Ethiopia and two in Malawi. Strand 1 comprised a baseline and two rounds of annual monitoring of food security and income at the household level by NGO staff. Strand 2 comprised two rounds of annual in-depth interviewing to elicit self-reported attribution from intended project beneficiaries. All data collected from these strands is deposited with UK Data, with this entry comprising the data for Strand 1...|$|R
