5000|$|... "Samuel Adams Darcy" [...] {{was born}} Samuel Dardeck in 1905 in the Ukraine, {{the son of}} Fagella Weissbly and Isidor Dardeck. In 1908 {{he and his family}} immigrated to New York. He spent his early years growing up in New York City, {{attending}} DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, and eventually New York University. [...] At an early age Darcy witnessed his father, an ardent union member, severely beaten by police at a garment workers picket line. According to Darcy that was a defining moment in the development of his own political beliefs. [...] During a 1998 radio interview, he recalled: [...] My father was a worker in American factories until his 79th year. He {{was a member of the}} International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and I was about ten years old when he started taking me to union meetings. He was in Local 35. It ignited an interest in American workers' welfare that has stayed for me to this day, in fact... We tried to organize child laborers. When I was twelve and a half years old, I worked for the O'Sullivan <b>Rubber</b> <b>Heel</b> Company in Lower Manhattan about 1917... From my previous couple of years in my father's union, I became interested in organizing young child laborers, who were employed illegally, against laws which prohibited children from working in factories below the age of sixteen. We organized something called the Young Workers League. In the YWL, we looked around for help, working out a program for improvement... I read the findings of Darwin... and the Communist Manifesto.|$|E

5000|$|Quentin Martin {{writes about}} the images within The Five-Forty-Eight. He explores {{multiple}} examples of imagery within the story. First he writes about when Blake was walking in downtown Manhattan and turns to see a plate of glass. Inside that was a domestic model that contained cups of coffee, magazines, and flowers in vases. But, the cups were empty of coffee, the flowers were dead in the vase, and the guests had not come. But, Blake saw his own reflection in the plate glass. Martin explains that this illustrates a [...] "false-front emptiness" [...] where Miss Dent thinks Blake's life is full of friendships, money, and a large and loving family but in reality sleeps in a room by himself, torments his wife, and all but abandoned his son to a neighbor. Martin also states that his domestic woes and ego dived behavior which is fueled by what he perceives as people wronged him. However, this all accumulates to his behavior being as open as the store-front window according to Martin. He then introduces another image theory about the ride home on the train. Martin explains that {{the first and third}} ad, that depict a women and man toasting wine and a Hawaiian Dancer; show visual manifestations of Blake's and Miss Dents emotional desolation and psychological dysfunction according to Martin. One final image that Martin explores is the Cat's Paw ad. Where a once popular <b>rubber</b> <b>heel</b> placed on the bottom of a shoe to prevent slipping and falling is actually a metaphor for Blake and Miss Dent. Martin explains when Miss Dent states, [...] "You’re the only obstacle between me and my happiness" [...] that the first and more literal meaning is that Blake is between her and the station ads that represent the relationship she seeks. But also Blake is the heel between Miss Dent and her happiness.|$|E

Major acquisitions included high-end shoe maker Florsheim in 1952, Canada's largest shoe maker Savage Shoes, Ltd. in 1954, and Caribe Shoe Corporation of Puerto Rico in 1958. That last deal led to the closing of a plant in Chester, Illinois, that had operated since 1916 and was making 5,000 shoes a day. A retail division began in 1959, and International Shoe began buying companies in other countries and even in businesses other than shoes.|$|R
40|$|The law {{of trade}} symbols is of modern development, largely judge-made and only partly codified. Its impetus {{comes from the}} demands of modem advertising, a black art whose {{practitioners}} {{are part of the}} larger army which employs threats, cajolery, emotions, personality, persistence and facts in what is termed aggressive selling. Much aggressive selling involves direct personal relationships; advertising depends on the remote manipulation of symbols, most importantly of symbols directed at a mass audience through mass media, or imprinted on mass-produced goods. The essence of these symbols is distilled in the devices variously called trade-marks, trade names, brand names, or trade symbols. To the courts come frequent claims for protection, made by those who say they have fashioned a valuable symbol, and that no one else should use it. Very recently, for example, the vendors of Sun-Kist oranges lost a court battle to prevent an Illinois baker from selling Sun-Kist bread. The highest court, in its most recent encounter with a like case, upheld the power of a manufacturer of rubber footwear to prevent the use of a red circle mark by a seller of <b>rubber</b> <b>heels,</b> which the plaintiff did not manufacture...|$|R

He wore special shoes with light leather uppers that laced nearly to the toes, <b>rubber</b> <b>heels,</b> and leather soles. From the beginning, Brignolia fought for the lead with Dick Grant, also a veteran of the two previous marathons. Brignolia finally established a lead of 200 yards {{at the top of the}} hill that would later be called Heartbreak Hill. By Coolidge Corner, the 22 ½ mile mark, Brignolia had an 11-minute lead on Grant and was five minutes ahead of McDonald’s year-old record. Here his handler, concerned about Brignolia’s lack of preparation, made him slow his pace in order to conserve his energy. At St. Mary’s Street, 1-½ miles from the finish, he stepped on a loose stone, turning his ankle, and he collapsed to the ground. He was immediately rubbed down by his handlers for five minutes, after which he walked and ran to the finish line in a time of 2:54:38 to win the race. Grant finished three minutes later.|$|R
