5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} <b>rostrum,</b> and {{the sides of the}} abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the <b>rostrum,</b> the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E
5|$|It has paired {{blowholes}} on {{a prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped <b>rostrum.</b> A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the <b>rostrum</b> tip. A light V-shaped marking, the chevron, begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is similar}} to that of Madagascan Paratriaenops, but the premaxilla is longer. The <b>rostrum</b> (front part of the skull) is {{well-developed}} and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in Paratriaenops; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow. Compared to other species of Triaenops, the <b>rostrum</b> is relatively narrow and short, similar to T.parvus; T.afer and T.persicus have a broader <b>rostrum.</b> The front margin of the <b>rostrum</b> is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line passes over the roof of the <b>rostrum.</b> The infraorbital foramen, an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the maxillaries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In T.menamena, these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in Paratriaenops. The braincase is lower than in other species of Triaenops. The sagittal crest, which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed. In the mandible, the coronoid process is blunt and rounded, but the angular process (both processes at the back of the bone) is small.|$|E

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped <b>rostrum</b> that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no <b>rostrum.</b> It begins to form shortly after hatching. The <b>rostrum</b> is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{distinctive}} in {{its large}} skull with broad, well-developed incisors {{and a strong}} front part (<b>rostrum)</b> that is strongly curved downwards. In O.albiventer, the <b>rostrum</b> and incisors were not as massive, but the molars are larger. The interparietal bone, part of {{the roof of the}} braincase, was broad and the incisive foramina, which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars, were relatively short.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies O. g. gloveri has a {{dark gray}} cheek and smoky yellow <b>rostrum.</b> O. g. brookei has an orange russet tipped nose, and light gray spotted above the eyes. The Glover's pika {{is similar to}} the Chinese red pika, but it is distinguished by its smaller auditory bullae, more slender <b>rostrum,</b> and longer nasals than the Chinese red pika. It also does not have the reddish mantle as possessed by the Chinese red pika.|$|E

50|$|Feliforms {{tend to have}} shorter <b>rostrums</b> than caniforms, fewer teeth, {{and more}} {{specialized}} carnassials. Feliforms {{tend to be more}} carnivorous and are generally ambush hunters. Caniforms tend more toward omnivorous and opportunity-based feeders.|$|R
5|$|The <b>rostrum</b> of H.americanus bears {{one or more}} spines on the underside, {{which are}} lacking in H.gammarus.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the <b>rostrum</b> (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter <b>rostrum</b> and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Their {{elongated}} {{upper and}} lower jaws form {{what is called a}} <b>rostrum,</b> or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open.|$|E

5000|$|Xiphiorhynchus is an extinct genus {{of prehistoric}} ray-finned fish. It {{is a member}} of the Xiphiidae, {{commonly}} known as swordfish or broadbills. Unlike the modern swordfish, both its upper and lower jaws were extended into blade-like <b>rostrums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sclerorhynchiformes is {{an order}} of extinct batoids with long, {{serrated}} <b>rostrums</b> {{very similar to those}} of sawsharks and sawfishes. While they are neither, they are more closely related to sawfishes, and are included alongside them in the clade Pristiorajea.|$|R
5|$|Fossil {{sperm whales}} differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered <b>rostrum.</b> Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene, with the {{possible}} exception of Aulophyseter, had teeth in their upper jaws. Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short <b>rostrum</b> and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale). Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales.|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the <b>rostrum</b> (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the <b>rostrum</b> (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. The frontal bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E
50|$|Sclerorhynchoidei is an extinct {{suborder}} of sclerorhynchiform rays with saw-like <b>rostrums.</b> They {{include the}} orders Sclerorhynchidae and Ptychotrygonidae. They were a rather long-lived group, living from the Cretaceous {{to the early}} Eocene, until they became extinct for unknown reasons and were replaced by their close relatives the pristiformes.|$|R

5|$|In the skull, the <b>rostrum</b> (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} is relatively narrow. The frontal bones are inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle part of the palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the <b>rostrum,</b> buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its <b>rostrum</b> is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
50|$|The Pituriaspida ("Pituri Shield") are a {{small group}} of extinct armored jawless fishes with {{tremendous}} nose-like <b>rostrums,</b> which lived in the marine, deltaic environments of Middle Devonian Australia (about 390 Ma). They are known only by two species, Pituriaspis doylei and Neeyambaspis enigmatica found in a single sandstone location of the Georgina Basin, in Western Queensland, Australia.|$|R
25|$|Orators, <b>Rostrums,</b> and Propaganda Stands {{is based}} on the work of Gustav Klutsis, {{including}} his designs for Screen-radio Orators, <b>Rostrums,</b> and Propaganda Stands from 1922. Each of four virtual orators displays a black and white animation from a contemporary mass uprising: Tank Man near Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989; the assassination of Neda Agha-Soltan, who was gunned down in the streets of Tehran during the 2009 Iranian election protests; scenes from Tahrir Square in Cairo during the 2011 Arab Spring; and the 2011 Occupy Wall Street uprising. Each of these images is juxtaposed, in montage, with frames from the Odessa Steps scene of Sergei Eisenstein‘s historic Battleship Potemkin film. When touched, the virtual objects play sound from the uprising. The stands call up both the resurgence and nostalgia of current worldwide political idealism as they re-imagine the museum plaza in the function of the public square.|$|R
2500|$|Oviraptorosaurians have {{shortened}} <b>rostrums,</b> massive, beaklike mandibles, {{and long}} parietal bones. [...] With {{the exception of}} the 8-meter long Gigantoraptor, they are generally medium-sized and rarely exceeded 2 meters in length. The most primitive members have four pairs of teeth in the premaxillae, such as in Caudipteryx and in Incisivosaurus they are enlarged and form bizarrely prominent bucktoothed incisors. The more advanced members have no teeth in the jaws.|$|R
5|$|Mindomys hammondi {{is known}} only from Ecuador, where {{it occurs in}} montane forest; a record from the Amazon basin {{lowlands}} is dubious. Reportedly, it lives {{on the ground and}} is associated with water; other suggest it lives in trees. A large, long-tailed, and long-whiskered rat, its fur is buff above and abruptly lighter below. The front part of the skull (<b>rostrum)</b> is heavily built.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1939, Hitler {{went to the}} Bürgerbräukeller beer hall in Munich for {{the annual}} anniversary celebration of the {{attempted}} putsch of 1923. He began speaking around 8:10 pm, earlier than usual because he had urgent business in Berlin. He left the hall at around 9:07 pm. About thirteen minutes later, a time bomb which had been concealed inside a pillar behind the speaker's <b>rostrum</b> exploded, killing eight and injuring sixty-three.|$|E
5|$|The family Balaenidae {{contains}} two genera and four species. All the Balaenidae whales have no ventral grooves; a distinctive head shape with a strongly arched, narrow <b>rostrum,</b> bowed lower jaw; lower lips that enfold {{the sides and}} front of the rostrum; long, narrow, elastic baleen plates (up to 9 times longer than wide) with fine baleen fringes; and fused cervical vertebrae rendering the head immobile.|$|E
