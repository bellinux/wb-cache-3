5|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include <b>remacemide,</b> coenzyme Q10, riluzole, creatine, minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
5|$|Tetrabenazine was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or <b>remacemide</b> are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide</b> is most {{commonly}} synthesized as the salt <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride. However, {{there has been}} some investigation into other <b>remacemide</b> salts and their crystals, as different <b>remacemide</b> salts might taste more pleasant or have a solubility more suitable for a pediatric suspension formulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide</b> is {{also known}} as <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride, (±)-2-amino-N-(1-methyl-1,2-diphenylethyl)-acetamide hydrochloride, or FPL 12924AA.|$|E
50|$|Ramacemide does {{interact}} with carbamazepine. <b>Remacemide</b> inhibits the metabolism of carbamazepine, while carbamazepine induces the metabolism of <b>remacemide</b> and FPL 12495.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Remacemide</b> binds weakly and noncompetitively to the ionic channel {{site of the}} NMDA {{receptor}} complex. <b>Remacemide</b> binds both allosterically and in the channel. However, because <b>remacemide</b> binds so weakly to NMDAR, much of remacemide's in vivo effect against excitotoxicity {{is thought}} to be caused by its metabolic transformation to the more potent desglycine derivative FPL 12495. [...] That is, <b>remacemide</b> may actually act as a prodrug to deliver the active metabolite FPL 12495 to the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>remacemide</b> {{has only}} a modest effect on seizure {{frequency}} and causes dizziness, {{it is no longer}} believed that <b>remacemide</b> will be an effective treatment for epilepsy. Although no such statement has been made about remacemide's potential for treating stroke, Huntington's, or Parkinson's, <b>remacemide</b> is no longer being developed for these conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide</b> delays the {{absorption}} of levodopa (300 mg of <b>remacemide</b> one hour before levodopa treatment delays mean time to peak levodopa plasma concentration by 20%) but not its total absorption (area-under-the-curve for levodopa plasma concentration was unchanged).|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{treatments}} for epilepsy, <b>remacemide</b> {{does not appear}} to impair cognitive performance or driving performance in humans, although the evidence for effects on cognitive performance in animals has been mixed. <b>Remacemide</b> is not a sedative.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Remacemide</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} drugs under {{development}} by the now-defunct English pharmaceutical company Fisons. [...] In 1995, it was acquired along with most of Fisons' research and development operations by the Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra, which in 1999 merged with the British company Zeneca to form AstraZeneca. [...] In 2000, AstraZeneca considered possibly licensing out <b>remacemide</b> to some other pharmaceutical company, but there has been little news about <b>remacemide</b> since then. Remacemide's development may have been discontinued in July 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide</b> {{does not}} {{interact}} with sodium valproate, {{a treatment for}} epilepsy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Remacemide</b> {{was last}} {{mentioned}} in AstraZeneca's reports on its R&D pipeline in 2000, {{when it was}} in Phase III clinical trials for <b>remacemide</b> {{in the treatment of}} Huntington's disease and Phase II for treatment of Parkinson's disease. At that time, the submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and the Marketing Authorization Application to the CHMP was projected for Huntington's in 2001 and for Parkinson's after 2003, but there has been no news of such submission. In this report, it was also noted that <b>remacemide</b> was [...] "under strategic review and a potential candidate for licensing activity" [...] (see this external article about drug licensing.) ...|$|E
50|$|FPL 15455 is an oxoacetate matabolite of <b>remacemide,</b> {{but has no}} {{demonstrated}} biological activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{values for}} 50% {{displacement}} of 3HMK801 were 68 µM for <b>remacemide</b> and 0.48 µM for FPL 12495AA.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{clinical}} trials of <b>remacemide</b> in progress, {{according to the}} Huntington Study Group, and the Parkinson Study Group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide,</b> {{under the}} trade name Ecovia, was {{designated}} an orphan drug {{for the treatment}} of Huntington's Disease by the FDA in March 2000.|$|E
50|$|FPL 14331 and FPL 14465 are the p-hydroxy-desglycinates of <b>remacemide,</b> {{and they}} exhibit some {{efficacy}} against maximal electroconvulsive shock after i.p. and i.v. dosing.|$|E
50|$|FPL 15053 is the N-hydroxy-desglycinate of <b>remacemide,</b> and {{exhibits}} modest binding to NMDAR and modest effects on convulsions and mortality in test mice and rats.|$|E
50|$|Compounds {{that have}} failed to prevent or slow {{progression}} of Huntington's disease in human trials include <b>remacemide,</b> coenzyme Q10, riluzole, creatine, minocycline, ethyl-EPA, phenylbutyrate and dimebon.|$|E
50|$|The hydroxy-methyl {{derivative}} of <b>remacemide</b> (FPL 13592) and its desglycinate (FPL 15112) prevents electric shock-induced convulsions only after i.v. administration; only the desglycine derivative binds to NMDAR.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, when Astra {{acquired}} <b>remacemide,</b> it {{was already}} in Phase IIb clinical development as an anti-epileptic drug and Phase I clinical development {{as a treatment for}} Huntington's.|$|E
50|$|The (-)stereoisomer of <b>remacemide</b> is {{of equal}} potency to the racemic mixture in {{preventing}} maximal electroshock seizures when administered orally to rats, while the (+)stereoisomer is less potent.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Remacemide</b> {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a low-affinity NMDA {{antagonist}} with sodium channel blocking properties. [...] It has been studied {{for the treatment of}} acute ischemic stroke, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|The median {{toxic dose}} of <b>remacemide</b> for neural {{impairment}} tests in mice is 5.6 mg/kg.Its estimated {{median lethal dose}} is about 927.3 mg/kg in mice.It has a favorable therapeutic index of 28.1 in mice.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{after the}} merger, AstraZeneca {{reported}} that they were investigating <b>remacemide</b> for its neuroprotective effects, and that they planned regulatory submissions for Huntington's Disease in 2001 and for Parkinson's disease and epilepsy in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|FPL 14991 and FPL 14981 {{are both}} β-Miydroxy-desglycinates of <b>remacemide,</b> and they display modest {{efficacy}} against maximal electroconvulsive shock in mice. [...] However FPL 14981 and not FPL 14991 prevents NMDLA-induced convulsions and mortality in mice.|$|E
5000|$|By 1998, when Astra {{announced}} its merger with Zeneca, <b>remacemide</b> had progressed to Phase III trials for epilepsy and Phase II trials for Parkinson's disease, and Astra was also investigating {{its potential for}} treating neuropathic pain ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Remacemide</b> is an {{experimental}} drug most recently {{being developed by}} the British multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. However, {{there has been little}} news of its progress since 2000. A few sources indicate that its development has been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The brain uptake index (BUI), {{a measure}} of a drug's ability to pass the blood-brain barrier that {{involves}} the injection of radiolabeled test and reference substances into the common carotid artery of anesthetized animals, for <b>remacemide</b> is 51 ± 0.9 SD.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, {{researchers}} at Fisons found that <b>remacemide</b> acted as an anticonvulsant in {{mice and rats}} [...] [...] Because of remacemide's potential as a neuroprotective agent through preventing glutamate toxicity, it was soon also under investigation {{as a treatment for}} Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|In a well {{validated}} {{and described}} genetic model of absence epilepsy, rats of the WAG/Rij strain, <b>remacemide</b> and its metabolite FPL 12495 {{were found to}} have a common for glutamate antagonist usual effect on the number of spike/wave dischargesEEG, the drugs decrease spike/wave dischanges dose dependently. However, in contrast to most other glutamate antagonists, FPL 12495 increased the duration of the spike-wave discharges.|$|E
5000|$|Much of remacemide's {{effect in}} vivo {{is thought to}} be caused by the desglycine {{derivative}} FPL 12495 (±).FPL 12495 (±) binds specifically and non-competitively to NMDAR,. [...] Its effect on maximal electroconvulsive shock is more potent than <b>remacemide.</b> [...] The S isomer (FPL 12859) is even more potent than the racemic mixture, while the R isomer is less potent than the racemate.|$|E

50|$|Devinsky {{serves as}} the {{director}} of the Phenome Core for the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, funded by an NIH multi-institutional grant. Devinsky and his co-investigators are conducting studies of several investigational antiepileptic medications such as topiramate, tiagabine, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine, and <b>remacemide,</b> as well as vagal nerve stimulator implantation. He is also collaborating with other researchers to develop a device to deliver antiepileptic drugs directly to the brain to treat seizures.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study {{investigated}} the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride in adult patients (n= 59) with refractory epilepsy, undergoing reduced or discontinued antiepileptic drug (AED) usage, {{as part of an}} evaluation for epilepsy surgery. On discontinuation or reduction of maintenance AEDs, patients received <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride, up to 600 mg daily, or placebo, for up to ten days or until they experienced a fourth complex partial (CPS) or a generalised tonic–clonic (GTC) seizure. Pre- and post-study blood and urine samples were taken for analysis. <b>Remacemide</b> hydrochloride showed a significantly (P= 0. 045) longer median time to fourth seizure compared with placebo (6. 8 vs. 3. 8 days). Median nine-day seizure counts were significantly (P= 0. 0327) lower with <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride than placebo (6. 2 vs. 12. 8). Eleven <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride patients and six placebo patients completed ten days’ treatment. <b>Remacemide</b> and desglycinyl metabolite levels were lower in patients receiving concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin than in those receiving non-inducing AEDs or <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride alone. No serious adverse events occurred; all patients receiving <b>remacemide</b> hydrochloride completed the study. <b>Remacemide</b> hydrochloride was well tolerated and showed significant therapeutic activity in this patient population...|$|E
