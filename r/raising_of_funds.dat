25|$|Pope Pius IX {{appointed}} him Bishop of Melbourne, {{and he was}} consecrated bishop by John Bede Polding on 6 August 1848 (the feast of the Transfiguration) in old St Mary's Cathedral Sydney. He transferred to Melbourne, travelling overland in 19 days, being installed on 8 October 1848 in his first Cathedral, St Francis Church in Lonsdale Street. Goold was only the second Roman Catholic bishop in Australia. He arrived in his new town to find only two Catholic church buildings, four priests in the diocese, no religious sisters or brothers, and a population around 11,000. Five acres of land on Eastern Hill, after negotiations begun in 1848, were finally granted by the crown on 1 April 1851 and shortly afterwards became the site of St Patrick's cathedral and the bishop's palace. The discovery of gold in this year enormously increased the population of Melbourne, and it was realized that the church of St Patrick that had been begun would not be worthy of the growing city. It was decided to build a great cathedral – St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. In 1858 William Wardell, then government architect, was asked to draw up the plans, and the first stone of the new building was laid in December 1858. For the remainder of Goold's life he was much occupied with the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> for the cathedral. Within thirteen years of arriving in Melbourne, the capable and determined Goold had {{increased the number of}} church buildings in Melbourne to 64.|$|E

500|$|The {{gatehouse}}, called Monnow Gate, {{which gives}} Monnow Bridge its now unique appearance, was added {{at the end}} of the 13th or start of the 14th centuries, twenty-five to thirty years after the bridge itself was built. The siting of the gatehouse mid-channel is relatively unusual; the archaeologist David Harrison notes the more common arrangement was for the gate to be situated on the roadway at one end of the bridge. In 1297, Edward I provided a murage grant in favour of Monmouth in response to a request from his nephew, Henry of Lancaster. A murage was a medieval tax, granted specifically to allow for the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to construct or repair town walls. The grant allowed the townspeople to build the town walls and gates, including the construction of the gatehouse. By 1315, work was incomplete or required repair, as the original authority was renewed on 1 June of that year. At that time, the bridge would have been much narrower than now, with all traffic passing beneath a single arch. The arch was protected by a portcullis, whose associated grooves are still visible. The prominent arched machicolations, defensive apertures through which stones or other material could be dropped on attackers, were added at an unknown date in the medieval period, possibly in the late 14th century. [...] The gate formed part of the town's defensive walls. The cartographer John Speed's map of 1610 shows walls only on the northern side of the town, which lies unprotected by either the Monnow or the Wye, but the archaeologist Ian Soulsby suggests it is [...] "inconceivable" [...] that Monnow Gate, and another gate shown by Speed leading out onto Chippenham Mead, stood alone.|$|E
60|$|The great {{difficulty}} in governing without a Parliament was the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> By the old customs and {{laws of the}} realm, a tax upon the people could only be levied {{by the action of}} the House of Commons; and the great object of the king and council during Buckingham's life, in summoning Parliaments from time to time, was to get their aid in this respect. But as Charles found that one Parliament after another withheld the grants, and spent their time in complaining of his government, he would dissolve them, successively, after exhausting all possible means of bringing them to a compliance with his will. He would then be thrown upon his own resources.|$|E
