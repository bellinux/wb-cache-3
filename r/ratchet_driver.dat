5000|$|Finally, a [...] "claw" [...] type of wrench, {{manufactured}} by Sykes-Pickavant and others, has three geared metal prongs and accommodates a (typically) 3/8" [...] <b>ratchet</b> <b>driver.</b> As {{the driver is}} turned anticlockwise the gears make the prongs clench the filter body harder. This type is very effective on tight filters {{and can be used}} in more confined spaces than a strap or chain type.|$|E
5000|$|Once very popular, {{versions}} of these spiral <b>ratchet</b> <b>drivers</b> using proprietary bits {{have been largely}} discontinued by manufacturers such as Stanley. Some companies now offer a modernized version that uses standard 1/4-inch hex shank power tool bits. Since {{a wide variety of}} drill bits are available in this format, the tool can do double duty as a [...] "push drill" [...] or Persian drill.|$|R
5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral <b>ratchet</b> screw <b>driver</b> and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral <b>ratchet</b> screw <b>driver</b> invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings. Screwdrivers were joined by push drills, breast drills, hand drills (also called egg beater drills), hand powered bench drills, bit and braces, ratcheting tap wrenches, vises, cutting tools and small tool kits.|$|R
5000|$|This storyline explores more {{elements}} of the Transformers hiding on Earth. The Decepticons have multiple bases, with the Autobots discreetly hiding themselves amongst traffic with holographic <b>drivers.</b> <b>Ratchet</b> is also seen deploying a smoke screen. In addition, the Decepticons place more stock in stealth in this continuity, preferring to destabilize a planet's society covertly before striking rather than attacking directly with the arrogant belief that their larger size and technological superiority will triumph over the [...] "puny fleshlings".|$|R
5000|$|Spiral <b>ratchet</b> screw <b>drivers,</b> often colloquially called Yankee {{screwdrivers}} (a brand name), {{provide a}} special mechanism that transforms linear motion into rotational motion. Originally the [...] "Yankee" [...] name was used on all tools {{sold by the}} North Brothers Manufacturing Company but later, after Stanley purchased the company, it became synonymous with only this type of screwdriver. The user pushes the handle toward the workpiece, causing a pawl in a spiral groove to rotate the shank and the removable bit. The ratchet can be set to rotate left or right with each push, or can be locked so that the tool can be used like a conventional screwdriver. One disadvantage of this design {{is that if the}} bit slips out of the screw, the resultant sudden extension of the spring may cause the bit to scratch or otherwise damage the workpiece.|$|R
