40|$|We have {{developed}} a virtual system for interpretation training of chest <b>radiograms.</b> Chest <b>radiograms</b> are widely used in clinic medicine, {{because it can be}} acquired and then display the internal region of human body quickly, conveniently and inexpensively. However, the overlap of the different human organ regions in chest <b>radiograms</b> prevents doctors (especially for trainee doctor) from understanding 3 -D anatomical structures and find out abnormality of human body (patient). A system has been developed to help mainly trainee doctors to understand anatomical structures and view the different organ regions in chest <b>radiograms</b> more easily. The system recognized the different organ and tissue regions from the high-resolution CT images firstly, and then generates resembling conventional chest <b>radiograms</b> by projecting the 3 -D CT images into a 2 -D plane. By adjusting the projection coefficient of each organ region, we can easily reduce the obscurity problems of human organs in chest <b>radiograms.</b> In conclusion, the sophisticated prototype virtual training system for interpreting chest <b>radiograms</b> may be useful and we are now investigating the effect of actual thoracic abnormalities on the training with this system...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} a comparative evaluation of radiography and MRI in the diagnostics of sacroiliitis in patients with a clinical diagnosis of spondyloartropathy, according to the current ASAS criteria. Material and Methods: Sacroiliac joints <b>radiograms</b> and MRI were conducted in 101 consecutive patients, aged 19 - 71 yrs (mean age: 40. 6 yrs). The patients were referred by a senior rheumatologist, with symptoms of the chronic back pain. The sacroiliac joints were assessed on AP <b>radiograms</b> of the pelvis according to the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis. MRI was performed to look for active and chronic inflammatory lesions. Results: Of 14 patients with radiographic sacroiliitis according to modified New York criteria, only 50 % had sacroiliitis on MRI. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional radiography were 22 % and 94 % and of MRI were 71 % and 90 %. Cohen’s kappa coefficient was κ= 0. 0187, agreement of <b>radiograms</b> and MRI was 58 %. Among 86 patients displaying no sacroiliitis on <b>radiograms,</b> MRI showed sacroiliitis in 34 patients (39. 5 %). Positive predictive value was 0. 429, negative predictive value was 0. 605. Conclusions: MRI allowed to diagnose sacroiliitis in 39, 5 % of patients in preradiographic stage. MRI ruled out the presence of active inflammatory lesions in 60. 4 % of patients with sacroiliitis on <b>radiograms</b> according to modified New York criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess whether clinicians are {{actually}} able to evaluate the mechanical status of fracture healing from <b>radiograms.</b> Fifteen orthopaedic surgeons evaluated the <b>radiograms</b> of experimentally produced femur fractures in rats and predicted mechanical strength (%) of the affected side compared to the unaffected control side. Following this, actual mechanical strength of the affected and control side was determined by a three-point bending test. The median of the strength in the transverse fracture model predicted from <b>radiograms</b> was 33 % (2  weeks), 72 % (4  weeks), 88 % (6  weeks), 84 % (8  weeks), and 89 % (12  weeks). The actual measured recovery ratio of mechanical strength (exp/control ×  100) was 36 %, 76 %, 93 %, 89 %, and 106 % in each observation period respectively. The tendency was almost the same in a comminuted fracture model. The mean recovery rate determined by interpretation of the surgeons correlated linearly to the actual measured mechanical strength determined by mechanical testing (R 2 : 0. 80 in transverse fracture, 0. 60 in comminuted fracture). Clinicians demonstrated that a comparatively good evaluation of the mechanical status of fracture healing is possible from <b>radiograms</b> up to approximately 80 % recovery. However, they tended to make less accurate, weaker assessments at the final stages. In conclusion, <b>radiograms</b> may be inadequate for evaluation of fracture healing completion...|$|R

2500|$|Under {{spatially}} coherent illumination and {{an intermediate}} distance between sample and detector an interference pattern with [...] "Fresnel fringes" [...] is created; i.e. the fringes {{arise in the}} free space propagation in the Fresnel regime, which means that for the distance between detector and sample the approximation of Kirchhoff's diffraction formula for the near field, the Fresnel diffraction equation is valid. In contrast to crystal interferometry the recorded interference fringes in PBI are not proportional to the phase itself but to the second derivative (the Laplacian) of the phase of the wavefront. Therefore, the method is most sensitive to abrupt changes in the decrement of the refractive index.

Nor will we describe {{the effect of these}} things upon warfare. The point that concerns us here is this, that before this age of discovery communities had fought and struggled with each other much as naughty children might do in a crowded nursery, within the measure of their strength. They had hurt and impoverished each other, but they had rarely destroyed each other completely. Their squabbles may have been distressing, but they were tolerable. It is even possible to regard these former wars as healthy, hardening and invigorating conflicts. But into this nursery has come Science, and has put into the fists of these children razor blades with poison on them, bombs of frightful explosive, corrosive fluids and the like. The comparatively harmless conflicts of these infants are suddenly fraught with quite terrific possibilities, and it is only a question of sooner or later before the nursery becomes a heap of corpses or is blown to smithereens. A real nursery invaded by a reckless person distributing such gifts, would be promptly saved by the intervention of the nurse; but humanity has no nurse but its own poor wisdom. And whether that poor wisdom can rise to the pitch of effectual intervention is the most fundamental problem in mundane affairs at the present time.|$|E

40|$|Background: Orthopedic trauma care {{relies on}} {{two-dimensional}} <b>radiograms</b> {{both before and}} during the operation. Understanding the three-dimensional nature of complex fractures on plain <b>radiograms</b> is challenging. Modern fluoroscopes can acquire three-dimensional volume datasets even during an operation, but the device limitations constrain the acquired volume to a cube of only 12 -cm edge. However, viewing the surrounding intact structures is important to comprehend the fracture in its context. We suggest merging a fluoroscope’s volume scan into a generic bone model to form a composite full-length 3 D bone model. Methods: Materials consisted of one cadaver bone and 20 three-dimensional surface models of human femora. <b>Radiograms</b> and computed tomography scans were taken before and after applying a controlled fracture to the bone. A 3 D scan of the fracture was acquired using a mobile fluoroscope (Siemens Siremobil). The fracture was fitted into the generic bone models by rigid registration using a modified least-squares algorithm. Registration precision was determined and a clinical appraisal of the composite models obtained. Results: Twenty composite bone models were generated. Average registration precision was 2. 0  mm (range 1. 6 to 2. 6). Average processing time on a laptop computer was 35  s (range 20 to 55). Comparing synthesized <b>radiograms</b> with the actual <b>radiograms</b> of the fractured bone yielded clinically satisfactory results. Conclusion: A three-dimensional full-length representation of a fractured bone can reliably be synthesized from a short scan of the patient’s fracture and a generic bone model. This patient-specific model can subsequently be used for teaching, surgical operation planning, and intraoperative visualization purposes...|$|R

In addition, there was assessed presense of the major trabecular structures of the supra-acetabular area (A,B,C).

Basing on the assessment of the first and second level criteria algorithm of choice of the total hip endoprosthesis component was developed. Thus, developed system of choice of total hip endoprosthesis component which consider peculiarities of the acetabular deformation formed in the late stages of FHAN assesses the ability of the supra-acetabular area to perceive loading.
