50|$|The <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> Guadalcazar {{has also}} {{increased}} due to many American miners looking for precious minerals. Minerals have been located deep within hillsides, and the mining process is beginning once again. Despite {{this change in}} attention, Guadalcazar's population has hovered steadily between 500 and 900 residents, the majority being elderly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Re-population</b> <b>of</b> wolves {{from other}} areas onto the {{peninsula}} did not occur until the 1960s. It has been shown through DNA studies that, at minimum, the current population of wolves on the Kenai Peninsula mated with other Alaskan subspecies, as {{the structure of the}} current wolf population's DNA is similar to other mainland Alaskan subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Timoleon {{established}} a new Syracusan constitution. It was described {{at the time}} as democratic. However, he did have wide powers equivalent to a supreme commander. He invited settlers from mainland Greece to assist in the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> Syracuse and other Sicilian cities. During this period, Greek Sicily enjoyed a recovery in its economy and its culture.|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} when Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva, Marquis of Mancera ordered the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> Valdivia and the {{construction}} of several forts. The main forts were built at Corral Bay, but some other forts were built to protect the city from the Mapuches. Then the city came to be called The key of the south sea and Gibraltar of the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|As {{gentrification}} and the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> {{urban centers}} by wealthier residents takes place, no-fault evictions {{are used as}} a tool to displace tenants in cities with rent control. In California, for example, the Ellis Act allows eviction of rent-controlled tenants if the landlord intends to no longer rent any portion of an apartment building (i.e., landlords cannot be compelled to rent). The Ellis Act has been applied to rentals in San Francisco, Santa Monica and Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|In 1676, a Dutch fleet {{abducted}} {{the population}} and plundered its facilities. After the repopulation of the island, its new inhabitants were attacked {{for the third time}} by the Dutch and by the British in 1690 and 1691. These raids, which resulted in the destruction of the mills, the refineries and the depopulation of the island, caused the Governor-General of Martinique to forbid the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the island until 1696. The British retook the island from 1759 to 1763.|$|R
40|$|In {{this pilot}} study, we address the nature <b>of</b> the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the T-cell {{compartment}} in HIV- 1 + (Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1), vertically infected children placed on successful regimens of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) incorporating 2 NRTI and a protease inhibitor. The clonality of the T-cell compartment and {{the abundance of}} RTEs (Recent Thymic Emigrants) were determined 2 weeks before and 20 weeks after initiation of HAART in a subgroup of children {{taking part in the}} PENTA (Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS) 5 trial. Analysis of the clonality of the circulating T-cell compartment was assessed using CDR 3 spectratyping and analysed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov two sample test. This revealed that a high degree of T-cell clonal restriction still exists 5 months into therapy, despite the appearance of previously undetectable T-cell clones within the periphery. We detected no increase in RTE abundance in this 5 month period, as determined by PCR detection of TRECs (T-Cell Receptor Excision Circles). We conclude that the observed <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> T cells within the periphery of treated children is heavily reliant upon the maintenance/expansion of pre-existing cells during the 5 month period immediately following the initiation of therapy...|$|R
40|$|Operation of the LHC {{will require}} {{injection}} {{of very high}} intensity beams from the SPS to the LHC. Fast scrapers have been installed and {{will be used in}} the SPS to detect and remove any existing halo before beams are extracted, to minimize the probability for quenching of superconducting magnets at injection in the LHC. We briefly review the functionality of the scraper system and report about measurements that have recently been performed in the SPS on halo scraping and <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> tails...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{numerous}} battles, {{neither the}} Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under {{the reign of}} Ramiro, famed for the highly legendary Battle of Clavijo, the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in Castile, Galicia, and León were fortified, and an intensive program <b>of</b> <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the Kingdom of León, when León became {{the seat of the}} royal court (it didn't bear any official name).|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the Aspotogan Heritage Trust {{was created}} to oversee the {{renovation}} and <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the land and buildings that were decommissioned at CFS Mill Cove following the automation of the receiver station. The Trust markets these assets as Mill Cove Park and includes the province’s first dedicated sound stage (established in 1996) in the former administration and gymnasium buildings. More than $40 million of film and TV production took place at this sound stage over a 5-year period, including filming for the CBC Television series Black Harbour and Blackfly.|$|R

25|$|<b>Re-population</b> <b>of</b> the {{recently}} vacated Arab dwellings by Jews became official policy by December 1948, {{but the process}} began slowly. The Israeli national plan of June 1949 designated al-Majdal as the site for a regional urban center of 20,000 people. From July 1949, new immigrants and demobilized soldiers moved to the new town, increasing the Jewish population to 2,500 within six months. During 1949, the town was renamed Migdal Gaza, and then Migdal Gad. Soon afterwards it became Migdal Ashkelon. In 1953 the nearby neighborhood of Afridar was incorporated and the current name Ashkelon was adopted. By 1961, Ashkelon ranked 18th among Israeli urban centers {{with a population of}} 24,000.|$|R
40|$|Leptogenesis is {{considered}} {{in its natural}} context where Majorana neutrinos fit in a gauge unification scheme and therefore couple to some extra gauge bosons. The masses {{of some of these}} gauge bosons are expected to be {{similar to those of the}} heavy Majorana particles, and this can have important consequences for leptogenesis. In fact, the effect can go both ways. Stricter bounds are obtained on one hand due to the dilution of the CP-violating effect by new decay and scattering channels, while, in a re-heating scheme, the presence of gauge couplings facilitates the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the Majorana states. The latter effect allows in particular for smaller Dirac couplings. ...|$|R

25|$|During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the country}} {{experienced}} {{a revolution in}} agriculture, water transport, finance, urbanization, science and technology, which made the Chinese economy the most advanced in the world from about 1100. Mastery of wet-field rice cultivation opened up the hitherto underdeveloped south of the country, while later northern China was devastated by Jur'chen and Mongol invasions, floods and epidemics. The result was a dramatic shift in the centre of population and industry from the home of Chinese civilization around the Yellow River {{to the south of}} the country, a trend only partially reversed by the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the north from the 15th century. By 1300, China had fallen behind Italy in living standards.|$|R
40|$|Experiments on {{high-quality}} GaAs (311) A two-dimensional {{holes at}} low temperatures reveal a remarkable {{dependence of the}} magnetoresistance, measured with an in-plane magnetic field ($B$), on the direction of $B$ relative to both the crystal axes and the current direction. The magnetoresistance features, {{and in particular the}} value of $B$ above which the resistivity exhibits an insulating behavior, depend on the orientation of $B$. To explain the data, the anisotropic band structure of the holes and a <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the spin-subbands in the presence of $B$, as well as the coupling of the orbital motion to $B$, need to be taken into account.

During the reign of Ordoño I of Asturias (850-866) the <b>re-population</b> <b>of</b> the uninhabited zone began.
