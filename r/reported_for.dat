5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force winds were <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> 18hours, and tropical storm-force winds were <b>reported</b> <b>for</b> 30hours. As the eye was crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E
