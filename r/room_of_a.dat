5|$|Rimsky-Korsakoffee House, {{located in}} the Buckman {{neighborhood}} of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States, {{is one of the}} city's oldest coffeehouses. Named after Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, the classical music-themed coffeehouse serves coffee and desserts, operating from the former living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reportedly haunted 1902 Craftsman-style house.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E

5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the chances of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E
5|$|The Musée {{des arts}} décoratifs (Museum of Decorative arts) {{is on the}} ground floor. It was {{established}} in its current form in the years 1920–1924, when the collections of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe, originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the palace apartments. The collections had previously been in the Renaissance former municipal slaughterhouse Grandes Boucheries or Große Metzig, which now hosts the Musée historique de Strasbourg.) The Musée des arts décoratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former hôtel particulier, the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on a more intimate scale than the rooms of the palace.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Inna {{answering}} {{to a call}} she gets from Stan on her Lenovo smartphone, of which the ringtone is the saxophone riff featured in the song. Subsequently, both are presented standing {{close to each other}} in front of a red backdrop and a cactus. The next scene portrays Stan and some backup dancers hanging out in the dressing <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> club, with her eventually going downstairs to the full party hall and later meeting Inna there. Next, Yankee makes a cameo appearance in the clip, followed by both singers performing a synchronized choreography. The video ends in the same way it opens. Cut scenes portray Yankee, Stan and Inna singing and dancing to the song in front of yellow, green and blue backdrops, Inna performing to the club's crowd or Stan dancing on a runaway.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds up to the first verse, they are depicted in the living <b>room</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E

Based on current research and literature we discuss topics like technology integra- tion, semantic interoperability, automation, and the importance of considering user needs. Furthermore, we introduce a living lab approach, which allows us to conduct research on these topics in a real smart building environment. This living lab actually is a system for enabling smart energy efficient building applications, based on a middleware approach. We describe the software design and the real-world deployment of this system in ten <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> university and eight <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> office building...|$|R
