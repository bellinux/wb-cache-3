To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate <b>ringing</b> <b>current.</b> The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|E

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the quiet-time <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> consists of two parts, the inner <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> imbedded deeply inside the plasmapause and the outer <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> flowing in the plasma sheet. The source of the inner <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> appears to be trapped protons with energies 100 keV to several hundred keV having their peak intensity at 3 to 4 R sub e. The dominant source of the outer <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is the population of protons with energy near 50 keV in the plasma sheet, as in Frank's (1967) model for the extraterrestrial <b>ring</b> <b>current.</b> The outer <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is an innermost part of the tail current, and the inner <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is its earthward extension. The plasma pressure is nearly continuous from the plasma sheet to the inner <b>current</b> <b>ring</b> region. When the plasma sheet moves inward during a substorm, the plasma pressure increase is directly conveyed to inside the plasmasphere and intensifies the inner <b>ring</b> <b>current...</b>|$|R
30|$|The major {{carrier of}} the storm-time <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> {{is known to}} be ions with energy of tens of keV (Frank 1967; Smith and Hoffman 1973). The AMPTEE/CCE {{satellite}} measured substantial contribution from O+ to the storm-time <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> (Hamilton et al. 1988). This is a striking finding in the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> research because it implies that the source of the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> particles is not only the Sun, but also the Earth. As for quiet time (non-storm time), the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> consists of ions with energy greater than 100  keV. This means that the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> always exists regardless of magnetic storms. Investigation of the growth and decay of the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is equivalent to investigating the accumulation and loss of the ions with energy of the order of tens of keV in the inner magnetosphere.|$|R
30|$|A {{magnetic}} storm is the world-wide geomagnetic disturbance {{taking place in}} near-Earth space environment, lasting for a few days. Geomagnetic fields can be depressed by ~[*] 1 % on the ground for large {{magnetic storm}}s. The prime cause of the long-lasting, world-wide geomagnetic disturbance {{is the development of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> that surrounds the Earth. The <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is an electric current carried by charged particles. Thus, the growth and decay of the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> correspond to accumulation and loss of the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> particles, respectively. The <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is strong enough to modulate near-Earth space environment, and leads to many observable effects. In this sense, the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> can be regarded as an important mediator in the near-Earth space environment. Here, the dynamics and structure of the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> and its active role are briefly reviewed on the basis of numerical simulation results.|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{extensive}} survey of the magnetic field observations in the inner magnetosphere using 30 years of magnetospheric magnetic field data from Polar, Cluster, ISEE, and AMPTE/CCE missions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the magnetic field evolution during the recovery phase of geomagnetic storms, and its implication to the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> recovery and loss mechanisms of <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> particles. It is now commonly believed that a strong partial <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is formed during the storm main phase due to the enhanced earthward convection of energetic ions from nightside plasma sheet. But the presence of a strong partial <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> throughout the recovery phase remains controversial. The magnetic field generated by the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> inflates the inner magnetosphere and causes magnetic field depressions in the equatorial magnetosphere. During the storm recovery phase, we find that the distribution of the equatorial magnetic field depression exhibits similar local time dependence as the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> distribution obtained from the combined dataset in the earlier study. It shows that a strong partial <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> is a permanent feature throughout the recovery phase. In the early recovery phase, the partial <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> peaks near the dusk terminator as indicated by the peak of the magnetic field depression. As the recovery phase progresses, the partial <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> decays most quickly near the dusk and results in a dusk-to-midnight moving of the peak of the partial <b>ring</b> <b>current.</b> Thus the loss mechanisms work most effectively near the dusk. The magnetic field depression increases the gyroradius of <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> protons to a scale greater or comparable to the thickness of the magnetopause, which increases the chance of ion drift loss near the dusk magnetopause at larger L-shell (L greater than 5). But the drift loss mechanism alone cannot explain the loss of <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> ions especially in the smaller L-shell (L less than 5). The precipitation loss due to wave-particle interaction is most likely the dominant loss mechanism in the small L-shell as it works most effectively at the same local time...|$|R

Rather than have a motor generator set for such a small installation, which generated noise and required maintenance, these systems used a hand magneto. Unlike on the public telephone network, which has a standard ringing cadence (the repeating pattern of ringing and silence), the ringing cadence on a PMBX depended upon the skill of the operator. When ringing local extensions, some switchboard operators used local codes of ringing to indicate internal, external or urgent calls.|$|E
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the {{incoming}} trunk circuit to control ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing selection switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks.

Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side.

40|$|International audienceOur {{examination}} of the 20 years of magnetospheric magnetic field data from ISEE, AMPTE/CCE and Polar missions has allowed us to quantify how the <b>ring</b> <b>current</b> flows and closes in the magnetosphere {{at a variety of}} disturbance levels.

5000|$|Many early manual {{telephones}} had an attached hand-cranked magneto {{that produced}} an alternating current (AC) at 50-100V for signaling {{to ring the}} bells of other telephones on the same (party) line and to alert an operator at the local telephone exchange. These were most common on long rural lines served by small manual exchanges which did not use a common battery circuit. The telephone instrument contained a local battery, consisting of two large [...] "N° 6" [...] zinc-carbon dry cells, to provide the necessary current for the transmitter.

On phones with a ringer loudness control, one gong was mounted off-center on the loudness control wheel; turning the wheel moved the gong toward (quieter) or away (louder) from the striker. Overall, the model 500 ringer was fairly loud and could be heard a few rooms away. The ringer could not be turned off on-the-fly, but could be disabled in the wiring. When the phone was subjected to mechanical shock the striker would hit the brass bells and a short ring would be heard.

The devices usually cannot provide enough <b>ringing</b> <b>current</b> for more than one phone and one externally powered device, such as a telephone answering device or the base station for a cordless phone.
