5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands when the church office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
25|$|In economics, the Laffer curve {{illustrates}} a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation {{and the resulting}} levels of government revenue. It illustrates the concept of taxable income elasticityâ€”i.e.,taxable income changes in response {{to changes in the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> The Laffer curve assumes that no tax revenue is raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%, {{and that there is a}} rate between 0% and 100% that maximizes government taxation revenue. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph that starts at 0% tax with zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue at an intermediate <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate. However, the shape of the curve is uncertain and disputed among economists.|$|E
2500|$|Economist Jeffrey Sachs {{argues that}} among {{developed}} countries, {{those with high}} <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and high social welfare spending perform better on most measures of economic performance compared to countries with low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and low social outlays. He concludes that Friedrich Hayek was wrong to argue that high levels of government spending harms an economy, and [...] "a generous social-welfare state is not a road to serfdom but rather to fairness, economic equality and international competitiveness". Austrian economist Sudha Shenoy responded by arguing that countries with large public sectors have grown more slowly.|$|R

50|$|Demand-side economists {{maintain}} inflation (and not {{a balanced}} budget) is the necessary constraint to prevent {{economic and financial}} dislocations.

25|$|In economics, the Laffer {{curve is}} a {{theoretical}} {{representation of the}} relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation. It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that taxable income will change in response to changes in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation).</b> The curve is constructed by thought experiment. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate {{there is no longer any}} incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> generate no revenue, it follows from the extreme value theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} {{mandates that}} taxation must be general and equal in nature, {{and it must}} be proportionate to one's ability to pay. The Federal Supreme Court has interpreted this as prohibiting a regressive tax, although flat rate taxes (as instituted in several cantons) are held to be constitutional by tax law scholars. Moreover, double taxation by several cantons is constitutionally prohibited, as is a confiscatory <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{after the}} first Muslim conquests in the 7th century, kharaj usually denoted a {{lump-sum}} duty levied upon the conquered provinces and collected by the officials of the former Byzantine and Sasanian empires, or, more broadly, any kind of tax levied by Muslim conquerors on their non-Muslim subjects, dhimmis. At that time, kharaj was synonymous with jizyah, which later emerged as a poll tax paid by dhimmis. Muslim landowners, on the other hand, paid only ushr, a religious tithe, which carried a much lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} distortional fiscal {{policies}} are studied within {{a model in}} which there is endogenous investment-specific technological change.

Labor or capital taxes then distort the trade-off between developing new technologies, and investing in existing types of capital. It is shown that if there is an externality in the research activity, then it may be socially optimal to impose both a capital tax, and an investment tax credit. The growth rate is shown to be increasing in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>taxation</b> and decreasing in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> labor <b>taxation,</b> although the effect <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> on the growth rate is modest.

2500|$|A tax (from the Latin [...] ) is a {{mandatory}} financial charge {{or some other}} type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or other legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures. A failure to pay, or evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent. Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public/common/agreed national needs and government functions: some levy a flat percentage <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> on personal annual income, some on a scale based on annual income amounts, and some countries impose almost no taxation at all, or a very low tax rate for a certain area of taxation. Some countries charge a tax both on corporate income and dividends; this {{is often referred to}} as double taxation as the individual shareholder(s) receiving this payment from the company will also be levied some tax on that personal income.|$|E

That {{the said}} Warren Hastings did also advance another {{dangerous}} and pernicious principle in justification of his violent, arbitrary, and iniquitous actings aforesaid: namely, [...] "that, {{if he had}} acted with an unwarrantable rigor, and even injustice, towards Cheyt Sing, yet, first, if he did believe that extraordinary means were necessary, and those exerted with a strong hand, to preserve the Company's interests from sinking under the accumulated weight that oppressed them, or, secondly, if he saw a political necessity for curbing the overgrown power of a great member of their dominion, {{and to make it}} contribute to the relief of their pressing exigencies, that his error would be excusable, as prompted by an excess of zeal for their [the Company's] interest, operating with too strong a bias on his judgment; but that much stronger is the presumption, that such acts are founded on just principles than that they are the result of a misguided judgment."

Was it gained by supplying the capital which industry needs, or by denying, except at an extortionate price, the land which industry requires? Was it derived from active reproductive processes, or merely by squatting on some piece of necessary land till enterprise and labour, and national interests and municipal interests, had to buy you out at fifty times the agricultural value? Was it gained from opening new minerals to the service of man, or by drawing a mining royalty from the toil and adventure of others? Was it gained by the curious process of using political influence to convert an annual licence into a practical freehold and thereby pocketing a monopoly value which properly belongs to the State--how did you get it?"
