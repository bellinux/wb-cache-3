5|$|Parts of {{the highway}} were built along the former <b>rights-of-way</b> of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Erie Canal. The entire route was built {{as part of the}} New York State Thruway in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was {{completed}} in 1964. In 2006, the tolls along the freeway were removed, although the Grand Island ones remain in place.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{was mostly}} routed along {{existing}} <b>rights-of-way,</b> but three commercial properties, including {{a gas station}} and a vacant building, were seized and demolished {{to make way for}} the AirTrain alignment. Members of the New York City Planning Commission approved the condemnation of several buildings along the route in May 1999, but voiced concerns about the logistics of the project. The commission's concerns included the projected high price of the tickets; ridership demand; and unwieldy transfers at Jamaica.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{recognition}} that the narrow linear strips of uncultivated vegetation that lie between roads and agricultural crops, referred to as roadside <b>right-of-ways</b> or verges, can serve as areas {{for the conservation of}} wildlife. The features of <b>right-of-ways</b> that should influence the composition of wildlife communities vary considerably. Our goal was to determine what features of <b>right-of-ways</b> increased the conservation potential of <b>right-of-ways</b> for wildlife in a grassland system dominated by agricultural production. We sampled 100 <b>right-of-ways</b> for birds and 92 <b>right-of-ways</b> for small mammals in McDonough and Warren Counties in west-central Illinois. We found that the sizes of <b>right-of-ways</b> and the amount of traffic on the adjacent roads synergistically worked to influence wildlife communities. On roads with low traffic, avian species richness increased rapidly with increased <b>right-of-way</b> width, while on roads with high traffic, avian richness increased only slightly with increasing <b>right-of-way</b> widths. We found that wider roadside <b>right-of-ways</b> (preferably across the road from equally wide <b>right-of-ways)</b> with thicker and taller vegetation had the greatest conservation value for birds and small mammals. The features that enhanced the conservation value of <b>right-of-ways</b> in our study area were uncommon. Efforts to create or enhance these features for the benefit of wildlife would likely face numerous obstacles. Nonetheless, from a grassland conservation perspective, working with stakeholders to implement specific strategies to enhance these often neglected areas may be an effective complement to purchasing and restoring conservation lands away from roads...|$|R
5|$|Initial {{planning}} of the segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg considered 13 different initial route proposals. However, no analysis for possible <b>rights-of-way</b> south of Tønsberg or north of Barkåker were considered. In September 1999, the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002–11, which included three segments on the Vestfold Line: Holm–Nykirke, Barkåker–Tønsberg and Farriseidet–Porsgrunn. When Parliament passed {{the plan in}} February 2001, the Barkåker–Tønsberg segment was prioritized second on the Vestfold Line, after a new passing loop at Nykirke. National Transport Plan 2002–11 proposed that construction start in 2005, but by November 2002, the National Rail Administration delayed the plans, following investment cuts by Bondevik's Second Cabinet. In response, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a public–private partnership paid through a surcharge on tickets fares.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county. Prince George's officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the Red Line extension in Montgomery County to Glenmont and began the immediate purchase of land and <b>rights-of-way</b> in Prince George's County. Metro agreed a month later to the plan, {{with the proviso that}} $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).|$|E
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification on the line, and the single-tracking {{in some parts of}} the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share <b>rights-of-way,</b> and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E
50|$|In April 2011, the Construction Authority {{completed}} its agreement with BNSF, which agreed {{to abandon their}} use of the <b>right-of-way</b> west of the San Gabriel River.

40|$|Prehistoric archaeological Site 41 CC 233 {{consists}} of a burned rock midden and a light lithic scatter outside the <b>right-of-way</b> of US 87 in Concho County, Texas. Testing within the <b>right-of-way</b> was undertaken {{to determine if the}} site did extend into the <b>right-of-way</b> area, to determine eligibility for inclusion within the National Register of Historic Places, and to determine site depth and archaeological significance. Recovered evidence suggests that the site minimally extends into the <b>right-of-way</b> and that at least one feature was within the <b>right-of-way.</b> Additional investigations are not warranted due to low recovery rates and construction plans which will effectively cover and protect the portions of the site within the <b>right-of-way...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1888 was a busy {{year for}} The Carolina, Knoxville & Western Railway in Transylvania County. <b>right-of-way</b> was acquiredi and cleared along {{what is now}} highway-276, behind Connestee Falls, around and above the Walnut Hollow valley behind {{what is now the}} Gwen Valley Camp. Remnants of the {{partially}} constructed <b>right-of-way</b> remain visible in 2015. The <b>right-of-way</b> veered from the into what is now the Connestee Falls community just south of the main gate. The <b>right-of-way</b> is clearly visible behind the administration office.

25|$|But on August 8, {{the state}} of Virginia {{abandoned}} its plans and agreed to begin work on the northern route for Lee Boulevard. For nearly a year, state and county officials had disagreed whether the northern route <b>rights-of-way</b> were adequate to begin construction. The state disagreed, but Arlington County officials {{did not wish to}} spend more money {{in the depths of the}} Great Depression to acquire more <b>rights-of-way.</b> By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, {{the state of}} Virginia put pressure on Arlington County to fix the <b>rights-of-way</b> problems with the northern route. Agreement to begin construction on the northern route finally was reached on August 8. The state of Virginia agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required <b>rights-of-way.</b> Arlington County provided another $21,122.|$|E
25|$|The line {{is planned}} to use multi-section {{vehicles}} to negotiate sharp curves at Lorraine Street, Cadman Plaza, 21st Street, and Astoria Boulevard. Streetcars, rather than light rail vehicles (LRVs), are proposed to be used, {{despite the fact that}} LRVs have more capacity and shorter headways; this is because streetcars were determined to operate better within mixed-use <b>rights-of-way,</b> as opposed to LRVs, which were determined to operate better within dedicated <b>rights-of-way.</b> Electrification is proposed to be from hydrogen fuel cells within the trains themselves, as opposed to from overhead lines or from embedded rails. Since the BQX would operate on both dedicated <b>rights-of-way</b> and on streets, the BQX would use both standard traffic lights and dedicated signals during operation. Annual operating costs are estimated at $26 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle for}} the Tidewater Railway's <b>rights-of-way</b> {{displayed}} Rogers at his most crafty and ingenious.

25|$|By contrast, {{light rail}} {{vehicles}} can travel in multi-car trains carrying a theoretical ridership up to 20,000 passengers per hour in much narrower <b>rights-of-way,</b> {{not much more}} than two car lanes wide for a double track system. They can often be run through existing city streets and parks, or placed in the medians of roads. If run in streets, trains are usually limited by city block lengths to about four 180-passenger vehicles (720 passengers). Operating on two-minute headways using traffic signal progression, a well-designed two-track system can handle up to 30 trains per hour per track, achieving peak rates of over 20,000 passengers per hour in each direction. More advanced systems with separate <b>rights-of-way</b> using moving block signalling can exceed 25,000 passengers per hour per track.|$|E
