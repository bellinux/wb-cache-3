5000|$|The table below {{summarizes}} the review results {{for all of}} the 25 banks, that were found to suffer from a capital short fall on 31 December 2013. Those 12 with a green background already raised sufficient amount of additional CET1-capital in 2014, while those 5 with a yellow background were found to have bridged their shortfall through other measures than raising additional capital (internal restructuring ensuring dynamic budget sheet gains, governmental guarantees, or retained earnings), and only the remaining 8 with a red background were required to raise additional CET1-capital. Beside of the 25 banks found to suffer from capital shortfalls on 31 December 2013, it was expected the second biggest bank in Portugal, Banco Espírito Santo, would also have shown a capital shortfall if being analyzed. However, ECB decided to postpone the AQR and stress test for this bank, after it went into an orderly resolution and ceased to exist in August 2014 - with all its assets transferred to the Portuguese resolution fund. The <b>resolution</b> <b>plan</b> now being implemented by the resolution fund, will cause a split of the bank into a [...] "bad bank" [...] (holding all bad assets, to be liquidated as soon as possible) and a new continuing recapitalized bank Novo Banco (only holding the healthy assets). At the time of the published stress test, the work of splitting up the assets between the two entities had not yet been completed, and for this reason ECB decided to postpone its stress test of the continuing Novo Banco. One month later, it was announced Novo Banco had a sufficient CET1-ratio of 9.2% as of 4 August 2014 (after secretion of the toxic assets into the [...] "bad bank"), and the resolution fund expected it would be sold as a viable bank to a new private owner during the second quarter of 2015.|$|E

30|$|For that reason, {{the idea}} of {{combination}} between business process and multi-agent system has been raised to improve agent-based design [6] {{as well as to}} allow performing divers analysis based on the strong sides of both paradigms (e.g. control-flow complexity metric for process model [14], organizational structure for OCMAS [13], etc.). Process models could be considered as additional components of agent ones, since they can provide means to represent an aggregate view of an MAS behaviour. In addition, process models share several concepts with MAS. Therefore, we believe that the marriage of Process- and Agent models is suitable to design an efficient coordination in complex system [7], such as crisis management, by improving the quality of coordination plan. While stakeholders and their behaviours may be described by agents, the crisis <b>resolution</b> <b>plan</b> is amenable to a process representation.|$|E
