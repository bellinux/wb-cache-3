50|$|He {{died in his}} attacking PBY {{aircraft}} at Jolo Harbor, Philippines, December 27, 1941, as {{he remained}} bravely at his post in the burning, gasoline-flooded <b>radio</b> <b>compartment.</b> For his heroism he received the Navy Cross.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the structural repairs in the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and tail gunner position, numerous repairs {{have been made to}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and related fairings. The vertical stabilizer is ready for remounting. Radio mounting brackets and landing light housings have been refabricated from scratch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first letter}} of the {{designation}} refers to the engine while an M indicates that it {{was intended as a}} mailplane, with the forward <b>compartment</b> <b>covered.</b> Minor modifications were made to the design which were reflected in the use of -1 after the designation.Reference: Simpson ...|$|R
60|$|And now all was prepared: but one {{compartment}} of {{the hall}} waited to be filled--a <b>compartment</b> <b>covered</b> with crimson, like the grand staircase and doors, furnished with stuffed and cushioned benches, ranged {{on each side of}} two regal chairs, placed solemnly under a canopy.|$|R
50|$|Other {{options include}} Carbon Fiber Exterior Mirror Covers, Carbon Fiber Engine <b>Compartment</b> <b>Covers,</b> Extended Interior Carbon Fiber package (additional carbon-fiber trim on seat {{backrest}} and side, {{as well as}} door sill panels), AMG Carbon-Ceramic High-Performance braking system, AMG Performance Media, Bang & Olufsen BeoSound AMG surround sound system.|$|R
25|$|As {{the heavily}} damaged {{choppers}} returned to Palali airbase, {{it became clear}} that further missions might be impossible. Sqn Ldr Vinayraj's helicopter had sustained significant damage. The undercarriage had been hit, the portside battery <b>compartment</b> <b>cover</b> was missing and the whole fuselage was peppered with bullet holes. Wg Cdr Sapre’s Mi-8 returned with its hydraulic system damaged.|$|R

50|$|On 1 May 1943 the {{aircraft}} in which Staff Sergeant Maynard Smith was a gunner {{was struck by}} enemy fire, igniting fires in the plane's <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and waist. Sgt Smith threw exploding ammunition overboard, extinguished the fire, administered first aid to the wounded tail gunner and manned his gun until enemy fighter aircraft were driven off. Sgt Smith was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on this mission.|$|R
5000|$|Customers {{were sent}} prepaid courier {{envelopes}} and instructed to send back their Mifi units for {{replacement of the}} battery and battery <b>compartment</b> <b>cover.</b> [...] Customers were notified that Novatel would return the serviced units within 6 to 8 weeks of their return. Bell customers were provided with cellular internet access via Novatel U998 USB sticks, which were provided as temporary replacements by Bell.|$|R

50|$|In British English, a car of this {{configuration}} {{is called}} a saloon. The engine <b>compartment</b> <b>cover</b> is the bonnet, the cargo-compartment boot is at the rear. Hatchback sedans are known simply as hatchbacks (not hatchback saloons); long-wheelbase luxury saloons may {{be referred to as}} limousines. A sports sedan with hatchback rear are typically called hot hatches in UK, but this usage is largely limited to upgraded small cars.|$|R
50|$|The type L is {{designed}} to be used against vehicles and tanks, the bomb had essentially the task of destroying the track to immobilize it, since the charge was insufficient for its destruction, but made the tank still vulnerable to possible attacks from the infantry, the soldiers at this point proceeded to place explosive charges or throw incendiary grenades into the engine <b>compartment</b> <b>covered</b> by some smoke grenade.|$|R
50|$|The camera {{handles and}} {{performs}} well, but {{suffers from a}} very loud shutter/mirror operation. The battery control can be cheated: with a lithium battery, the battery control lamp can indicate 'OK', but not have enough energy to release the shutter. The camera has a sturdy feel, except for the very flimsy battery <b>compartment</b> <b>cover.</b> Without a winder attached, large amounts of dust can (and will!) enter the camera through the winder socket.|$|R
50|$|The engine <b>compartment</b> was <b>covered</b> by metal sheets. Its chassis {{base was}} also covered, {{something}} imitated by many other car models later.|$|R
50|$|The <b>compartment</b> is <b>covered</b> by {{the provincial}} flower, the purple violet, and the fiddlehead, an edible fern that grows in New Brunswick.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars are}} {{designed}} for running on dirt and more recently, carpets and artificial turfs; both featuring jumps. The buggies features independent suspension, long-travel shock absorbers, and <b>covered</b> transmission and <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> to keep them running in extreme conditions. For a 2WD buggy, the rear tires are spiked for traction, while the front tires are thin, and ribbed for good steering in dirt. On a 4WD buggy, all four tires are identical, spiked tires. They are designed specifically for dirt, and running on pavement wears the spikes down quickly.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in 42 it {{was defined}} the final version, {{with the top}} of the {{transport}} <b>compartment</b> <b>covered.</b> With the pressure of events in April 1945, the samples still being completed at Viberti workshops, with covered top version and not, were requisitioned by the various factions. At least three were taken by Republicans of the Social Republic. Two vehicle was captured by the partisans, one was destroyed by a Panzerfaust from a legionary of the 29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (italienische Nr. 1) (the Italian SS division).|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{differed from}} the standard B-17 in that a second manned dorsal turret was installed in the former <b>radio</b> <b>compartment,</b> just behind the bomb bay and forward of the ventral ball turret's location. The single [...]50-caliber light-barrel (12.7 mm) Browning machine gun at each waist station was replaced by two of them mounted side-by-side as a twin-mount emplacement, with a mount for each pair of these being {{very much like the}} tail gun setup in general appearance. The bombardier's equipment was also replaced with two [...]50-caliber light-barrel Browning AN/M2 machine guns in a remotely operated Bendix designed [...] "chin"-location turret, directly beneath the bombardier's location in the extreme nose.|$|R
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. The aircraft of which Sgt. Smith was a gunner was subjected to intense enemy antiaircraft fire and determined fighter aircraft attacks while returning from a mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe on 1 May 1943. The aircraft was hit several times by antiaircraft fire and cannon shells of the fighter aircraft, 2 of the crew were seriously wounded, the aircraft's oxygen system shot out, and several vital control cables severed when intense fires were ignited simultaneously in the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and waist sections. The situation became so acute that 3 of the crew bailed out into the comparative safety of the sea. Sgt. Smith, then on his first combat mission, elected to fight the fire by himself, administered first aid to the wounded tail gunner, manned the waist guns, and fought the intense flames alternately. The escaping oxygen fanned the fire to such intense heat that the ammunition in the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> began to explode, the radio, gun mount, and camera were melted, and the compartment completely gutted. Sgt. Smith threw the exploding ammunition overboard, fought the fire until all the firefighting aids were exhausted, manned the workable guns until the enemy fighters were driven away, further administered first aid to his wounded comrade, and then by wrapping himself in protecting cloth, completely extinguished the fire by hand. This soldier's gallantry in action, undaunted bravery, and loyalty to his aircraft and fellow crewmembers, without regard for his own personal safety, is an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|R
2500|$|The {{estate cars}} (chassis {{designation}} S124) came in 5- or 7-seat models, the 7-seater having a rear-facing bench seat that folded flush luggage <b>compartment</b> <b>cover</b> and an optional (in the US until 1994) retractable cargo net. [...] To provide a flat loading {{floor with the}} seat folded down, the T-model's rear seat squab was mounted about [...] higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's an old {{style of}} type, not much in use at present," [...] {{explained}} the youthful detective. [...] "In one printing office {{the case that}} contains this type face hasn't been used for months and months. I found all the <b>compartments</b> <b>covered</b> with dust {{a quarter of an}} inch thick. There wasn't a trace of the type having been disturbed. I proved this by picking out a piece of type, which scattered the dust and brought to light the shining bodies of the other type in that compartment. So the circulars could never have been printed from that case of type." ...|$|R
50|$|Grewia latifolia {{is a small}} shrub {{endemic to}} Northern and Eastern Australia. Growing to a height of 2m, the species is characterised by ovate leaves with {{serrated}} margins. The leaves are discolourous with green papery upper surfaces and pale green to yellow pubescent lower surfaces. The species is deciduous, shedding leaves in response to dry conditions. Cream coloured flowers are produced year round. Fruits are woody capsules with four externally visible <b>compartments</b> <b>covered</b> with coarse hairs. These fruits have an distinct similarity to dog testicles, giving rise to the common name of Dogs Balls. Other common names include Emu Berry and Dysentery Bush.|$|R

To provide a flat loading {{floor with the}} seat folded down, the T-model's rear seat squab was mounted about 10 cm higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched {{more than a year}} later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124.|$|R
5000|$|All {{species that}} have been {{examined}} — including mammals and non-mammals — show compartmentalization, {{but there are some}} systematic differences in the details of the arrangement. [...] In species with a streak-type retina (mainly species with laterally placed eyes, such as rabbits and deer), the <b>compartments</b> <b>cover</b> {{the full extent of the}} SC. In species with a centrally placed fovea, however, the compartmentalization breaks down in the front (rostral) part of the SC. This portion of the SC contains many [...] "fixation" [...] neurons that fire continually while the eyes remain fixed in a constant position.|$|R
25|$|On 2 August 1947, the {{aircraft}} {{was sold to}} Charles T. Winters, of Miami, Florida, who, in turn, sold it on 16 August 1947, to Joe Lopez of the Vero Beach Import and Export Company who purchased {{the aircraft}} {{to serve as a}} cargo hauler, hauling cattle in Florida and Puerto Rico. Its new role necessitated removing the original <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and floor, replacing it with a strengthened floor. In 1949, Aero Service Corporation bought the aircraft and turned it back into an aerial photography and surveying platform. In this role, during the next 12 years, the B-17 carried out mapping operations over Arabia, Libya, Lebanon, Iran, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Egypt and Jordan.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 March 1944 a {{badly damaged}} B-17 landed at Raydon due to Raydon {{being the first}} {{airfield}} the crew came across. The B-17 was B-17 #42-31968 LN:D [...] "Miss Irish" [...] of the 350th Bomb Squadron of the 100th Bomb Group. The aircraft's nose art was a black four leafed clover. The B-17 took a direct 88mm flak hit while on a [...] "milk run" [...] (easy mission) over France. The shell blew a large hole in the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and the <b>radio</b> operator was blown out of the aircraft. The aircraft was severely weakened around the place of impact so the remaining crew decided to land at Raydon. The B-17 was salvaged.|$|R
2500|$|In 1952, Alfred A. Mikalow {{constructed}} an ADS employing {{ball and}} socket joints, specifically {{for the purpose of}} locating and salvaging sunken treasure. The suit was reportedly capable of diving to depths of [...] and was used successfully to dive on the sunken vessel SS City of Rio de Janeiro in [...] of water near Fort Point, San Francisco. Mikalow's suit had various interchangeable instruments which could be mounted {{on the end of the}} arms in place of the usual manipulators. It carried seven 90-cubic foot high pressure cylinders to provide breathing gas and control buoyancy. The ballast <b>compartment</b> <b>covered</b> the gas cylinders. For communication, the suit used hydrophones.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} road-going Type 57 {{included a}} smaller {{version of the}} Royale's square-bottom horseshoe grille. The sides of the engine <b>compartment</b> were <b>covered</b> with thermostatically-controlled shutters. It was a tall car, contrary to the tastes of the time.|$|R
50|$|The ball turret {{has been}} {{restored}} and a machine gun (with new ammo box) mounted {{in one of the}} waist gunner positions. New gun barrels were fabricated and added to the tail and chin positions and a fully refurbished, modified top turret has been installed. Both the ball turret and top turret can be manually operated. New signage (part of an Eagle Scout project) directs visitor attention to, and provides information about, various features of the aircraft. Crew station equipment, particularly in the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> and tail gunner positions are being restored, replaced with new surplus items, or if necessary, fabricated in preparation for reinstallation when structural repairs are completed in those positions. The tail cone has been removed and structural repairs in it are nearing completion after the tedious task of stripping all old paint was completed. The same is true of the <b>radio</b> <b>compartment</b> where structural repairs are underway following the laborious task of stripping paint. All equipment from the nose has been removed from the aircraft. Stripping paint from the nose and performing much needed repairs there will follow completion of the tail gunner and radio operator positions. Wooden components have been rebuilt or refabricated, including the floor in the waist, an electrical junction box in the bomb bay, two ammo boxes (the first two of several), the tail gunner seat, the radio operator’s desk (using mostly original wooden components), and the navigator’s desk with the restoration and re-fabrication of interior wooden doors is still in progress. All props have been stripped and prepared for painting plus the tail wheel assembly and main landing gear have been cleaned and repainted. Restoration of peripheral equipment such as bombs and bomb carts is also nearing completion.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is used in}} {{the same}} roles as the NATO [...]50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) cartridge. The two differ in bullet shape and weight, and the casing of the 12.7×108mm is {{slightly}} longer, but smaller muzzle velocity, allowing it to hold slightly more of a different type of powder. The 12.7×108mm can be used to engage a wide variety of targets on the battlefield, and will destroy unarmored vehicles, penetrate lightly armored vehicles and damage external ancillary equipment (i.e.: searchlights, radar, transmitters, vision blocks, engine <b>compartment</b> <b>covers)</b> on heavily armored vehicles such as tanks. Armor-piercing [...]50 cal ammunition will penetrate around 25 mm of armor. Normal full metal jacket [...]50 cal ammunition will only dimple tank armor, causing no damage.|$|R
