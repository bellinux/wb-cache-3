25|$|Partition- and NP-HPLC {{fell out}} of favor in the 1970s with the {{development}} of reversed-phase HPLC because of poor reproducibility of <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> due to the presence of a water or protic organic solvent layer {{on the surface of the}} silica or alumina chromatographic media. This layer changes with any changes in the composition of the mobile phase (e.g. moisture level) causing drifting <b>retention</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an upflow {{anaerobic}} sludge blanket digestion (UASB), hydraulic residence times can be as short as 1 hour to 1 day, and solid <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> can be up to 90 days. In this manner, a UASB system is able to separate solids and hydraulic <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> {{with the use of a}} sludge blanket. Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and the food to be in contact. They also allow excess material to be continuously extracted to maintain a reasonably constant volume within the digestion tanks.|$|E
25|$|Most {{biological}} oxidation processes for treating industrial wastewaters {{have in common}} the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90% removal of BOD with <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> of 1 to 10 days. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres and utilize motor-driven aerators floating {{on the surface of}} the wastewater.|$|E
30|$|According to the HPLC principle, {{polymers}} were eluted {{with low}} <b>retention</b> <b>time,</b> while monomers needed higher <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> HPLC analyses show that phenolic compounds with low <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> were detected in upper layers (0 – 25  cm), while higher <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> phenolic compounds infiltrated in deeper {{layers of the}} soil (50 – 120  cm).|$|R
30|$|The {{molecular}} ion peak for teneligliptin {{was observed at}} 427.22 in ESI mode. In the base-stressed sample, the fragments of 354.30 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.195  min, 310.30 and 214.19 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.345  min, and 178.73 and 155.65 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.205  min were observed. In the peroxide-stressed sample, the fragments of 138.08 and 136.18 were observed at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.666 and 1.467  min, respectively. In the thermally stressed sample, the fragments of 375.72 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 0.455  min and 214.20, 310.31, and 155.69 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.325  min were observed. There are no degradation peaks for teneligliptin in acid- and UV-stressed conditions.|$|R
30|$|According to LC–ESI–MS, {{before the}} elution of surfactins (4.5 – 7.2  min), several peaks {{appeared}} {{that correspond to}} unknown compounds at m/z 1012 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 4.79  min, 1026 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 5.26  min, 1026 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 5.53  min, 1040 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 5.89  min, 1054 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 6.36  min and 1068 at <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> 7.19  min. What a coincidence is that, compared with the surfactins at m/z 994, 1008, 1022, 1036 and 1050, respectively, the m/z precursor molecules are 18  Da bigger than surfactins correspondingly. As we know, the relative molecular mass of the H 2 O was just 18. We can conclude they were linear surfactins based on their chromatographic behavior and fragmentation pattern.|$|R
25|$|For CE-SERS, {{capillary}} electrophoresis eluants can be deposited onto a SERS-active substrate. Analyte <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> {{can be translated}} into spatial distance by moving the SERS-active substrate at a constant rate during {{capillary electrophoresis}}. This allows the subsequent spectroscopic technique {{to be applied to}} specific eluants for identification with high sensitivity. SERS-active substrates can be chosen that do not interfere with the spectrum of the analytes.|$|E
25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short <b>retention</b> <b>times).</b> A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E
25|$|Column {{chromatography}} is {{a separation}} technique {{in which the}} stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> of the sample.|$|E
30|$|Thus, thy {{hydraulic}} <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> (HRT) and {{the sludge}} <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> (SRT) were 24  h. The DOC-volume loading of SSW was about 16  kg/m 3 /d.|$|R
30|$|The {{molecular}} ion peak for teneligliptin {{was observed at}} 427.22 in ESI mode. In base-stressed sample, the major intense fragments with M+ of 354.30 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.195  min, 310.30 and 214.19 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.345  min, and 178.73 and 155.65 at a <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of 1.205  min were observed.

There is no degradation peaks for teneligliptin in acid- and UV-stressed conditions. The scan mode is PDA with both positive (E+) and negative (E−) scans at total ion current (TIC) chromatogram. Both the scans were compared with diode array spectra.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Retention</b> <b>time</b> - {{refers to}} the {{time spent in the}} {{leaching}} system by the solids. This is calculated as the total volumetric capacity of the leach tank/s divided by the volumetric throughput of the solid/liquid slurry. <b>Retention</b> <b>time</b> is commonly measured in hours for precious metals recovery. A sequence of leach tanks is referred to as a leach [...] "train", and <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> is measured considering the total volume of the leach train. The desired <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> is determined during the testing phase, and the system is then designed to achieve this.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{instrument}} analysis is to quantify an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some sample in the library. This is best performed by a computer {{because there are a}} myriad of visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also simultaneously correlate more data (such as the <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> identified by GC), to more accurately relate certain data.|$|E
25|$|Aerated lagoons are a low {{technology}} suspended-growth {{method of}} secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators {{floating on the}} water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer to the lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kW·h. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> of 1 to 10 days. Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long <b>retention</b> <b>times,</b> as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by {{individual}} users to store backup data in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E
40|$|Logic-compatible 2 T and 3 T {{embedded}} DRAMs (eDRAM) {{have recently}} gained their popularity in embedded applications {{because of their}} high density and good voltage margin. The most important design requirements in eDRAM cells are cell area, data <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> and read speed. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis on the data <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of various logic-compatible eDRAM cells, followed by the effects of several design factors on the <b>retention</b> <b>time.</b> A systematic methodology is proposed for enhancing the <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> of the eDRAM cells. Simulation results using a standard 65 nm CMOS technology show that the optimization process improves the data <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> more than 3 ×. Finally, the number of read operations per retention period is estimated to show the effectiveness of each eDRAM cell.

25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge <b>retention</b> <b>times,</b> usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxocobalamin {{is another}} form of B12 {{commonly}} encountered in pharmacology, but which is not normally present in the human body. Hydroxocobalamin is sometimes denoted B12a. This form of B12 is the form produced by bacteria, and is what is converted to cyanocobalmin in the commercial charcoal filtration step of production. Hydroxocobalamin has an avid affinity for cyanide ions and {{has been used as}} an antidote to cyanide poisoning. It is supplied typically in water solution for injection. Hydroxocobalamin is thought to be converted to the active enzymic forms of B12 more easily than cyanocobalamin, and since it is little more expensive than cyanocobalamin, and has longer <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> in the body, has been used for vitamin replacement in situations where added reassurance of activity is desired. Intramuscular administration of hydroxocobalamin is also the preferred treatment for pediatric patients with intrinsic cobalamin metabolic diseases, for vitamin B12 deficient patients with tobacco amblyopia (which is thought to perhaps have a component of cyanide poisoning from cyanide in cigarette smoke); and for treatment of patients with pernicious anemia who have optic neuropathy.|$|E

By measuring individual cells <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> before and after radiation exposures, we found out that the reduction is not homogeneous among cells: the amount of leakage current increase depends on the position and the energy level of the generated trap, leading to a wide distribution of <b>retention</b> <b>time</b> reduction.

2500|$|The polar analytes diffuse into a {{stationary}} water layer {{associated with the}} polar stationary phase and are thus retained. The stronger the interactions between the polar analyte and the polar stationary phase (relative to the mobile phase) the longer the elution time. The interaction strength depends on the functional groups part of the analyte molecular structure, with more polarized groups (e.g. hydroxyl-) and groups capable of hydrogen bonding inducing more retention. [...] Coulombic (electrostatic) interactions can also increase retention. Use of more polar solvents in the mobile phase will decrease the retention time of the analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to increase <b>retention</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The use of more polar {{solvents}} in {{the mobile}} phase will decrease the retention time of analytes, whereas more hydrophobic solvents tend to induce slower elution (increased <b>retention</b> <b>times).</b> Very polar solvents such as traces {{of water in}} the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the solid surface of the stationary phase forming a stationary bound (water) layer which is considered to play an active role in retention. [...] This behavior is somewhat peculiar to normal phase chromatography because it is governed almost exclusively by an adsorptive mechanism (i.e. analytes interact with a solid surface rather than with the solvated layer of a ligand attached to the sorbent surface; see also reversed-phase HPLC below). Adsorption chromatography is still widely used for structural isomer separations in both column and thin-layer chromatography formats on activated (dried) silica or alumina supports.|$|E
2500|$|Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a {{non-polar}} {{stationary phase}} and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase <b>retention</b> <b>times</b> by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the eluent.
