5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's {{instructions to}} <b>refurbish</b> the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} <b>refurbish</b> the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E

40|$|Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) manage {{products}} returned {{shortly after}} sale by either dismantling them or <b>refurbishing</b> and reselling them. These <b>refurbished</b> products technically {{perform as well}} as new products that are currently in the market. Therefore, introducing <b>refurbished</b> products can cannibalize new product demand. In this paper, we study how to maximize total profit by setting the price and the proportion of returned products to be <b>refurbished</b> in different scenarios. We model the manufacture, sale, return, refurbishment and resale processes in a general open queueing network. The results show how the optimal policy is affected by different factors such as the consumer willingness to pay for <b>refurbished</b> products, the variability in the <b>refurbishing</b> time, the ability to sort returns, and the number of times products can be <b>refurbished.</b> 1...|$|R
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to <b>refurbish</b> rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to <b>refurbish</b> St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E

The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters. Instead, it opted to <b>refurbish</b> and reclad the building in silvery metal.|$|E

In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern light rail transit as part of his Transit City plan.|$|E

5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to <b>refurbish</b> 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to <b>refurbish</b> the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to <b>refurbish</b> the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} <b>refurbish</b> all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total.

SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E
