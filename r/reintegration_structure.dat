One type is a total institution, which is an organization {{in which people are}} confined until they can adhere to society's norms, including prisons and mental hospitals. Another type of middle level organization is the <b>reintegration</b> <b>structure.</b> This structure rehabilitates those who do not conform. These include rehabilitation centers for drugs and alcohol. A final type of organization is a safety-valve organization. These provide outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, including prostitution. Communities also are instruments {{of social control}}.
