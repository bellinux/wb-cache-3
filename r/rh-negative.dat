50|$|There is no {{difference}} in postoperative blood loss, future pregnancy outcomes, or major complications in intact D&E when compared to non-intact dilation and extraction.

40|$|I N THE PRECEDING PAPER ’ our {{methods for}} {{performing}} Rh antibody titrations were described in detail, with special {{reference to the}} precautions taken to insure objective and reproducible results. Using these technics, it was shown that pregnancies with <b>Rh-negative</b> fetuses {{and the birth of}} <b>Rh-negative</b> babies have no significant effect on the Rh antibody titer of sensitized Rh-nega-tive mothers. This paper is a continuation of these studies on Rh sensitization and will present the results of observations on the effect of pregnancies with Rh-positive fetuses and birth of Rh-positive babies on the maternal Rh antibody titer. As will be pointed out, these findings have important implications with regard to the frequency with which pregnant <b>Rh-negative</b> women are apt to be-come isosensitized and give birth to erythroblastotic babies.

40|$|Transplacental or fetomaternal {{hemorrhage}} (FMH) {{may occur}} during pregnancy or at delivery {{and lead to}} immunization to the D antigen if the mother is <b>Rh-negative</b> and the baby is Rh-positive. This can result in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in subsequent D-positive pregnancies. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight the challenges associated with the effective management and prevention of Rh alloimmunization among <b>Rh-negative</b> women in Sub-Saharan Africa. In most Sub-Saharan African countries, there is poor and sometimes no alloimmunization prevention following potentially sensitizing events and during medical termination of pregnancy in <b>Rh-negative</b> women. Information about previous pregnancies and termination are often lacking in patients’ medical notes due to poor data management. These issues have made the management of <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnancy a huge challenge. Despite the fact that the prevalence of <b>Rh-negative</b> phenotype is significantly lower among Africans than Caucasians, Rh alloimmunization remains a major factor responsible for perinatal morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa and may result in the compromise of the woman’s obstetric care due to the unaffordability of anti-D immunoglobulin. There is the urgent need for the implementation of universal access to anti-D immunoglobulin for the <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnant population in Africa. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be available in cases of potentially sensitizing events such as amniocentesis, cordocentesis, antepartum hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, external cephalic version, abdominal trauma, intrauterine death and stillbirth, in utero therapeutic interventions, miscarriage, and therapeutic termination of pregnancy. There is also the need for the availability of FMH measurements following potentially sensitizing events. The low-cost acid elution method, a modification of the Kleihauer–Betke (KB) test, can become a readily available, affordable, and minimum alternative to flow cytometric measurement of FMH. Knowledge of anti-D prophylaxis among obstetricians, biomedical scientist, midwives, traditional birth attendants, pharmacists, and nurses in Africa needs to be improved. This will facilitate quality antenatal and postnatal care offered to <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnant population and improve perinatal outcomes...|$|E

Method: Descriptive observational study involving 291 consecutive <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnancies managed between January 1995 and January 2004. the perinatal mortality of 99 alloimmunized patients was compared with 192 <b>Rh-negative</b> unimmunized patients (control group). the perinatal mortality of patients managed with amniocenteses was compared to those managed with Doppler studies. Results: There were 74 patients managed with amniocenteses and 25 managed with Doppler studies. Perinatal mortality was significantly higher in the 99 <b>Rh-negative</b> isoimmunized patients than in the 192 unimmunized patients (12. 1 % versus 1 %, p = 0. 0001) and did not differ according to the management protocol used (amniocentesis 13. 5 % versus cerebral Doppler 8. 0 %, p = 0. 725). Mean gestational age and mean weight at birth in pregnancies managed with amniocenteses (35. 7 weeks and 2586 g) {{did not differ significantly}} from those managed with Doppler (36. 3 weeks and 2647 g).

40|$|Background Rhesus {{incompatibility}} is a preventable {{cause for}} severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, hydrops fetalis and still births. The prevalence of the <b>Rh-negative</b> blood group among Indian woman varies from 2 % - 10 %. Despite declining {{the incidence of}} Rhesus incompatibility, due to availability of anti-D immunoglobulin, and improved antenatal care of the <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnant woman, it still accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and neuro-morbidity. The prevalence of <b>Rh-negative</b> women having Rh-positive neonates is 60 %. Objectives This study aimed to estimate the incidence of Rh iso-immunization and evaluate the outcomes of Rh iso-immunized neonates. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit, Princess Esra hospital, Deccan college of medical sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Consecutive intramural and extramural neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit with the <b>Rh-negative</b> mother’s blood group and hyperbilirubinemia were enrolled. Neonates born to Rh+ve mothers were excluded. Neonatal gestational age, birth weight, age at admission, duration of phototherapy, duration of hospitalization, neonatal examination and investigations were recorded in a predesigned, pretested performa. Results A total of 90 neonates were born to <b>Rh-negative</b> mothers, of which 70 % (63) had the Rh-positive blood group and 30 % had the <b>Rh-negative</b> blood group. Of these 63 neonates, 48 (76. 2 %) had hyperbilirubinemia and 43 neonates (68. 3 %) had significant hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin > 15 mg/dL). Among them, 2 %, 75 % and 23 % were born to primi, multi and grandmutli, respectively. Also, 14. 5 % of the neonates were large for dates (LFD), 75 % appropriate for dates (AFD) and 10. 5 % were small for dates (SFD). Premature and SFD neonates had higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia. Significantly higher incidence of jaundice occurred within 72 hours of life. The mean serum bilirubin level among neonates with significant hyperbilirubinemia was 17. 98 ± 1. 76 (95 % CI: 17. 43 - 18. 52) while that of neonates without significant hyperbilirubinemia was 13. 1 ± 0. 53 (95 % CI: 12. 47 - 13. 77) with statistical significance (P < 0. 0001). Maternal multiparity, direct coombs test (DCT) positivity, and abnormal neurosonogram (NSG) were important accompaniments of high serum bilirubin levels. Conclusions Incidence of Rh-positive phenotype in neonates born to <b>Rh-negative</b> mothers is 70 %. Incidence of hyperbilirubinemia among them is 76. 2 % and that of significant hyperbilirubinemia was 68. 3 %. The incidence of DCT positivity was 20. 9 %.

40|$|Between 1970 and 1976 in the Yorkshire region the {{incidence}} of Rh antibodies in <b>Rh-negative</b> pregnant women fell by 70 %. This decrease occurred in both old (long-standing) and new (first-affected) cases, which emphasised that the reduction in numbers was as much due to fewer pregnancies among <b>Rh-negative</b> mothers as to administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. Nevertheless, {{the incidence}} has begun to level out. The continued incidence of first-affected cases is caused by three main factors: failure of administration of anti-D immunoglobulin after normal deliveries and abortions; a steady incidence of antibodies in primigravidae; and cases in which administration of anti-D immunoglobulin had failed to protect. Administering anti-D antenatally might reduce {{the incidence of}} new cases among primigravidae who are sensitised before anti-D is normally given. Even without routine antenatal administration of anti-D, the incidence of severely affected Rh babies in the Yorkshire region could be reduced to one or two isolated cases a year in a population of three to four million by administering anti-D after all <b>Rh-negative</b> deliveries and after every abortion...|$|E
40|$|Billingham et al. [1] {{reported}} that mice and chickens injected as embryos with cells from other strains acquired a persistent tolerance to later skin grafts from the donor strains. It seemed possible {{to us that}} a similar, but naturally acquired, tolerance might be in part responsible for the variation in response of <b>Rh-negative</b> persons exposed to the Rh antigens. [2] The hypothesis to be tested was that <b>Rh-negative</b> children of Rh-positive mothers might, {{as a result of}} their exposure as embryos to the maternal Rh antigen, acquire a degree of persistent tolerance toward the antigen. <b>Rh-negative</b> children of <b>Rh-negative</b> mothers, on the other hand, could have had no similar embryonic exposure and might therefore be expected to react more easily upon encountering an Rh-positive antigen in later life. We have collected data on the mothers of two groups of <b>Rh-negative</b> women: first, those in whom there is no evidence of Rh sensitization within three Rh-positive pregnancies and, second, those who have developed evidence of Rh sensitization during or before their third Rh-positive pregnancy. The first-group we classify as relatively "tolerant" and the second as relatively "intolerant" to Rh antigens. Table 1 lists the Rh types of the mothers of women in these two groups. A simple χ^ 2 test for homogeneity yields a probability of less-than 0. 01 that the two samples of mothers could have been drawn by chance from the same population. In other words, these data seem to offer good reason to believe that the degree of Rh tolerance displayed by <b>Rh-negative</b> women is indeed related to their mothers' Rh types. A number of cases included in the study have been omitted from Table 1 because of uncertainties in their classification. For example, stillbirths or miscarriages of unknown Rh type made it impossible to classify some of them according to the criteria of tolerance we have employed. Some of the data that are included in Table 1 are open to question on other grounds. Ten of the women were given transfusions or injections of blood at some time prior to their third Rh-positive pregnancy. Some of these transfusions were with Rh-positive blood, others with blood of unknown Rh type, and others probably with <b>Rh-negative</b> blood. Two additional women believed that they might have received injections or transfusions of blood but were not certain that they had. It is difficult to evaluate the number of exposures of these twelve women to Rh antigens or to weigh the sensitizing significance of blood injections or transfusions relative to the importance of an Rh-positive pregnancy. Table 2 lists the data after the exclusion of all cases in which there is a record suggesting that blood may have been transfused or injected. A χ^ 2 test for homogeneity on the data of Table 2 yields a probability of less than 0. 001. It should be noted that transfusions or injections with Rh-positive blood appear to provide a very effective stimulus to Rh sensitization and that a considerable number of the <b>Rh-negative</b> daughters of Rh-positive women who fall in the "intolerant" class have been stimulated by this route...|$|E
