25|$|On 17 June 2008, the {{municipality}} of Rana dismissed their Chief Municipal Officer, Jan Reitehaug, and the Financial Director.

This denomination was originally intended to pay the <b>fee</b> for <b>registered</b> mail. However, the change in <b>registered</b> mail <b>fees</b> that necessitated the introduction of the 8-cent Columbian also changed the most common purpose of this value; it instead paid the full postage for registered first-class mail, rather than just the additional fee.|$|R

5000|$|In both {{of these}} {{countries}} statutory reform has altered {{the manner in which}} real property dealings are conducted. What is termed a [...] "mortgage" [...] is a legal interest that is <b>registered</b> against the <b>fee</b> simple title of the property. Since in both countries, the Torrens title system of land registration is used, being registered as proprietor or as a mortgagee creates an indefeasible interest (unless the acquisition of the registration was by land transfer fraud). The mortgagee therefore never holds the fee simple, and there is a statutory process for initiating and conducting a mortgagee sale in the event that the mortgagor defaults. In New Zealand, as in England, say, the land title database is now electronic so there are no paper [...] "title documents".|$|R

The State of Wisconsin as a whole is viewed as the most progressive state in the Union for the implementation of modern land information systems (LIS).. All 72 counties are actively pursuing land records modernization (see cover figure).. By 2003, about 60 % of the originally designated foundational records will have been modernized, and 80 % of all property records will be modernized.. The WLIP has accomplished and will continue to carry out its legislative charges. Modernization investments have resulted in numerous types of economic benefits:. The six-dollar increase in the <b>Register</b> of Deeds'recording <b>fee</b> has resulted in a $ 71 -million information investment over the past decade. Equal matching funds by Wisconsin local governments have been generated both in new dollars and in-kind contributions.. New companies have been formed and older companies have expanded their expertise and skills. Now, Wisconsin companies are moving new outlets into other states. These efforts have resulted in new jobs, higher-paying jobs, and jobs with a future.. Because of modernization of land records, citizens and companie [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This comment {{reviews the}} {{decision}} of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Gill v. Bucholtz and explores the implications for the allocation of risk in the province’s title registration system. The case involved a rogue who forged the transfer of a <b>fee</b> simple and <b>registered</b> that transfer. The person on title, also a party to the fraud, then transferred two mortgages to bona fide purchasers. The purchasers of these charges held title insurance. The question before the court was whether the title registration system’s assurance fund would compensate the original holder of the fee simple interest for the mortgages that, because of fraud, had been <b>registered</b> against the <b>fee</b> simple interest, or whether the title insurers would pay out the value of the mortgages to the mortgagees. The answer turned on whether the mortgagees held valid interests because they had dealt in good faith with the person registered on title, or whether they held invalid interests because the person on title was a party to the fraud. In interpreting British Columbia’s Land Title Act, the court re-asserted the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet in respect of charges: title holders can only give that which they validly hold. If they hold because of fraud, then they have nothing to give. As a result, the title insurers had to pay out for the invalid mortgages. More generally, the decision confirms that registering charges, defined in the Act as any interest less than the fee simple, does not cure defects in those interests. After Gill, even when the instrument creating the charge is apparently valid because it has been executed by the person registered as the holder of the fee simple interest, the charge will be invalid if the registered title holder is on title because of fraud. The comment concludes by exploring the implications of this decision for the allocation of risk in British Columbia’s title registration system...|$|R
