The model {{is based on}} a generative grammar of abstract prosodic functionally involved units. This grammar creates for each sentence a structure of immediate prosodic constituents {{in the form of a}} tree. Each prosodic word of a sentence is assigned with a description vector by a description function and this vector is used by a <b>realization</b> <b>function</b> to create appropriate intonation for the prosodic word. Parameters of the model are automatically set up using real speech data from a prosody corpus, which is also described. ...|$|E

40|$|A Dynamic {{model of}} Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), based on {{chemical}} kinetics principles and artificial intelligence, is developed. The model can rapidly predict the combustion probability, thermochemistry properties, and exact {{timing of the}} Start of Combustion (SOC). A <b>realization</b> <b>function</b> is developed {{on the basis of}} the Sandia National Laboratory chemical kinetics model, and GRI 3. 0 methane chemical mechanism. The inlet conditions are optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA), so that combustion initiates and SOC timing posits in the desired crank angle. The best SOC timing to achieve higher performance and efficiency in HCCI engines is between 5 and 15 degrees crank angle (CAD) after top dead center (TDC). To achieve this SOC timing, in the first case, the inlet temperature and equivalence ratio are optimized simultaneously and in the second case, compression ratio is optimized by GA. The model’s results are validated with previous works. The SOC timing can be predicted in less than 0. 01 second and the CPU time savings are encouraging. This model can successfully be used for real engine control applications...|$|E

Emphasis is placed on creditors secured by the lien to real estate. The thesis is focused on realization of the lien and position of secured creditors in legal proceedings concerning realization of the lien. In first chapter thesis deals with concept of security and its purpose, in particular the lien. Description of distinction between security and reinforcement of the debt is included. It also deals with function of the lien - security function and <b>realization</b> <b>function.</b> Realization of the lien is achieved in legal proceeding by public auction, execution of decision by court or licensed executor. Thesis describe position of secured creditors in these legal proceedings {{and in the process}} of sale of the pledge. Thesis also examines execution of decision by court lien relating real estate and licensed executor lien relating real estate, its purpose and procedure of creation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present sublien {{as a form of}} security. The sublien is a special kind of {{proprietary}} security interests, which arises by pledging a receivable secured by a lien. Accessoriness and subsidiarity are the main characteristics of sublien which significantly affect all its aspects including the two main functions of sublien - security function and <b>realization</b> <b>function.</b> The focus of the thesis is on presenting sublien in regard to its close relation to a lien and to a lien on receivables. The thesis presents sublien in its complexity including the application of appropriate section regarding the lien. Above that the thesis formulates some of the crucial questions that have risen with the recent changes in the Czech civil law. The thesis consists of three chapters. Chapter One deals with lien in general and focuses on its characteristics and principles {{as well as on the}} establishment, realization and extinction of lien. Furthermore, there are presented the subjects of a lien and their rights and duties. Chapter Two deals with lien on receivables, concerning the special modifications and differences in comparison to lien in general. Chapter Three is of main significance, since it concerns the problem of sublien itself. Successively, there are presented the issues of the classification [...] ...|$|E

The objectives {{of this research}} are to identify and classify the types of functions subject and to analyze the <b>realizations</b> of <b>functions</b> subject. This research uses a descriptive method. There are three steps to finish this research. First step is preparation, the writer reads the speech {{to find out the}} data. Second step is data collection. The writer collects the subject found in the speech and compares them with the speech text then the writer identifies and classifies the kinds of function subject according to the theory of Aarts and Aarts (1982). Third step is data analysis, to analyze the data about the <b>realizations</b> of <b>functions</b> subject, the writer uses the theory from Aarts and Aarts (1982) to analyze and describe the <b>realizations</b> of <b>function</b> subejct. The result of this research: First, it shows that according to the theory of Aarts and Aarts (1982), there are four criteria of functions subject, but there were only three criteria of function subject found in this speech, those are Position, Concord, Passivization. Furthermore, the six <b>realizations</b> of <b>function</b> subject, those are Noun Phrase, Finite Clause, Non- Finite Clause, Anticipatory it + Finite/Non-Finite Clause, Unstressed there in existential sentences, and Prepositional Phrase found in the speech San Bernardino Terror Attack and the War On ISIS.
