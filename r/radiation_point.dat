The OrthoDB implementation employs a Best-Reciprocal-Hit (BRH) clustering algorithm based on all-against-all Smith-Waterman protein sequence comparisons. Gene set pre-processing selects the longest protein-coding transcript of alternatively spliced genes and of very similar gene copies. The procedure triangulates BRHs to progressively build the clusters and requires an overall minimum sequence alignment overlap to avoid domain walking. These core clusters are further expanded to include all more closely related within-species in-paralogs, and the previously identified very similar gene copies.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} abdominal chemoradiation (CRT) for locally advanced cancers and bone mineral density (BMD) reduction in the vertebral spine. Data from 272 patients who underwent abdominal radiation therapy from January 1997 to May 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-two patients received computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen prior to initiation and at least twice after radiation therapy. Bone attenuation (in Hounsfield unit) (HU) measurements were collected for each vertebral level from T 7 to L 5 using sagittal CT images. <b>Radiation</b> <b>point</b> dose was obtained at each mid-vertebral body from the radiation treatment plan. Percent change in bone attenuation (Δ%HU) between baseline and post-radiation therapy were computed for each vertebral body. The Δ%HU was compared against radiation dose using Pearson's linear correlation. Abdominal radiotherapy caused significant reduction in vertebral BMD as measured by HU. Patients who received only chemotherapy did not show changes in their BMD in this study. The Δ%HU was significantly correlated with the <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> dose to the vertebral body (R=- 0. 472, P< 0. 001) within 4 - 8 months following RT. The same relationship persisted in subsequent follow up scans 9 months following RT (R=- 0. 578, P< 0. 001). Based on the result of linear regression, 5 Gy, 15 Gy, 25 Gy, 35 Gy, and 45 Gy caused 21. 7 %, 31. 1 %, 40. 5 %, 49. 9 %, and 59. 3 % decrease in HU following RT, respectively. Our generalized linear model showed that pre-RT HU had a positive effect (β= 0. 830) on determining post-RT HU, while number of months post RT (β=- 0. 213) and <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> dose (β=- 1. 475) had a negative effect. A comparison of the predicted versus actual HU showed significant correlation (R= 0. 883, P< 0. 001) with {{the slope of the}} best linear fit= 0. 81. Our model's predicted HU were within ± 20 HU of the actual value in 53 % of cases, 70 % of the predictions were within ± 30 HU, 81 % were within ± 40 HU, and 90 % were within ± 50 HU of the actual post-RT HU.

To complete the picture, previous Oliner's formula is obtained as a limiting case of this general formulation. These results would provide a very useful tool for the correct prediction of the radiating features of 1 -D LWAs. © 2017 Euraap...|$|R

On the basis of calculated elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections of neutrons on carbon atoms from the database ENDF-VII (neutron energies up to 150 MeV) and the data obtained using FLUKA, (neutron energy over 150 MeV) the numerical calculations of generation rates for primary <b>point</b> <b>radiation</b> defects are made due to formation of secondary fast neutrons. It is shown that the greatest generation rate of <b>point</b> <b>radiation</b> defects in graphite materials is determined by secondary pions with the generation rate of point defect formation {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the production rates of point defects due to secondary fast neutrons and other fast secondary particles. So the generation rate of primary <b>point</b> <b>radiation</b> defects in the interaction of pions and electrons with graphite collimator materials of LHC are comparable in order of magnitude (0. 004 dpa/s per bunch) for each type of secondary particles.

40|$|Abstract- The {{effect of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation {{on human health}} {{is the subject of}} recent interest and study. ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) study has concluded that the exposure levels due to cell phone base stations are generally around one-ten-thousandth of the guideline levels. Moreover, the WHO has classified mobile phone radiation on the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) scale into Group 2 B – possibly carcinogenic to humans. That means that there could be some risk. On the other hand, telecom service providers are worried about QoS (quality of service) of mobile services after implementation of stricter norms regarding cell tower radiations. Therefore an exercise was done to measure cell tower radiations at various places of dense urban regions, in the context of QoS measurement at these places. Exercise was also done to understand near field behavior of mobile towers and practically realization of compliance distance. This paper deals with practically observed radiation level (power density) and QoS benchmarks at various sample points along with practically realization of safer zone from cell tower <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> for various sets of EIRP/ERP, antenna gain, bands etc. Comparison among theoretical and practically observed values of signal strength/power density/EIRP is also done with MATLAB program...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues with {{radiation}} from the natural isotopes 40 K, 226 Ra (238 U) and 232 Th and their decay products is the forthcoming legislation from the European Commission in relation to its Basic Safety Directive (2014). The European legislation is mandatory {{and could not be}} overthrown by national legislation. Hence, even though the BSS is still a directive it is foreseen as becoming a regulation in due time. The reference value of the natural isotopes, from a <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> of view, set for building materials is 1 mSv per year (EC, 2014). Earlier recommendations (The Radiation Protection Authorities in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, 2000) within the Nordic countries set an upper limit at 2 mSv per year of radiation from building materials. The main objective within the frame of the thesis was to investigate gamma radiation in relation to Swedish aggregates and their use as final construction products and the applicability and use of a model (EC, 1999) for building materials to calculate the effective dose within a pre-defined room. Part of the thesis also investigates different methodologies {{that can be used to}} assess the radiation in a construction material made up of several constituents (building materials) and aims to show that for some purposes as for the construction industries (precast concrete), that a hand-held spectrometer can be used with good accuracy, even though the object is limited in thickness and size. Secondly, the author proposes a simplified way of assessing the radiation in a construction material by use of correlation coefficient of a specified recipe by use of a hand-held spectrometer. Moreover, an understanding of the different building materials´ contribution to the finalized construction product, e. g. concrete is demonstrated, and how to achieve a good control of the radiation levels in the concrete building.

During this procedure, both the patient and the physician are exposed to some radiation. Measurement of radiation doses in patients and personnel are important. Patient radiation doses are used for comparison with other centers for achieving the best possible radiation practice. In addition, there are performance checks for the fluoroscopy machines so that x-ray emitting machines should work at the optimum level ie, producing good images at minimum possible radiation doses. Material and Methods: This is a review of literature and discussion on radiation dose to patients and personnel, and on basic radiation safety tenets and their application in urological interventions of PCNL procedure. Results: Radiation doses during PCNL have gone down over the time due to advances in technology. However, as radiation is hazardous, {{there is no room for}} complacency. A hospital’s medical physicist may ensure even further reduction of x-ray dose by carrying out regular dosimetry and quality assurance tests on the fluoroscopy machines. A survey meter may provide an easy and quicker but not-so-accurate method for occupation exposure determination. Conclusion: The practice of PCNL procedures seems to be quite safe with <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> of view. The quick, easy, and economical method of estimation of radiation dose using survey meter may need further calibration with the standard thermoluminescence dosimetry method. Setting optimum x-ray parameters, incorporation of filters, and quality assurance tests are a few areas where medical physicists may help in further reduction of radiation doses. </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Spectators of any open stadia {{are exposed}} to the {{environmental}} conditions which may be sever, especially in extreme climatic conditions. The architectural components of the building, such as the stadium bowl and the roof can either augment or attenuate the effect of the environmental factors. Among the prevailing outdoor environmental factors temperature an relative humidity cannot be directly influenced by the means of architecture. However, solar radiation and airflow are affected by stadium morphology and design. A stadium design of protective character is advantageous for cold climates from wind effect point of view, nevertheless from solar <b>radiation</b> <b>point</b> of view, an open character would be suitable. The last depends not only on the form but also the photometric characteristics of the roofing material. A sophisticated equilibrium reached through a compromise of these requirements leads to optimised stadium design solutions. An attempt is made using the results of wind tunnel experiments carried out in one of the boundary layer wind tunnels of the CSTB Nantes, on a stadium model and the existing comfort indices, to support an environmental conscious stadium design in cold climate, focusing on spectators ' aerothermal comfort. The impact of the following architectural parameters has been investigated: roof inclination, overhang and façade porosity. Based on the wind tunnel measurements iso-lines of relative air velocity compared to the reference wind velocity in front of the stadium have been defined. It facilitates on one hand to define the critical area of spectators ' terrace and their ratio to the whole area, on the other hand to find local corrective measures, such as brise vents. An algorithm has been developed to calculate the seasonal or yearly frequency of comfort indices on the spectator terrace...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{radiation}} sources exist at the Department of Radiology and the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge. Radiation sources {{can also be}} found in areas outside of these departments due to the wide use of mobile xray machines and fluoroscopic c-arm equipment and also due to the movement of patients that have received diagnostic or therapeutic doses of radionuclides. In a proposal for a new legislation from the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (SSI), which was later issued as legislation SSI FS 2005 : 6, the effective doses of the general public from a practice using ionising radiation need to be kept below stated limit of 0. 1 mSv/year. This project was performed to verify the dose limit for individuals of the general public in the above mentioned practices. Long-term measurements with TL-dosimeters were utilised to carry out the environmental monitoring of the areas throughout the Departments of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine. To assess the contribution of ionising radiation from rooms housing mobile fluoroscopic c-arm equipment to surrounding areas, a tissue equivalent phantom of size (30 × 30 × 20 cm 3) was employed to simulate a patient and the scattered radiation was monitored by using area monitors, such as portable proportional counters. The annual effective doses were calculated in terms of personal dose equivalent as well as ambient dose equivalent monitored using TL-dosimeters and area monitors, respectively. The stated limit of 0. 1 mSv/year to the general public was verified by risk analysis.

This allows us to use results for computing the displacement field from point sources in general anisotropic media utilizing the Gaussian curvature of the slowness surface of the considered waves. Since the formulae used are based on high frequency asymptotics the procedure gives reliable results as long as no parabolic points of the slowness surface are encountered. <b>Radiation</b> patterns of <b>point</b> sources for models representing rocks in the crust and upper mantle are presented and discussed. The <b>radiation</b> from <b>point</b> sources in anisotropic models is compared with the <b>radiation</b> from <b>point</b> sources in average isotropic models to emphasize the differences. Anisotropy is either caused by aligned cracks (crustal rocks) or by aligned olivine crystals (upper mantle rocks). Considering models of aligned cracks differing only in the physical parameters of the crack material (water or gas) significantly different radiation patterns are obtained. Models with wet cracks exhibit focusing of quasi S-wave energy for some directions whereas this effect is not observed for the corresponding model with dry cracks. The quasi S-wave radiation pattern from explosions are multilobed and the wet crack models exhibit more lobes than the dry crack models. The radiation of single forces in olivine shows strong energy focusing (wave tuning) of quasi S waves, however, for realistic compositions of upper mantle rocks with some 10 per cent of preferentially orientated olivine this wave tuning is less pronounced.
