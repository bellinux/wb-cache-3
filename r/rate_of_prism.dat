40|$|Learning, {{according}} to Oxford Dictionary, is “to gain knowledge or skill by studying, from experience, from being taught, etc. ” In {{order to learn}} from experience, {{the central nervous system}} has to decide what action leads to what consequence, and temporal perception plays a critical role in determining the causality between actions and consequences. In motor adaptation, causality between action and consequence is implicitly assumed so that a subject adapts to a new environment based on the consequence caused by her action. Subjective feeling of temporal order of action and consequence, however, can be modified or even reversed when her sense of simultaneity is manipulated with an artificially delayed feedback. Our previous study (Tanaka, Homma & Imamizu (2011) Exp Brain Res) demonstrated that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation was unaffected when the subjective delay of visual feedback was shortened. This study asked whether subjects could adapt to prism adaptation and whether the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation was affected when the subjective temporal order was illusory reversed. Adapting to additional 100 ms delay and its sudden removal caused a positive shift of point of simultaneity in a temporal-order judgment experiment, indicating an illusory reversal of action and consequence. We found that, even in this case, the subjects were able to adapt to prism displacement with the learning rate that was statistically indistinguishable to that without temporal adaptation. This result provides further evidence to the dissociation between conscious temporal perception and motor adaptation...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} two processes {{are relevant to}} the growth of ice crystals from the vapour phase : i) diffusion process of water molecules, ii) surface kinetic process for incorporating the molecules into crystal lattice. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the interaction of basal and prism faces from various points of view by taking into account both processes self-consistently. The obtained results are as follows : (1) The growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> face decreases with increasing axial ratio c/b, i. e. increasing are a of prism face, under the condition of constant periphery length of a crystal. On the other hand, the growth rate of basal face increases, since both faces scramble for water molecules in air. (2) The interaction of both faces decreases with increasing diffusion constant. (3) The mass growth rate is almost independent of the axial ratio for a constant periphery length of a crystal and for various diffusion constant...|$|E
50|$|Dove prisms have an {{interesting}} property that when they are rotated along their longitudinal axis, the transmitted image rotates at twice the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism.</b> This property means they can rotate {{a beam of light}} by an arbitrary angle, making them useful in beam rotators, which have applications in fields such as interferometry, astronomy, and pattern recognition.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{approximately}} {{estimate the}} slip <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the WBSF from the offset of Shionomisaki Canyon (Figure 3). First, we estimate a minimum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> slip. The 6 -km offset {{of the western}} sidewall of the canyon {{was caused by the}} cumulative right-slip on the WBSF. It is evident that the channel offset has been increasing progressively by incision of the continental slope since Shionomisaki Canyon was established. Therefore, the maximum age of the canyon offset is the age when the accretionary wedge front was at the present-day offset point. By considering the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the accretionary <b>prism</b> calculated mainly from the shape <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> imaged on seismic profiles (Figures 2 and 6) and the thickness of incoming sediment (Westbrook 1994), we can approximately calculate the depositional age <b>of</b> the accretionary <b>prism</b> at the offset point at 20 km distance from the trough axis as 1.7 Ma. Anma et al. (2011) studied seafloor outcrop samples of the accretionary wedge at the offset region and estimated the depositional age at approximately 2 Ma (yellow star in Figure 3 a). The present mega-splay fault off Kumano was initially a frontal thrust at 1.95 Ma (Strasser et al. 2009). These ages give the maximum age of the channel offset; therefore, the minimum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> strike-slip along the WBSF can be calculated as approximately 3 mm/year by dividing the offset length by the age (= 6 km/ 2 Ma). Because this rate is a minimum value, we estimate a more realistic slip rate using other information as follows.|$|R
40|$|Research {{shows that}} low-volume roads, {{including}} commonly studied forest roads, can have many effects on {{water quality and}} aquatic resources. The temporal and spatial relationships of these environmental effects are complex. Water quality sampling is costly, and results are difficult to link to specific road problems. Research results from other road systems or regions are often dated and not reflective of a well-maintained road system. Because most best management practices deal with new roads, a landscape-level survey is essential for understanding and managing the environmental effects of roads at a landscape or watershed scale. This rapid survey has been developed by using monitoring and research results. Metrics were developed to quantify the environmental effects of road systems: road location in relation to streams or slopes prone to landslide or erosion; stream crossing effects on fish passage; washout and diversion risk at stream crossings; percent of road system with hydrologic connection to streams; land area dedicated to roads and not growing forests; and general condition <b>rating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism,</b> surface, drainage system, drainage structures, and brush and weeds. This survey analyzes conditions {{on the ground and}} is organized in a database and linked spatially to a geographic information system. Application of this survey to three watersheds indicates that most serious problems are limited in extent and severity. Performance measures and benchmarks have been developed and evaluated on the basis of information drawn from this survey...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical prismatic layers in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Pinctada and aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Anodonta: <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Unio; <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course <b>of</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis. Meanwhile, the spongy matrix, regardless of being inter- or intraprismatic, is basophilic, and will have some connections with mineralization <b>of</b> <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Prism {{adaptation}} induces rapid recalibration of visuomotor coordination. The neural mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation {{have come}} under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, {{but not so much}} that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated. We propose recommendations for fMRI studies <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation based on the design-specific constraints and our results. </p...|$|R
