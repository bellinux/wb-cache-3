5|$|Although it {{has been}} a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different <b>routings</b> for M-171 out of the former US23 <b>routings</b> in the area.

40|$|SCALABLE SOURCE <b>ROUTING</b> {{is a novel}} routing {{approach}} for large unstructured networks, for example hybrid mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), mesh networks, or sensor-actuator networks. It is especially suited for organically growing networks of many resource-limited mobile devices supported by a few fixed-wired nodes. SCALABLE SOURCE <b>ROUTING</b> is a full-fledged routing protocol that directly provides the semantics of a structured peer-to-peer overlay. Hence, it can serve as an efficient basis for fully decentralized applications on mobile devices. SCALABLE SOURCE <b>ROUTING</b> combines source routing in the physical network with Chord-like routing in the virtual ring formed by the address space. Message forwarding greedily decreases the distance in the virtual ring while preferring physically short paths. Unlike previous approaches, scalability is achieved without imposing artificial hierarchies or assigning location-dependent addresses. SCALABLE SOURCE <b>ROUTING</b> enables any-to-any communication in a flat address space without maintaining any-to-any routes. Each node proactively discovers its virtual vicinity using an iterative process. Additionally, it passively caches {{a limited amount of}} additional paths. By means of extensive simulation, we show that SCALABLE SOURCE <b>ROUTING</b> is resource-efficient and scalable well beyond 10, 000 nodes. A MIPS...|$|R

We show that common design flaws in these schemes lead to highly effective {{attacks against the}} anonymity provided by the schemes. These attacks stem from attacks on DHT routing, and are not mitigated by the well-known DHT security mechanisms due to a fundamental mismatch between the security requirements of DHT <b>routing’s</b> putget functionality and anonymous <b>routing’s</b> relay selection functionality. Our attacks essentially allow an adversary that controls {{only a small fraction}} of the relays to function as a global active adversary. We apply these attacks in more detail to two schemes: Salsa and Cashmere.

40|$|An Ad-Hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of wireless mobile hosts that can dynamically organize into a wireless network without the support of any infrastructure or centralized administration such as the base stations. The data transmission in Ad-Hoc networks can be achieved via the nearby mobile hosts interchanging message information. Routing is a very important key research issue in Ad-Hoc wireless network. Under the identity and limited resources of Ad-Hoc wireless network such as move arbitrarily, limited network bandwidth, limited memory capacity and limited battery power, the efficiency of routing schemes in Ad-Hoc wireless networks become more important and challenging than in traditional networks. Much research has been done on designing Ad-Hoc routing protocols and some well known protocols are also being implemented in practical situations. However, one major drawback in existing state-of-the-art protocols, such as the AODV routing protocol, is the time-varying nature of the wireless channels among the mobile hosts is ignored. This is a serious design drawback because the varying channel quality can lead to very poor overall route quality, in turn result in low data throughput. We propose a new Ad-Hoc routing algorithm that dynamically change the routing paths according to the channel conditions. Extensive simulation results indicate that our proposed protocol are more efficient. Ad-Hoc無線網路是指由一群無線行動主機(mobile host) 動態形成的一個無線網路，在此網路中並不需要任何網路的基礎建設和集中式的管理，如基地台(base station) 。所有的通訊均可藉由鄰近的行動主機相互傳遞和交換訊息來達成。Ad-Hoc無線網路中，繞路更是一項非常重要的課題。如何在Ad-Hoc無線網路的特性(如行主機可隨意移動、網路頻寬有限、記憶體容量和電池持續力等資源都很有限的情況下），如何有效的繞送來傳遞訊息，將較傳統的有線網路更為重要，也更具挑戰性。已經有許多的研究設計在Ad-Hoc的繞送演算法，一些廣為人知的繞送演算法已經被執行在實際情況下。然而，有一個主要缺點在最先前的繞送演算法是被忽略的就是在行動主機之間的無線頻道會依時間而自然改變；像AODV繞送演算法。這是一個非常嚴重的缺點，因為多變的頻道品質將會導致全部繞送品質變的非常差，再者導致較差的資料處理量。在本論文中，我們提出一個可依造頻道情況動態改變繞送路徑的繞送演算法；大量的模擬結果顯示我們推薦的繞送演算法是比AODV繞送演算法來的有效能。目錄 論文摘要 1 ABSTRACT 2 目錄 3 圖表目錄 5 第 1 章 簡介 6 1. 1 概論 6 1. 2 研究動機及重要性 7 1. 3 論文架構 7 第 2 章 知識背景 9 2. 1 無線網路 9 2. 2 AD-HOC 無線網路 12 第 3 章 相關研究 16 3. 1 TABLE-DRIVEN <b>ROUTING</b> PROTOCOL 17 3. 2 ON-DEMAND <b>ROUTING</b> PROTOCOL 19 3. 3 HYBIRD <b>ROUTING</b> PROTOCOL 24 第 4 章 預期式繞送協定 26 4. 1 基本定義 26 4. 2 繞送路徑的尋找(ROUTE DISCOVERY) 27 4. 3 繞送路徑的維護(ROUTE MAINTENANCE) 30 4. 4 CAPS繞送分析 32 第 5 章 模擬結果與效能評估 34 5. 1 模擬架構 34 5. 1. 1 模擬環境 34 5. 1. 2 模擬環境參數設定 34 5. 2 模擬結果與效能分析 35 5. 2. 1 平均點對點的延遲時間(Average End-to-End Delay) 35 5. 2. 2 封包成功傳送的比例(Successful Percentage of Packet Delivery) 38 5. 2. 3 繞送的花費(Routing Overhead) 43 5. 2. 4 平均連結的產量(Average Link Throughput) 46 5. 3 總結 49 第 6 章 結論與未來展望 51 參考文獻 5...|$|R
