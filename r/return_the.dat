In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope Alexander III, whom the king had just recognised as pope instead of Alexander's rival, Victor IV, intimating that the canonisation of King Edward the Confessor, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted as a reward for Henry's recognition of Alexander.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their <b>return.</b> <b>The</b> Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to <b>return</b> <b>the</b> post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments <b>return</b> <b>the</b> ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments <b>return</b> <b>the</b> ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war.

Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not <b>return</b> <b>the</b> enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws.

The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In <b>return</b> <b>the</b> FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> title <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> of <b>the</b> Soldier embodies {{a common}} trope in Great War literature: {{soldiers}} return from war {{and interact with}} everyday life, confronting trauma sustained through the brutality of war. <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> of <b>the</b> Soldier is the first deliberate evocation of <b>the</b> <b>returned</b> soldier in literature. West's treatment of <b>the</b> <b>returning</b> soldier in <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> of <b>the</b> Soldier is deliberately distanced from the war. The trauma Chris suffers in <b>The</b> <b>Return</b> of <b>the</b> Soldier becomes an isolated piece of evidence of the war's effect on a society {{that appears to be}} otherwise functioning normally. This distance is very similar to the distance from war and its trauma in Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room.|$|R
