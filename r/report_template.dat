Many slots have a procedure attached; the procedure obtains the information from a database, if it is available, or displays a menu of possible values, or asks the user a question. The document templates are arranged in a hierarchy, so that the slots in common to all documents of a class, such as meeting announcements, need to be specified only once; these slots than inherit down to all descendants of the class.

In MRRT <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> are provided in HTML 5, a syntax that enables direct management by web browsers. The data structure is flexible. It allows both management and free text and coded entries, e.g. using RadLex. Basic metadata use terms from the Dublin Core metadata element set, a standard terminology for document metadata [20]. This choice strikes a balance between expression of coded content and description of a user interface and the related data capture methods [21, 22].|$|R

In this paper, we present {{an assessment of}} the impact of a thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) template on diagnostic classification and cytohistologic concordance. Materials and Methods: A thyroid FNAC <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> was developed and introduced at a university teaching hospital. We examined FNAC reports for a five-month period before introduction of the template and compared these to the five month period after the template introduction. We recorded diagnostic categorization as well as cytohistologic correlation. Results: A total of 168 cases were identified in the five month period prior to the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> and 172 cases in the five month period after the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template.</b> The template appeared to improve the diagnostic precision of benign conditions without altering the proportion of cases classified as unsatisfactory, benign or abnormal. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of cytohistologic concordance before and after the template introduction. Conclusions: The introduction of a <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> for thyroid FNAC improved diagnostic precision of benign conditions and did not alter the general diagnostic classification or cytohistologic concordance...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{emissions}} at {{the level}} of countries, states, regions or provinces and even larger companies in most cases is a knowledge-intensive exercise. Guidelines, guidebooks and other guidance documents to prepare emissions inventories typically contain thousands of pages with emission estimation methods and specific and aggregated emission factors for large numbers of sources. The personnel responsible for the compilation of an emission inventory therefore needs to browse through large amounts of material to find the specific information needed for his application. To support the compilation of emission inventories we developed, {{within the framework of the}} European Environment Agency’s set of software tools a user friendly expert system, that makes existing knowledge and expertise directly available to the individual who is compiling the emission inventory. The expert system consists of an application using a knowledge database to draw the estimation methods and emission factors from. Upon start of the application, the user can drag and drop one or more complete inventories for certain source sectors or parts thereof into his or her inventory under compilation. In subsequent steps, the user can replace the default values in the estimate by other values at any level of detail. Doing so, the emission estimate will be updated and an indicator of the quality of the emission estimate will be presented to the user. In an iterative process, the user can improve the estimate until a satisfactory quality is reached. The system allows for exporting the resulting emission estimation into a standard <b>report</b> <b>template</b> The system now is freely available from the European Environment Agency via its web site. The knowledge libraries implemented have been developed within the framework of the greenhouse inventories for agriculture and the energy sector reference approach.

30|$|Following {{the growing}} {{evidence}} that structured reports {{would have a}} beneficial impact on the communication between radiologists and referring physicians, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) presented its Reporting Initiative aimed at developing and providing vendor-neutral reporting templates [19, 20]. This was later picked up by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) {{and led to the}} publication of the Management of Radiology Report Templates (MRRT) profile [21]. This profile extensively describes the concepts and technical details for interoperable, standardised, structured, report templates. Report templates are developed and provided using a subset of standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and allow for the integration of RadLex terms. This offers the possibility of further standardising <b>report</b> <b>template</b> content as synonyms and even content in different languages could be mapped to the same RadLex code [22].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Outcome after {{cardiac arrest}} and {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation {{is dependent on}} critical interventions, particularly early defibrillation, effective chest compressions, and advanced life support.

These technical aspects are complex and should be addressed in collaboration with organisations developing standard terminologies/ontologies. In particular, <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> should increasingly include quantitative measurements (imaging biomarkers), especially when formalised clinical decision models exist, which are based on these measurements.|$|R
