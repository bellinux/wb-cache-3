5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. He {{explained}} that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular. These <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months. A fourth fast bowler, Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen, was later added to the tour. The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time, drawing comment from Australian writers, including Bradman.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 presidential {{candidate}} Jesse Jackson and former United Nations ambassador Andrew Young made anti-Semitic comments, which were widely publicized. These <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> {{thought to have}} extended the era of African-American and Jewish distrust into the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, using {{parliamentary}} privilege, Democratic Unionist Party MP Iris Robinson {{claimed that}} Adams {{was involved in}} the IRA's 1978 La Mon restaurant bombing. Adams denied the allegation and said the <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> made to deflect attention away from developments in the Stevens Inquiry into collusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{magistrate}} court later {{affirmed that}} there was clear {{evidence to show that}} some officers {{who took part in the}} investigation conducted by the local police and Crime Branch wanted to refer this case as a case of suicide.

25|$|Padilla's {{longtime}} stylist is Ton Lao, {{a pioneer}} of menswear styling in the Philippines. He cited Johnny Depp as a style icon.

25|$|Early stories {{following}} the shootings charged that school {{administrators and teachers}} at Columbine had long condoned a climate of bullying by the so-called jocks or athletes, allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and resentment to fester. Critics said this could have contributed to triggering the perpetrators' extreme violence. Reportedly, homophobic <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> directed at Klebold and Harris.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradhawi is president, had used the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations. Al-Qaradawi's <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, Patrick {{posted on}} his Facebook page condemning the PAS-led Kedah state {{government}} for then setting up restrictions {{for the upcoming}} Chinese New Year Celebration.

25|$|In {{the extreme}} left-wing scene, anti-Semitic <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> {{to be found}} mainly {{in the context of}} pro-Palestinian and {{anti-globalisation}} rallies and in newspaper articles using anti-Semitic stereotypes in their criticism of Israel. Often this generated a combination of anti-Zionist and anti-American views that formed an important element in the emergence of an anti-Semitic mood in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani's {{campaign}} {{ended up}} $3.6 million in arrears, and in June 2008 Giuliani sought to retire the debt by proposing {{to appear at}} Republican fundraisers during the 2008 general election, and have part of the proceeds go towards his campaign. During the 2008 Republican National Convention, Giuliani gave a prime-time speech that praised McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, while criticizing Democratic nominee Barack Obama. He cited Palin's executive experience as a mayor and governor and belittled Obama's lack of same, and his <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> met with wild applause from the delegates. Giuliani continued {{to be one of}} McCain's most active surrogates during the remainder of McCain's eventually unsuccessful campaign.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2010, Sarah Palin {{announced}} on Fox News Channel that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring {{to make up}} stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof. It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed to hang up a phone after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail. During the conversation, they laughingly considered twittering about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there. The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> taken out of context, but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.|$|E

25|$|The passage {{suggests}} that the Court continued to draw a distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. However, since the decision {{was based on a}} breach of natural justice, the Court's <b>remarks</b> <b>were,</b> strictly speaking, obiter dicta. Also, the judge in Stansfield was speaking about the scope of judicial review where the statute in question contained an ouster clause; it is possible that different considerations apply in that situation. The rest of this article assumes that, at least where ouster clauses are not involved, Singapore law and UK law are the same – that is, the High Court may exercise judicial review whether a public authority has committed an error of law that would traditionally have been regarded as jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional.|$|E
25|$|A {{jury was}} {{selected}} on 14 November 2011, and the trial, {{presided over by}} Mr Justice Treacy, began {{the next day at}} the Central Criminal Court. With the prosecution led by Mark Ellison QC, the case centred on the new forensic evidence and whether it demonstrated the defendant's involvement in the murder, or was the result of later contamination due to police handling. On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder. The two were sentenced on 4 January 2012 to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years and 2 months for Dobson and 14 years and 3 months for Norris. Time spent on remand by Dobson was not deducted from his minimum term to ensure his existing sentence for drug-related offences was served. The judge's sentencing <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> later published in full online.|$|E
25|$|In late October 2017, it was {{reported}} in the media that the first secretary of the Iranian Embassy Hormoz Ghahremani, the visiting Iranian cleric Hojatoleslam Shafie, and community elder Sayed Taghi Derhami had made remarks denying the Holocaust and attacking Israel at the Shia Islamic Ahlulbayt Foundation in Pakuranga, Auckland during a meeting to commemorate Quds Day in June. A video of the speeches had been posted on the Foundation's YouTube channel. These <b>remarks</b> <b>were</b> criticized by the New Zealand Jewish Council and the pro-Israel think tank the Israel Institute of New Zealand, who advocated Ghahremani's expulsion. Ghahremani later clarified that his actions represented the Iranian government's official position on Israel. Race Relations Commissioner Devoy also condemned the trio's anti-Semitic statements. The opposition New Zealand National Party's foreign affairs spokesperson Gerry Brownlee also urged the incumbent Labour-New Zealand First-Green coalition government to expel Ghahremani. In response, Foreign Minister Winston Peters countered that the incident had occurred under the previous National government's watch. Peters indicated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade had summoned Ghahremani to express its disapproval.|$|E
