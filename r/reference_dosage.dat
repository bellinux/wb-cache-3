40|$|Docetaxel, a {{lipophilic}} drug, {{is indicated}} for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Most men with such disease {{would have had}} androgen-deprivation therapy, which decreases muscle and increases body fat. Obesity and body composition changes may influence the outcomes of docetaxel therapy. We conducted a retrospective review of 333 patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with docetaxel at a comprehensive cancer center between October 7, 2004 and December 31, 2012. Body composition parameters were measured based on the areas of muscle and adipose tissues in the visceral and subcutaneous compartments on CT images at L 3 - 4 levels. Dose calculations, toxicity and adverse reaction profiles, and overall survival were analyzed. Obese patients were younger at the diagnosis of prostate cancer and had a shorter duration from diagnosis to docetaxel therapy. Analysis of body composition found that a high visceral fat-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR) was associated with poor prognosis but a high visceral fat-to-muscle area ratio (VMR) and high body mass index were associated with increased duration from starting docetaxel to death, allowing such men {{to catch up with}} patients with normal body mass index in overall survival from cancer diagnosis to death. Cox proportional hazard regression showed that age ≥ 65 years, high VSR, abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase, and > 10 % reduction of initial dosage were significant predictors of shorter time between starting docetaxel and death, and that high VMR, obesity, and weekly regimens were significant predictors of longer survival after docetaxel.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the quality of pelvic and abdominal CT images performed for lymphoma according to the criteria proposed in the European Commission Guidelines on radiation imaging. (En castellano dice: la Guia de la Comisión Europea. Lo que pasa es que hay muchas guias publicadas por la Comisión: aseguranse que sea esta la citada) Material and methods: The criteria were evaluated in a sample of 100 patients attended at five public hospitals in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. All patients underwent single-slice helical CT studies. Fulfillment of the imaging criteria in the selected images was evaluated by five radiologists, one from each center, working independently. The Index of Image Quality (IIQ) was determined for the complete abdominal and pelvic examination. The dose was also measured to estimate the values of the CT Dose Index (CTDIw), Dose by Length Product (DLP), and effective dose (E). Results: A high rate of fulfillment of the criteria was found for individual abdominal images. In the pelvis, the rate of fulfillment was lower, especially for three criteria. The IIQ for each center was between 83 %- 92 %, with variable degrees of internal deviation. The mean values of CTDIw per center were between 16 - 23 mGy; DLP values were between 430 and 750 mGy cm, and the effective dose was 7 - 12 mSv. In general, no correlation was found between IIQ and dose per patient, either for the entire sample (r = 0. 04) or by centers (r£ 0. 36). Conclusions: The utility of the European Union's Quality Criteria was confirmed. We have elaborated a single list of criteria of image quality and suggest <b>reference</b> <b>dosage</b> levels for abdominal-pelvic CT examinations in patients with lymphoma...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} defoamer dosage {{procedure and}} a more efficient dosing point to the approach system were studied in this thesis. Their influence on paper machine wet end operations was investigated. The improved defoamer dosing procedure was examined at UMP-Kymmene Tervasaari PM 8. Air content and its controlling methods at the paper machine were studied in the literature survey. Also the influence of dissolved gases and entrained air in the papermaking furnish were introduced. Feeding methods – a TrumpJet chemical mixer and traditional feeding devices – were reviewed. The defoamer’s functioning methods were studied. The influence {{of the use of}} defoamers was estimated based on the main selected wet end operations. In the experimental part, defoamer mixing with a traditional feeding method and two improved mixing stages were compared based on the air content profiles in PM 8 ’s approach system. The <b>reference</b> <b>dosage</b> procedure was PM 8 ’s old dosing system. The first dosage procedure in the comparison involved two TrumpJet chemical mixers installed on the bottom wire trays. The second element of comparison involved the improvement brought by a third TrumpJet chemical mixer installed on the top wire tray. This second comparison of the efficient defoamer feeding concept was made at a higher production speed of PM 8. The air content control situation was also studied at the higher production speed. In addition the connection between the defoamer and air content was observed and a mill-scale system was studied. The economical benefits of the new dosing procedure were also reviewed. Air content profiles of short circulation were measured in the reference situation and the two comparison points of the study. These air content measurements proved the main gas load is introduced to PM 8 's paper furnish from the white water tray. Thick stock air content was not essential when the air volume flow was considered. The improved defoamer dosing procedure made lower dosage amounts possible. Compared with the traditional feeding system, the new defoamer feeding concept made only few direct improvements to the wet end operations and the produced paper itself. The lower defoamer need was noticed to have a positive influence on hydrophobic sizing and paper defects. The surfaces of the white water tanks and the operation of pumps were assessed based on the density variations of the suspension. The temperature in the white water silo was stated to have a significant influence on the air content measured in the first centrifugal cleaning stage.

40|$|Objectives. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of the presence of water on the dermal absorption of 2 -butoxyethanol (BE) in volunteers. Methods. Six male volunteers were dermally exposed to 50 %, 90 % or neat w/w BE for 4 h on the volar forearm over an area of 40 cm(2). An inhalation exposure with a known input rate and duration served as a <b>reference</b> <b>dosage.</b> The dermal absorption parameters were calculated from 24 -h excretion of total (free + conjugated) butoxyacetic acid (BAA) in urine and BE in blood, measured after both inhalation and dermal exposure. Results. The dermal absorption of BE from aqueous solutions was markedly higher than that of neat BE. The time-weighted average dermal fluxes were calculated from the urine and blood data and expressed in milligrammes per square centimetre per hour. The dermal fluxes obtained from cumulative 24 -h excretion of BAA amounted to 1. 34 +/- 0. 49, 0. 92 +/- 0. 60 and 0. 26 +/- 0. 17 mg cm(- 2) h(- 1) for 50 %, 90 % and neat BE, respectively. The dermal fluxes calculated from the BE blood data amounted to 0. 92 +/- 0. 34 and 0. 74 +/- 0. 25 mg cm(- 2) h(- 1) for 50 % and 90 % BE, respectively. The permeation rates into the blood reached a plateau between 60 and 120 min after the start of exposure, indicating achievement of steady-state permeation. The apparent permeability coefficient K-p, was 1. 75 +/- 0. 53 x 10 (- 3) and 0. 88 +/- 0. 42 x 10 (- 3) cm h(- 1) for 50 % and 90 % BE, respectively. Conclusion. The percutaneous absorption of BE from aqueous solution increased markedly when compared with neat BE. Even water content as low as 10 % led to an approximate fourfold increase in the permeation rates. These findings are important for the health risk assessment of occupational exposure to BE, since BE is commonly used in mixtures that contain water. Exposure to aqueous solutions of 50 % and 90 % of BE may result in substantial skin absorption: if a 60 -min skin contact of 1, 000 cm(2) is assumed, dermal uptake would be four-times higher than the pulmonary uptake of an 8 -h occupational exposure at a TLV of 100 mg m(- 3). This clearly justifies the skin notation for BE. For the purpose of biological monitoring, both BE in blood and BAA in urine were shown to be reliable indicators of exposur...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{putative}} {{promoter of}} the holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS) gene on chromosome 21 is hypermethylated in placental tissues {{and could be}} detected as a fetal-specific DNA marker in maternal plasma. Detection of fetal trisomy 21 (T 21) has been demonstrated by an epigenetic-genetic chromosome dosage approach where the amount of hypermethylated HLCS in maternal plasma is normalized using a fetal genetic marker on the Y chromosome as a chromosome <b>dosage</b> <b>reference</b> marker. We explore if this method can be applied on {{both male and female}} fetuses {{with the use of a}} paternally-inherited fetal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele on a reference chromosome for chromosome dosage normalization. Methodology: We quantified hypermethylated HLCS molecules using methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease digestion followed by real-time or digital PCR analyses. For chromosome dosage analysis, we compared the amount of digestion-resistant HLCS to that of a SNP allele (rs 6636, a C/G SNP) that the fetus has inherited from the father but absent in the pregnant mother. Principal Findings: Using a fetal-specific SNP allele on a reference chromosome, we analyzed 20 euploid and nine T 21 placental tissue samples. All samples with the fetal-specific C allele were correctly classified. One sample from each of the euploid and T 21 groups were misclassified when the fetal-specific G allele was used as the reference marker. We the...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Throughout {{the past}} decades, several {{methods have been}} {{developed}} to achieve therapeutic lithium blood levels as quick and safe as possible. The present study will systematically review the methods developed and studied for lithium dose estimation or level prediction at the initiation of therapy. METHODS: A systematic computerized Medline search was performed for papers published in English, French or Dutch between 1966 and April 2012 describing or studying methods for dosing lithium or predicting the lithium level on a certain <b>dosage.</b> <b>References</b> of relevant articles were screened for additional papers. RESULTS: Of 273 unique references retrieved, 65 met the inclusion criteria. Apart from the empirical titration method, 38 predictive methods for initiating lithium were identified. These methods can be classified into two categories: the a priori predictive methods, and the test-dose predictive methods requiring the administration of a test dose of lithium prior to starting treatment. LIMITATIONS: The methodological strength was not taken into account for a study {{to be included in the}} review. CONCLUSIONS: The most important distinction between the empirical titration method and the predictive methods appears to be the shorter time the latter need to achieve the targeted lithium level. The vast majority of predictive methods, however, show inconsistent or poor results or have not been replicated since their initial description. The empirical titration method, although not extensively studied, appears to be a time-honored method that can be recommended for use in daily clinical practice. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{estimated}} glomerular {{filtration rate}} (eGFR) {{has been associated}} with increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in the general population. VTE incidence significantly increases in cancer patients, especially those undergoing chemotherapy. Despite the evidence that a substantial number of cancer patients have unrecognized renal impairment, as indicated by reduced eGFR in the presence of serum creatinine levels within the <b>reference</b> value, chemotherapy <b>dosage</b> is routinely adjusted for serum creatinine values. Among chemotherapies, platinum-based regimens are associated with the highest rates of VTE. A cohort study was designed to assess the value of pretreatment eGFR in the risk prediction of a first VTE episode in cancer outpatients without previous history of VTE who were scheduled for platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods. Serum creatinine and eGFR were evaluated before the start of standard platinum-based chemotherapy in a cohort of 322 consecutive patients with primary or relapsing/recurrent solid cancers, representative of a general practice population. Results. Patients who experienced a first VTE episode in the course of chemotherapy had lower mean eGFR values compared with patients who remained VTE free. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that eGFR had an independent value for risk prediction of a first VTE episode during treatment, with a 3. 15 hazard ratio. Indeed, 14 % of patients with reduced eGFR had VTE over 1 -year follow-up compared with 6 % of patients with normal eGFR values. Conclusion. The results suggest that reductions in eGFR, even in the presence of normal serum creatinine, are associated with an increased VTE risk in cancer outpatients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Determining eGFR before chemotherapy could represent a simple predictor of VTE, at no additional cost to health care systems...|$|R
40|$|Cocaine is powerfully {{rewarding}} {{in humans}} and lower animals. The brain stimulation reward paradigm offers an interesting tool {{with which to}} study the reward-relevant actions of cocaine. Cocaine potentiates the rewarding impact of brain stimulation; the stimulation is thought to exert its reward-relevant effects on neural circuitry that subsumes the rewarding effects of cocaine and natural rewards such as food. In the present experiments the curve-shift rate-frequency variant of the brain stimulation reward paradigm was used to characterize the reward-potentiating actions of cocaine in rats lever-pressing for lateral hypothalamic brain stimulation. In Experiment 1 a dose-response curve of cocaine's potentiation of brain stimulation reward was determined {{and served as a}} <b>reference</b> for the <b>dosages</b> tested in subsequent experiments. In Experiment 2 repeated intermittent injections of cocaine failed to sensitize cocaine's ability to potentiate brain stimulation reward as would be predicted from the drug self-administration and conditioned place-preference literature. In Experiment 3, the widely held notion that tolerance to the rewarding effects of cocaine contributes significantly to the cocaine habit was tested in the brain stimulation reward paradigm. The reward-potentiating effects of cocaine failed, however, to undergo tolerance with repeated high-dose drug administration. In Experiment 4 a dose of cocaine or amphetamine that causes a 0. 3 -log unit shift of the rate-frequency curve to the left canceled the effects of a dose of the dopamine antagonist pimozide that causes a 0. 3 -log unit shift to the right. These findings further suggest that cocaine and amphetamine act as synergists of brain stimulation reward and provide additional evidence of the importance of dopaminergic function in mediating the reward-relevant actions of cocaine and amphetamine. Fischer 344 and Lewis rat strains have been hypothesized to be differentially sensitive to the reward-relevant effects of cocaine. In Experiment 5, however, cocaine produced an equipotent potentiation of brain stimulation reward in the two rat strains. These results suggest that factors other than the reward-relevant effects of cocaine may account for previously reported differences between these two rat strains...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of {{personal}} digital assistants (PDAs) and electronic resources has rapidly increased throughout the years. Physician Assistants (PAs) are using PDAs for multiple purposes, such as medical <b>references,</b> drug <b>dosage,</b> and personal use. In the past, {{some of the}} resources available for the PDA were only available as texts. This {{is an area of}} interest to see what is being used, but poses a major challenge since there are so many resources available and no major studies have looked into this. Hypothesis: More seasoned providers rely less on electronic resources and use technology less due to experience and tradition. Study Design: Pilot Study. Methods: Participants: The survey was opened for 1 month period in 2007. The population included Physician assistant students and practicing, both men and women, who were 18 years of age and older. It was anticipated that the study would include approximately 60 participants. Exclusionary Criteria: Individuals were only excluded from the study if they were under the age of 18; or if they were unable to read English at a level which gave them an understanding of the consent process. Recruitment: Individuals will be recruited via email through the Pacific University School of Physician Assistant Studies e-mail list, a snowball sampling of Physician Assistants from associates of this group, and members of the Portland Vancouver Physician Assistant Society. Materials: The materials needed for this study was an e-mail recruiting Students and Alum of Pacific University School of Physician Assistant Studies and the Portland Vancouver Physician Assistant Group with directions to connect to an internet based survey on SurveyMonkey. The survey was designed by the principal investigator and was not modeled after any prior published survey of this type. The survey included 17 questions of which only 1 was for exclusionary criteria, 9 were for demographics, 6 were directly related to technology and decision making, and 1 was an open ended survey question for comments. Data Management: The data was managed with Microsoft Excel, and was statistically analyzed with Statistix 8. 0 software. The data was analyzed to evaluate the descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median. Two-Sample T-tests were performed to compare the data submitted by the participants as a whole. Two-Sample T -tests were also performed to compare the groups individually and a break down between student participants and practicing participants. Therefore, Chi Square analysis was performed to make comparisons of: Status vs. Influencing diagnosis; Status vs. Influencing diagnosis; Amount of time used vs. Status. The data for this investigation was collected as nominal and was translated to ordinal numbers for statistical analysis. Results: Demographics: The invitation to participate in the survey was sent out to Pacific University Physician Assistant students, alumni, and members of the Portland Vancouver Physician Assistant Society. The documented number of individuals who completed the survey online was 94. Three of the individuals neglected three or more questions within the survey, and were therefore not included in the data analysis. Of the rest of the respondents 91 completed all of the questions and were included in the assessment. Therefore, the number of respondents that were analyzed was 91. Amount of time per day: The student males (80 %) time is use is 15 - 45 per day, the practicing males (58 %) use 0 - 30 minutes per day, female students (63 %) use 15 - 45 minutes per day, and the practicing females (92 %) use 60 minutes per day. The practicing females seem to use the handhelds and computers the most for about 60 - 75 minutes per day. Affect on day With 75 % of all groups answering that the affect on their day would be very little or able to survive. The female practitioners had 8 participants who answered that their day would be affected by a great deal. Age vs. Status: The mean for the students was 30. 96 and the mean for practicing PAs was 32. 83. With a p value of 0. 01380 which is statistically significant, but of no clinical importance. Status vs. Affect: The students had an answer with a mean of 2. 67 and the practicing PAs had a mean answer of 3. 11 with a p value of 0. 0007. This means that the difference is significant between the two groups and that a practicing PAs day is more of a struggle when the internet or computer is down when compared to the students. Status vs. Influence: With a p value of 0. 0067 for the two groups. This means that the students had a higher influence, with the clinicians just using it to back them selves up. With the majority of all students responding that sometimes it can be very helpful. Conclusion: The goal {{of this study was to}} see if technology plays a role in influencing their patient decision making by what means out they doing it. The information that was provided by the respondents does show that students and practitioners alike are using many different resources and feeling that the resources are helpful in influencing clinical decision making. There are multiple different online references that have been listed, but the common theme is that most of the participants use UpToDate and Epocrates. Students do seem to use the online resources more than do the practitioners overall. Not only are the students using online resources more, it is also influencing there decisions more in a clinical setting. As for the practitioners there day is more of a struggle when the internet is down or they are unable to use there computer, this was likely due to practitioners relying to the use of treatment protocols and the EMR. In looking over the information from the survey it is not possible to completely answer the hypothesis. It would have been nice to see the data lead us to believe that more seasoned providers relied less on technology, but the average time in practice was only 1. 89 years for all of the respondents. There is not a lot of separation between the students and the practitioners. Thus making it difficult to see how seasoned practitioners use technology...|$|R
