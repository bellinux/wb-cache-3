50|$|The site - part of {{a larger}} parcel of land alienated in 1845 - had been {{subdivided}} by 1880 as a <b>residential</b> <b>allotment</b> of 44 perches, and a cottage, fronting Barker Street and Oxley Lane, appears to have been extant by 1883. There {{does not appear to have}} been any development of the northern end of this block prior to approval being granted by the Brisbane City Council in September 1921, for Mousley & Halliday of New Farm to erect a picture show with concrete and iron walls at the corner of Barker and Brunswick Streets. Known as the Merthyr Picture Palace, the theatre was functioning by 1923 at least, and probably opened in late 1921.|$|E
30|$|The above {{results have}} been {{discussed}} based on an idealized situation. For an awful circumstances, where the estimated stormwater volume may be double due to longer declining limb of hydrograph, four leaky-wells each with diameter D =  2.5  m and depth H =  2.0  m in 500  m 2 <b>residential</b> <b>allotment</b> {{may be necessary to}} control the stormwater quantity. Installations of hydraulic structures considering this situation will be expensive and hence, idealized circumstances can be adopted for installations of leaky-wells in Dhaka City.|$|E

50|$|The suburb {{is named}} after Thomas Aitken, the {{original}} grantee of Portion 38, Parish of Coonambelah. He began subdividing the property during the 1880s, putting 440 quarter-acre <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> {{on the market in}} 1885. A dairy farm was established in the region by Thomas Aitken in about 1867.|$|R
25|$|The Authority {{developed}} 60 {{hectares of}} the estate for housing and related commercial and community activities. <b>Residential</b> <b>allotments</b> were progressively released for sale from May 1991.

50|$|In November 1919 {{title to}} {{the whole of the}} {{property}} was transferred to Charles Louis Albert Brown, who carried out the first subdivision of the 105 acre property in 1920, creating a number of beachfront <b>residential</b> <b>allotments.</b> In the mid-1920s the track leading to the Eimeo Hotel at the northern end of the property was surveyed as a public lane, which became known as Mango Avenue.|$|R
50|$|Lionel ('Daddy') Wiss was {{a highly}} {{respected}} local identity, who took {{a prominent role in}} the community and the local Methodist church. In 1910, he acquired 56 acres in the centre of Engelsburg. About half of this he subdivided in 1916 into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments,</b> thereby creating most of the western half of the town of Engelsburg (renamed Kalbar in 1916 when the railway reached the town).|$|R
50|$|The land {{on which}} the {{building}} is located was originally part of a suburban block of just over 16 acres, located {{at the intersection of}} the roads to the Logan and to Ipswich (later known as the Woolloongabba Fiveways). This parcel (suburban portion 165, parish of South Brisbane) was alienated by James Gibbon in 1857, and was subdivided into commercial and <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> by the late 1870s.|$|R
50|$|The Solis {{residential}} and tourism development was approved in May 2004. The estimated A$150 million development at Louisville Point (to {{the north of}} Orford) will include 550 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments,</b> 60 'eco-tourism' cabins, a central precinct with retail shops, a day spa, restaurants and bars, and an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.

50|$|In 1912, {{title to}} the Corbett farm, {{including}} the residence, was transferred to David Rhoades, who subdivided the land into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> as the Derby Estate. By 1931, the estate was thickly settled. In 1925 title to Killarney and its remaining 62 perches (1578m2) passed to the Tate family, then in 1934 to Emily Firrell. Killarney passed to Mrs Firrell's daughter, Beryl Agnes Farry, in 1948, and it remains her property.|$|R
50|$|The area {{now known}} as Indooroopilly was {{surveyed}} in 1858 and first settled in 1860. The area was subdivided into farms and later into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments.</b> Prior to 1870 there were few houses built in the area but settlement of the district received impetus from {{the opening of the}} Brisbane to Ipswich railway in 1875. During the 1880s and 1890s Indooroopilly developed as a fashionable suburb. Many substantial, architect-designed residences were built on large allotments.|$|R
50|$|Two small <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> and a concreted laneway on Teemangum Street (the latter {{providing}} service {{access to}} the Kiosk building) are also included within the heritage boundary. A single-storeyed fibrous-cement clad house, where Alex Griffiths chiefly resided between 1971 and 1998, with an attached shop, sits {{on one of these}} allotments, but is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance {{for the purposes of this}} entry in the Queensland heritage register.|$|R
50|$|Comparatively {{few changes}} were {{required}} for occupation by the 10 WRAAC from 1953 to 1969, and {{during this period}} the Red Cross continued to maintain its library headquarters in the sub-floor of the dormitory block. About 1964 or 1965, the Red Cross subdivided the land into smaller <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> around an extension of Sutton Street, leaving the buildings leased by the armed forces on a much smaller parcel of land. At this period the house lost its river access.|$|R

50|$|Increasing {{demand for}} Gold Field Homestead Leases at Georgetown {{resulted}} in a Mines Department survey of Sections 21 to 26 {{of the town of}} Georgetown, late 1888 early 1889, as <b>residential</b> <b>allotments.</b> The site of the Antbed House (allotments 1 and 2 of Section 22, parish of Georgetown, county of Gilbert) was included in this survey, and there is no indication on the plan, dated 1 February 1889, that there was any structure on the site at the time of survey.|$|R
50|$|The site {{on which}} Mountview House is located {{was part of}} a larger parcel of land (suburban {{portions}} 177 and 178, parish of North Brisbane - totalling just over 2 acres) with a frontage to Leichhardt Street, purchased from the Crown by Brisbane draper Richard Ash Kingsford in November 1856 at a sale of Villa Allotments at Hanley's Valley, Brisbane. In the early 1860s this property was surveyed into 18 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> and a 40 feet wide road, later known as Downing Street.|$|R

50|$|The firm prospered, a new {{store was}} erected in 1909, and Wiss Bros {{became one of}} the most {{important}} businesses in the district. Lionel ('Daddy') Wiss was a highly respected local identity, who took a prominent role in the community and the local Methodist church. In 1910, he acquired 56 acres in the centre of Engelsburg.

50|$|The {{site was}} earlier {{part of a}} much larger parcel of land {{purchased}} from the Crown in 1855 by Joseph Darragh of Brisbane. Darragh held the land, unsubdivided, for nearly 30 years, and it was the eventual subdivision of this property into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> (mostly 16 perches) in the mid-1880s, which established East Brisbane as a dormitory suburb. Prior to this, East Brisbane was semi-rural in character, with a few isolated families scattered through the bush, and a number of elite estates (such as Mowbray's and Heath's) along the riverbank.|$|R
50|$|The 1886 {{cemetery}} reserve {{proved too}} difficult to access, and was cancelled in 1890 when a new cemetery of 40 acres was reserved from the former police paddock near Stratford. Although increased to over 45 acres in 1891, and located adjacent to the Cairns-Herberton railway, it was never used as a cemetery. In 1928 part of the reserve was resumed and subdivided into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> for workers' housing, and the remaining reserve was cancelled in 1940. In the meantime, the cemetery reserve in Martyn Street had been proclaimed and opened for use in late 1916.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently the {{hospital}} buildings were demolished, {{leaving only the}} house Rhyndarra, stable and significant trees, prior to the property being subdivided into approximately 30 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments.</b> Rhyndarra was extensively refurbished, albeit on a greatly reduced block, {{and is now a}} family residence. The former stables is located on a separate allotment and became part of a new house, with the hay bale hoist beam on the upper floor still readily identifiable. Part of the riverfront of the original property is now a reserve for park purposes, under the trusteeship of the Brisbane City Council.|$|R
50|$|In August 1877 Hedge {{subdivided}} the 4 acres {{acquired in}} 1870, into 20 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> and a dead-end street off Brook Street, variously known as Best or Bess Street {{in the early}} years. Later, Bess Street was extended east to meet McKenzie Street. The blocks {{at each end of}} Bess Street averaged close to 1 rood each in size; those in-between were surveyed as 27 perches each {{on the north side of}} the road and 23.4 perches each on the south side. The survey plan does not indicate any extant dwellings, but shows a perimeter fence around the 4-acre property.|$|R
5000|$|On survey {{plans of}} the 1860s, the Kelvin Grove area was marked as the [...] "Three Mile Scrub". In February 1865 forty {{portions}} of one to two acres were surveyed between Kelvin Grove and Waterworks Roads, stretching from the Normanby Fiveways to Enoggera Creek. By the end of August that year some of these portions along Kelvin Grove Road had been subdivided into <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> {{ranging in size from}} twenty to thirty perches, up to a half acre or so. Local subdivision into small housing lots continued for decades, resulting in an early 20th century townscape denuded of vegetation.|$|R
25|$|Between 1920 and 1961, the {{peninsula}} was subdivided into 776 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments.</b> Further buildings and infrastructure were erected within the penguin colony {{and the area}} {{became known as the}} Summerland Estate. As human activity grew so did introduced threats such as invasive weeds, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and traffic which was negatively impacting biodiversity. Slowly the importance of protecting the area's natural values for the benefit of both wildlife and tourism were recognised and a large penguin reserve was established by the government. Scientific research into little penguin breeding and survival on {{the peninsula}} only began in 1968 with the formation of the volunteer Penguin Study Group (PSG).|$|R
50|$|Boston Island is a 960 ha {{privately owned}} island in Boston Bay, Spencer Gulf, South Australia. It has been {{primarily}} used for grazing sheep {{and was also}} once {{the location of a}} proposed township called Kerrillyilla {{at the southern end of}} the island. In 2009, the island was rezoned to allow for future residential and tourism development. As of 2009, it is owned by the mayor of Port Lincoln, Peter Davis. Davis' development plans include up to 1,000 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments,</b> three tourism developments and an inland marina. Prior to rezoning, there had been little interest expressed in the development plan, despite the mayor's enthusiasm.|$|R
50|$|The site slopes steeply to {{the west}} and north from low-lying areas along the eastern and {{southern}} boundaries where Flat Rock Creek winds its way toward the ocean. Bounded by Currumbin Hill Conservation Park to the north-east, it is otherwise enclosed by <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> along the north-western ridge topped by Lansell Avenue and along the western and southern curve of Crest Avenue. It meets Thrower Drive in the north and borders Crest Drive where it forms a south-west-facing corner. The residences on the north-western side of Farrell Drive also border the sanctuary and the long thin lake or lagoon formed by Flat Rock Creek.|$|R
50|$|The Wilsons left Wilston House and Stevenson {{subdivided}} {{the estate}} -85. In May 1885 Brisbane auctioneer John Cameron (later {{a director of}} the Queensland National Bank) auctioned the first section of the Wilston Estate, comprising over 300 <b>residential</b> <b>allotments</b> and Wilston House on about 8 acres of land. The residence was described at this time as comprising drawing and dining rooms elegantly finished, entrance hall, library, breakfast room, five bedrooms (all lofty, spacious, and well ventilated) - verandahs, kitchen, servants' quarters, scullery and storeroom. The grounds contained stables, carriage-house, buggy-shed, harness-room, man's room and hay-house - (possibly housed in one or two structures) - underground tanks holding a domestic water supply, and a flower garden.|$|R
