5|$|Biden had <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> once before, but his 1988 presidential {{campaign}} had lasted for only {{three and a}} half months. He had been forced to withdraw due to controversies arising over reusing other politicians' speeches without credit, and falsely recollecting parts of his academic record.|$|E

5|$|As he {{prepared}} to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to maintain {{good relations with the}} Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him.

In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, and {{went out of his way}} to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 he won {{re-election}} to {{his seat}} in the Oregon House. He also received national attention for his early support for coaxing Dwight D. Eisenhower to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> of the United States as a Republican. This earned him a spot as a delegate at the Republican National Convention that year.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996 a {{group of}} Moscow academics, journalists and intellectuals {{suggested}} that Vladimir Bukovsky should <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. However, no formal nomination process was initiated.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley {{decided to}} <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president,</b> {{but to have}} a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed {{by the need to}} reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was {{supportive}} of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge and Cox were renominated {{for their}} {{respective}} offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters (especially Stearns) had publicized his {{actions in the}} Police Strike around {{the state and the}} nation and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> in 1920.|$|E

He <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> again in 1998, receiving 12% of the vote and coming in third place, and again <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> in 2002, receiving 14% of the vote and fourth place.|$|R
5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> again led to expectations that the Social Democrats (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was ready to run for the office. The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Combs {{appointed}} Clements {{as state}} highway commissioner. Some state newspapers charged that Clements had demanded this {{post at the}} head of the state's largest executive department in exchange for supporting Combs, a charge Combs denied. Others wondered if Clements took the post in order to organize the state political machinery for his friend Lyndon Johnson, who was rumored to be considering a <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president.</b> Still others believed that, from his powerful post, Clements would be the real governor and Combs only a puppet.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, {{an effort}} arose to {{convince}} Jim Gilmore to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> of the United States in 2008. The volunteers cited Gilmore's past experiences as qualifications {{for the job}} including his service as a counter-intelligence officer for the U.S. army, his post of attorney general of Virginia, his services {{as chairman of the}} Gilmore Commission and the National Council on Readiness and Preparedness, as well as his role as president of the non-profit homeland security think-tank USA Secure.|$|E

5|$|Menem met Admiral Eduardo Massera, who {{intended}} to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president,</b> and had public meetings with personalities such as Carlos Monzón, Susana Giménez, and Alberto Olmedo. As a result, {{he was forced}} to reside in another city, Tandil. He had to report daily to Chief of Police Hugo Zamora. This forced residence was lifted in February 1980. He returned to Buenos Aires, and then to La Rioja. He resumed his political activities, despite the prohibition, and was detained again. His new forced residence was in Las Lomitas, in Formosa Province. He {{was one of the last}} politicians to be released from prison by the National Reorganization Process.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|William Emmons, the Boston printer, {{published}} {{a biography of}} Johnson in New York dated July 1833. Richard Emmons, from Great Crossing, Kentucky, followed this up with a play entitled Tecumseh, of the Battle of the Thames and a poem in honor of Johnson. Many of Johnson's friends and supporters – Davy Crockett and John Bell among them – encouraged him to <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president.</b> Jackson, however, supported Vice-President Van Buren for the office. Johnson accepted this choice, and worked to gain the nomination for vice-president.|$|E
