40|$|The {{introduction}} of a fractional differential operator {{defined in terms of}} the Riemann-Liouville derivative makes it possible to generalize the kinetic equations used to model relaxation in dielectrics. In this context such fractional equations are called fractional kinetic relaxation equations and their solutions, called fractional kinetic <b>relaxation</b> <b>functions,</b> are given in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. These fractional kinetic <b>relaxation</b> <b>functions</b> generalize the kinetic <b>relaxation</b> <b>functions</b> associated with the Debye, Cole-Cole, Cole-Davidson and Havriliak-Negami models, as the latter functions become particular cases of the fractional solutions, obtained for specific values of the parameter specifying the order of the derivative.

As theoretical tools we use the theorem by Bernstein on the complete monotonicity of functions together with Titchmarsh's inversion formula.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method which enables a QCD-based {{calculation}} of a relaxation {{time for a}} dissipative current in the causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation derived by Israel and Stewart. We {{point out that the}} Israel-Stewart equation is not unique as a causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation, and the form of the causal and dissipative hydrodynamic equation is determined by the shape of a spectral function reflecting the properties of elementary excitations in the system we consider. Our method utilizes a <b>relaxation</b> <b>function,</b> which can be calculated from QCD using the linear response theory. We show that the <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> can be derived from a spectral function for a microscopic representation of the dissipative current. We also show that the Israel-Stewart equation is acceptable only as long as the calculated <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> is approximated well by a exponentially damping function, and the relaxation time can be obtained as its damping time constant. Taking a baryon-number dissipative current of a plasma consisting of charm quarks and gluons as a simple example, we present the first calculation of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> with use of the spectral function derived employing the quenched lattice QCD together with the maximum entropy method. The calculated <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> shows a strongly-oscillation damping behaviour due to the charmed vector hadron J/Ψ surviving above the deconfinement phase transition temperature in QCD. This result suggests that the applicability of the Israel-Stewart equation to the baryon-number dissipative current of the charm quark-gluon plasma is quite doubtful.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{models can}} be used to better {{understand}} arterial wall mechanics in physiological and pathological conditions. The arterial wall reveals very slow time-dependent decays in uniaxial stress-relaxation experiments, coherent with weak power-law functions. Quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) theory was successfully applied to modeling such responses, but an accurate estimation of the reduced <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> parameters can be very difficult. In this work, an alternative <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> based on fractional calculus theory is proposed to describe stress relaxation experiments in strips cut from healthy human aortas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mechanical and {{dielectric}} spectroscopy {{studies of}} local segmental motion (R-relaxation) in polybutadienes are reviewed and new results presented. Previous mechanical spectra for 1, 4 -polybutadiene relied on time-temperature superpositioning, leading to discrepancies regarding {{the breadth of}} the <b>relaxation</b> <b>function.</b> By measuring over a wide range of actual frequencies, we show that the mechanical dispersion is narrow, relative to 1, 2 -polybutadiene. The disagreement among published dielectric R-relaxation results is shown to be a consequence of the intrusion of the secondary relaxation for temperatures near the glass transition. The actual breadth of the <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> can be gleaned from analysis of the temperature dependence of the R-relaxation time and is consistent with the determination from mechanical spectroscopy (i. e., a narrow dispersion). Thus, decreasing vinyl content is associated with a narrower segmental <b>relaxation</b> <b>function,</b> whereby the correlation of chemical structure with both {{the breadth of the}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>function</b> and its temperature dependence holds for polybutadiene.

An increasing quantitative understanding of the critical dynamics of isotropic ferromagnets such as EuO, EuS and Fe above T~has been achieved recently by taking into account the long range dipolar interaction, which is present in all real ferromagnets.
