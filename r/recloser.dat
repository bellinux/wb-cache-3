50|$|<b>Recloser</b> controller: <b>Recloser</b> {{controllers}} remotely {{control the}} operation of automated reclosers and switches. These devices monitor and store power-system conditions and determine when to perform control actions. They also accept commands from a remote operator or process.|$|E
50|$|Reclosers may {{cooperate}} with down-stream protective devices called sectionalizers, usually a disconnector or cutouts {{equipped with a}} tripping mechanism triggered by a counter or a timer. A sectionalizer is generally not rated to interrupt fault current and is therefore cheaper than a <b>recloser.</b> Each sectionalizer detects and counts fault current interruptions by the <b>recloser</b> (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the sectionalizer will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the <b>recloser</b> to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E
40|$|In {{transmission}} system, the <b>reclosing</b> {{method is}} quite effective {{to restore the}} system after removing line faults by tripping circuit breakers. This is because the most of faults on overhead transmission system are transient in nature. Especially, high-speed <b>reclosing</b> scheme has a benefit increasing the continuity of supply due to fast restoration of system. It is possible to increase the transient stability due to high-speed <b>reclosing,</b> whereas it damages generator shafts due to fast closing. As one of alternatives, time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> can be proposed for transmission system. Time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> is a method having longer dead time than that of high-speed <b>reclosing.</b> However, if the system separation happens with high angle during long time, time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> may result in aggravation of stability. Thus, transient stability assessment must be considered for application of time-delayed <b>reclosing.</b> This paper models a 154 kV and 345 kV transmission systems using ElectroMagnetic Transient Program-Restructured Version (EMTP-RV) and performs transient stability assessment using Integral Square Error (ISE) developed by Dynamic Link Library (DLL) to assess the adequacy of time-delayed <b>reclosing</b> for modelled transmission system...|$|R

The {{synchronism}} {{problem is not}} considered in conventional <b>reclosing</b> in a distribution system. However, a <b>reclosing</b> in distribution system that serves the power from BESS to a healthy phase is similar with <b>reclosing</b> of a transmission system, and so the synchronism problem must be considered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper proposes the {{high-speed}} <b>reclosing</b> operating method to improve for the {{stability in the}} power system. The proposed method calculates the <b>reclosing</b> time, taking the case of standard in which the <b>reclosing</b> is not done using the energy function of generator phase angle. And, the execution of <b>reclosing</b> time is calculated, considering the acceleration / deceleration energy of the generator in during fault. It can be expected that the delta of generator is suppressed by this optimum <b>reclosing</b> operation. Therefore, the system stability {{can be expected to}} improvement by carrying out {{the high-speed}} <b>reclosing,</b> when the fault arose. At present, it has been set at the value which seems to be optimum considering various problems in the <b>reclosing</b> time. However, in those methods, the system stability improvement effect can not be expected. It was demonstrated that the high-speed <b>reclosing</b> method have depression effect of the delta in the computer simulation...|$|R

50|$|As {{the utility}} can be {{reasonably}} assured {{that they will}} always have a method for discovering a fault, whether that be automated or simply looking at the <b>recloser,</b> {{it is possible for}} the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line. This can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped DG systems by deliberately opening a series of <b>recloser</b> in the grid to force the DG system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the NDZ. This method can be guaranteed to work, but requires the grid to be equipped with automated <b>recloser</b> systems, and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the reclosers.|$|E
50|$|In {{electric}} power distribution, a <b>recloser,</b> or autorecloser, is {{a circuit breaker}} equipped with a mechanism that can automatically close the breaker {{after it has been}} opened due to a fault. Reclosers are used on overhead distribution systems to detect and interrupt momentary faults. Since many short-circuits on overhead lines clear themselves, a <b>recloser</b> improves service continuity by automatically restoring power to the line after a momentary fault.|$|E
40|$|In a power system, the {{auto-reclosing}} schemes {{are applied}} {{in order to}} enhance the transient stability. However, conventional auto-reclosing techniques adopt fixed time interval <b>reclosing,</b> that is, the circuit breakers <b>reclose</b> after a prescribed dead time. Since the transient stability is dependent on the generator state of <b>reclosing</b> instance, this method may cause an unstable state when unsuccessful <b>reclosing</b> occurs. Therefore, the method to determine the optimal <b>reclosing</b> time is needed {{in order to enhance}} the transient stability of power system effectively. This paper proposes the method to determine an optimal <b>reclosing</b> time by using the kinetic energy of synchronous generators. The significance of this method is that it uses the kinetic energy of each generator which can be obtained easily. Consequently, this technique may be implemented for the on-line application. The proposed method is verified by simulation study using EMTP/ATP...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>reclosing</b> scheme using {{synchronism}} checking for utilization of battery {{energy storage system}} (BESS) in a distribution system. The algorithm disconnects the faulty phase and keeps the power supply from the BESS to the healthy phase. Synchronism checking between the main source side and the load side is applied to minimize the transients at the <b>reclosing</b> instant. The BESS at the faulty phase is reconnected after checking the successful <b>reclosing.</b> The distribution system including BESS and proposed <b>reclosing</b> scheme are modeled by the electromagnetic transients program (EMTP)/ATPDraw. The various simulations by varing the fault clearing time are conducted and the simulation results are discussed. Also, the relation between proposed <b>reclosing</b> scheme and reliability is discussed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{control system}} for a <b>recloser</b> allows a {{selected}} number of attempts to restore service after adjustable time delays. For example a <b>recloser</b> may have 2 or 3 [...] "fast" [...] reclose operations with a few seconds delay, then a longer delay and one reclose; if the last attempt is not successful, the <b>recloser</b> will lock out and require human intervention to reset. If the fault is a permanent fault (downed wires, tree limbs lying on the wires, etc.) the autorecloser will exhaust its pre-programmed attempts to re-energize the line and remain tripped off until manually commanded to try again. About 80-90% of faults on overhead power lines are transient and can be cured by autoreclosing. The result is increased availability of supply.|$|E
50|$|On a 3 phase circuit a <b>recloser</b> is more {{beneficial}} than three separate fuse cutouts. For example on a wye to delta conversion if cutouts are {{used on the}} wye side, and only 1 out of 3 of the cutout fuses open, some customers on the delta side would have a low voltage condition, due to voltage transfer through the transformer windings. Low voltage can cause severe damage to electronic equipment. But if a <b>recloser</b> were used, all three phases will open, eliminating the problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuse holder}} on a cutout {{can also be}} {{replaced}} with a mechanism designed {{to function as a}} sectionalizer, to be used on a distribution line downstream from autoreclosing circuit breakers. Autoreclosers sense and briefly interrupt fault currents, and then automatically reclose to restore service. Meanwhile, downstream sectionalizers automatically count current interruptions by the <b>recloser.</b> When a sectionalizer detects a preset number of interruptions of fault current (typically 3 or 4) the sectionalizer opens (while unenergized) and remains open, and the <b>recloser</b> restores supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} the coordination of optimal <b>reclosing</b> and fuzzy logic-controlled braking resistor on the transient stability of a multimachine power system in case of an unsuccessful <b>reclosing</b> of circuit breakers. The transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal <b>reclosing</b> and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is compared to that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations in case of a nine-bus power system model as well as a ten-machine system. Simulation results of both balanced and unbalanced faults at different points in the power systems show that the coordinated operation of optimal <b>reclosing</b> and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is able to stabilize the systems well in case of an unsuccessful <b>reclosing.</b> Moreover, the transient stability performance of the coordinated operation of optimal <b>reclosing</b> and fuzzy controlled braking resistor is better than that of the coordinated operation of conventional auto-reclosing and fuzzy controlled braking resistor...|$|R
30|$|To {{verify the}} {{proposed}} <b>reclosing</b> technique, this paper models the distribution system, BESS, and proposed algorithm using EMTP/ATPDraw and performs the various simulations {{according to the}} fault clearing time. From the simulation results, regardless of the fault clearing time, we can conclude that the <b>reclosing</b> can successfully be performed by the proposed <b>reclosing</b> technique and the BESS in a healthy phase can be operated as UPS.|$|R

50|$|Reclosers {{address this}} problem by further {{dividing}} up the network into smaller sections. For instance, the city grid example above might be equipped with reclosers at every branch point on the network. Reclosers, because of {{their position in the}} network, handle much less power than the breakers at the feeder stations, and therefore can be set to trip at much lower power levels. This means that a single event on the grid will cut off only the section handled by the single <b>recloser,</b> long before the feeder station would notice a problem. A normal breaker could also be used for this role, but because they are distributed geographically throughout the grid, as opposed to being centralized at feeder stations, resetting a breaker might take considerable time. For this reason, reclosers are used to automatically re-connect after a brief interval. There is a strong likelihood that the fault will be gone when the power is restored. If the fault is still present, the <b>recloser</b> opens again.|$|E
50|$|Substations {{generally}} have switching, {{protection and control}} equipment, and transformers. In a large substation, circuit breakers are used to interrupt any short circuits or overload currents that may occur on the network. Smaller distribution stations may use <b>recloser</b> circuit breakers or fuses for protection of distribution circuits. Substations themselves do not usually have generators, although a power plant may have a substation nearby. Other devices such as capacitors and voltage regulators may also be located at a substation.|$|E

The proposed <b>reclosing</b> technique classifies the fault and healthy phases based on the fault current from utility, and so the BESS can keep the power service in the healthy phase. To minimize the effect in a healthy phase at the <b>reclosing</b> instant, this paper adopts synchronism checking between the main source side and load side.|$|R
