In sub-Saharan African countries and Madagascar, rice crops host many insect species, {{which have been}} inventoried and studied for almost 40 years. Management of these <b>rice</b> <b>pests</b> using synthetic chemical pesticides is not common practice. In Asia, genetically modified rice varieties (Bt rice) resistant to some insects were engineered in the 1990 s. In 2009, two Bt rice varieties were authorized to be marketed in China. Bt rice is not grown in African countries. We therefore decided to analyze the published literature on Bt rice and to compare the findings with the current insect pest situation in African rice fields. The activity spectrum and the efficacy of Bt toxins represent the first limitation encountered {{in the use of}} currently available Bt rice varieties. For instance, the effect of Bt toxins against Diptera (Diopsidae) species is unknown, since these species only occur in Africa. On the African continent and in Madagascar, it would be essential to enhance or promote taxonomic, biological and ecological knowledge concerning <b>rice</b> <b>pests</b> and to more accurately measure the impact of various insect species on crop yields. The broad range of <b>rice</b> insect <b>pests,</b> including insect vectors of disease, the risk of target insects developing resistance to Bt toxins and the lack of economic assessments suggest that, with the current state of knowledge in Africa, it would be inappropriate to introduce currently available Bt rice varieties there...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One {{of the new}} {{strategies}} to control <b>rice</b> <b>pests</b> {{that are at the}} same time more environmentally friendly is integrated pest management (IPM). IPM employs such methods as biological and mechanical controls, and botanical pesticides. National and international resources have been used to developed IPM programs in some countries. Indonesia and Taiwan have used such programs to control <b>rice</b> <b>pests.</b> Biological control, botanical pesticides and some mechanical control have been conducted in IPM program in both countries. However, assessing and comparing the effects of IPM programs are difficult because of the heterogeneity of the data due to differences in regions (e. g., climate, rainfall, soil structure), time periods, pest classes (e. g., insects, plant pathogens, weeds), and types of crops researched. In Indonesia using the recommended pesticides still be the last option for controlling the pests that reach an economic threshold. In 2011, recommended pesticides are applied about 981, 628 ha of all rice crops. Other controls are the second pests control choosen in Indonesia. Other controls are consists of biological control (using parasitoids and predators), microbial control (fungi, virus and bacteria) and natural plant extraction. Other controls reach about 464, 854 ha of total rice crops in Indonesia. Mechanical controls are less applied than recommended pesticides and other controls. Mechanical controls are including all controls before rice planting, such as harrowing land, killing rats, applying organic fertilizer, planting good varieties and cropping pattern. Mechanical controls reach about 84, 920 ha of total rice crops in Indonesia. Taiwan also have similar development of rice IPM like Indonesia. I...|$|R
