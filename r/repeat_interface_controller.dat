50|$|A {{wireless}} network <b>interface</b> <b>controller</b> (WNIC) is a network <b>interface</b> <b>controller</b> which connects to a wireless radio-based computer network, {{rather than a}} wired network, such as Token Ring or Ethernet. A WNIC, just like other NICs, works on the Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI Model. This card uses an antenna to communicate via microwave radiation. A WNIC in a desktop computer is traditionally connected using the PCI bus. Other connectivity options are USB and PC card. Integrated WNICs are also available, (typically in Mini PCI/PCI Express Mini Card form).|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 75) The {{concept of}} a Music Playback Sequencer is an audiophile's dream come true. It allows the user quick access to music and information from a library of compact digital discs without having to physically handle them. The system is composed of an IBM personal computer, an <b>Interface</b> <b>Controller</b> Card, and two Sony CDK- 006 Auto Disc Loaders. This project is not a full implementation but rather a system level design with fully functional software in the personal computer, a chip level design and untested software in the <b>interface</b> <b>controller</b> card and an interface description for the Sony Auto Disc Loaders. The personal computer program is written in Turbo Pascal and provides compact disc library management, user control of music playback sequencing, and communications to the <b>interface</b> <b>controller</b> card, all with {{the primary goal of}} an extremely user friendly <b>interface.</b> The <b>Interface</b> <b>Controller</b> Card is an Intel 8085 AH- 2 based system and uses six support chips to accomplish its major task of handling communications between the personal computer and the Sony Auto Disc Loaders. The Sony Auto Disc Loader is a retrieval and playback system that stores compact disc up to sixty discs. Two Sony units are used in this system to minimize the delay time between compact disc play and increase system storage capacity to 120 discs. Although the Sony Auto Disc Loaders are not physically included in this project the interface to both Sony units is defined, with the required hardware components designed and program coded...|$|R
