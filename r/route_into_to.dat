50|$|The {{original}} {{route of}} SR 164 was commissioned as a three-mile (5 km) long connector in Banks County in the 1940s and extended {{in the early}} 1960s into Franklin County east to SR 106 along Bold Springs Road. The original route joined US 441/SR 15 to SR 59, serving as a cutoff between Homer and Carnesville. While the 1960s extension was retracted back to its original eastern terminus around 1989, the highway was extended again in late 2004 westward along Old US 441 {{as part of a}} business <b>route</b> <b>into</b> Homer <b>to</b> join SR 51.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMost of {{existing}} computer methods to analyse {{the perception of}} the open spaces do not consider the Gibsonian motion perspective, i. e.,the gradual changes in the visual field in the rate of displacement. This paper describes a new approach considering this motion perspective to analyse paths and routes in urban environments. Based on Teller 's spherical metric, it proposes to use the skeletonisation as a way to trace the variations of the sky shape between successive views. It is thereby possible <b>to</b> structure the <b>route</b> <b>into</b> sequences,according <b>to</b> its potential interest in the urban environment...|$|R

30|$|In human’s skin, {{the hair}} follicles cover only 0.1 % {{of the skin}} surface, however, target drug {{delivery}} can be performed through follicular route, to achieve a better drug penetration. By pulling out the hair sheath, {{it is possible to}} make a significant penetration of medicines in a size smaller than 40  nm <b>into</b> epidermal cell, <b>to</b> reach, and facilitate a higher topical nanoparticle delivery through skin. Mechanical stress on the skin is necessary, which can be achieved by massage, skin flexing, or follicles pulled out. Over the last few years, the interest in a target by follicular delivery has increased as it might be a potential delivery <b>route</b> <b>into</b> sebum <b>to</b> control the skin diseases (Naves and Almeida 2015).|$|R
50|$|On 1 March 1853, {{a portion}} of the 1848 Swiss Federal Constitution came into effect and removed all {{internal}} tolls on travel and trade. The toll houses on the Nydegg bridge were closed and the canton took over ownership of the bridge. In 1850, the Tiefenaubrücke was built. The newer bridge and the railroad quickly became the preferred <b>routes</b> <b>to</b> <b>into</b> the city, while the Nydegg bridge was only used for local traffic. This changed in the 1920s when the city expanded to the southeast and the Nydegg bridge once again became a popular <b>route</b> <b>into</b> the city.|$|R

40|$|Pseudorabies {{virus was}} inoculated by various <b>routes</b> <b>into</b> dogs <b>to</b> {{determine}} {{the relationship of}} pseudorabies virus {{to the development of}} heart lesions. Electrocardiograms and serum samples for lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes were taken twice daily. Transitory and persistent arrhythmias were a consistent finding. Heart lesions were noted within each of the inoculated groups. These changes varied from severe multifocal areas of hemorrhage and myocardial degeneration to small zones of myolysis. A ganglioneuritis of the stellate ganglia and autonomic ganglia within the heart were also consistent findings. Herpes-like viral particles were found by electron microscopy in various autonomic ganglia and in myocardial endothelial cells. No viral particles were found in myocardial cells. Significant increases in lactate dehydrogenase- 1 were noted. It was concluded that fatal arrhythmias resulted from pseudorabies virus infections in the dog after the occurrence of myocardial and ganglionic lesions...|$|R
50|$|The growing {{passenger}} traffic reached {{an alarming rate}} in 2014. Appeals to upgrade the airport to cater the growing numbers using Miri Airport were constantly voiced. Miri Airport handles more than 4,000 flights a month, {{with an average of}} 125 aircraft landings and take-offs daily, including 62 landings for rural services; with the current airport size, arrival time for incoming flights will be delayed because they {{have to wait for the}} other aircraft to depart before it could land at the runway. Traffic congestion during peak hours also pose a problem. An urgent meeting was held by Sarawak Communication Assistant Minister Datuk Lee Kim Shin regarding the matters. There are also talks to introduce more international <b>routes</b> <b>into</b> Miri <b>to</b> further boost the city's economy and to break the tourism bottleneck experienced in Miri as the only international route of Miri-Singapore at present is inadequate.|$|R

The section from Towcester to Ravenstone Wood junction remained used by freight until June 1958, and the line south to Olney closed as a result of the construction of the M1 motorway. The last section to remain open was from Woodford West junction to Blisworth which closed to goods in February 1964.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose the {{possibility}} of obtaining syngas from very different and complex organic wastes, such as municipal solid wastes, agricultural residues or sewage sludge, through microwave-induced and conventional pyrolysis at 400 and 800 °C. Microwave heating {{has proved to be}} an appropriate way to produce a syngas with CO + H 2 concentrations as high as 90 vol% and in large yields (up to 0. 83 L g− 1 waste). In addition, the potential of the syngas produced by this technology as fermentation substrate for the production of bioplastics is discussed. Microwave pyrolysis seems to serve as a novel <b>route</b> <b>into</b> biorefineries <b>to</b> produce valuable biobased products. The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 311815 (SYNPOL project).

50|$|Can be {{a little}} noisy (comparatively for France) from the local Autoroute which passes {{on the other side}} of the heights of Saint Laurent de Mure and the {{aircraft}} which pass from the airport but not objectionable levels by any means and often interesting. The Antonov heavy lift aircraft that leave with Beaujolais nouveau are the noisiest to leave the airport early in the morning but as it's only once a year it merely serves to remind one of the important links France has with its Wine production. The main road RN6 (Route Nationale) passing through the village becomes blocked in the morning (07:45 to 09:15) and evening (16:30 18:00) due to it being a secondary <b>route</b> <b>into</b> Lyon (alternate <b>to</b> the Autoroute).

On the southeast, the pass known as the Sasser Pass (Saser La) separates the Rimo Muztagh from the Saser Muztagh.

40|$|Biomedical {{applications}} are an emerging {{field of interest}} for magnesium technology, envisioning biodegradable implants that resorb {{in the human body}} after having cured a particular medical condition (such as artery clogging or bone fractures). This challenges research in a sense that the materials to be used need to dissolve in vivo in a controlled fashion without leaving harmful remainders and while maintaining sufficient strength and other (mechanical) attributes as long as necessary. To comply to the requirements, magnesium alloys as well as their processing <b>routes</b> <b>into</b> implants need <b>to</b> be tailored. While new alloy compositions are receiving ample attention, the paper at hand addresses the processing issue. The application of choice is the (cardio) -vascular stent. Different steps in manufacturing magnesium AZ-alloy stent tube are considered, including equal channel angular pressing, extrusion and subsequent drawing operations. Results show that the processing route has an important influence on the microstructure of the finished stent tube and hence on its functional performance...|$|R
