Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a <b>retired</b> <b>farmer),</b> and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the financial performance and stress experienced by beginning and retired {{farms in the}} U. S. Using USDA’s ARMS data, probit models are estimated to study the personal and farm characteristics that affect {{whether or not the}} financial ratios fall into critical zones. The results show that older farmers and larger farms are less likely to experience financial stress while hobby farms and livestock farms are more likely to experience financial stress. The results for beginning and <b>retired</b> <b>farmers</b> indicate fewer significant effects. beginning farmers, financial performance, financial stress, <b>retired</b> <b>farmers,</b> transitioning farmers, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

They added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from the Reverend H. Bennett Smith of St Nicholas-at-Wade, who had in turn learned from a <b>retired</b> <b>farmer</b> in his parish that [...] "the farmer used to send annually round the neighbourhood the best horse under the charge of the wagoner, and that afterwards instead, a man used to represent the horse, being supplied with a tail, and with a wooden figure of a horse's head, and plenty of horse hair for a mane... The custom has long since ceased." ...|$|E

40|$|Many European {{countries}} employ {{social policy}} instruments {{specifically designed for}} <b>retired</b> <b>farmers.</b> We present the German case and argue from a life course perspective {{that it may be}} justified, in principle, to employ specific social policy instruments for groups with their own social characteristics. The Swiss case where retirement policies for farmers do not yet exist, is used for examining the need for special social support instruments. A regression analysis of the financial situation of <b>retired</b> Swiss <b>farmers</b> and a Configural Frequency Analysis of several social parameters was carried out. It cannot be shown that Swiss <b>retired</b> <b>farmers,</b> in default of own social policy instruments, are generally in a precarious situation.

But it was also known that Mr. Campbell was not always in a good humour. If he liked you there was nothing he would not do for you; if he disliked you--well, you were not left in ignorance of it. In short, we had the impression that Mr. Campbell resembled the famous little girl with the curl {{in the middle of her}} forehead.

He doesn't understand anything about it, but ever since he started a cucumber-frame last summer he has regarded himself in the light of an agriculturist, and talks in this absurd way with the idea of impressing the rest of the terrace with the notion that he is a <b>retired</b> <b>farmer.</b> I can only hope that for this once he is correct, and that the weather really is doing good to something, because it is doing me a considerable amount of damage.
