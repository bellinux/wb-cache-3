The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{most of the}} 2nd Division's {{units were}} sent to the United Kingdom in August 1940, {{although}} the Iceland garrison remained in place until 31October. The absence of the Mont Royals allowed Odlum to <b>reassign</b> the Calgary Highlanders to the 5th Brigade in September, in an attempt to ethnically mix the brigades of the division. By late December 1940, the 2nd Canadian Division was joined with the 1st to form the Canadian Corps (later renamed to I Canadian Corps).|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) {{approaches}} former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) and enlists him in {{her plan}} to sabotage the club. She blackmails Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) into appointing Sandy as the school's new Arts director, and together they hold auditions for a school production of Cabaret, hoping to entice away the glee club's star, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Rachel feels slighted when Will awards Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) a solo that she wanted, so she auditions for the musical and is given the lead role. When Will refuses to <b>reassign</b> the solo to Rachel, she quits the club.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors {{on a daily basis}} is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would <b>reassign</b> control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY93 was realigned to use Junction and Upper Mountain Roads instead. As a result, NY270 was {{cut back to}} its {{junction}} with Upper Mountain Road. On November1, 2005, the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure that, if passed, would allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to remove the NY93 designation from Upper Mountain Road, a county-maintained highway, and <b>reassign</b> it to Junction Road (NY270) and Saunders Settlement Road (NY31). The change was intended to eliminate truck traffic on Upper Mountain Road while providing additional capacity to NY93. This part of the agenda was passed. NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006, rerouting NY93 as proposed and truncating NY270 southward to NY31.|$|E
5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and <b>reassign</b> tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
5|$|Centaur was {{allocated}} the United Kingdom Official Number 147275 and the Code Letters KHHC. Her {{port of registry}} was Liverpool. When Centaur entered {{service at}} the end of 1924, the Fremantle–Java– Singapore trade route was being serviced by two other Blue Funnel Line vessels; Gorgon (which remained in service until 1928) and Charon (which Centaur was replacing). Centaurs route ran from Fremantle up the Western Australian coast calling at Geraldton, Carnarvon, Onslow, Point Samson, Port Hedland, Broome, and Derby then to the Bali Strait, Surabaya, Semarang, Batavia, and Singapore. Centaur operated as a cross between a tramp steamer and a freight liner; she travelled a set route, but stops at ports along the route varied between journeys. From 1928 until sometime in the 1930s, Centaur remained alone on her route, but the increase in trade along this route prompted Blue Funnel Line to <b>reassign</b> Gorgon and assign the new Charon to work alongside Centaur.|$|E

5|$|Students were {{enrolled}} {{from throughout the}} city. Often the school was used to <b>reassign</b> students {{who could not be}} enrolled into other high schools. As of the 2006-2007 school year, Arlington enrolled 1,825 students. The plurality were Asian, at 48%, with Black, 35% and Hispanic, 11% being the other major ethnic groups. 5% of students identified as White. The school has the highest rate of poverty in high schools from the Saint Paul Public School system with 89% of students qualifying for Free and Reduced Price Lunch. Free and Reduced Price Lunch is the measure of poverty for the district. The school has a large percentage of students who have limited English proficiency (58%). 14% of students qualify for special education. The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 83% while roughly three out of five students who initially enroll graduate within 4 years. 35% of students had grade level reading proficiency and 13% of students had proficiency in mathematics. Enrollment dropped considerably in the last years with only 875 students enrolled in 2010 and projections of only 650 for 2011.|$|E

40|$|A bug report {{contains}} many fields, such as product, component, severity, priority, fixer, operating system (OS), platform, etc., which provide important {{information for the}} bug triaging and fixing process. It is important {{to make sure that}} bug information is correct since previous studies showed that the wrong assignment of bug report fields could increase the bug fixing time, and even delay the delivery of the software. In this paper, we perform an empirical study on bug report field reassignments in open-source software projects. To better understand why bug report fields are <b>reassigned,</b> we manually collect 99 recent bug reports that had their fields <b>reassigned</b> and emailed their reporters and developers asking why these fields got <b>reassigned.</b> Then, we perform a large-scale empirical study on 8 types of bug report field reassignments in 4 open-source software projects containing a total of 190, 558 bug reports. In particular, we investigate 1) the number of bug reports whose fields get <b>reassigned,</b> 2) the difference in bug fixing time between bug reports whose fields get <b>reassigned</b> and those whose fields are not <b>reassigned,</b> 3) the duration a field in a bug report gets <b>reassigned,</b> 4) the number of fields in a bug report that get <b>reassigned,</b> 5) the number of times a field in a bug report gets <b>reassigned,</b> and 6) whether the experience of bug reporters affect the reassignment of bug report fields. We find that a large number (approximately 80 %) of bug reports have their fields <b>reassigned,</b> and the bug reports whose fields get <b>reassigned</b> require more time to be fixed than those without field reassignments...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{increased}} traffic and access to transit systems, putting in public transit frequently has {{a positive effect on}} real estate prices. For example, the Washington DC Metro system has increased land desirability around its stations, and The Hong Kong metro MTR generates a profit by redeveloping land around and above its stations. Much public opposition to new transit construction can be based on the concern about the impact on neighborhoods of this new economic development. Few localities have the ability to seize and <b>reassign</b> development rights to a private transit operator, as Hong Kong has done.|$|E

By 20 August 1920, the Polish army {{had reached a}} strength of 737,767, so there was rough numerical parity between the Polish army and the opposing Soviet forces. Polish intelligence knew the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive; the Polish High Command decided to launch a preemptive attack. The plan for Operation Kiev was more ambitious than simply defeating the Red Army on Poland's southern flank. It aimed at creating a friendly government within the captured Ukrainian territories. Afterwards, Piłsudski and his Polish General Staff planned to <b>reassign</b> the 3rd Army to the north, where Polish planners expected a major Red Army counteroffensive.|$|E
