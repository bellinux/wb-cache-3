60|$|The Bravo {{spoke with}} deep feeling, and his {{companion}} fancied, {{strange as it}} was coming from such a man, with an air of wounded integrity. Don Camillo knew that there was no condition of life, however degraded or lost to the world, which had not its own particular opinions of the faith due to its fellows; and he had seen enough of the sinuous course of the oligarchy of Venice, to understand that it was quite possible its shameless and irresponsible duplicity might offend the principles of even an assassin. Less odium was attached to men of that class, in Italy and at that day, than will be easily imagined in a country like this; for the radical defects and the vicious administration of the laws, caused an irritable and sensitive people too often to take into their own hands the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redressing</b> their own wrongs. Custom had lessened the odium of the crime; and though society denounced the assassin himself, it is scarcely too much to say, that his employer was regarded with little more disgust than the religious of our time regard the survivor of a private combat. Still it was not usual for nobles like Don Camillo to hold intercourse, beyond that which the required service exacted, with men of Jacopo's cast; but the language and manner of the Bravo so strongly attracted the curiosity, and even the sympathy of his companion, that the latter unconsciously sheathed his rapier and drew nearer.|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{like many}} other jurisdictions, {{principles}} of fairness and transparency underpin modern consumer protection laws applying to traditional consumer transactions. These laws had, until recently, focused on those transactions involving the supply of goods or services for personal, domestic or household use, {{and in the case}} of the supply of goods, to personal property transactions. An overriding objective of consumer protection law is to shore up the bargaining position so that the perceived weaker party has access to greater <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> should the stronger party seek to exploit that weakness. The commencement of the new Australian Consumer Law (ACL) on 1 July 2010 has introduced a single generic consumer law applying across Australia and has extended the blue pencil principle to Unfair Contract Terms (UCT) in land transactions. The ACL interferes with the contractual terms between the parties involved in a standard form consumer contract by declaring void those terms that fail to meet the ‘fairness test’, severing the unfair term from the contract. This paper questions whether such an extension is justified in circumstances where existing protection is already provided under the common law, in equity and transparency principles integrated in real property laws supporting those ‘consumers’ involved in land transactions. It also questions whether the new UCT provisions could be open to abuse by unmeritorious parties seeking to avoid otherwise binding contractual obligations. A comparative study is undertaken of the current consumer protection and real property laws of Singapore and whether the standard form consumer land contracts in those jurisdictions would meet the UCT ‘fairness test’ under the ACL...|$|R

40|$|The {{politics}} of the body have been debated at length; ideas of moral and natural rights to protect individual autonomy have been presented {{in the context of}} class, gender and race for centuries.

40|$|Consumers {{benefit from}} well-functioning markets. Since {{competition}} law infringements harm the market mechanism, all competition law infringements harm consumers, directly or indirectly. There are {{two categories of}} consumers who have suffered: consumers who have bought products at a higher price or of inferior quality; and consumers who {{could not afford to}} buy the overpriced product (deadweight loss). Consumers have a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> for antitrust damages in all the Nordic countries. However, with a few exceptions, neither consumers nor their representatives are currently pursuing such claims. Consequently, consumers are not being compensated for their losses. The Nordic Council of Ministers therefore decided to fund a project and a report on the subject. The project was set up and supervised by the Steering Group on Legal Issues under the Committee on Consumer Issues. The ambition of the report is twofold: to analyse the main obstacles to redress of consumers' antitrust damages; and to provide possible solutions to the problems consumers and their representatives face when pursuing such claims. The report aims to provide both national and EU institutions with specific recommendations on how to facilitate consumers' claims for antitrust damages...|$|E

40|$|In {{traditional}} commercial transactions, {{consumers are}} usually {{regarded as the}} vulnerable party. 1 This vulnerability is, arguably, more pronounced in e-commerce due to the way this particular kind of business is conducted, and this creates additional complications that do not exist in a traditional trade transaction. E-consumer concerns can be reduced by creating an appropriate legal environment, including the introduction of consumer protection regulations. Most developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, have realised that empowering consumers is important for fostering the e-commerce market. 2 However, in developing countries, the lack of consumer protection regulations for e-commerce {{is one of the}} main barriers to the progression of e-commerce. Saudi Arabia is one country affected by a lack of efficient protection for e-consumers. 3 This lack of efficiency is attributed to the ambiguity of current measures available for protecting e-consumers; current measures are based on basic consumer protection principles gleaned from Sharia and some other standard regulations that are used for protecting e-consumers. In the context of e-commerce, these general rules require further explanation and clarification. 4 Therefore, the overriding objective of this research is to address the need for e-consumer protection regulations in Saudi Arabia by proposing a legal framework that might be used to provide efficient protection. This research identifies areas that contribute to the ambiguity of current measures, including a lack of clear unified regulations for e-consumer protection, and a lack of clear provisions in specific areas including: information obligation, the right to cancel, and <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress.</b> In order to address these needs, a legal framework is suggested. This was built by using UK regulations as a model, with consideration given to their suitability for the Saudi Legal system, and its culture and traditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} physical {{outcomes of}} compliance with halal requirements in Islamic production are high quality and safe products. The producers or suppliers, who claim that their products are halal but in actual fact are not halal, are subject to criminal sanctions under relevant laws in Malaysia. The question arises {{as to whether the}} producers of non-halal products can also be liable for physical or emotional injury caused to the victims of such products. This paper aims to explore the potential liability of the producer and supplier of false halal products under the product liability law which generally concerns with providing protection to consumers against unsafe products. The paper specifically examines the provisions of strict liability for defective products under Part X of Consumer Protection Act 1999 (CPA). The main questions to be answered are whether non-halal products can be considered as ‘defective ’ and what kind of injury can be recovered by the victims. The findings of this study provide insights to producers and suppliers on the civil liability for supplying supposedly halal products and recognition of consumer <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> for injury caused by non-halal products...|$|E
40|$|Subject {{matter of}} the present study is the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> {{provided}} by the Directive 44 / 1999 on consumer sales for final seller. To him art. 1519 -quinquies, which according to the Directive was introduced into the Italian civil code, grants a remedy as against anyone of the previous sellers in the chain to whom the non conformity to contract is imputable. The final seller can recover any expense due to the non conformity he has made, and this is true redress in a technical sense. After this precision, the author tries to single out the foundation of this remedy and comes to the conclusion that this is the liability of the one in the chain who has caused the non conformity. Question arises whether the redress includes also damages paid to the consumer by the final seller, since the discipline introduced by the Directive does not deal with this problem. The study finally is an occasion to discuss the question regarding the nature of the fundamental remedy granted by the new discipline to the consumer as against the final seller. The relationship between the rules on products liability and those newly introduced on consumer sales is also dealt with...|$|E
40|$|The {{judicial}} discretion to grant leave for a derivative action, {{in terms of}} s 165 (5) (b) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, involves a tension between two equally important policy objectives. On the one hand is {{the benefit of a}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>redress,</b> where a stakeholder may seek redress on the company’s behalf; on the other hand is the indisputable need to protect companies and their directors from nuisance actions by stakeholders. The guiding criteria for the granting of leave attempt to draw a proper balance between these two objectives. They serve as checks and balances to curtail the abuse of the derivative action, by weeding out claims that are frivolous, vexatious or meritless. Much depends on the application by the courts of the open-textured criteria for leave to institute derivative proceedings. The legislature has left it to the courts to flesh out the interpretation, application and contours of the guiding criteria and, thereby, to determine effectively {{the success or failure of}} this remedy in South African law. This article focuses on two leading criteria, namely that the proposed action must involve the ‘trial of a serious question of material consequence to the company’, and that it must be ‘in the best interests of the company’. Guidelines are suggested for the proper judicial approach to these preconditions for a derivative action, based on the jurisprudence developed in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, all of which have influenced the relevant provisions of the Companies Act.

50|$|An {{example of}} the dual nature <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> {{revolution}} as both a natural law and as positive law {{is found in the}} American revolutionary context. Although the American Declaration of Independence invoked the natural law <b>right</b> <b>of</b> revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists’ actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England called “the law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> against public oppression.” Like the natural law’s <b>right</b> <b>of</b> revolution, this constitutional law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was “a central dogma in English and British constitutional law” since “time immemorial.” The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.|$|R
50|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> had limits {{like the}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> {{revolution}} under natural law.

It belonged to {{the community as a}} whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract. It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government. Blackstone’s Commentaries suggested that using the law <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> would be “extraordinary,” for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated “the fundamental laws,” or abandoned the kingdom. During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from “the hand of oppression” and “the merciless feet of tyranny.” A decade later the “indictment” of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.|$|R

40|$|Mainstream legal {{scholarship}} has {{paid much attention}} to clarifying the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to development by placing a great deal of scrutiny primarily on obligations of states to the neglect of non-state actors, as if states are the only integral players in the global economy necessary for realizing the right to development. This entrepreneurship steered clear of assessing viability <b>of</b> the <b>right’s</b> founding vision <b>of</b> <b>redressing</b> institutional imbalances and unfairness of the global economic order. If the discourse took a global order reform trajectory, it would have injected thoughts on how accountability of international economic institutions and transnational corporations can be formulated in a way that bridges the disjuncture between human rights and economic globalization. This article argues that contemporary accountability practices underpinned by the state responsibility doctrine are ill-conceived and inadequate because they overplay the role of the state. Yet, the state is subordinated to the vested interests of unaccountable global capital which seed the global economy with numerous incidences <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> violations. Thus, the article recommends an expanded notion of accountability (answerability, responsibility, sanctions) detached from a state-centric conception of accountability, and which bears the potential of resolving the non-state actor accountability deficit in international law...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa the {{distribution}} <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> remains a major manifestation and cause of injustice, only slowly {{affected by the}} constitutionally mandated programme of land restitution, redistribution and tenure reform. The Transformation of Certain Rural Areas Act 94, 1998 (Trancraa) is the first post-apartheid legislation to reform 'communal' land tenure. It applies to 23 former 'coloured rural areas' and was introduced in six areas in Namaqualand in the Northern Cape Province during 2001 - 2. In a different, contested process a Communal Land Rights Bill for the former 'homelands' was published in August 2002, adopted by Cabinet in 2003 and signed into law in July 2004. While the Communal Land Rights Act relies on 'traditional councils' with a majority of non-elected members, Trancraa was enacted {{in the context of}} the 1997 White Paper of South African Land Policy and focused on community choice and the role of municipalities. The consultative process in Namaqualand was driven by civil society organisations and community actors, but did not include the training, finance and development support needed to transform rural relations among people affected by unemployment, land scarcity and weak local organisations. To promote procedural and substantive justice, tenure reform must honour the human <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> equality, <b>redress</b> and land development support articulated in land policy and the Constitution. ...|$|R

Although the legislation was designed to protect the constitutional <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> employees, there are legal considerations and policy concerns that challenge the viability of this type of legislation.

40|$|Government {{is relying}} {{increasingly}} {{on the market}} mechanism for economic management. The underlying perfect competition model assures maximum welfare of consumer, but assumptions of the model do not hold in real world. Consumer is central to economic activity {{but at the same}} time is vulnerable to exploitation by producers, misleading information, ignorance <b>of</b> his <b>rights</b> and non-availability <b>of</b> <b>redress</b> mechanism. Markets may be competitive but the consumers may suffer on account of imperfect information, search and transport costs needed to make satisfactory choices. This creates the need for government intervention for protecting the consumer welfare and rights.

The area of consumer protection in Pakistan has remained neglected so far and no meaningful effort has been made in this direction. Realising this gap, the paper chalks out a consumer protection strategy for Pakistan; which goes beyond mere formulation of legislation and also includes consistent efforts towards awareness creation, provision of information/advice, setting of quality standards and redress.
