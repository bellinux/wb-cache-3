5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups.

Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E

Cross-sectional data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 4, 982), obtained in 2008 and 2009, were analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. The associations of MVPA, <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> parents, and <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> romantic partner to depressive symptoms were mediated through mastery. <b>Relations</b> <b>with</b> one's romantic partner were a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms than <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> parents, while the influence of religiosity on <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> romantic partner was largely mediated by <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> parents. The results highlight the sociobehavioral buffers of depressive symptoms that are peculiar to young adulthood. Further intervention research in preventing and treating depressive symptoms should consider incorporating the sociobehavioral factors that are tailored to the specific age group.

5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no <b>relation</b> <b>with</b> those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
