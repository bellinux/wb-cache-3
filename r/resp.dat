5|$|The complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically {{represented}} as {{points in the}} plane, and addition <b>resp.</b> multiplication of such numbers then corresponds to adding <b>resp.</b> rotating and scaling points. The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The {{general public}} stood in long lines {{waiting for a}} turn {{to pay their respects}} to the president. People passed by the casket {{at a rate of about}} 5,000 per hour (83.3 per minute <b>resp.</b> 1.4 per second) and the wait time for some {{exceeded}} seven hours. In all, 104,684 paid their respects when Reagan lay in state. The Washington Metro subway set a then daily record in ridership of 850,636 as a result.|$|E

25|$|Sulfate-reducing (<b>resp.</b> sulfur-reducing) {{bacteria}} generate usable energy under low-oxygen conditions {{by using}} sulfates (<b>resp.</b> elemental sulfur) to oxidize organic compounds or hydrogen; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue and}} green entries are {{symmetric}} around the diagonal: The entry for row p, column q is R (<b>resp</b> N) {{if and only if}} the entry at row q, column p, is R (<b>resp</b> N).|$|E
25|$|The {{yellow and}} orange ones, {{on the other}} hand, are antisymmetric: The entry for row p, column q is R (<b>resp</b> N) {{if and only if}} the entry at row q, column p, is N (<b>resp</b> R).|$|E
25|$|If all {{roots of}} f above are real (respectively, complex) or, equivalently, any {{possible}} embedding F ⊂ C is actually {{forced to be}} inside R (<b>resp.</b> C), F is called totally real (<b>resp.</b> totally complex).|$|E
25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} for {{the real}} line (<b>resp.</b> for periodic functions, see Fourier series), maps Lp(R) to Lq(R) (<b>resp.</b> Lp(T) to ℓq), where 1≤ p≤ 2 and 1/p+ 1/q= 1. This {{is a consequence of}} the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem, and is made precise with the Hausdorff–Young inequality.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetric}} group has two 1-dimensional representations: the trivial representation and the sign representation. The symmetric polynomials are the trivial representation, and the alternating polynomials are the sign representation. Formally, the scalar span of any symmetric (<b>resp.,</b> alternating) polynomial is a trivial (<b>resp.,</b> sign) {{representation of the}} {{symmetric group}}, and multiplying the polynomials tensors the representations.|$|E

25|$|Weil {{introduced}} the adele {{ring in the}} late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his Basic Number Theory in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (<b>resp.</b> of Serre) {{became known as the}} Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (<b>resp.</b> Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In Budget 2007, Flaherty {{introduced}} the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP). The RDSP {{is a long-term}} savings plan to help Canadians with disabilities and their families save. The RDSP resembles its other saving counterparts, the RRSP and the <b>RESP,</b> and is meant to ensure a secure future for people with disabilities. The Government assists these families by contributing through grants and bonds that supplement contributions.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, 1991, the Croatian {{authorities}} {{held the}} Croatian referendum on independence. Serb local authorities {{called for a}} boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. In the end, a majority of Croatians endorsed independence from Yugoslavia, with a turnout of 83.56% and the two referendum questions answered positively by 93.24% and 92.18% (<b>resp.)</b> {{of the total number}} of votes.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{started his}} {{professorship}} on April 1, 1971. Soon an electrostatic particle accelerator for 700 keV protons was installed (later also a tandem accelerator), und {{in collaboration with}} O. Benka, D. Semrad, A. Kropf and others, atomic physics experiments were started. To make the Linz group internationally known, Paul started to organize international workshops: at first three on theories of ionisation of inner atomic shells. A table of cross sections for K shell ionisation by light ions, established together with J. Muhr and O. Bolik, <b>resp.,</b> {{is available in the}} Internet.|$|E
25|$|Offertories are sung {{during the}} {{offering}} of Eucharistic bread and wine. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but {{the use of}} verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoire. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and <b>Resp.</b> are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last melodic line of the chant.|$|E
25|$|Under a {{syntactic}} intransitive base approach, the transitive form {{is derived}} from the intransitive form by insertion of a verbal layer projected by a head expressing causation and introducing the external agent argument. This idea assumes that a verbal phrase is able to be separated into different layers of verbal projections whereby each of the layers provide a specifier where an argument can be attached. In addition, the layers are joined together by head movement of the lowest verb head to positions higher in the syntactic structure. Change-of-state verbs are broken-down into the verbal layers of initiation phrase (initP), process phrase (procP) and result phrase (<b>resP),</b> which approximately correspond to the predicate cause, become, and state respectively.|$|E
25|$|The tune {{appears in}} several {{collections}} by Michael Praetorius, for voices only: Musae Sionae II (1607) no. 5, a motet à 8 for double choir; Musae Sionae V (1607) nos. 80–82 (for 2, 3 or 4 voices); Musae Sionae VI (1609) nos. 28, 29, 31 <b>resp.</b> 32, 33 all for 4 voices; and 5 part setting from Musae Sionae VI (1597). And a vocal–instrumental version from his collection Polyhymnia Caduceatrix et Panegyrica (1618–19), No 34: a festive multi-choir version with large instrumental support including trumpets and timpani. It can be executed by 7, 12, 16 or 20 voices in 5 choirs (three vocal, one chapel- and one instrumental choir) and general bass.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% <b>resp</b> 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
25|$|Erwin Vandenbergh is {{the only}} player to have claimed the top scorer title 4 {{consecutive}} times, between 1979–80 and 1982–83 (the first three times while at Lierse SK {{and the last time}} while at RSC Anderlecht). He is also the player to have claimed the most Belgian First Division top scorer titles in his career (6 times with 3 different clubs: 3 times with Lierse SK, twice with RSC Anderlecht and once with KAA Gent). Victor Wegria and Josip Weber won the title 3 consecutive times (<b>resp.</b> between 1958–59 and 1960–61 while at RFC Liégeois and between 1991–92 and 1993–94 while at Cercle Brugge KSV). Wegria eventually finished top scorer a 4th time in 1962–63 still with RFC Liégeois, making him the second player with the most top scorer titles in the history of Belgian First Division top scorers.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it would}} be quite {{difficult}} to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them S, M, and L. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (I'S, I'M, I'L) for the S, M, and L lights, <b>resp.,</b> until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (I'S, I'M, I'L) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} total duration of the syllables, <b>resp.</b> neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E
