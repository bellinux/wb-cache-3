5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian.

For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|John Martin Scripps {{was born}} in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, 9 December 1959 to Leonard and Jean Scripps, an East End lorry driver and a Fleet Street barmaid respectively. He {{travelled}} often in childhood, occasionally accompanied by his father, with whom he was very close. Leonard Scripps committed suicide when his son was nine. After his father's death, Scripps developed problems with <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing,</b> which led to him leaving school {{at the age of}} 15.

50|$|Different {{considerations}} for memory access patterns appear in parallelism beyond locality of reference, namely {{the separation of}} <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> <b>writes.</b> E.g.: even if the <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> <b>writes</b> are 'perfectly' local, it can be impossible to parallelise due to dependencies; separating the <b>reads</b> <b>and</b> <b>writes</b> into separate areas yields a different memory access pattern, maybe initially appear worse in pure locality terms, but desirable to leverage modern parallel hardware.|$|R

5|$|Patton never seriously {{considered}} a career {{other than the}} military. At the age of seventeen he sought an appointment to the United States Military Academy. Patton applied to several universities with Reserve Officer's Training Corps programs.

He attended the school from 1903 to 1904 and, though he struggled with <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing,</b> performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection as well as military drill. While Patton was at VMI, California's Senator nominated him for West Point.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). <b>Reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E

5|$|In August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Poetry. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by James Joyce, Robert Frost, D. H.

In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch, Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>writing,</b> walking in the woods and fencing.

As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and public performance.
