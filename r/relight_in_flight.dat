40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The highly {{exothermic}} reaction of fuel combustion {{is the most}} common source of usable energy in the world. The fuel itself originates almost entirely from fossil fuels, such as crude oil and natural gas. The use of these fuels for energy production is under pressure in recent times due to environmental and availability concerns. This then sets the stage for combustion research aimed at providing more efficient combustion processes and characterising the combustion behaviour of alternative fuels. The laminar flame speed of a combustible mixture is a well defined combustion characteristic that influences the efficiency and performance of many combustion processes. An example of where flame speed has a strong impact on the performance of a combustion process, is the blow-out and <b>relight</b> ability <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> applications of gas turbine engines. A very common experimental setup to obtain laminar flame speed data is the constant volume combustion bomb, where the laminar flame speed is calculated from the measured flame speed of a spherical flame, propagating outwards inside a usually spherical combustion chamber...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the {{literature}} that image-based relighting of scenes with unknown geometry can be achieved through linear combinations of a set of pre-acquired reference images. Since the placement and brightness of the light sources can be controlled, it is natural to ask: what is the optimal way to illuminate the scene {{to reduce the number of}} reference images that are needed? We show that the best way to light the scene (i. e., the way that minimizes the number of reference images) is not using a sequence of single, compact light sources as is most commonly done, but rather to use a sequence of lighting patterns as given by an object-dependent lighting basis. While this lighting basis, which we call the optimal lighting basis (OLB), depends on camera and scene properties, we show that it can be determined as a simple calibration procedure before acquisition. We demonstrate through experiments on real and synthetic data that the optimal lighting basis significantly reduces the number of reference images that are needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy in the relit images. This reduction in the number of needed images is particularly critical in the problem of <b>relighting</b> <b>in</b> video, as corresponding points on moving objects must be aligned from frame to frame during each cycle of the lighting basis. We show, however, that the efficiencies gained by the optimal lighting basis makes <b>relighting</b> <b>in</b> video possible using only a simple optical flow alignment. We present several relighting results on real video sequences of moving objects, moving faces, and scenes containing both. In each case, although a single video clip was captured, we are able to relight again and again, controlling the lighting direction, extent, and color. ...|$|R
