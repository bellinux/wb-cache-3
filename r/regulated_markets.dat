25|$|In {{the final}} months before Zimbabwe's central bank reforms of 30 April 2008, {{virtually}} all popular currency conversion resources relied upon the official rate of 30,000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures, {{in spite of}} the vast differences between that and free market rates. By 23 May 2008, Bloomberg and Oanda began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe's formally regulated domestic bank market, while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July, albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places. Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table. They soon began to differ, in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, increasingly substantially in comparison to less <b>regulated</b> <b>markets</b> such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare, reflected above as Parallel Rates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{transmission}} system operator (TSO) is re-sponsible {{for keeping the}} balance between production and consumption in the power system. In order to do so, the TSO continuously trades power on the so-called <b>regulating</b> <b>market.</b> Hydropower is a flexible power source well suited for trading on the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> because it allows fast changes in generation output. This paper describes an optimization model for creating optimal bidding strategies for the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> from a hydropower producer perspective. The model is based on nonlinear stochastic programming, where the <b>regulating</b> <b>market</b> prices are considered stochastic variables. The model also includes generation of regulating power price scenarios and scenario tree construction...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{whether a}} <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs should be legalized. The main {{focus will be}} on the {{arguments}} given by philosophers James Stacey Taylor and Michael Sandel regarding the discussion of legalization. In addition to this it is analyzed and later concluded whether the term dignity can be a reasonable argument in the above mentioned discussion. The study examines dignity through an analysis of the term and how it is defined in four selected historical periods and its significance {{in the context of a}} <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs. It is hereby concluded that it is somewhat impossible to provide a precise definition of dignity in modern society; hence it cannot be used in the discussion of whether a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs is morally permissible. Through an analysis and discussion of the aforementioned philosophers’ arguments, it is concluded that Taylor argues that a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs ought to be legalized. It is noted that Sandel does not explicitly discuss this particular subject, but instead focuses on the immoral factors of market transactions in general. It is therefore concluded that he would also find a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs to be immoral. The study finally concludes that the arguments given by Sandel are not reasonable and thus cannot be accepted in the review of whether or not a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs should be legalized. In contrast to this it is found that the arguments given by Taylor have defeated the challenges thrown at them. On account of the above it is concluded that a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> in human organs ought to be legalized and that it is a morally permissible decision...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{argue that}} {{prohibition}} creates more troubles than alternative policies, but {{fewer than half}} of American voters support a taxed and <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> for cannabis. Some oppose a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> because of concerns about driving after smoking cannabis. Although a roadside sobriety test for impairment exists, few voters know about it. The widespread use of a roadside sobriety test that could detect recent cannabis use might lead some voters who currently oppose a <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> to support it. In contrast, a question that primes respondents about the potential for driving after cannabis use might lead respondents to be less likely to support a <b>regulated</b> <b>market.</b> Methods Phone interviews with a national sample of 1002 registered voters asked about support for a <b>regulated</b> cannabis <b>market</b> and support for such a market if a reliable roadside sobriety test were widely available. Results In this sample of registered voters, 36 % supported a <b>regulated</b> cannabis <b>market.</b> Exploratory chi-square tests revealed significantly higher support among men and Caucasians but no link to age or education. These demographic variables covaried significantly. Logistic regression revealed that gender, ethnicity, and political party were significant when all predictors were included. Support increased significantly with a reliable roadside sobriety test to 44 %, but some respondents who had agreed to the <b>regulated</b> <b>market</b> no longer agreed when the sobriety test was mentioned. Logistic regression revealed that ethnicity and political affiliation were again significant predictors of support with a reliable sobriety test, but gender was no longer significant. None of these demographic variables could identify who would change their votes in response to the reliable roadside test. Conclusion Increased awareness and use of roadside sobriety tests that detect recent cannabis use could increase support for a <b>regulated</b> cannabis <b>market.</b> Identifying concerns of voters who are not Caucasian or Democrats could help alter cannabis policy. </p...|$|R
