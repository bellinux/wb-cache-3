50|$|The first {{safe and}} {{successful}} {{steam power plant}} was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged {{to come to an}} arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into {{the lower half of the}} cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a <b>rocking</b> <b>beam</b> to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical plug tree suspended from the <b>rocking</b> <b>beam</b> which rendered the engine self-acting.|$|E

50|$|The other {{ends of the}} two <b>rocking</b> <b>beams</b> are {{connected}} to the vertical pumping cylinders by a chain mechanism. The cylinders have a bore of 2 ft and a stroke of 5 ft. The pistons in each cylinder include triangular weighted flaps of iron with leather hinges.|$|R
40|$|Eccentrically {{braced frame}} (EBF) {{is a highly}} {{effective}} seismic-resistant structural system when properly designed. However, permanent drift of EBFs after design basis earthquakes may affect the structure’s continuous occupancy and seismic retrofit can be very costly. To address the resilience issues such as uninterrupted use even after strong earthquakes, self-centering behavior is incorporated into EBF through post-tensioning to develop the self-centering eccentrically braced frame (SC-EBF) system. Post-tensioned connections are formed at the interfaces between <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> and EBF beams using post-tensioned (PT) tendons. Gaps are allowed to open at these post-tensioned connections in strong earthquakes; and can be firmly closed under the re-centering force of the PT tendons. The columns, beams, braces, and the <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> are designed to behave elastic under the design basis earthquake. Therefore, no residual drift is expected {{to occur in the}} SC-EBF system and damage is concentrated to replaceable fuse members under the design basis earthquake. The proposed SC-EBF system provides a competitive design option in high seismic hazard regions with its self-centering behavior, stiffness and strength comparable to conventional EBF structural systems, and tunable energy dissipation capacity provided by conveniently replaceable fuse devices. The link beam which is welded or bolted to the beams of the conventional EBF system is replaced by the <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam.</b> Self-centering behavior is observed in all the investigated SC-EBF structures in this study. A nonlinear finite element analysis based parametric study is conducted on the SC-EBF systems with K-type or D-type EBF configurations. Effects of two key design parameters are evaluated: PT tendon area and the <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> length. To cope with the large link rotation demand, replaceable fuse devices in the SC-EBF systems are made of highly ductile AISI 316 L stainless steel and are designed to utilize the large deformation in the SC-EBF systems for energy dissipation during strong earthquakes. It is observed that the ductility of the SC-EBF with short <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> is generally lower than that of the SC-EBF with longer <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> if the same PT tendon length is used for both cases. To take advantage of the findings from both the SC-EBF system with short <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam</b> and the SC-EBF with long <b>rocking</b> link <b>beam,</b> a modified design of the SC-EBF with two parallel short <b>rocking</b> link <b>beams</b> is proposed. Nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted on this modified SC-EBF system under cyclic loading, showing that this type of SC-EBF system exhibits improved self-centering performance, strength, ductility, and energy dissipation behaviors.

5000|$|Newcomen took forward Papin's {{experiment}} {{and made it}} workable, although little information exists as to exactly how this came about. The main problem to which Papin had given no solution was {{how to make the}} action repeatable at regular intervals. The way forward was to provide, as Savery had, a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder, providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam, and disposing of the water once it had been condensed. The power piston was hung by chains from the end of a <b>rocking</b> <b>beam.</b> Unlike Savery's device, pumping was entirely mechanical, the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the <b>rocking</b> <b>beam.</b> The rod descended the mine shaft by gravity and drove a force pump, or pole pump (or most often a gang of two) inside the mineshaft. The suction stroke of the pump was only for the length of the upward (priming) stroke, there consequently was no longer the 30-foot restriction of a vacuum pump and water could be forced up a column from far greater depths. The boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe. Making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer; Newcomen's trade as an [...] "ironmonger" [...] or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the next}} six years, he {{made a number of}} other {{improvements}} and modifications to the steam engine. A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on {{the two sides of the}} piston was one. He described methods for working the steam [...] "expansively" [...] (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected <b>rocking</b> <b>beam,</b> whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from [...] "running away" [...] were very important.

The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas Aqueducts and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome. Avoncliff Aqueduct was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas, between 1797 and 1801. The aqueduct consists of three arches and is 110 yd long with a central elliptical arch of 60 ft span with two side arches each semicircular and 34 ft across, all with V-jointed arch stones. The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry, and rock-faced blocks. The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times. The Dundas Aqueduct was built by the same team between 1797 and 1801 and completed in 1805. James McIlquham was appointed contractor. The aqueduct is 150 yd long with three arches built of Bath Stone, with Doric pilasters, and balustrades at each end. The central semicircular arch spans 64 ft; the two oval side arches span 20 ft.
