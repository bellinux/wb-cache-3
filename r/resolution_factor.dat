40|$|International audienceTo {{study the}} space charge {{distribution}} in the bulk of dielectric materials irradiated by an electron beam the Pulse Electro Acoustic (PEA) method has been selected. However this method offers a limited resolution and doesn’t allow the detection of injected charges when they are {{too close to the}} surface. Actually, it is difficult to separate the negative injected charges a few micrometers below the surface from positive induced surface charges. In this work, we focus our attention on the deconvolution process that is commonly used to recover the space charge distribution. The aim is to determine the more appropriate <b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> that appears in the treatment software. A link between the <b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> and the cutting frequency of the Gaussian filter that is introduced in the deconvolution process {{to get rid of the}} high frequency noise is established. Then, the relation between the spreading factor of the surface charge and the <b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> introduced in the calculation is analyzed. From experimental data it is shown that the choice of the <b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> can be of mayor importance in order to obtain an accurate space charge distribution especially at the interface...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two-object resolution {{from the}} viewpoint of model fitting theory. The studied experiment consists in counting events, for example, an electron hitting a pixel. It is stated that the precision and the accuracy with which the locations of the objects can be estimated will determine the attainable resolution. Two different approaches are followed. For both, the special case of Gaussian peaks is further investigated. The first approach leads to the maximally attainable precision. It is shown that this precision is determined by a certain factor, which {{is a function of the}} distance of the peaks, their widths and the number of counts. This factor will be called the <b>resolution</b> <b>factor.</b> The influence of each of the quantities involved is determined by the way they enter this factor. The second approach defines a probability of resolution, i. e., the probability that the Maximum Likelihood estimates of the locations will be distinct.

40|$|The {{definitions}} of the temperature resolution, the so-called resolution of DSC instruments given in literature are discussed [1]. A new definition of the resolution for DSC instruments is presented and outlined. The main characteristic introduced in this new definition is a minimum between two caloric events as a prerequisite of an existing resolution. Existing reference substances and possible candidates of test substances have been evaluated and there usefulness discussed [1, 2, 3]. The oligomer n-hexatriacontane is revealing an interesting phenomenon, namely a lambda transition {{which is in the}} peak temperature only 2 K lower than the melting temperature of 76 °C. The substance was selected as an ideal test substance for the quantification of the resolution of DSC instruments. The lambda transition is a second order process which may reach under certain conditions the saturation of the occurring molecular dislocation within a half width of 0. 2 K, and after saturation the heat flow rate drops sharply down [4]. Investigations concerning the main characteristics of n-hexatriacontane in respect to the temperatures of transition (lambda transition and melting), to the involved enthalpies, and to the <b>resolution</b> <b>factors</b> were performed as functions of the sample mass and the heating rate.

40|$|For this study, we {{used the}} macrocyclic {{antibiotic}} teicoplanin, a molecule consisting of an aglycone peptide "basket" with three attached carbohydrate (sugar) moieties. The sugar units were removed and the aglycone was purified. Two chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were prepared in a similar way, one with the native teicoplanin molecule {{and the other with}} the aglycone. Twenty-six compounds were evaluated on the two CSPs with seven RPLC mobile phases and two polar organic mobile phases. The compounds were 13 amino acids or structurally related compounds (including DOPA, folinic acid, etc.) and 13 other compounds (such as carnitine, bromacil, etc.). The chromatographic results are given as the retention, selectivity, and <b>resolution</b> <b>factors</b> along with the peak efficiency and the enantioselective free energy difference corresponding to the separation of the two enantiomers. The polarities of the two CSPs are similar. It is clearly established that the aglycone is responsible for the enantioseparation of amino acids. The difference in enantioselective free energy between the aglycone CSP and the teicoplanin CSP was between 0. 3 and 1 kcal/mol for amino acid enantioseparations. This produced <b>resolution</b> <b>factors</b> 2 - 5 times higher with the aglycone CSP. Four non amino acid compounds were separated only on the teicoplanin CSP. Six and five compounds were better separated on the teicoplanin and aglycone CSPs, respectively.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of temporal properties of the auditory system on speech recognition, either in noise or in both noise and reverberation, has been investigated. Temporal resolution parameters consisted of both the temporal <b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> (TRF) and the minimum detectable gap (MDG). TRFs were measured for probe-tone frequencies of 500, 1000, and 3000 Hz; MDGs were measured for octave-band noises centered at 500, 1000, and 3000 Hz and for a wideband noise. TRF and MDG proved to be rather independent parameters of temporal resolution. For both temporal-resolution parameters, there was considerable overlap between {{the performance of the}} normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{positional}} isomerism on chemical and photochemical degradations of the Imazamethabenz-methyl (IMBM), a pesticide of the imidazolinone family, has been studied.

The development of an effective HPLC method (<b>resolution</b> <b>factor</b> R = 1. 3) allows us to follow either the abiotic disappearance of the meta and para IMBM and the formation of their breakdown products. The abiotic degradation studies include the chemical hydrolysis, as well as the direct and the indirect photodecomposition. We used TiO 2, a well-known initiator of hydroxyl radicals, to highlight the role of. OH in the indirect photodegradation. This work confirms the different behaviours of positional isomers in the environment. Indeed the chemical or direct photochemical degradation is faster for the meta isomer than for the para. Whereas, concerning IMBM, there is not any prevalent influence of this type of isomerism on the indirect photochemical degradation.

The major merits of this measurement are that it is simple enough to be used clinically and that the results are, within certain limits, independent of presentation level.

To test our model we developed a new measurement protocol. This protocol was applied in measurements of 5 normal-hearing and 9 sensorineurally hearing-impaired listeners.
