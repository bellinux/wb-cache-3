40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} taxation of benefits, which {{shareholders and}} company leaders can enjoy from close corporations. The Government {{said in the}} government bill lead- ing to the amendments regarding taxation of benefits, {{that it should be}} the possibility alone to enjoy benefits that should be the reason to impose taxes on company lead- ers. The Swedish tax agency (Skatteverket) has agreed to that statement. In other words, it isn’t necessary that someone actually enjoys the company’s assets for pri- vate use, it is enough that they have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> of them in order to be taxed. The question that arises is how a benefit can be defined as something you can enjoy rather then something you actually enjoy. The objective of this thesis is to straighten out if there are legal grounds for imposing taxes on company leaders just because they have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> to the compa- ny’s assets, and in that case which those legal grounds are. Different courts have interpreted the law in different ways in a number of cases, which this thesis gives an account of. In summery, the conclusion {{is that there are a}} legal grounds for imposing these taxes on company leaders because of their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> to the company’s assets. The case law has interpreted the law and the gov- ernment bill, and from that interpretation developed a rule that declares that owners and leaders in close corporations shall be taxed based on their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> The reason for this is that the vision for the enactor is to reach neutrality between people who run and own companies and people who are employed in a regular way. The rule that assess company leaders in close corporations because of their right of disposals preventing people from letting their company pay their private cost of living. ...|$|E

Land is so valuable that man as social beings will defend their land with all kinds of efforts.

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the concept of}} women’s empowerment with a narrative and feminist approach. The empirical production consists of narrative interviews with two women from the village Kimunyu in the Northeastern part of Tanzania. Research questions are as follows: In what way do two Tanzanian women narratively construct themselves with reference to their participation in micro-credit groups? And how do these narratives relate to the conception of women’s empowerment? These questions are sought answered by means of both a vertical narrative analysis of each interview {{as well as a}} horizontal discussion taking reflections upon the conceptualization of empowerment into account. Where the former aims to treat each narrative on its own terms, the latter works towards identifying the possibilities and challenges of the women’s empowerment through micro-credit groups. The theoretical framework consists of methodological theory on narratives, theory concerned with language and identity (Stuart Hall) as well as feminist theories on women’s empowerment and its compliance with the concept of power. By analyzing the narratives it has been possible to uncover how empowerment emerges both individually {{in the form of an}} inner ‘sense of self’, in the power over assets as well as collectively as the women are engaging in their community. In this way empowerment can be traced both directly as <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal</b> over assets and indirectly by narratively challenging norms and discursively defined power structures. However, this agency is contextually bound as to why the importance of considering how power relations influence and constrain the informants is underlined. Women’s empowerment are therefore both difficult to define and to measure as to why we must be aware of the processual possibilities of empowerment, in order not to miss the transformations that do actually occur...|$|R

40|$|As {{the right}} to sell may exist either {{as a result of}} ownership, or by virtue of a power without or {{independent}} of ownership, it is sometimes a question whether words indicating a right to sell, contained in an instrument granting an estate, are intended to give a power, or are merely descriptive of the rights incident to the estate given. When property is devised without any designation of the estate given, and the devise is followed by words indicating that the devisee is to have the right of absolute disposal in fee, or to sell in fee, it has often been held that the words indicating an absolute power of disposal show that the devisee was intended by the testator to have an estate in fee, not a life estate with a testamentary power of appointing the reversion.

40|$|Since {{as early}} as the {{beginning}} of the 1980 s German labour law - especially the regulations related to protection against dismissal and fixed-term employment - has come under criticism as a possible cause of a lack of labour market flexibility. From an economic point of view mandatory labour law regulations provide for a redistribution <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> They improve the legal position of one group of people at the expense of another. This is why compensation issues are relevant in the case of changes of law (e. g. {{in the form of a}} deregulation of labour law). Taking as an example the regulations affecting job security, the paper first discusses whether and to what extent there is a cause for revisions in labour law. For this, results of theoretical analyses and empirical findings are collated. Starting out from the fact that in every legal system there must be assumed to be a permanent need for reform not least due to changes in basic conditions, there then follows a discussion as to what adjustment alternatives for companies would also be available (at least potentially) without substantial legal changes and what forms of public compensation could be considered in the case of substantial deregulation. Legal-economics analyses on a theoretical and empirical basis show that structural effects of job security (distribution of employment opportunities and unemployment risks) seem to be considerably more important than effects on the level of employment and unemployment. According to the international findings job security de jure correlates negatively with the mobility of labour. However, fluctuation at industry level and national level is associated for all those concerned with cost (e. g. frictions as a result of search and familiarisation) and return (e. g. new ideas and better allocation). More mobility as a result of reforms of job security in labour law would not only open up more entry possibilities to outsiders (unemployed and peripheral workers), but would also direct public interest away from maintaining existing employment and towards the creation of new employment. More freedom in terminating employment relationships would be realisable if, like with the Flexicurity concepts in Denmark and the Netherlands, there were acceptable exchange deals that guarantee a sufficient degree of social protection for the workers. It would nonetheless be possible to retain a certain level of job security de jure and the positive effects accompanying this (in particular on labour productivity), if the available scope for flexibility as regards wages and working time - in the end extended even further via opening clauses - were made use of more fully and - where this is insufficient - extended. A higher level of internal flexibility could then reduce the pressure towards more flexibility which is being increased by economic trends.

40|$|Despite the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) being {{enacted in}} 1980, {{it has not}} {{received}} a strong position in the documentary sale of commodities where English law is the chosen norm for the law applicable to contract. This is often claimed to be attributable to the uncertainty under the CISG which makes it unsuitable to govern contracts of commodities where price fluctuations and speculation call for a more strict legal environment. This study examines the compatibility of the CISG to such documentary sales by taking the passing of risk and loss as the perspective. Commodities are often transported and once a transport document fulfills certain statutory requirements, it gives its holder the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>disposal.</b> Taking this into account, the underlying goods may be sold during transit by selling the documents. This also allows the formation of trade strings where a buyer of the documents may act as an intermediate without the intention of taking the physical delivery of the goods. This presentation outlines the documentary sales of commodities and the contractual network that is commonly established {{for the performance of}} the sale. In this regard, the presentation establishes the time for the passing of risk under the CISG, the liability regime of the carrier of the goods, the expected insurance coverage for the goods, and the involvement of banks in financing the sale. The study establishes how the CISG should be interpreted as a convention and what value should be given to foreign judgments in the pursuit of uniformity under the convention. Thereafter the discussion moves on to the use of documents in the performance of the contractual obligations of the parties and the default rules of the CISG in relation to passing of risk and their suitability in documentary sales to establish when risk passes. The discussion then moves on to see what case law under CISG has held as the correct time for the risk to pass in sales that involve carriage of goods and what has let to that outcome. The rest of the discussion moves on to present the involvement of the carrier in the transport of commodities and the liability regime that is placed on him when using bills of lading. Following the carriers liability, the presentation outlines the use of marine insurance and the required coverage of such insurance in sales of goods under the CISG. The second to last chapter outlines the use of banks in financing the sales contract and its implications to the required performance of the parties. The suitability of the CISG in documentary sales it put to a test under both the convention itself and under the reported case law. The study finds that although the default rules of the convention do not fit the purposes of documentary sales, the case law has established the right outcome for the passing of risk. However, the implications drawn from the case law suggest that under the CISG, the decision-maker is faced with a duty to search for uniformity that might undermine the intention of the parties upon concluding the contract. In several reported cases under the CISG, the court has applied Incoterms as the applicable rules to the contract between the buyer and seller even if the parties did not expressly incorporate them, but merely referred to a term that is also defined in the Incoterms. The application of Incoterms as trade usage has further consequences in relation to the required insurance coverage, which might lead to {{a situation in which the}} documents that represent the goods do not correlate with the expectations of the buyer. The study concludes that although parties may achieve a desired outcome by express contract terms, the case law under the CISG has not evolved enough to make the convention certain enough to be a desired applicable law...|$|E
