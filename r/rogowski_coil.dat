It is given by, where A is the cross-sectional area of the coil N is the number of turns,The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> has a low sensitivity and is due to the absence of a high permeability magnetic core, that the current transformer can take advantage of. However, this can be compensated by adding more windings on the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> or using an integrator with a higher gain k. More windings increase the self-capacitance and self-inductance, and higher integrator gain means an amplifier with a large gain-bandwidth product. As always in engineering, trade-offs must be made depending on specific applications.|$|E

50|$|More recently, {{low-cost}} current sensors {{based on}} the principle of a <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> have been developed. These sensors share the principles of a <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil,</b> measuring the rate of change of current using a transformer with no magnetic core. The difference from the traditional <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> is that the sensor can be manufactured using a planar coil rather than a toroidal coil. In order to reject the influence of conductors outside the sensor's measurement region, these planar Rogowski current sensors use a concentric coil geometry instead of a toroidal geometry to limit the response to external fields. The main advantage of the planar Rogowski current sensor is that the coil winding precision that is a requirement for accuracy can be achieved using low-cost printed circuit board manufacturing.|$|E

The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> gives a voltage proportional to the rate of change of current in the primary cable, so more signal processing is needed before the sensed values can be displayed.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Rogowski (May 7, 1881 [...] - [...] March 10, 1947) was a German {{physicist}} who bridged the {{gap between}} theoretical physics and applied technology in numerous areas of electronics. The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> was named after him.|$|E
5000|$|For larger {{currents}} {{conventional current}} transformers require {{an increase of}} the number of secondary turns, {{in order to keep the}} output current constant. Therefore, a <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> for large current is smaller than an equivalent rating current transformer.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rogowski</b> <b>coils</b> {{are widely}} used as high pulsed current sensors in {{resistance}} welding applications. The operating conditions of the coils determine the requirements for their calibration. A new calibration system has been developed at National Research Council (NRC) Canada for calibrating current sensing coils and weld current monitors (WCMs) used in AC resistance welding. The calibration system, which includes a high-current source and a coaxial copper cage, has been evaluated at peak pulsed currents of up to 80 kA at 60 Hz. The expanded measurement uncertainties (k = 2) have been estimated {{to be less than}} 350 3 ̆bcA/A for magnitude.

50|$|A device {{similar to}} the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> was {{described}} by Arthur Prince Chattock of Bristol University in 1887. Chattock used it to measure magnetic fields rather than currents. The definitive description was given by Walter Rogowski and W. Steinhaus in 1912.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{it has no}} {{iron core}} to saturate, it is highly linear even when {{subjected}} to large currents, such as those used in electric power transmission, welding, or pulsed power applications. This linearity also enables a high-current <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> to be calibrated using much smaller reference currents.|$|E
50|$|Specially {{constructed}} wideband CTs {{are also}} used, usually with an oscilloscope, to measure high frequency waveforms or pulsed currents within pulsed power systems.

50|$|Since {{the use of}} {{the first}} current {{indicating}} instrument called galvanometer, metrology have been developed and presently there are different technologies available to measure electric current which includes the shunt resistor based on the Ohm’s Law, AC current measurements carried out by traditional current transformers and <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coils,</b> Magnetic-field based transducers and there are other emerging technologies like the magneto-resistance effect (MR) Transducers.|$|R
40|$|Halo {{currents}} (HCs), {{flowing through}} the plasma and the vacuum vessel during plasma disruptive events, induce severe mechanical stresses in the plasma facing components and in the vessel, and are a major concern for present and future fusion experiments like ITER. The new system of halo current sensors (HCS) designed for JET-EP (enhanced performance, EP) should help to evaluate HC density distribution, localization and rotation as well as toroidal and poloidal current asymmetries. The HCS system will include four identical mechanical structures each including eight <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coils</b> and two toroidal pick-up <b>coils.</b> The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coils</b> will measure directly the current flowing {{through some of the}} tiles of the upper dump plate. The toroidal field pick-up coils will estimate the total poloidal HC.

In the paper, the design and the manufacturing of the HCS system are presented in detail...|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{split-core}} {{current transformers}} {{do not require}} integrator circuits. The integrator is lossy, so the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> {{does not have a}} response down to DC; neither does a conventional current transformer (see Néel effect coils for DC). However, they can measure very slow changing currents with frequency components down to 1 Hz and less.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> is {{proportional}} to the derivative of the wire current. The output is often integrated so the output {{is proportional to the}} wire's current:In practice, an instrument will use a lossy integrator with a time constant much less than the lowest frequency of interest. The lossy integrator will reduce the effects of offset voltages and set the constant of integration to zero.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the voltage}} that is induced in the coil is {{proportional}} to the rate of change (derivative) of current in the straight conductor, the output of the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> is usually connected to an electrical (or electronic) integrator circuit to provide an output signal that {{is proportional to}} the current. Single-chip signal processors with built-in analog to digital converters are often used for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|In the {{industrial}} world {{the quality of the}} electric power is becoming very critical. In order to verify this requirement, new measurement systems should be installed at various levels of the power network, capable to measure over a wide frequency range the current and voltage harmonics with a proper accuracy. When high voltage power systems are taken into account, this requirement is very difficult to achieve using traditional measurement devices, mainly due to the bandwidth limitations of this kind of transducers. For this reason in the last years several research activity have been especially focused on the study and the development of new measurement systems for high-voltage networks. In particular, in this paper a current transformer based on <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coils</b> for high voltage systems is presented, fulfilling the features required for power quality analysis.

However inductive coupling devices are able to work on any AC at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, from 15 up to 2000 Amps.|$|E
50|$|If {{the burden}} {{resistance}} {{is much less}} than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that {{is proportional to the}} measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>coil</b> uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current.|$|E
50|$|A {{current clamp}} uses a current {{transformer}} with a split core {{that can be}} easily wrapped around a conductor in a circuit.
