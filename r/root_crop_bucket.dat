It was further noted that organized data for use in a classification of the tillage requirements of different soils for the various <b>root</b> <b>crops</b> is lacking.

40|$|Persistent {{population}} pressure on agricultural {{land in the}} tropics {{has led to the}} evolution of food production strategies heavily weighted towards increasing productivity per unit of land. In many of these same areas, tropical <b>root</b> <b>crops</b> represent a major item in the national food economies. Given this scenario, this paper examines the potential role of tropical <b>root</b> <b>crops</b> in meeting domestic food needs. First, the present contribution of <b>root</b> <b>crops</b> to food production is briefly summarised and used to provide simple guidelines for allocating research resources. These guidelines are somewhat deficient in that they overlook a number of energetic considerations of importance at both the individual producer and national level. To illustrate, a two-goods model of a semi-subsistence agricultural production unit is constructed and some conclusions drawn which lend weight to the opinion that tropical <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> research should receive high priority...|$|R

The main criteria for meeting these demands are the digging quality and <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> impurities separation characteristics. The objective of research is the justification of design and kinematic parameters of cleaning tools. The paper provides description of the experimental unit and procedures for experimental research of the process of stripping the haulm residues from <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads. A histogram and polygon were plotted for probability density function of random variables of the length of leaf remnants on <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads. The differential law for a probability density function of length of leaf remnants after the stripping by cylindrical rollers was obtained. The approximate linear dependence was obtained as a regression equation, which describes a change in the length of leaf remnants on the <b>root</b> <b>crop</b> heads depending on the diameter and rotation speed of rollers. The aforementioned method and results obtained in experimental research can be used by specialists at design engineering bureaus for development of new or improvement of existing combined cleaning systems...|$|R

40|$|For many generations, taro, {{together}} with other <b>root</b> <b>crops,</b> {{has been a major}} component of the traditional cropping system in Tonga and is its most important staple.
