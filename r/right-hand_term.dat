30|$|When {{only the}} {{background}} noise is present, {{an estimate of}} its power is obtained using the <b>right-hand</b> <b>term</b> in (61). This expression holds even if {{the level of the}} background noise changes, so that {{there is no need for}} the estimation of this parameter during silences of the near-end talker. In case of double-talk, when the near-end speech is also present (assuming that it is uncorrelated with the background noise), the <b>right-hand</b> <b>term</b> in (61) still provides a power estimate of the near-end signal. Most importantly, this term depends only on the signals that are available within the AEC application, i.e., the microphone signal, d(n), and the output of the adaptive filter, y(n). Moreover, as it was demonstrated in [29], the estimation from (61) is also suitable for the under-modeling case, i.e., when the length of h(n) is smaller than the length of h(n), so that an under-modeling noise appears (i.e., the residual echo caused by the part of the echo path that is not modeled by the adaptive filter; it can be interpreted as an additional noise that corrupts the near-end signal).|$|E
