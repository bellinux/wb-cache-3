50|$|The anular {{ligament}} {{is attached}} by both its ends to the anterior and posterior {{margins of the}} radial notch of the ulna, together with which it forms the articular surface that surrounds {{the head and neck}} of the radius. The ligament is strong and well defined, yet its flexibility permits the slightly <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> of the radius to rotate freely during pronation and supination.|$|R
50|$|The mammee tree is 18 m - 21 m {{high and}} {{is similar in}} {{appearance}} to the southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Its trunk is short and reaches 1.9 m - 1.2 m in diameter.

50|$|Myrmica cadusa is {{a species}} of ant. Myrmica cadusa differs from similar ants in the genus Myrmica by the {{external}} shape of the antennal socket, which is jar shaped. They forage on the ground surface. Myrmica are unique from other types of ants in many ways. These are their <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> rounded clypeus, prominent frontal lobes and in most species, a strongly developed propodeal spine with two large nodes.|$|R
50|$|The work shows incisive use of chiaroscuro {{reminiscent}} of Verrocchio, in whose workshop Botticelli may have trained. The {{same type of}} child, with a large <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> and joyful lively expression, {{can be seen in}} Verrocchio's sculpture Putto con delfino from the same period. The figure of Mary is elongated and loosely posed, much more so than in the works of Filippo Lippi, another of the young Botticelli's models.|$|R
50|$|Zippy is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the British children's television programme Rainbow. Zippy is a brownish-orange puppet with a rugby-ball-shaped <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> {{blue eyes and}} a zip for a mouth, hence his name. His voice was first provided by Peter Hawkins and later by Roy Skelton. Violet Philpott and Ronnie Le Drew operated the character, the latter also providing the voice for the 1994 series and Rainbow Days.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{kneeling}} {{figure was}} probably carved by Maku, the master carver {{of the town}} of Erin, or by Toibo, his son. The elongated <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> set on a slightly curved neck, the stylized ears, and the incised lines across and below the half-closed eyes are characteristic of these carvers. The figure probably served as a receptacle for small gifts on a shrine altar, possibly dedicated to Shango, the god of thunder and lightning.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{pervasive}} Olmec figurine type features crouching figurines {{with thin}} bodies and over-large <b>oval</b> <b>heads</b> with small noses and receding chins. [...] Some researchers such as Miguel Covarrubias generally characterise these figurines as [...] "dwarfs". many others, also including Covarrubias, see evidence of [...] "what looks like pre-natal posture". In a 1999 article, Carolyn Tate and Gordon Bendersky analysed head-to-body ratios {{and concluded that}} these figurines are naturalistic sculptures of fetuses, and discuss the possibility of infanticide and infant sacrifice.|$|R

Synoicum clavatum is characterized by clubshaped colonies with <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> and elongate stalk, circular cloacal systems, a branchial sac with 14 - 16 stigmata rows of 10 - 17 stigmata per row and a stomach with smooth surface.

50|$|The {{proximal}} radioulnar joint {{is similarly}} derived in higher primates in {{the location and}} shape of the radial notch on the ulna; the primitive form being represented by New World monkeys, such as the howler monkey, and by fossil catarrhines, such as Aegyptopithecus. In these taxa, the <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> of the radius lies in front of the ulnar shaft so that the former overlaps the latter by half its width. With this forearm configuration, the ulna supports the radius and maximum stability is achieved when the forearm is fully pronated.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of racket designs, {{although}} the racket size and shape are limited by the Laws. Different rackets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> shape is still available, but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new rackets.Various companies have emerged but Yonex of Japan and Li-Ning of China are the dominant players in the market. Majority of top tournaments are sponsored by these companies. Every year a new technology is introduced by these companies but predominantly, all rackets are made of carbon graphite composite.|$|R
60|$|One of {{his last}} friendships was with Rusper, the ironmonger. Rusper took over Worthington's shop about three years after Mr. Polly opened. He was a tall, lean, nervous, convulsive man with an upturned, back-thrown, <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> who read {{newspapers}} and the Review of Reviews assiduously, had belonged to a Literary Society somewhere once, and had some defect of the palate that at first gave his lightest word a charm and interest for Mr. Polly. It caused a peculiar clicking sound, {{as though he had}} something between a giggle and a gas-meter at work in his neck.|$|R
50|$|Plants grow {{to around}} 20-30 cm, with 18-24 leaves {{arranged}} in three ranks. New leaves appear individually over {{time from the}} centre of the plant, flattening older leaves and pushing them outward in a spiral fashion. Each leaf is a rich green colour with irregular light green banding made up of amalgamated, slightly <b>raised</b> <b>oval</b> spots, and similarly light coloured fine serrations along each edge. In mature plants the outer, and thus oldest, leaves are 10-15 cm long and approximately 3-6 cm broad at the base. Depending on trauma, space, water availability or even old age, outer leaves will die off, turning golden brown and shriveling away.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternate}} {{leaves are}} bipinnate compound, 15-40 cm long and 17 cm broad with a 2-6 cm petiole bearing 4-15 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40-70 leaflets; the leaflets are slender oblong, 8-15 mm long by 2-4 mm wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, <b>raised,</b> <b>oval</b> gland. The leaves {{are confined to}} the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful {{enough to make it}} moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1-2 months during the dry season. Most foliage is shed in December, {{at the start of the}} dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April.|$|R

500|$|The Borg Queen was a {{challenge}} because {{she had to be}} unique among Borg but still retain human qualities; Westmore was conscious of avoiding comparisons to films like Alien. The final appearance involved pale gray skin and an elongated, <b>oval</b> <b>head,</b> with coils of wire rather than hair. Krige recalled the first day she had her makeup applied: [...] "I saw everyone cringing. I thought, great; they made this, and they've scared themselves!" [...] Frakes noted that the Queen ended up being alluring in a disturbing way, despite her evil behavior and appearance. Zimmerman, Everton and Westmore combined their efforts to design and create the Borgified sections of the Enterprise to build tension and to make the audience feel that [...] " [...] the Borg".|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Snow White, Kimball was {{promoted}} to a supervising or directing animator. He would remain in this position {{until his retirement in}} the 1970s. His employer Walt Disney was sufficiently satisfied with Kimball's work that he entrusted him with designing new character Jiminy Cricket. The character was intended for use in the Disney studio's next feature film, Pinocchio. It took Kimball 12 or 14 drafts before completing his final design of Jiminy. Kimball told one interviewer that he [...] "hated" [...] animating Jiminy Cricket: [...] "I got sick of drawing that <b>oval</b> <b>head</b> looking in every direction.") Kimball's next major task was designing the sympathetic Crows in Dumbo (1941). Following the example of the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White, Kimball had to give each crow a distinct appearance and character.|$|R
