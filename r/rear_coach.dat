25|$|On 26 November 1921, {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which was standing at platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble. The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to telescope with the <b>rear</b> <b>coach.</b> Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.|$|E
2500|$|The inaugural {{train was}} formed of a rake of eight carriages, formed (from the front) of three [...] "blood and custard" [...] liveried coaches, four green liveried coaches, {{and a special}} <b>rear</b> <b>coach.</b> This <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> was a {{restored}} LNER beavertail observation car. This train departed at 10.15 am from Quorn and Woodhouse station, and ran non-stop to Leicester North station, back to Loughborough, and then to Quorn. Five trains in all ran on this first day, with all special services being restricted to those involved with the Trust, with Tornado running around in a non-platform passing loop at Loughborough Central. On this day, 1,000–2,000 covenantors, donors and guests travelled on the service.|$|E
2500|$|Although Braniff {{had been}} one of the first U.S. {{operators}} of the British-built BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the British Aircraft Corporation twin jet), in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight loading door located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger Combi aircraft configuration if needed and Braniff did operate [...] "red eye" [...] overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> compartment of the jetliner.|$|E

50|$|On January 4, 2013, as the DLRR's No. 1 {{locomotive}} {{approached the}} Frontierland station with its train, a bolt snapped {{between the first}} and second coach. This caused the front coach to uncouple from the other four <b>coaches.</b> The three <b>rear</b> <b>coaches</b> struck the front coach when the engine stopped at the station and four people were injured.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the points}} behind the train (no. 145) {{had been set}} for the next departure, {{which was to be}} from Platform 10. The coaches for this service, the 19:00 Aberdonian to , were already in the platform. The {{signalman}} became aware of the 18:00 train rolling back and operated the points again in order to route it into unoccupied platform 15, but he was too late; the first bogie of the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> (BCK no. 1889) had already passed. This caused the two bogies to take different tracks. The rear of the train collided with the front of the coaches in platform 10. The <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> rose into the air and struck a signal gantry, crushing one of the two first-class compartments {{in the middle of the}} coach. Two passengers were killed, one of whom was Cecil Kimber, a former controller of the MG car company.|$|E

50|$|The boilers made {{direct contact}} {{and the impact}} caused an {{explosion}} heard up to five miles away. The sounds of crashing woodwork, hissing steam, and the victims' screams and moans succeeded the first deafening noise of the explosion. The three forward cars of the picnic train were decimated and the subsequent derailment caused a fire to spread among the wooden cars. The initial impact did not kill most of the victims; rather most were caught in derailed cars that were on their sides, burning. The {{women and children who}} occupied the <b>rear</b> <b>coaches,</b> thereby escaping serious injury, jumped out, screaming in a frenzy of fear and grief.|$|R
50|$|The express {{which was}} {{travelling}} at around 60‒65 mph, {{collided with the}} rear end of a local train which had just {{pulled away from the}} station, and was travelling at around 30‒35 mph. The <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> of the local train was wrecked in the collision and two more were overturned. One passenger in the local train was killed and 25 injured. The locomotive of the express overturned and the driver suffered severe shock.|$|E
50|$|On 11 January 1967 Locomotive No. 864 Zambesi at St Annes Bristol {{was light}} engine {{on the up}} line that {{came into contact with}} the {{destroyed}} <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> of an accident on the down line where the diverted 12:00 Paddington to Swansea had just collided with the rear of the 11:45 Paddington to Bristol. Only very minor damage was sustained by No. 864 which came into glancing contact with the splayed out body panels of the last coach of the Bristol train.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} trains involved. The {{first was the}} 7:10 am from Bangor to Belfast. This was a {{traditional}} passenger train consisting of 13 six-wheeled coaches, pulled by 4-6-4 steam locomotive Number 25. The coaches were of an old design with steel and oak undercarriages and light wood coachwork. The train had a seating capacity of 724 and was carrying about 600 passengers. The guard's van was the ninth coach on the train. This had side lights, but the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> of the train had only a single red light.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{station was}} opened in Bedford in 1857 on the Midland Railway's [...] to [...] line. The route {{chosen by the}} Midland took it across the earlier line at a point near the Bletchley end of the triangle, and a level {{crossing}} was built. In March 1875, a Midland passenger train collided with the <b>rear</b> <b>coaches</b> of a Bedford service, killing one passenger and injuring four others. The subsequent enquiry identified a badly-positioned Bedford starter signal as {{a major cause of}} the accident. To remedy the problem a 29-lever signal box was opened in 1877 to control new interlocked signals, and block signalling was introduced throughout the Bedford line, which had been extended to Cambridge.|$|R
5000|$|The British Rail (BR) Class 310 is a slam-door, {{alternating}} current (AC) electric multiple unit (EMU) introduced in 1963 {{as part of}} the West Coast Main Line electrification project. They were initially classified as Class AM10 units before the introduction of the TOPS classification system. Constructed at BR's Derby Carriage and Wagon Works. They consisted of four carriages - a second class driving trailer, a second class trailer, a second class motor car (with guard's/luggage compartment above which the Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph was mounted) and a composite (1st and 2nd class) driving trailer. The maximum speed was 75 miles per hour. A glass partition behind the driver's cab enabled passengers in the leading and <b>rear</b> <b>coaches</b> to have [...]|$|R
50|$|Tyler was {{appointed}} an Inspecting Officer for Railways in 1853 a function which is normally {{carried out by}} Royal Engineers officers, holding the position for 24 years. A typical investigation is reported in the press in 1858. Other important investigations included the Wooton bridge collapse and the Clayton Tunnel rail crash, both of which occurred in 1861. The former involved failure of cast iron beams supporting the track in a wooden bridge, through which a coal train fell, killing the driver and stoker instantly. The Clayton tunnel crash involved a collision in the tunnel and was the worst rail disaster at the time, killing 24 passengers in the <b>rear</b> <b>coaches.</b> He also reported on the Bull bridge accident when yet another cast iron girder failed suddenly as a train was passing over.|$|R
50|$|On 11 June 2009, a Class 142 (No. 142042) {{operated}} by Northern Rail derailed while {{en route from}} Blackpool to Liverpool. All {{but one of the}} 40 passengers on board escaped injury. An initial investigation was carried out by the UK Rail Accident Investigation Branch which determined that the engine mounted under the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> became detached and fell onto the track at a recorded speed of 57 mph, derailing the rear axle. The detachment of the engine caused extensive damage to underfloor equipment, severing control wires and damaging the braking system resulting in an automatic emergency brake application.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 November 1921, {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} Midland half of New Street station, when an express from Bristol crashed into the rear of a stationary train to Derby, which was standing at platform four and had been delayed due to engine trouble.

5000|$|The {{guard of}} the Aberdeen train {{said that he}} had looked out of the window of the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> at Longforgan as the train picked up speed. He saw the {{starting}} signal giving [...] "a poor off" [...] (in other words, somewhere between the [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] positions) but assumed that it had already been put back to Danger after the locomotive had passed it and perhaps had not quite returned to the horizontal position. It is not clear if the guard could have seen the starting signal exactly as the driver would have seen it. The subsequent public inquiry found that the guard was not to blame.|$|E
50|$|The {{heavy steel}} lead {{car of the}} 7:40 rode up over the {{underframe}} of the <b>rear</b> wooden <b>coach</b> and ploughed through the entirety of its coachwork and ten feet of the next car's coachwork as well.

50|$|Meanwhile, train No.11, {{an eight}} car mail express pulled by a Wootten-type engine, also {{travelling}} from Hoboken to Buffalo, departed Elmira at 5:00 a.m. For {{some reason the}} engineer, William Schroeder, ignored two signals, one at caution and one at danger and plowed {{into the back of}} No.9 at a speed of 60 mph. The <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> of No.9 was 'completely destroyed', the next one being of steel construction was less damaged only the 'vestibules and platforms on both ends were crushed', however it was 'stripped off its trucks and telescoped the third (wooden) car from the end through two-thirds of its length. All but two of the mail express cars were derailed and whiplashed, bringing down the telegraph poles {{on both sides of the}} track; meaning it was an hour before news of the disaster reached Corning. Meanwhile, hordes of spectators gathered hampering subsequent access by medical and rescue teams. A special relief train arrived from Elmira at 7 a.m. carrying doctors and nurses, but by 9 a.m. injured were still trapped in the wreckage.|$|E
5000|$|The airline was {{established}} by Continental and other regional shareholders in the former U.S. Trust Territory and started operations on May 16, 1968, as Air Micronesia, hence the nickname and callsign [...] "Air Mike". Service was started with a Boeing 727-100, number 475, which was nicknamed [...] "Ju-Ju," [...] and a Douglas DC-6. It also operated two Grumman SA-16/ HU-16 Albatross amphibians to fly from Chuuk (Truk) to Pohnpei (Ponape), until an airfield could be built that could accommodate the 727. The 727's underside was coated with teflon, due to it having to operate on coral runways. Additionally, the plane had to carry spare parts and a mechanic, as well as open-water survival gear and (beginning in 1975) onboard doppler radar, then a rarity. The airline also operated Boeing 727-100 Combi aircraft models which were capable of transporting freight pallets on the main deck of the jetliner just aft of the cockpit in addition to passengers seated in the <b>rear</b> <b>coach</b> compartment. [...] By 1983, Continental Micronesia was operating all-passenger Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 aircraft in addition to mixed passenger/freight 727-100 Combi aircraft from its Guam hub.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was very}} dark {{that night and}} the {{engineer}} of the express thought {{the lights on the}} rear car were from the stations lamps. Suddenly, his head light caught the rear car and he whistled for brakes, but they were primitive hand brakes and couldn't hold on the slippery track. The express managed to slow to 10 mph, but it wasn't enough as it slammed into the stopped local, telescoping the rear cars. The scene of the accident was horrific. The express train’s steam boiler burst and about a dozen people were either crushed to death by the boiler or scalded by the escaping hot water. [...] Some passengers that were trapped in the splintered <b>rear</b> <b>coaches</b> were burned alive as coal-oil lamps ignited the wreckage and 29 people died (some sources say 32), while several others were injured. Bystanders from the station and surviving passengers attempted to rescue trapped victims by tearing parts of the roof off the coaches, but their effort was unsuccessful as fire quickly engulfed the shattered timbers. After the accident some Bostonians accused the Eastern Railroad of deliberately murdering the passengers.|$|R
