30|$|Whilst {{there is}} yet to be {{consensus}} on the preferred terminology, two papers have attempted to provide working definitions [3, 4]. Lynch et al. [3] initially defined <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport as “one or two seasons in the sport of injury at the same level as prior to injury”. More recently a consensus statement described a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport continuum [4]. The continuum has three elements, the first being a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> participation, the second a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport and the third a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> performance. <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> participation may be a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> training or a level of sport that is lower that what the athlete desires. A <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport is designated as the athlete having <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> their pre-injury sport of choice but not performing at the desired level, whereas a <b>return</b> <b>to</b> performance signifies that the athlete is now performing at or above the preinjury level in their chosen sport. Empirical application of this theoretical continuum has however not yet been validated for <b>return</b> <b>to</b> sport after ACL reconstruction.|$|R

30|$|Only {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the consequences of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> work for the pre-disability employer versus <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> work for a new employer.

For example, Campolieti (2004) found that workers who <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the pre-injury employer were more likely to receive accommodations than workers who <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> another employer. Campolieti and Krashinsy (2006) found that permanently impaired male workers who <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the pre-accident employer had significantly higher wages than workers who did not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the pre-injury employer.|$|R
