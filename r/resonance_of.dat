5|$|<b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate {{characters}} and costumes make appearances {{in a number}} of other Sega games. In 2010's , Vocaloid Kagamine Rin can obtain a Leanne outfit. Zephyr, Vashyron, and Leanne are the three characters representing <b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate in Project X Zone, a Namco-Capcom-Sega mega-crossover video game for the Nintendo 3DS. Zephyr and Leanne are a Pair Unit while Vashyron is a Solo Unit. Various enemies from <b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate also appear as enemy units. The trio returns in Project X Zone 2, this time with Zephyr and Vashyron being the Pair Unit and Leanne as the Solo Unit. Cardinal Garigliano also appears in the game as a non-playable character.|$|E
5|$|<b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) developed by tri-Ace {{and published by}} Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released in January 2010 in Japan and March 2010 in Western territories. In contrast to other RPGs of the time, the game uses a fast-paced strategic combat system revolving around different types of firearms and combination moves between the three playable characters.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's. These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E
5|$|<b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When {{atmospheric}} pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of rotating accelerator-mode islands (RAIs), performing quasiregular motion in rotational <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> order m> 1 {{of the standard}} map, is firmly established by an accurate numerical analysis of all the known data. It is found that many accelerator-mode islands for relatively small nonintegrability parameter K are RAIs visiting <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> different orders m≤ 3. For sufficiently large K, one finds also "pure" RAIs visiting only <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> the same order, m= 2 or m= 3. RAIs, even quite small ones, are shown to exhibit sufficient stickiness to produce an anomalous chaotic transport. The RAIs are basically different in nature from accelerator-mode islands in <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> the "forced" standard map which was extensively studied recently {{in the context of}} quantum accelerator modes.

5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Resonance</b> <b>of</b> Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E

50|$|A {{sound box}} or {{sounding}} box (sometimes written soundbox) {{is an open}} chamber {{in the body of}} a musical instrument which modifies the sound of the instrument, and helps transfer that sound to the surrounding air. Objects respond more strongly to vibrations at certain frequencies, known as resonances. The frequency and strength <b>of</b> the <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> the body of a musical instrument {{have a significant impact on}} the tone quality it produces. The air inside the chamber has its own resonances, and these interact with the <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> the body, altering the <b>resonances</b> <b>of</b> the instrument as a whole.

25|$|The moving-coil {{principle}} {{commonly used}} today in speakers was patented in 1924 by Chester W. Rice and Edward W. Kellogg. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters {{so that the}} fundamental <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> the moving system is below the frequency where the cone's radiation impedance becomes uniform. About this same period, Walter H. Schottky invented the first ribbon loudspeaker together with Dr. Erwin Gerlach.|$|E
25|$|Another hazard is the <b>resonance</b> <b>of</b> the {{magnetron}} tube itself. If {{the microwave}} is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form.
