Research study addressed literature extensively on the local and international scenes; looking at cooperative case studies of India, California, United Kingdom, Ghana, Bangladesh and South Africa. The researcher used a qualitative research methodology using structured and semi structured questionnaires that were distributed to thirty identified cooperatives in Walmer Location and external stakeholders supporting cooperatives.

40|$|Abstract This study {{attempted}} {{to find out}} the institutional viability of cooperatives in Northern Samar in terms of profitability liquidity and the variates affecting its viability. Thirty-three 33 <b>registered</b> primary <b>cooperatives</b> were the respondents. It adopted descriptive-evaluative research with multiple regression analysis in testing the relationship of the variables. Findings showed that 15 or 45 percent of the primary cooperatives were viable while 18 or 55 percent were not viable in terms of profitability. In terms of liquidity 28 or 85 percent were viable while 5 or 15 percent were non-viable. Results also revealed that the number of years of operation the number of employees and staff the rate of loan repayments and the amount of current authorized share capital significantly affected the viability of Cooperatives. Generally Cooperatives in Northern Samar are less profitable however majority of them are liquid which implies that the services are continuously rendered to the members. Specifically the finding suggests that the absence of participatory and collaborative management efforts of the members and the officials adversely affect the organizational financial viability.

30|$|Cooperatives {{did not get}} {{any policy}} {{attention}} by EPRDF, the incumbent government, between 1991 and 1993 who {{came to power in}} 1991. Since 1994, the government has made efforts to promote a new generation of cooperatives that differ from their predecessors and issued a new cooperative proclamation in 1994 (Proclamation No. 85 / 1994) which incorporated universally accepted principles of cooperatives. According to this proclamation, cooperatives are independent entities organized to promote common socioeconomic interests of their members (FDRE 1994). The Federal Cooperative Commission (FCC), later named as the Federal Cooperatives Agency (FCA), was established to manage the proper implementation of cooperatives’ legislation and to devise policies and legal measures consistent with international conventions on cooperatives (Bernard et al. 2010). The efforts of FCA have resulted in considerable growth in both the number of agricultural cooperatives and the services they provide to their members (Abate et al. 2014). In 2012, there were 43, 256 <b>registered</b> primary <b>cooperatives</b> (agricultural cooperatives accounts for 26.5 % of them) with 6.5 million members (of which 21.5 % are female) (Bernard et al. 2013).
