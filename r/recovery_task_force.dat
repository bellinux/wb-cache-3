40|$|Eighty-five of 99 Iowa {{counties}} were declared Presidential Disaster Areas for Public Assistance and/orIndividual Assistance as {{a result}} of the tornadoes, storms, and floods over the incident period May 25 through August 13, 2008. Response dominated the state’s attention for weeks, with a transition to recovery as the local situations warranted. The widespread damage and severity of the impact on Iowans and their communities required a statewide effort to continue moving forward despite being surrounded by adversity. By all accounts, it will require years for the state to recover from these disasters. With an eye toward the future, recovery is underway across Iowa. As part of the Rebuild Iowa efforts, the Long Term <b>Recovery</b> Planning <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> was charged with responsibilities somewhat different from other topical <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> assignments. Rather than assess damage and report on how the state might address immediate needs, the Long Term <b>Recovery</b> Planning <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> is directed to discuss and discern the best approach to the lengthy recovery process. Certainly, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor expect the task to be difficult; when planning around so many critical issues and overwhelming needs, it is challenging to think to the future, rather than to rise to the current day’s needs...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of {{a one-day}} {{symposium}} held 20 April 2009, {{sponsored by the}} UW-Madison?s La Follette School of Public Affairs, the Water Resources Institute and the Center for World Affairs and the Global Economy, with additional support from the Ira and Ineva Reilly Baldwin Wisconsin Idea Endowment. When record floods swept through the Midwest {{in the summer of}} 2008, some local government officials put out a call for extra sandbags as their primary response. Others dusted off incomplete and out-of-date floodplain maps or tried to reinstate municipal flood insurance that had expired. As the waters receded, it became clear that localities varied widely in their crisis preparation, response, and recovery practices. State agencies and legislators want to change that. They have turned to the University of Wisconsin System, looking for help and information on everything from hydrology to climate change and intergovernmental collaboration. Organized as part of a partnership with Wisconsin Emergency Management, the Wisconsin <b>Recovery</b> <b>Task</b> <b>Force,</b> the Special Committee on Emergency Management, the Wisconsin Counties Association and the Association of State Floodplain Managers, this April 20 symposium will serve as a forum where members of the academic community and emergency management professionals will combine their expertise and experience {{to address the needs of}} policy-makers and practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to observe the manner in which three local public interest organizations participated in a local, environmentallyoriented decision process. The study period began in December, 1978, with the passage of a revised solid waste ordinance (Ord. 78 - 102) for the City of Corvallis, OR. The main forum for public participation {{during the first year of}} the study centered around the Resource <b>Recovery</b> Advisory <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> (RRATF), established in December, 1978, to discuss solid waste issues and make recommendations to the Corvallis City Council. In December, 1979, the Corvallis City Council accepted the RRATF recommendations, which called for the creation of a new, pe manent advisory board (the Source-Separation Board); the development of a new ordinance, separate from the solid waste ordinance, to address source separation services; and the use of the RRATF Final Report as a guideline for City decisions. In November, 1980, Ord. 80 - 98 was passed by the City Council. This ordinance amended Ord. 78 - 102 to include the provision of source separation services by the existing solid waste franchise holder, Corvallis Disposal Co. (CDC) and marked the end of the study period. The study considers the issues addressed by RRATF, City staff, City Council, CDC, the public interest organizations and the Source Separation Board, and describes the techniques employed by the involved organizations to influence decisions regarding these issues. Although numerous influencing efforts were made, the study concludes that the most powerful tool for impacting solid waste decisions appears to be control of the flow of waste materials, rather than the use of a particular political technique. The study also documents the considerable influence held by paid City staff, when compared to Citizen Advisory Committees, elected officials, and the general public...|$|R
