5|$|The 24-inch Burrell Schmidt Telescope was {{originally}} built in 1939 by Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio and was housed at the Taylor Road facility. It is currently housed at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The telescope <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> its optics upgraded {{with a very}} wide field of view CCD array, {{which is much more}} sensitive than the photographic plates. It is the instrument used today by the Case astronomers.|$|E

5|$|Hergé first {{devised the}} idea of sending Tintin {{on a mission to}} the Moon while he was working on Prisoners of the Sun (1949). His {{decision}} to move into the field of science fiction might have been influenced by his friendly rivalry with his colleague Edgar P. Jacobs, who had <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> success with his own science fiction comic, The Secret of the Swordfish (1950–53). He decided {{that it would be a}} two-volume story arc, as had proved successful with his earlier arcs, The Secret of the Unicorn (1943) and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944), and The Seven Crystal Balls (1948) and Prisoners of the Sun. He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E

5|$|In 1381, Le Gris and Carrouges {{engaged in}} a very public {{argument}} over the domain of Arnou-le-Faucon. Carrouges had returned from the wars with a new bride, Marguerite de Thibouville, daughter of a controversial Norman squire who until <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> owned Arnou. Although the lands had been legally bought by Count Pierre in 1377 for 8,000 livres, Carrouges wanted them back {{as part of his}} dowry and took Count Pierre in court to return them. Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin the King to obtain royal approval for his purchase and consequently was furious with Carrouges. The eventual result was that Carrouges was isolated from the court and subjected to three years of legal struggles over land with Count Pierre, who denied him the purchase or inheritance of several estates. Le Gris was heavily involved in these legal disputes both as the Seigneur of Arnou-le-Faucon and as adviser to the Count. He thus became a target of Carrouges, who accused Le Gris of orchestrating the lawsuits against him.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{known as}} Cann Valley Road, the Victorian section was {{designated}} as a highway in 1960, and received the name Cann Valley Highway. The Monaro Highway name {{was applied to the}} road within Victoria in 1996. Within NSW, the highway was created in 1938 and designated as State Highway 19 within the Department of Main Roads. In 1958, It was named the Monaro Highway in both NSW and the ACT, though the same name had been in use by the Snowy Mountains Highway until 1955. The Monaro Highway has more <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> a grade-separated dual carriageway extension constructed within Canberra, as part of the Eastern Parkway construction project.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{difficulty}} with Bede's chronology {{on the date}} of Æthelburg's marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede's chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburg must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby's reasoning. Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that Æthelburg and Edwin were married before 625, but {{that she did not}} go to Northumbria until 625. If Kirby's arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus' consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd <b>recently</b> <b>had.</b> Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E
5|$|Mitzeee pleads {{guilty to}} {{stabbing}} Mercedes, as she doesn't {{remember what happened}} since Mercedes had knocked her unconscious. As a result, Riley and Mitzeee's relationship {{comes to an end}} and Riley and Mercedes get back together. Mitzeee is sentenced to seven years in prison for her actions, however when she notices Mercedes smiling at her as she is being sentenced, she realises her own innocence. Myra discovers that Mercedes had framed Mitzeee although doesn't tell anyone. Mitzeee goes insane in prison knowing that she is innocent and is transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mitzeee escapes from the psychiatric hospital where she confronts Mercedes and threatens her with a knife although leaves before Mercedes can call the police. Carl returns and attempts to persuade Riley not to marry Mercedes. Mercedes hears a conversation between Riley and Carl in which Riley admits that he does not love Mercedes and that he <b>recently</b> <b>had</b> sex with Mitzeee. Angered, Mercedes kidnaps Bobby in an attempt to punish Riley and lies to the police that Mitzeee has kidnapped him. Mercedes pays Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{to be part of the}} scam and look after Bobby in a secret flat. Mercedes sends a letter to Riley asking for £500,000 ransom money in exchange for Bobby. When dropping off the ransom money, Riley sees Mercedes and realises that she is behind the kidnap. Phoebe exposes Mercedes and tells Riley the truth. Mercedes takes Bobby to the rooftop of a building, threatening to throw herself and Bobby off. Mercedes eventually gives Bobby to Riley and she agrees to leave with the ransom money. They return to the McQueen household where Mercedes' involvement in the kidnap is revealed by Phoebe. Myra then exposes Mercedes for having stabbed herself and framed Mitzeee, and calls the police. Moments later, Riley is shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon). In prison, Mercedes shows further signs of mental illness, denying to herself that Riley has died. Mercedes is later taken to a psychiatric hospital. Doctor Browning pleads innocent in his trial. When Myra visits Mercedes, Mercedes appears distressed and asks Myra to help her. Myra contacts lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). At the trial, Jim suggests Riley was abusive towards Mercedes and stabbed her and forced her to frame Mitzeee. He also suggests that Lynsey knew of this so Riley killed her. Mercedes backs up the claims and tells the courtroom that Riley had threatened to kill her so she kidnapped Bobby to protect him from Riley. The jury give a not guilty verdict for both charges of perverting the course of justice and Mercedes is released. Myra tells Mercedes she can not come home as she needs to learn her lesson and instead tells her to move into Jacqui's old flat that has recently been flooded.|$|E
