They {{are marked by}} fine lines of growth and numerous exceedingly fine, closely spaced, spiral striations. The sutures are very slightly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is <b>very</b> <b>rounded.</b> The base of the shell is moderately long, well rounded and narrowly umbilicated. The aperture is broadly oval, effuse anteriorly. The posterior angle is obtuse;. The outer lip is thin. The inner lip is very oblique, slightly curved and revolute, not appressed to the base. It is provided with a very deep-seated feeble fold at its insertion. The parietal wall {{is covered with a}} thick callus, which renders the peritreme complete.|$|R

5000|$|The {{northern}} bastard codling {{is similar}} in general appearance to the rattails, with large eyes and an elongated, tapering body, but the northern bastard codling has a separate, <b>very</b> <b>rounded</b> caudal fin.

25|$|The thorax has ten narrow {{segments}} {{while the}} pygidium (the tail) {{is smooth and}} <b>very</b> <b>rounded.</b> It is isopygous - that is, the pygidium {{is about the same}} size as the cephalon. The pygidium completely lacks any visible trilobation. It is usually semicircular in shape but can be pointed in some species like B. niagarensis.|$|R
50|$|Cypraeidae have adult shells {{which are}} <b>very</b> <b>rounded,</b> {{almost like an}} egg; they do {{not look like a}} typical {{gastropod}} shell. In virtually all of the species in the family Cypraeidae, the shells are extremely smooth and shiny. This is because in the living animal, the shell is nearly always fully covered with the mantle.|$|R
