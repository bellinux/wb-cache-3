25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression</b> that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal. An example of hostile aggression would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An instrumental form of aggression would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between affective and predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|E

Chan, {{the author}} of [...] "Facebook and its Effects on Users' Empathic Social Skills and Life Satisfaction: A Double Edged Sword Effect", claims that the more time people spend on Facebook, the less {{satisfied}} they feel about their life. Self-presentational theory explains that people will consciously manage their self-image or identity related information in social contexts. According to Gina Chen, {{the author of}} Losing Face on Social Media: Threats to Positive Face Lead to an Indirect Effect on <b>Retaliatory</b> <b>Aggression</b> Through Negative Affect, when people are not accepted or are criticized online they feel emotional pain. This may lead {{to some form of}} online retaliation such as online bullying. Trudy Hui Hui Chua and Leanne Chang's article, [...] "Follow Me and Like My Beautiful Selfies: Singapore Teenage Girls' Engagement in Self-Presentation and Peer Comparison on Social Media" [...] states that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on social media to achieve a sense of beauty that is projected by their peers. These authors also discovered that teenage girls compare themselves to their peers on social media and present themselves in certain ways in effort to earn regard and acceptance, which can actually lead to problems with self-confidence and self-satisfaction.|$|E
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} collective narcissism—an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the in group's greatness—aiming to explain how feelings about an ingroup shape a tendency to aggress against outgroups. The results of 5 studies indicate that collective, but not individual, narcissism predicts intergroup aggressiveness. Collective narcissism is related to high private and low public collective self-esteem and low implicit group esteem. It predicts perceived threat from outgroups, unwillingness to forgive outgroups, preference for military aggression over and above social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and blind patriotism. The relationship between collective narcissism and aggressiveness is mediated by perceived threat from outgroups and perceived insult to the ingroup. In sum, {{the results indicate that}} collective narcissism is a form of high but ambivalent group esteem related to sensitivity to threats to the ingroup's image and <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression...</b>|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{researchers}} have consistently {{found that children}} who exhibit a hostile attribution bias (tendency to perceive others' intent as hostile, as opposed to benign) {{are more likely to}} engage in aggressive behaviors. More specifically, hostile attribution bias has been associated with reactive aggression, as opposed to proactive aggression, as well as victimization. Whereas proactive aggression is unprovoked and goal-driven, reactive aggression is an angry, retaliatory response to some sort of perceived provocation. Therefore, children who are victims of aggression may develop views of peers as hostile, leading them to be {{more likely to engage in}} <b>retaliatory,</b> or reactive, <b>aggression.</b>|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{examined}} {{the contribution of}} perceived racial/ethnic discrimination to disparities in problem behaviors among pre-adolescent Black, Latino, and White youth. MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from Healthy Passages, a three-community study of 5, 119 fifth-graders and their parents. Multivariate regressions were {{used to examine the}} relationships of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and race/ethnicity to problem behaviors (physical and non-physical <b>aggression,</b> <b>retaliatory</b> behaviors, and delinquency). We used values from these regressions to calculate the percentage of disparities in problem behaviors associated with the discrimination effect. ResultsIn multivariate models, perceived discrimination was associated with greater problem behaviors among Black and Latino youth. Compared to Whites, Blacks {{were significantly more likely to}} report problem behaviors, whereas Latinos were significantly less likely (a 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 reverse disparity 22 ̆ 0 ac?). When Blacks 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 and Latinos 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 discrimination experiences were set to zero, the adjusted disparity between Blacks and Whites was reduced by an estimated one-third to two-thirds; the reverse adjusted disparity favoring Latinos widened by about one-fifth to one-half. ConclusionsResults suggest that the elimination of discrimination could lead to considerable reductions in mental health issues, including problem behaviors, among Black and Latino youth.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{in order to}} assess the ability of 12 -year-old boys to discriminate between intentionality and mode of provocation. Intentionality of provocation was described as accidental versus intentional aggression. Mode of provocation was defined as physical versus verbal aggression. Thirty 12 -year-old boys served as Ss. The experimental group consisted of 15 boys referred to a mental health clinic. The control group consisted of 15 boys not identified as in need of pychological intervention. All the boys were read 12 stories varying in mode and intentionality of provocation. The S's task was to assess the Justifiableness of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression.</b> The results indicate that all the 12 -year-old boys were able to adequately discriminate between the modes of provocation. However, the experimental Ss did have significant difficulty in discriminating between accidental and intentional provocation. The implications for treatment were discussed. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between exclusion or rejection and aggression is already well documented, {{but there is}} still a debate about the mechanisms that underlie this effect. In two studies we focused on the propensity to react aggressively (readiness for aggression) on the bases of emotional, cognitive or self-enhancement (personality-immanent) processes. In both studies we first measured readiness for aggression and then ego-depleted participants. Next, in Study 1 we excluded participants (n = 96) using an online ball throwing game and measured displaced aggressive behavior - intensity and duration of an unpleasant noise administrated to a stranger. In Study 2 participants (n = 140) were rejected by a peer on the basis of an interview that they gave and then could retaliate by reducing peer's chance for getting a job. The results show that exclusion effect on displaced aggression was moderated by cognitive readiness for aggression, while rejection effect on <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression</b> was shaped by emotional and personality-immanent readiness for aggression as well as ego-depletion. The results were discussed in light of the strength model of self-control by Baumeister, Vohs, and Tice (2007) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT—We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} a socio-cultural variable known as the culture of honor would be uniquely predictive of school-violence indicators. Con-trolling for demographic characteristics associated in previous studies with violent crime among adults, we found that high-school students in culture-of-honor states {{were significantly more likely}} than high-school students in non-culture-of-honor states to report having brought a weapon to school in the past month. Using data aggregated over a 20 -year period, we also found that culture-of-honor states had {{more than twice as many}} school shootings per capita as non-culture-of-honor states. The data revealed impor-tant differences between school violence and general pat-terns of homicide and are consistent with the view that many acts of school violence reflect <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression</b> springing from intensely experienced social-identity threats. From the coordinated attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, to the one-man massacre at Virginia Tech, violence in schools has become a topic of increasing concern in recent years and has prompted a flurry of studies on possible precursors to gun-related aggression among youth. To date, most of these studies have utilized a focused, case-based approach, largely because of the low frequency of school shootings. This case-study approach has yielded valuable insights into certain commonalities among shooters (e. g., they tend to be interested in violent media, often have mood disorders or suicidal ideations, and are commonly the victims of taunting or rejection; Fei...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to examine {{aggression}} in romantic couples exposed to different power levels and different patterns of provocation. Participants in positions of high or low power were faced with one of four levels of provocation: Low, Decreasing, Increasing, and High. The amount of "bad juice" a participant was given to drink was used as the manipulation of provocation and the amount of "bad juice" a participant poured for his or her partner was used as the measure of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression.</b> Seventy-nine couples completed multiple trials of drinking and allotting this juice for their partners. A 2 (sex) x 2 (power) x 4 (provocation) x 5 (trial) repeated measures ANCOVA and follow up post-hoc analyses indicated that, overall, participants responded to the provocation condition they were in: participants who received high amounts of provocation retaliated with higher levels of aggression and participants in the low provocation condition responded with lower levels of aggression. Participants in the High Power group poured a larger mean number of ounces of bad juice than participants in the Low Power group; however, participants in the Low Power group poured a greater percentage of juice for their partners than participants in the High Power condition. Men and women displayed similar levels of aggressive behavior, though differences emerged in interaction effects. Implications of these and other findings, as well as methodological limitations and directions for future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|While persuasive {{evidence}} has accumulated {{over the past}} 15 years documenting an association between schizophrenia and violence, there are 3 unresolved issues. First, does a downward extension of this relationship exist at the nonclinical level with respect to schizotypal personality and aggression in children? Second, is aggression more as-sociated with impulsive reactive aggression or with more planned proactive aggression. Third and importantly, does peer victimization mediate the relationship between schizo-typy and aggression? A further aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to examine}} the utility of a new child self-report measure of schizotypal personality. These issues were exam-ined in a sample of 3804 schoolchildren assessed on schizo-typy using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Child (SPQ-C), reactive-proactive aggression, and peer victimiza-tion. A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the 3 -factor structure (cognitive-perceptual, interpersonal, and disorga-nized) of the SPQ-C. Schizotypy was positively associated with total aggression and reactive aggression but not with proactive aggression. Peer victimization was found to signif-icantly mediate the schizotypy-aggression relationship, ac-counting for 58. 9 % of the association. Results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that schizotypal fea-tures elicit victimization from other children, which in turn predisposes to reactive <b>retaliatory</b> <b>aggression.</b> Findings are to the authors ’ knowledge the first to document anymediator of the schizotypy-aggression relationship and have potential treatment implications for violence reduction in schizophre-nia-spectrum disorders. This study also provides initial evi-dence for the factorial and discriminant validity of a brief and simple measure of schizotypal personality in children as young as 8 years...|$|E
