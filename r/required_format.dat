25|$|When {{the patient}} visits a doctor, the latter spends {{time with the}} former {{discussing}} his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record {{the information about the}} patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then listens to the dictation and transcribes it into the <b>required</b> <b>format</b> for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.|$|E
2500|$|In large part, this {{calendar}} continued unchanged {{under the}} Roman Empire.

Constantine formally established the 7-day week by making Sunday an official holiday in 321. Consular dating became obsolete following the abandonment of appointing nonimperial consuls in 541. The Roman method of numbering the days of the month never became widespread in the Hellenized eastern provinces and was eventually abandoned by the Byzantine Empire in its calendar.|$|E

The list part is a literature review with relevant appendices attached. The second part is a research report incorporating the collection and analysis of data.

The literature review is to be submitted to the Clinical Psychology Review and the research report to the Journal of Family Psychology.

Results indicate the level of performance achievable and the requirements for hardware and software components of such system...|$|R

50|$|No {{matter what}} {{hardware}} and software are used, the basic principle involved is relatively simple. If a greatly enlarged image of a segment of a phonautograph tracing were projected as a horizontally-oriented undulating line {{on a sheet of}} graph paper, a numerical description of the line could be created by proceeding from one grid column to the next, counting the number of squares between the line and a straight horizontal reference line, and making a list of the numbers. Such a list is, in fact, a digital audio file of the simplest kind. If entered into a computer in the <b>required</b> <b>format</b> and with the required file header information, it can be played as sound. Naturally, a computer needs no projector or graph paper to convert a scanned phonautogram into a playable digital audio file by comparable procedures.|$|E

Host Katie Boyle then contacted Norway, the fifth jury due to vote, and the Norwegian spokesman clearly and confidently announced their votes as 5 to the United Kingdom, 4 to Italy, 3 to Switzerland, 2 to Denmark and 1 to Germany.
