Chdh+/+ and Chdh−/− mice produced comparable amounts of sperm; the impaired fertility was due to diminished sperm motility in the Chdh−/− males. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal mitochondrial morphology in Chdh−/− sperm. ATP content, total mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and inner mitochondrial membrane polarization were all significantly reduced in sperm from Chdh−/− animals. Mitochondrial changes were also detected in liver, kidney, heart, and testis tissues. We suggest that men who have SNPs in CHDH that decrease the activity of the CHDH enzyme could have decreased sperm motility and fertility. —Johnson, A. R., Craciunescu, C.

We investigated the role of IL- 1 and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) and its significance in the pathogenesis of LPS-arthritis. Production of IL- 1 beta peaked at 6 h (196. 7 +/- 89. 4 pg/joint) after injection of 10 ng of LPS, while IL- 1 Ra peaked at 9 h (34. 5 +/- 13. 4 ng/joint). The amount of IL- 1 Ra was 180 - 200 -fold molar excess of IL- 1, and {{a large amount of}} IL- 1 Ra was sustained for 1 week. Both IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 Ra were mainly produced by synovial exudate cells. Arthritis was reproduced by rabbit IL- 1 beta. LPS-induced leucocyte infiltration was inhibited 70 - 75 % by rabbit IL- 1 Ra. Loss of PG in LPS-arthritis was prevented by IL- 1 Ra and also by neutrophil elastase inhibitor, and superoxide dismutase. In leucopenic rabbits, injection of LPS induced neither production of IL- 1 beta nor loss of PG. Direct injection of inflammatory exudated cells in leucopenic rabbits <b>reproduced</b> <b>loss</b> of PG, and there was only a partial recovery by IL- 1 Ra. These results suggest that LPS-initiated IL- 1 acts as a key mediator in LPS-arthritis and that endogenous IL- 1 Ra may suppress a part of IL- 1 activity at the site, but its amount was too low for suppression of the produced IL- 1.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically {{the suppression}} of two-body losses when the on-site loss rate is larger than all other energy scales in a lattice. This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature 501, 521 - 525 (2013) ]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us {{to show that the}} loss suppression is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects. Accounting for these effects reduces the inferred molecule filling fraction by a factor of five.

Picornavirus-infected cells show changes in cell morphology and rearrangement of cytoplasmic membranes, which are a consequence of virus replication. We show here, by confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, that the changes in morphology of FMDV-infected cells involve changes in the distribution of microtubule and intermediate filament components during infection. Despite the continued presence of centrosomes in infected cells, there is a loss of tethering of microtubules to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) region. Loss of labeling for γ-tubulin, but not pericentrin, from the MTOC suggests a targeting of γ-tubulin (or associated proteins) rather than a total breakdown in MTOC structure. The identity of the FMDV protein(s) responsible was determined by the expression of individual viral nonstructural proteins and their precursors in uninfected cells.

As a result a spectral break is to be expected at a photon energy of ∼ 1 GeV. This value does not depend on the surface magnetic field strength or on the period of the neutron star, but only involves a geometric factor. The predicted change of the spectral index by 1 explains in particular the spectral shape of PSR B 1706 – 44.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on atom loss in ultra-cold Fermi gases all show a maximum at {{a magnetic field}} below Feshbach resonance, where the s-wave scattering length is large (close to inter-particle distance) and positive. These experiments have been performed {{over a wide range}} of conditions, with temperatures and trap depths spanning over three decades. Different groups have come up with different explanations, among them the emergence of Stoner ferromagnetism. Here, we show that this maximum is a consequence of two major steps. The first is the establishment of a population of shallow dimers, which is the combined effect of dimer formation through three-body recombination, and the dissociation of shallow dimers back to atoms through collisions. The dissociation process will be temperature dependent, and is affected by Pauli blocking at low temperatures. The second is the relaxation of shallow dimers into tightly bound dimers through atom-dimer and dimer-dimer collisions. We have constructed a simple set of rate equations describing these processes. Remarkably, even with only a few parameters, these equations <b>reproduce</b> the <b>loss</b> rate observed in all recent experiments, despite their widely different experimental conditions. Our studies show that the location of the maximum loss rate depends crucially on experimental parameters such as trap depth and temperature. These extrinsic characters show that this maximum is not a reliable probe {{of the nature of the}} underlying quantum states. The physics of our equations also explains some general trends found in current experiments...|$|R

In this system, we observed transient promoter activation only with LpHsfA 2. In contrast, both factors were able to activate mutant versions of the promoter with improved consensus Hsf-binding sites. Exclusive activation by LpHsfA 2 was also observed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) without other Hsfs and with a minimal Cyc 1 promoter fused to the Ha hsp 17. 6 G 1 heat stress cis-element. Furthermore, the same promoter mutations <b>reproduced</b> the <b>loss</b> of activation selectivity, as observed in sunflower embryos. The results of in vitro binding experiments rule out differential DNA binding of the two factors as the explanation for the observed differential activation capacity. We conclude that the specific sequence of this heat stress cis-element is crucial for Hsf promoter selectivity, and that this selectivity could involve preferential transcriptional activation following DNA binding. In sunflower embryos, we also observed synergistic transcriptional activation by co-expression of LpHsfA 1 and LpHsfA 2. Mutational analyses of the Ha hsp 17. 6 G 1 promoter, combined with in vitro binding assays, suggest that mixed oligomers of the two factors {{may be involved in}} promoter activation.

40|$|The {{formation}} of multicellular tissues during development {{is governed by}} mechanical forces that drive cell shape and tissue architecture. Protein complexes at sites of adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell neighbors, not only transmit these mechanical forces, but also allow cells to respond to changes in force by inducing biochemical feedback pathways. Such force-induced signaling processes are termed mechanotransduction. Vinculin is a central protein in mechanotransduction that in both integrin-mediated cell-ECM and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions mediates force-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and adhesion strengthening. Vinculin {{was found to be}} important for the integrity and remodeling of epithelial tissues in cell culture models and could therefore be expected to be of broad importance in epithelial morphogenesis in vivo. Besides a function in mouse heart development, however, the importance of vinculin in morphogenesis of other vertebrate tissues has remained unclear. To investigate this further, we knocked out vinculin functioning in zebrafish, which contain two fully functional isoforms designated as vinculin A and vinculin B that both show high sequence conservation with higher vertebrates. Using TALEN and CRISPR-Cas gene editing technology we generated vinculin-deficient zebrafish. While single vinculin A mutants are viable and able to <b>reproduce,</b> additional <b>loss</b> of zygotic vinculin B was lethal after embryonic stages. Remarkably, vinculin-deficient embryos do not show major developmental defects, apart from mild pericardial edemas.

Thallus density showed slight but significant seasonal variation; it was highest {{at the end of}} the hot season and lowest {{at the end of the}} cold season. Mean thallus and lateral lengths peaked in the second half of the cold season. Initiation of new laterals was highest in the first half of the cold season. High lateral densities suppressed new lateral initiation. In the first month after initiation, laterals grew out to the same length as those formed earlier in the year. Thus, elongation rates of young laterals were highest during the period of maximum canopy height. In older laterals, growth rates decreased with length, due to increased tissue loss. Growth rates were independent of reproductive status.

40|$|A {{computational}} framework for modelling damage-induced softening in fibre-reinforced materials is presented. The main {{aspect of this}} framework is the proposed non-local gradient-enhanced continuum damage formulation. At the material level, the elastic constitutive behavior is defined by a hyperelastic functional including a volumetric and an isochoric contribution. The isochoric contribution is subdivided into three contributions associated to three different phases i= 0, 1, 2. Phase 0 is represented by an incompressible neo-Hookean material, whereas phases 1 and 2 are represented by an exponential format that accounts for the stretching along two preferred anisotropy directions, i. e. two fibre families. Furthermore, a 1 -di-type damage function, is introduced to <b>reproduce</b> the <b>loss</b> of stiffness in each phase i. Following the ideas discussed in Dimitrijeciv and Hackl (2008) Waffenschmidt et al. (2014), and references cited therein, the model is built around the enhancement of the local free energy function by means of terms that contain the referential gradients of the non-local damage variables ϕ(symbol) i The inclusion of these terms ensures an implicit regularisation of the finite element implementation.

Methods 17 femoral shaft fractures at various levels in 16 children aged 2 – 15 years were treated by closed intramedullary Kirschner wiring under image intensifier control between May 2000 and October 2003. No external splint was used. Results Fracture union was achieved in 6 – 14 weeks. Non-weight bearing crutch walking was started 2 – 3 days after surgery. Full weight bearing started 6 – 14 weeks. Average operative time was 40 min (range 20 – 72 min). Wires were removed after 8 – 22 weeks. There were no infections, no limb length disparity. One child had pin track ulceration. A big child of 14 years had angulation of the fracture. Conclusion Intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures in children by stainless steel Kirschner wires is an effective method, which compares well with other studies. It is a simple procedure, which can be easily <b>reproduced.</b> Blood <b>loss</b> is minimal, and the operative time short. There is no need pre-bend the wires in a C or S curve. Stainless steel Kirschner wires are cheap, universally available, and can be manufactured locally. The cost of Image intensifiers is affordable in most of the cities of the developing countries. The hospital does not have to maintain a costly inventory. Provides early mobility, return to home and, school. Gives a predictable clinical pathway and reduces occupancy of hospital beds. The technique was successfully applied for internal fixation of other diaphyseal fractures in children and some selected diaphyseal fractures in adults. Based on my experience and a review of the literature, I recommend this technique as a modality for treatment of femoral shaft fractures in children aged 2 to 14 years. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of two-dimensional (2 D) magnetization processes in devices and electrical machines {{calls for the}} development of vector model for loss prediction. Starting from the Del Vecchio-Charap work [2], we developed a static model able to reproduce the 2 D evolution of magnetization in soft non-oriented steel sheets: the most interesting case for applications. The material is assimilated to an ensemble of biaxial grains, each associated with a hysteron having two orthogonal easy axes. In each of them, the field driven irreversible switch of magnetization between the easy directions (Barkhausen jump: BJ) is governed by the value of local coercive field (about ten times smaller than the anisotropy fields); the ensemble of all these BJs accounts for the domain wall displacement. After the BJ, the local magnetization is brought to its energy minimum by the antagonism between anisotropy and Zeeman energy, so determining the reversible magnetization component. Domain wall reversible processes (bending) are not considered, whereas the role of macroscopic and internal demagnetizing fields is accounted for. The system average magnetization is obtained after integrating the outputs of single hysterons, each weighted by probability density functions suitably characterizing the material properties (i. e. : grain orientations, coercive and anisotropy fields). We have been able to <b>reproduce</b> the <b>loss</b> vs. polarization W(Jp) evolution in several non-oriented materials, subjected to alternating and rotating fields. In particular, under circular induction, the W drop at high Jp was always found, without introducing “ad hoc” fitting functions. It is remarkable that the outlined approach can be extended to systems magnetized in dynamic conditions. [1]	C. Appino, C. Ragusa, and F.

40|$|We perform density {{functional}} theory calculations on {{a series}} of armchair and zigzag nanotubes of diameters less than 1 nm using the all-electron Full-Potential(-Linearised) -Augmented-Plane-Wave (FPLAPW) method. Emphasis is laid on the effects of curvature, the electron beam orientation and the inclusion of the core-hole on the carbon electron energy loss K-edge. The electron energy loss near-edge spectra of all the studied tubes show strong curvature effects compared to that of flat graphene. The curvature induced π-σ hybridisation is shown to have a more drastic effect on the electronic properties of zigzag tubes than on those of armchair tubes. We show that the core-hole effect must be accounted for in order to correctly <b>reproduce</b> electron energy <b>loss</b> measurements. We also find that, the energy loss near edge spectra of these carbon systems are dominantly dipole selected and that they can be expressed simply as a proportionality with the local momentum projected density of states, thus portraying the weak energy dependence of the transition matrix elements. Compared to graphite, the ELNES of carbon nanotubes show a reduced anisotropy. Comment: 25 pages, 15 figures, revtex 4 submitted for publication to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSwitch (SWI) /sucrose nonfermentable (SNF) is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved complex with ATPase function, {{capable of}} regulating nucleosome position to alter transcriptional programs within the cell. It {{is known that}} the SWI/SNF complex is responsible for regulation of many genes involved in cell cycle control and proliferation, and it has recently been implicated in cancer development. The ATPase action of SWI/SNF is conferred through either the brahma-related gene 1 (Brg 1) or brahma (Brm) subunit of the complex, and it is of central importance to the modification of nucleosome position. In this study, {{the role of the}} Brg 1 and Brm subunits were examined as they relate to chromatin structure and organization. Deletion of the Brg 1 ATPase results in dissolution of pericentromeric heterochromatin domains and a redistribution of histone modifications associated with these structures. This effect was highly specific to Brg 1 and is not <b>reproduced</b> by the <b>loss</b> of Brm or SNF 5 /BAF 47 /INI 1. Brg 1 deficiency is associated with the appearance of micronuclei and aberrant mitoses that are a by-product of dissociated chromatin structure. Thus, Brg 1 plays a critical role in maintaining chromatin structural integrity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} different types of kinetic models and to propose a set of kinetic parameters for simulating the heat treatment of woody biomass under temperatures representative of torrefaction conditions. The mass loss of three wood types, locust, spruce and eucalyptus, as well as their main components, cellulose, xylan, glucomannan and lignin, has been determined in a TGA at different isothermal temperatures between 210 and 290 °C for residence times of up to ten hours. These data were used to evaluate the kinetic parameters corresponding to various multi-step series reaction mechanisms proposed in the literature. A computational solution of the multi-step formulation was derived, which allows the exact conditions undergone by the sample to be used as input parameters. The inverse procedure takes into account simultaneously the different temperature levels for each species. A comprehensive table summarizes all results, among which the dimensionless residues, proposed as a guideline to choose the relevant mechanism complexity. Overall we find that 2 -step series reaction models provide acceptable accuracy for <b>reproducing</b> the mass <b>loss</b> from lignocellulosic biomass and their constituents under torrefaction conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost {{patients}} with unilateral vestibular loss exhibit a similar static and dynamic vestibular syndrome consisting of vestibulo-ocular, posturolocomotor, and perceptive deficits. This vestibular syndrome recovers {{more or less}} completely and more or less rapidly over time. One open question is whether recovery mechanisms differ according to vestibular pathology and/or patients. It is reported here (1) data from three different cat models of unilateral vestibular <b>loss</b> <b>reproducing</b> vestibular pathology with sudden (unilateral vestibular neurectomy [UVN] model), gradual (unilateral labyrinthectomy [UL] model), or reversible (tetrodotoxine [TTX]) model) loss of vestibular function, and (2) clinical observations in a population of unilateral vestibular loss patients suffering the same pathology (Meniere's disease). Animal models show that time courses and mechanisms of recovery depend {{on the type of}} vestibular deafferentation, and clinical findings show that Meniere's patients compensate their postural and perceptive deficits using different vicarious processes. Taken together, results point to a more complex picture of compensation after unilateral vestibular loss, which cannot be reduced either to a common recovery mechanism or to a single process identical for all individuals. These findings should guide physiotherapists in treatment and rehabilitation for vestibular deficits...|$|R
