5|$|Teaneck's {{location}} {{at the crossroads}} of river, <b>road,</b> <b>train</b> and other geographical features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries. After the American defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington, George Washington and the troops of the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey from the British Army, traveling through Teaneck and crossing the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing, which has since been turned into a state park and historic site commemorating the events of 1776 and of early colonial life. In 1965, Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools, after the Board of Education approved a plan to do so by a 7â€“2 vote on May13, 1964. Teaneck has a diverse population, with large Jewish and African American communities, and growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian residents.|$|E

25|$|After combining, the oats are {{transported to}} the {{farmyard}} using a grain truck, semi, or <b>road</b> <b>train,</b> where they are augered or conveyed into a bin for storage. Sometimes, when {{there is not enough}} bin space, they are augered into portable grain rings, or piled on the ground. Oats can be safely stored at 12-14% moisture; at higher moisture levels, they must be aerated or dried.|$|E

Large <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> are used in some areas of the state with 53 m <b>Road</b> <b>trains</b> being permitted on the Stuart Highway north of Port Augusta, while smaller <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> and B-Triple are permitted on many roads throughout the state to the north of Adelaide.|$|R

50|$|Triple (three-trailer) <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> {{operate in}} western New South Wales, western Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, {{with the last}} three states also {{allowing}} AB-quads (B double with two additional trailers coupled behind). In South Australia, <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> up to 53.5 m are only permitted on the Stuart Highway and Olympic Dam Highway in the Far North. Darwin is the only capital {{city in the world}} where triples and quads are allowed to within 1 km of the central business district (CBD).

Victoria had previously allowed double <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> to operate around Mildura for the vintage grape harvest.|$|R

He murdered six people and wounded nineteen others before being stopped by three of the passengers: Kevin Blum, Mark McEntee, and Mike O'Connor. Ferguson's trial was notable {{for a number of}} unusual developments, including his firing of his defense counsel and insisting on representing himself and questioning his own victims on the stand.|$|E
500|$|Rail {{transport}} in the Philippines only {{plays a role}} in transporting passengers within Metro Manila. The {{region is}} served by three rapid transit lines: LRT-1, and LRT-2 and MRT-3. In the past, railways served major parts of Luzon, and railroad services were available on the islands of Cebu and Negros. Railways were also used for agricultural purposes, especially in tobacco and sugar cane production. Rail freight transportation was almost non-existent [...] A few transportation systems are under development: DOST-MIRDC and UP are implementing pre-feasibility studies on Automated Guideway Transit. A so-called Hybrid Electric <b>Road</b> <b>Train</b> which is a long bi-articulated bus, was also being tested [...]|$|E
