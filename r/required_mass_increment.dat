40|$|Use of the nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug diclofenac (DF) {{is associated}} with serious idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Covalent binding of reactive intermediates of DF to proteins is considered to initiate the process leading to this severe side-effect. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the nature of covalent protein modifications by reactive metabolites of DF which result from bioactivation by cytochrome P 450. DF and its major monohydroxylated metabolites 4 ′-hydroxydiclofenac (4 ′-OH-DF) and 5 -hydroxydiclofenac (5 -OH-DF) were bioactivated using a highly active P 450 BM 3 mutant (CYP 102 A 1 M 11 H) in the presence of the model target protein human glutathione-S-transferase P 1 - 1 (hGST P 1 - 1). Protein-adducts were subsequently identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests of hGST P 1 - 1. In total, 10 different peptide adducts were observed which result from modifications of Cys- 47 and Cys- 14 of hGST P 1 - 1. The majority of the protein thiol modifications appeared to be derived from 5 -OH-DF, which produced seven different peptide adducts with <b>mass</b> <b>increments</b> of 289. 0, 309. 0, and 339. 0 Da. Remarkably, no peptide adducts were observed upon the bioactivation of 4 ′-OH-DF. Incubations of P 450 BM 3 with DF also showed the peptide adducts derived from 5 -OH-DF and peptide adducts that are not derived from quinone imine. A peptide adduct with a <b>mass</b> <b>increment</b> of 249. 0 Da most likely results from the o-imine methide formed by oxidative decarboxylation of DF. In addition, a peptide adduct was observed with a <b>mass</b> <b>increment</b> of 259. 0 Da, which corresponds to the substitution of one of the chlorine atoms of DF by protein thiol. A corresponding GSH-conjugate with a similar <b>mass</b> <b>increment</b> was only observed if incubations of DF with P 450 and GSH were supplemented by human GST P 1 - 1. The results of this study not only confirm the importance of 5 -OH-DF in covalent protein-binding but also suggest that the nature of protein adduction is not necessarily reflected by chemical conjugation with GSH. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Noncovalent adducts of ligand and protein dimer were similarly observed for oxidized glutathione and for two glutathione inhibitors, both incorporating substituted thiol structures.

Electronic databases were searched for relevant articles that met our predefined inclusion criteria. Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 4054 women were identified and included. Although Aln was more effective than Rlx in increasing bone mineral density (BMD), no statistical differences were observed in reducing the risk of neither vertebral fractures (P= 0. 45) nor nonvertebral fractures (P= 0. 87) up to two-year followup. Aln reduced the risk of vasomotor (P= 0. 006) but increased the risk of diarrhea compared to Rlx (P= 0. 01). Our subgroup analysis further indicated the difference between Aln and Rlx in fracture risk and was not materially altered by the administration pattern, the age.

40|$|Clavulanic acid, the therapeutically {{important}} inhibitor of beta-lactamases {{containing a}} nucleophilic serine residue at their active sites, inhibits Escherichia coli TEM- 2 beta-lactamase via a complex mechanism. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) studies {{revealed that a}} minimum of four different modified proteins are formed upon incubation of clavulanate with the TEM- 2 enzyme. These exhibit <b>mass</b> <b>increments</b> relative to the unmodified TEM- 2 beta-lactamase of 52, 70, 88, and 155 Da. Time course studies implied that no long-lived forms of clavulanate-inhibited TEM- 2 beta-lactamase retain the carbons of the oxazolidine ring of clavulanate. The absence of a 199 Da increment to unmodified TEM- 2 suggests rapid decarboxylation of clavulanate upon binding to the enzyme. Proteolytic digestions of purified forms of clavulanate inhibited TEM- 2 beta-lactamase followed by analyses using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ESIMS (HPLC-ESIMS) and chemical sequencing were used to provide positional information on the modifications to the enzyme. Increments of 70 and 80 Da increments were shown to be located in a peptide containing Ser- 70. A further 70 Da <b>mass</b> <b>increment,</b> assigned as a beta-linked acrylate, was localized to a peptide containing Ser- 130. A mechanistic scheme for the reaction of clavulanate with TEM- 2 beta-lactamase is proposed in which acylation at Ser- 70 and subsequent decarboxylation is followed either by cross-linking with Ser- 130 to form a vinyl ether or by reformation of unmodified enzyme via a Ser- 70 linked (hydrated) aldehyde.

Results {{for the first}} 4 years after treatment initiation at this study were first reported by Albaugh et al. [For. Sci. 44 (1998) 317]. The site is primarily nutrient limited and all measured stand parameters (height, basal area, leaf area index, live crown length, stem mass accumulation, current annual stem <b>mass</b> <b>increment)</b> were increased with fertilization throughout the study period. Irrigation effects were also positive for these parameters but the increases were much smaller than those found with fertilization.

40|$|Petrosaspongiolide M (PM) is an {{anti-inflammatory}} marine metabolite that {{displays a}} potent inhibitory activity toward group II and III secretory phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) enzymes. The {{details of the}} mechanism, {{which leads to a}} covalent adduct between PLA 2 and γ-hydroxybutenolide-containing molecules such as PM, are still a matter of debate. In this paper the covalent binding of PM to bee venom PLA 2 has been investigated by mass spectrometry and molecular modeling. The <b>mass</b> <b>increment</b> observed for the PM–PLA 2 adduct is consistent with the formation of a Schiff base by reaction of a PLA 2 amino group with the hemiacetal function (masked aldehyde) at the C- 25 atom of the PM γ-hydroxybutenolide ring. Proteolysis of the modified PLA 2 by the endoprotease LysC followed by HPLC MS analysis allowed us to establish that the PLA 2 α-amino terminal group of the Ile- 1 residue was the only covalent binding site for PM. The stoichiometry of the reaction between PM and PLA 2 was also monitored and results showed that even with excess inhibitor, the prevalent product is a 1 : 1 (inhibitor:enzyme) adduct, although a 2 : 1 adduct is present as a minor component. The 2 : 1 adduct was also characterized, which showed that the second site of reaction is located at the ε-amino group of the Lys- 85 residue. Similar results in terms of the reaction profile, <b>mass</b> <b>increments,</b> and location of the PLA 2 binding site were obtained for manoalide, a paradigm for irreversible PLA 2 inhibitors, which suggests that the present results may be considered of more general interest within the field of anti-inflammatory sesterterpenes that contain the γ-hydroxybutenolide pharmacophore. Finally, a 3 D model, constrained by the above experimental results, was obtained by docking the inhibitor molecule into the PLA 2 binding site through AFFINITY calculations. The model provides an interesting insight into the PM–PLA 2 inhibition process and may prove useful in the design of new anti-inflammatory agents that target PLA 2 secretory enzymes...|$|R

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis was performed recently, to obtain directly information on the molecular masses of the different subunits from HbGp in the oxy-form. This technique demonstrated structural similarity between HbGp and the widely studied hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris (HbLt). Indeed, two major isoforms (d(1) and d(2)) of identical proportions with masses of 16, 355 +/- 25 and 16, 428 +/- 24 Da, respectively, and two minor isoforms (d(3) and d(4)) with masses around 16. 6 kDa were detected for monomer d of HbGp. In the present work, the effects of anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic cethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) on the oligomeric structure of HbGp have been studied by MALDI-TOF-MS in order to evaluate the interaction between ionic surfactants and HbGp. The data obtained with this technique show an effective interaction of cationic surfactant CTAC with the two isoforms of monomer d, d(1) and d(2), both in the whole protein {{as well as in the}} pure isolated monomer. The results show that up to 10 molecules of CTAC are bound to each isoform of the monomer.
