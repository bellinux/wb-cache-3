The cabin pressure is provided by the conditioned air entering the cabin through the distribution ducts and controlled by modulating the amount of air exhausted from the cabin. During ground operations, a solenoid limits the pressure differential to 0.25 psi in order to ensure normal functioning of the door and emergency exit. The pressure differential at final cruising altitude will be maintained at 8.7 psi difference between pressure altitude and cabin altitude. A <b>rate</b> <b>controller</b> enables the crew to select the rate pressurization of the cabin within preset limits. The normal pressure relief valve will open at 8.9 psi differential pressure and the safety outflow valve will open at 9.2 psi differential pressure which is the maximum allowable differential pressure.Oxygen is contained in a pressurized bottle located in the dorsal fin of the aircraft. The use of oxygen is only required for emergency in case of depressurization of the cabin or contamination of the cabin air. Oxygen is always available for the crew and can be made available to the passengers manually or automatically. The oxygen storage cylinder has a capacity of 38 cubic feet and is stored at 1800 psi. An oxygen rupture disc will relieve oxygen pressure if the oxygen cylinder pressure reaches 2700 to 3000 psi. A green overboard indicator on the outside surface of the dorsal fin will be ruptured or missing to indicate that the rupture disc is not intact.|$|E

We focus on a novel class of Hose <b>Rate</b> <b>Controllers</b> (HRC), which aim at regulating the aggregate upload rate of each peer. This choice is motivated by the peculiar P 2 P-TV needs: video content is not elastic but it is subject to real-time constraints, so that the epidemic chunk exchange mechanism is much more bursty for P 2 P-TV than file sharing applications. Furthermore, the peer up-link (e. g., ADSL/Cable) is typically the shared bottleneck for flows in real scenarios. We compare two classes of aggregate rate control mechanisms: Delay Based (DB) less-than-best-effort mechanisms, which aim at tightly controlling the chunk transfer de-lay, and loss-based Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) <b>rate</b> <b>controllers,</b> which are designed to be more aggressive and can compete with other AIMD conges-tion controls, i. e., TCP.
