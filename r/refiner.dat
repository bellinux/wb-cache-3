5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania {{invented a}} {{drilling}} process to extract oil {{from deep within}} the earth. Drake's invention is credited with giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil <b>refiner</b> in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable <b>refiner</b> in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York <b>refiner,</b> Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>refined</b> topological {{string theory}} in the {{presence}} of orientifolds by counting second-quantized BPS states in M-theory. This leads us to propose a new integrality condition for both <b>refined</b> and unrefined topological strings when orientifolds are present. We define the SO(2 N) <b>refined</b> Chern-Simons theory which computes <b>refined</b> open string amplitudes for branes wrapping Seifert three-manifolds. We use the SO(2 N) <b>refined</b> Chern-Simons theory to compute new invariants of torus knots that generalize the Kauffman polynomials. At large N, the SO(2 N) <b>refined</b> Chern-Simons theory on the three-sphere is dual to <b>refined</b> topological strings on an orientifold of the resolved conifold, generalizing the Gopakumar-Sinha-Vafa duality. Finally, we use the (2, 0) theory to define and solve <b>refined</b> Chern-Simons theory for all ADE gauge groups...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of eucalyptus pulp fibers {{prior to and}} after low-consistency (LC) <b>refining</b> was studied using a state-of-the art laboratory <b>refining</b> device and advanced surface analysis techniques. It was found that LC <b>refining</b> could generate fines and fibrillation and change the surface chemical composition of fiber surfaces. Both of these two effects can facilitate the adsorption of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) by the combination of increased specific surface area, electrostatic forces, and hydrophobic interactions, thus compensating {{for the loss of}} optical properties resulting from LC <b>refining.</b> The mechanical hydraulic force generated by the high <b>refining</b> energy disturbed the FWA retention. Therefore, high <b>refining</b> energy could improve the adsorption of FWAs when they are added after <b>refining,</b> but for better performance, the <b>refining</b> energy should be controlled and lowered. In addition, small amounts of calcium salt added after <b>refining</b> can also ameliorate the adsorption of FWAs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the <b>refined</b> palm oil addition (20 %) on the fatty acid and sterol compositions of <b>refined</b> olive oil or <b>refined</b> soya bean oil and also to investigate the formation of total polar compounds and volatile compounds in these oil blends during fifty successive deep-frying sessions of potato fries at 180  °C. The blend of <b>refined</b> olive oil and <b>refined</b> palm oil exhibited a higher chemical stability during the frying process than that of <b>refined</b> soya bean oil and <b>refined</b> palm oil. Indeed, the total polar compounds and volatile compounds formed, especially 2, 4 -decadienal, were found to be relatively increased in the <b>refined</b> soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend reaching 36. 50 % and 46. 70 %, respectively, after fifty deep-frying sessions. Moreover, the degradation of linoleic acid and β-sitosterol was significantly (P <  0. 05) observed for the <b>refined</b> soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend. The results have proven that the proper blending of monounsaturated <b>refined</b> olive oil with <b>refined</b> palm oil increases its stability and hence improves the quality of such olive oil during frying process...|$|R

25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a <b>refiner,</b> which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the <b>refiner,</b> the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
