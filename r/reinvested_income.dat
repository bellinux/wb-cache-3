40|$|The study {{generated}} optimal farm {{plans in}} the dynamic decision environment of the farmers using a dynamic programming model for farms under Government irrigated agricultural program, Fadama farming. The model integrates technical and economic constraints with farmer's objectives. The optimal farm plan obtained gives a farm income of N 57, 402. 76 from 0. 45 hectares in the first year. This {{is expected to increase}} over time by 31. 06 percent in five years. The plan supports mixed cropping but with sole okro as the predominant enterprise. The cultivation of non-leafy vegetables like pepper and tomatoes will also increase farm income. As more capital is made available by <b>reinvesting</b> <b>income,</b> the hectarage cultivated to okro will increase, thereby increasing income. Land and family labour are constraining but the effect of the latter is ameliorated by hiring labour. The study concludes that fadama farming is profitable with potentials for growth if land is increased and capital is reinvested. This requires institutional support to assist farmers access groundwater on lands located away from perennial streams...|$|R

The region experiences high retrenchments, unemployment and poverty levels and the research sought to uncover the livelihoods strategies using a Sustainable Livelihood Framework as a tool. The study highlights the assets that assist harvesters survive {{as well as the}} challenges faced by the poor people in this region. It also demonstrates the value of natural resources to the poor. Unlike many rural areas in South Africa, thatching grass was harvested for commercial trade rather than subsistence use. Most harvesters were immigrants from neighbouring countries (73. 7 %) some of them had been employed or attempted to find employment on the gold mines. Some operated on full-time basis (44. 7 %) while others diversified their incomes to supplement the income obtained from harvesting (55. 2 %). Earnings were generally low, ranging from R 255 to R 5 917 per month (mean+SE=R 1 980 ± 112; n= 38). However, several were able to <b>reinvest</b> <b>incomes</b> into their livelihoods by, for example, purchasing a vehicle to transport their loads and, in one instance, employing people to work for them. Access to harvesting sites was a major problem for many harvesters due to conflict with some land owners. But some were able to access land particularly belonging to mines or farmers, drawing on their social connections they have established. Additional problems included crime, xenophobia and social divisions, long distances and lack of reliable markets...|$|R

40|$|Degree of Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the differences between Government Employees and Private Employees in allocating their assets in financial investment. This study is used primary data gathered from issuing questionnaires which is collected from 50 of Government Employees and 50 of Private sector Employees to compare the investment asset allocation of Government and Private employees. The finding of this study reveals that most of Government Employees are conservative investors and most of Private Employees are growth oriented investors. Conservative Government Employees are not willing to tolerate noticeable downside market fluctuations, and are willing to forego most all significant upside potential, relative to the markets. From analysis of Government Employees, main investment objectives of them are safety and generate income. They have no growth or aggressive objectives for investment. That's why they consider only retirement income and supplement them overall income. Main objectives of Private Employees are growth and aggressive income. They have growth or aggressive objectives for investment. They like to <b>reinvest</b> investment <b>income</b> and maximize them. Based on the time horizon analysis of the investment, Government Employees are willing to realize their investment with in maximum five years, meanwhile majority of Private sector Employees wish to have a maturity period between six to ten years...|$|R
40|$|Training {{programmes}} for start-ups to turn unemployment into self-employment measure {{effectiveness in}} terms of economic indicators (Michaelidis & Benus, 2010; Baumgarter & Caliendo, 2008). The social impact in relation to health, happiness and sustainability is often neglected. A study on the social impact of Job Yourself, a non-profit organization in Belgium that helps unemployed people towards self-employment, revealed that aspects of sustainability were included in their guiding process, but at a modest level (Molderez, et al, 2013). Coaches spent a lot of attention on the hardline of business, i. e. customers, accounting, price setting. Survival of the young start-up was more important than including goals in relation to sustainable development. This outcome urged for a follow-up: how can young entrepreneurs be trained for social entrepreneurship, what are the challenges and obstacles to start with a social enterprise. In order to do so a multiple case study was set up. Social entrepreneurs were {{selected on the basis of}} Alter’s (2003) framework. She defines social enterprises as hybrid organizations that combine social and business interests. Different from socially responsible businesses and corporations practicing social responsibility, social entrepreneurs are characterized by a mission motive, stakeholder accountability and <b>reinvesting</b> of their <b>income</b> in the organization. According to Dees (1989) they are self-sufficient, market oriented and based on fulfilling social goals. To be able to make comparisons and to disentangle challenges and obstacles, social enterprises were chosen at different stages of their life-cycle: start-ups, young and mature organizations. The data was collected through surveys and interviews. The results demonstrated that social entrepreneurs started their company because of a passion for social change. It took more than one year to actually start their business. Despite the emphasis on a social mission they did not want to communicate about it. They focused on social goals because it fitted within their own philosophy and not because of the economic benefits of their social mission. The social change they could create with their enterprise, triggered them to effectively start an enterprise. They were intrinsically motivated and not inspired by the concept of shared value. Entrepreneurs that were guided by Job Yourself were stimulated to communicate about sustainability and to work on the social cohesion. But, they lacked guidance on how to integrate sustainability aspects in their company. Often entrepreneurs perceived conflicts between economic, ecological and social interests. They did not receive guidance on how to balance these interests. Social entrepreneurs did not get enough support from the external environment. Their market share was modest and suppliers with the same mission were hard to find. This obstacle was difficult to overcome by training programmes because too often social companies operate within a niche. Starting and surviving as a social entrepreneur remained a lonely business. Because they work on their own, they could not spend a lot of time on networking. Relying on their inner circle became a dangerous vicious circle.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} European {{countries}} with high unemployment rates (Caliendo & Künn, 2010; Congregado, Golpe & Carmona, 2010; Michaelides & Benus, 2012; Christensen, Parsons & Fairbourne, 2009) the Belgian government supports active {{labour market policies}} to turn unemployment into self-employment. The preferred way of achieving this goal is rather by facilitating than organising these programs by themselves. The legal framework for this policy was published in 2007. It defined the so-called ‘activity co-operatives’, non-profit organisations supported {{by the government to}} help unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups towards self-employment. During a limited period of time unemployed individuals can test their business project without losing their benefit. One of these activity co-operatives is JobYourself, located in Brussels. Brussels is one of the regions in Belgium with the highest unemployment rate: 19 %, contrary to 8, 4 % for the country and a very high unemployment rate for youngsters, i. e. 36, 4 %. The aim of JobYourself is much broader than reducing the unemployment rate. Having a positive impact on Brussels, improving the quality of life, reducing social injustice and stimulating cooperation all belong to their social mission. Training programs for start-ups to turn unemployment into self-employment often measure effectiveness in terms of economic indicators (Michaelidis & Benus, 2012; Baumgarter & Caliendo, 2008; De Mel, McKenzie & Woodruff, 2013). This is also the case when the effectiveness of incubators, another type of instrument to support start-ups, is analysed (Mas-Verdu, Ribeiro-Soriano, Roig-Tierno, 2015; Aerts, Matthyssens & Vandenbempt, 2007; Albort-Morant & Oghazi, 2015). The social impact in relation to health, happiness and sustainability is often neglected, although business incubators have a lot of opportunities in boosting sustainable business development (Hernandez & Carrà, 2016). According to Albort-Morant and Ribeiro-Soriano there is still a lack of articles on business incubators and this is even more the case for incubators with a social mission. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the social impact of JobYourself. Drawing on an ecosystem perspective (Deog-Seong, Phillips, Park & Lee, 2016; Pilinkiene & Maciulis, 2014; Zacharakis, Shepherd & Coombs, 2003; Zahra & Nambisan, 2012; Tsvetkova & Gustafsson, 2012) the study wants to reveal that JobYourself is a small, but important node in the entire network of organisations with the aim to reduce unemployment, to improve the well-being of people they support and to contribute to the sustainable transition of the city they are working in. The study is built on quantitative and qualitative research. An online survey was set up to be able to measure the social impact of JobYourself. Almost 40 % of the population, i. e. unemployed people who were guided by JobYourself during maximum two years, responded. It became clear that their coaches spent a lot of attention on the hardline of business, i. e. customers, accounting, price setting. Lowest priority for start-ups was to employ other people; the main goal of their start-up was to employ themselves. Despite the modest income, they were very satisfied about their quality of life. During their guidance by JobYourself they saw a positive evolution in their happiness, optimism and satisfaction. The added value of JobYourself was the mix of shelter and share: keeping their unemployment benefit and at the same time getting individual coaching and having the opportunity to develop a project without external pressure. Survival of the young start-up, however, was more important than including goals in relation to sustainable development. This outcome urged for a second part of the research: how can young entrepreneurs be trained for social entrepreneurship and what are the challenges and obstacles for training programs to help unemployed people to start with a social enterprise. In order to do so a multiple case study was set up. Social entrepreneurs were selected on the basis of Alter’s (2003) framework. She defines social enterprises as hybrid organizations that combine social and business interests. Different from socially responsible businesses and corporations practicing social responsibility, social entrepreneurs are characterized by a mission motive, stakeholder accountability and <b>reinvesting</b> their <b>income</b> in the organization.

The data was collected through interviews. The results demonstrate that social entrepreneurs started their company because of a passion for social change. It took more than one year to actually start their business. Despite the emphasis on a social mission they did not want to communicate about it. They focused on social goals because it fitted within their own philosophy and not because of the economic benefits of their social mission. The social change they could create with their organisation, triggered them to effectively start an enterprise. They were intrinsically motivated and not inspired by the concept of shared value. JobYourself stimulated them to communicate about sustainability and to work on the social cohesion. But, they lacked guidance on how to integrate sustainability aspects in their company. Often, entrepreneurs perceived conflicts between economic, ecological and social interests. They did not receive guidance on how to balance these interests. Social entrepreneurs did not get enough support from the external environment. Their market share was modest and suppliers with the same mission were hard to find. This obstacle was difficult to overcome by training programmes because too often social companies operate within a niche. Starting and surviving as a social entrepreneur remained a lonely business. Because they work on their own, they could not spend a lot of time on networking. Relying on their inner circle became a dangerous vicious circle. Based on the results of the survey and the interviews, the paper aims to contribute to a holistic evaluation of the projects towards self-employment to enforce activity co-operatives such as JobYourself to incorporate sustainability criteria in their decision process and to focus more on sustainability as part of their coaching. In this way money from the government will be used to move towards more sustainability instead of only to reducing unemployment. In line with Bollingtoft (2012) the paper also wants to emphasise the importance of bottom-up initiatives among nascent entrepreneurs to exchange experiences in relation to sustainability.
