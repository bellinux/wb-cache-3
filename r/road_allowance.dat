5000|$|Between certain {{sections}} of a township run [...] "road allowances" [...] (but not all road allowances {{have had an}} actual road built on them). The road allowances add {{to the size of}} the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly 24 mi apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of 1+1/2 chain m surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are 1 chain m wide and run north-south between all sections; however, there are only three east-west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north-south <b>road</b> <b>allowance</b> every mile going west, and an east-west <b>road</b> <b>allowance</b> every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American Public Land Survey System, which leaves no extra space for roads.|$|E

50|$|In Saskatchewan {{there are}} both {{township}} and range roads. The {{numbers of the}} range roads help to establish {{the location of the}} roads as they exist with relation to the legal land description survey system. Range roads travel in a north and south direction between the meridians parallel to the latitudinal lines. Range roads indicate firstly the meridian number. In Saskatchewan roads near the Manitoba border would begin with 1 as they would be west of the prime or first meridian, then the range numbers would be west of the second and finally west of the 3rd meridian. There are no roads in Saskatchewan west of the fourth meridian as the fourth meridian line defines the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. The next two digits would be the range number which increments from east to west from a meridian line. The last range number shows how many miles within the range the road is located starting at the easternmost edge of the range and traveling west. As they mark a definite location such as a longitudes and latitudes, the naming convention is the same across Saskatchewan. Township and Range roads can be either gravel, highway, or municipal paved road. The Dominion Land Survey system designated a township <b>road</b> <b>allowance</b> every two miles apart south to north, and allowed for a range <b>road</b> <b>allowance</b> every mile apart east to west.|$|E
50|$|Early {{surveyors}} {{surveyed the}} prairies into township and range lines which were 6 miles apart. Townships which comprised 36 sections had surveyed road allowances through them. Sections themselves were one mile square, and had monuments generally {{placed at the}} north, northeast and east corners. The {{west side of the}} range <b>road</b> <b>allowance</b> (travel north and south) meets with the iron post set at the surveyed location, and {{the south side of the}} township road (road travels east and west) also meets up with the survey marker. Therefore, road allowances are always to the east and north of the markers.|$|E
25|$|Approximately half of {{the trail}} runs through public land.

50|$|All {{this will}} result in a mesh of cells {{nominally}} six miles (plus 3 or 6 chains for <b>road</b> <b>allowances)</b> on a side.
