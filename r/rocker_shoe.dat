40|$|Background: There is no {{consensus}} on the precise <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> outsole design that will optimally reduce plantar pressure in people with diabetes. This study aimed to understand how peak plantar pressure is influenced by systematically varying three design features which characterise a curved rocker shoe: apex angle, apex position and rocker angle. Methods: A total of 12 different <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> designs, spanning a range {{of each of the}} three design features, were tested in 24 people with diabetes and 24 healthy participants. Each subject also wore a flexible control shoe. Peak plantar pressure, in four anatomical regions, was recorded for each of the 13 shoes during walking at a controlled speed.

The efficacy of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> in unloading the forefoot pressure has been shown in walking. In running, however, the effect of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> on forefoot pressure is unknown. Eighteen healthy female runners participated in this study. In-shoe plantar pressures were recorded during running with the standard running <b>shoes</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes.</b> Shoe comfort was assessed after each shoe measurement. Peak pressure (PP), maximum mean pressure (MMP) and force-time integral (FTI) were determined for seven foot areas. The effects of shoes on the different outcome variables were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed model. Running with the <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> caused a significant reduction (p < 0. 001) in all pressure parameters in the central and lateral forefoot. FTI and MMP were also reduced by 11 % and 12 % in the medial forefoot while running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes.</b> Running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> resulted in a significant increase in all pressure parameters at the heel region (p < 0. 001). Running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> received a significant (p < 0. 01) lower comfort rate than running with standard running <b>shoes.</b> <b>Rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> might be beneficial for runners who are recovering from metatarsalgia or stress fractures of the forefoot region, as it reduces plantar pressure in the forefoot region.

40|$|Background: It is {{a routine}} {{practice}} to prescribe {{a combination of}} <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> and custom-made foot orthoses for patients with plantar fasciitis. Recently, {{there has been a}} debate on this practice, and {{studies have shown that the}} individual prescription of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> or custom-made foot orthoses is effective in treating plantar fasciitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the immediate therapeutic effects of individually prescribed <b>rocker</b> sole <b>shoes</b> and custom-made foot orthoses, and a combined prescription of them on plantar fasciitis. Methods: This was a cross-over study. Fifteen patients with unilateral plantar fasciitis were recruited; they were from both genders and aged between 40 and 65. Subjects performed walking trials which consisted of one 'unshod' condition and four 'shod' conditions while wearing baseline <b>shoes,</b> <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> baseline shoes with foot orthotics, and <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> with foot orthotics. The study outcome measures were the immediate heel pain intensity levels as reflected by visual analog scale pain ratings and the corresponding dynamic plantar pressure redistribution patterns as evaluated by a pressure insole system. Results: The results showed that a combination of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> and foot orthoses produced a significantly lower visual analog scale pain score (9. 7 mm) than <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> (30. 9 mm) and foot orthoses (29. 5 mm). With regard to baseline shoes, it also significantly reduced the greatest amount of medial heel peak pressure (- 33. 58 %) without overloading other plantar regions when compared to <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> (- 7. 99 %) and foot orthoses (- 28. 82 %). Discussion: The findings indicate that a combined prescription of <b>rocker</b> sole <b>shoes</b> and custom-made foot orthoses had greater immediate therapeutic effects compared to when each treatment had been individually prescribed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Relative {{rest and}} pain relief play an {{important}} role in the management of Achilles tendinopathy, and might be achieved by reducing the load on the Achilles tendon.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assessed the effects of the heel- to-toe rocker shoes on the motion of the forefoot and hindfoot. Materials and Methods: In this quasi-exprimental study, three-dimentional gait analysis was performed on 15 healthy volunteers girls with normal BMI and normal gait pattern, between 18 - 24 years old. A Vicon 470 system(Oxford Metrix, U. K.) consisting of 6 ultra-red cameras operating at 60 Hz and two kistler forceplate(A 9286) was used. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to statistical analysis. the motion of the forefoot and hindfoot compared between traditional shoes and heel- to-toe rocker shoes. Results: The statistical analysis using Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the hindfoot joint excursion while wearing rocker shoes in sagittal plane was significantly less than that while wearing traditional shoes(p= 0. 005) but in frontal plane increased(p= 0. 028) and no obvious <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> effect was found in the transverse plane(p= 0. 203).

40|$|Background and Aim: The {{effect of}} rocker soles on {{improvement}} of foot plantar pressure distribution is well documented. Rockers are commonly prescribed for diabetic patients with neuropathy {{in order to}} offloading the particular area of the foot sole thereby decreasing the chance of the foot ulcers. On the other hand, these patients may experience balance problems because of the somatosensory defects due to peripheral neuropathy. There is an evidence of postural destabilizing effect of rocker soles in healthy adults. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate the postural responses to the rocker sole in diabetic patients with neuropathy.   Materials and Methods: Seventeen diabetic patients with neuropathy participated in this study. Canvas shoes were modified by addition of toe only rocker soles made of EVA (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate). The motor control test was conducted by the use of Neurocom system to evaluate postural stability with and without rocker sole. The Center of force displacement, response latency and response strength were measured. Results: No significant difference was observed between the toe only rocker sole and without it in center of force displacement and response latency of the patients (P› 0. 05). The results also indicated {{a significant increase in the}} response strength of patients by the <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe,</b> only in medium perturbations (P‹ 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that the postural stability of diabetic patients with neuropathy in response to the toe only <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> is the same as the shoe without any rocker profiles. However, rocker shoes increase the need for generating active force during the automatic postural response of these patients which may indicate a training effect on diabetic patients with neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{a link between}} the loading of the Achilles tendon and the magnitude of the ankle internal plantar flexion moment during late stance of gait, which is clinically relevant in the management of Achilles tendinopathy. Some studies showed that rocker shoes can reduce the ankle internal plantar flexion moment. However, the existing evidence is not conclusive and focused on walking and scarce in running. Sixteen healthy runners participated in this study. Lower extremity kinetics, kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) signals of triceps surae and tibialis anterior were quantified for two types of shoes during running and walking. The peak ankle plantar flexion moment was reduced significantly in late stance of running (0. 27 Nm/kg; p < 0. 001) and walking (0. 24 Nm/kg; p < 0. 001) with the <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> compared to standard shoe. The ankle power generation and plantar flexion moment impulse were also reduced significantly when running and walking with the <b>rocker</b> <b>shoe</b> (p < 0. 001). No significant changes in the knee and hip moments were found in running and walking. A significant delay of the EMG peak, approximately 2 % (p < 0. 001), was present in the triceps surae when walking with rocker shoes. There were no significant changes in the EMG peak amplitude of triceps surae in running and walking. The peak amplitude of tibialis anterior was significantly increased (64. 7 mV, p < 0. 001) when walking with rocker shoes. The findings show that rocker shoes reduce the ankle plantar flexion moment during the late stance phase of running and walking in healthy people. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Load {{reduction}} {{is an important}} consideration in conservative management of tendon overuse injuries such as Achilles tendinopathy. Previous {{research has shown that}} the use of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> can reduce the positive ankle power and plantar flexion moment which might help in unloading the Achilles tendon. Despite this promising implication of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> the effects on hip and knee biomechanics remain unclear. Moreover, the effect of wearing <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> on different running strike types is unexplored. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate biomechanics of the ankle, knee and hip joints and the role of strike type on these outcomes. Design: Randomized cross-over study. Methods: In this study, 16 female endurance runners underwent three-dimensional gait analysis wearing <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> and standard shoes. We examined work, moments, and angles of the ankle, knee and hip during the stance phase of running. Results: In comparison with standard <b>shoes,</b> running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> significantly (p < 0. 001) reduced the positive (16 %), and negative (32 %) work at the ankle joint. Plantar flexion moment peak and impulse were also reduced by 11 % and 12 %, respectively. Reduction in these variables was almost two times larger for midfoot strikers than for rearfoot strikers. At the knee joint running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> significantly increased the positive work (14 %), extension moment peak (6 %), and extension moment impulse (12 %). Conclusions: These findings indicate that although running with <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> might lower mechanical load on the Achilles tendon, it could increase the risk of overuse injuries of the knee joint.

40|$|Background: Appropriate {{footwear}} {{for individuals}} with diabetes but no ulceration history could {{reduce the risk of}} first ulceration. However, individuals who deem themselves at low risk are unlikely to seek out bespoke footwear which is personalised. Therefore, our primary aim was to investigate whether group-optimised footwear designs, which could be prefabricated and delivered in a retail setting, could achieve appropriate pressure reduction, or whether footwear selection must be on a patient-by-patient basis. A second aim was to compare responses to footwear design between healthy participants and people with diabetes {{in order to understand the}} transferability of previous footwear research, performed in healthy populations. Methods: Plantar pressures were recorded from 102 individuals with diabetes, considered at low risk of ulceration. This cohort included 17 individuals with peripheral neuropathy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ankle-foot orthoses {{could be}} {{utilized}} both {{with and without}} shoes. While several {{studies have shown that}} ankle-foot orthoses improve gait abilities in hemiplegic patients, it remains unclear whether they should be used with shoes or without. OBJECTIVES: The study purpose was to compare the effect of standard <b>shoes</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> on functional mobility in post-stroke hemiplegic patients utilizing ankle-foot orthosis. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical study. METHODS: Thirty post-stroke hemiplegic patients participated in this study randomly assigned to two groups. Group I received standard shoes[*]+[*]ankle-foot orthosis and group II were provided with rocker shoes[*]+[*]ankle-foot orthosis. Their functional mobility and energy expenditure parameters including timed up and go, timed up stairs, timed down stairs, preferred walking speed, and oxygen (O 2) cost (mL/kg/m) were measured. RESULTS: In group I, no significant changes were seen in outcome measures after wearing standard shoes. While in group II, O 2 cost and timed up and go time significantly decreased, and preferred walking speed increased when patients wore <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes.</b> Also, {{there was a significant difference}} between <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> and standard shoes in improvement of timed up and go, preferred walking speed, and O 2 cost. CONCLUSION: When patients using ankle-foot orthosis wore <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> their functional mobility improved and oxygen cost diminished. Also, <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> was significantly more effective than standard shoes in improving functional mobility parameters. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that in post-stroke hemiplegic patients using ankle-foot orthosis, wearing <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> can lead to much more improved functional mobility and decreased energy expenditure compared to ankle-foot orthosis only. Thus, in stroke patients, the combination of ankle-foot orthosis-rocker shoes is recommended for both rehabilitation programs and ankle-foot orthosis efficacy investigations...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to assesse the effects of the heel- to-toe <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> on temporal-spatial and ankle joint moments in sagital and frontal plane. Materials and Methods: In this quasi-exprimental study, three-dimentional gait analysis was carried out on 20 healthy university female students with normal normal gait pattern selected by convenience sampling method. A Vicon 470 system(Oxford Metrix, U. K.) consisting of 6 cameras operating at 60 Hz and kistler forceplate (A 9286) was used. The paired samples T test was used to statistical analysis.

40|$|Rocker-soled shoes {{provide a}} {{way to reduce the}} {{possible}} concentration of stress, as well as change movement patterns, during gait. This study attempts to examine how plantar force and spatio-temporal variables are affected by two rocker designs, one with softer and one with denser sole materials, by comparing them with the barefoot condition and with flat-soled shoes. Eleven subjects' gait parameters during walking and jogging were recorded. Our results showed that compared with barefoot walking, plantar forces were higher for flat shoes while lower for both types of <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> the softer-material <b>rocker</b> being the lowest. The plantar force of flat shoes is greater than the vertical ground reaction force, while that of both <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> is much less, 13. 87 - 30. 55 % body weight. However, as locomotion speed increased to jogging, for all shoe types, except at the second peak plantar force of the denser sole material <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> plantar forces were greater than for bare feet. More interestingly, because the transmission of force was faster while jogging, greater plantar force was seen in the rocker-soled shoes with softer material than with denser material; results for higher-speed shock absorption in rocker-soled shoes with softer material were thus not as good. In general, the rolling phenomena along the bottom surface of the <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes,</b> as well as an increase in the duration of simultaneous curve rolling and ankle rotation, could contribute to the reduction of plantar force for both rocker designs. The possible mechanism is the conversion of vertical kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. To conclude, since plantar force is related to foot-ground interface and deceleration methods, rocker-design shoes could achieve desired plantar force reduction through certain rolling phenomena, shoe-sole stiffness levels, and locomotion speeds...|$|R

Findings: The relative midfoot index decreased in all groups from barefoot to running shoes and again to <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes</b> (p < 0. 001). The forefoot maximal force increased wearing shoes (p < 0. 001), but there was no difference between running and <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes.</b> Walking speed increased by 0. 06 m/s with footwear (p < 0. 001). Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal in running shoes but both deviated from healthy controls (total ankle replacement/ankle arthrodesis smaller RMI p = 0. 07 / 0. 017; increased forefoot maximal force p = 0. 757 / 0. 862; slower walking speed p < 0. 001). In <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes,</b> this ranking remained the same except the relative midfoot index merged to similar values. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis were inferior in both shoes.

The cla ims have since been a ltered based on a lawsuit that the company misrepresented the benefits of wearing the <b>rocker</b> soled <b>shoe.</b> As physical therapy students, we wanted to know if the benefits of the claims made by Sketchers would be adva ntageous to increase muscle activity during ambulation for our patients. The purpose of our study is to use EMG to determine whether or not the claims made by the shoe compa ny a re in fact true. It is our hypothesis that the use of Shape-up shoes will not increase muscle activity of the lower extremities in subjects vs. the use of self­ selected athletic shoes...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} metabolic energy cost and external mechanical work for step-to-step transitions after tibiotalar arthrodesis, {{and the effect}} of MBT <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes.</b> Methods: Oxygen uptake, forceplate and kinematic data were recorded in 18 controls and 15 patients while walking at a fixed speed of 1. 25 m/s in three walking conditions: barefoot, normal walking <b>shoes</b> and MBT <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes.</b> Metabolic energy cost, external mechanical work, and the roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex were analyzed. Findings: Tibiotalar arthrodesis leads to higher metabolic energy cost during walking. During step-to-step transitions positive work during push-off with the impaired ankle was decreased but negative work during collision was not affected. The roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex did not differ between groups and shoe conditions. However, both in patients and controls <b>rocker</b> bottom <b>shoes</b> did lead to decreased positive work at push-off and increased negative work at collision and consequently higher metabolic energy cost of walking. Interpretation: External mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is not different between patients and controls and could not account for the higher metabolic energy cost in patients. Apparently, patients adopt a different walking strategy that limits step-to-step transition cost but nevertheless induces a higher metabolic energy cost. Despite restricted ankle movement, patients retain a normal roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex. MBT shoes do not affect roll-over shape and appear to have a counterproductive effect on step-to-step transition cost and walking economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND More {{than three}} million persons are {{disabled}} by leprosy worldwide. The main complication of sensory nerve damage is neuropathic ulceration, particularly of the feet. In this review we explored interventions that can prevent and treat secondary damage to skin and limbs. OBJECTIVE To assess {{the effects of}} self-care, dressings and footwear in preventing and healing secondary damage to the skin in persons affected by leprosy. METHODS Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (April 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (from 2003 to April 2008), EMBASE (from 2005 to April 2008), CINAHL (1982 - 2006) and LILACS (1982 - April 2008) as well as online registers of ongoing trials (April 2008). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials involving anyone with leprosy and damage to peripheral nerves treated with any measures designed to prevent damage {{with the aim of}} healing existing ulcers and preventing development of new ulcers. Data collection and analysis: Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS Eight trials with a total of 557 participants were included. The quality of the trials was generally poor. The interventions and outcome measures were diverse. Although three studies that compared zinc tape to more traditional dressings found some benefit, none of these showed a statistically significant effect. One trial indicated that topical ketanserin had a better effect on wound healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste, RR was 6. 00 (95 % CI 1. 45 to 24. 75). We did not combine the results of the two studies that compared topical phenytoin to saline dressing, but both studies found statistically significant effects in favour of phenytoin for healing of ulcer (SMD - 2. 34; 95 % CI - 3. 30 to - 1. 39; and SMD - 0. 79; 95 % CI - 1. 20 to 0. 39). Canvas shoes were not much better than PVC-boots, and double <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> did not promote healing much more than below-knee plasters. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS One study suggested that topical ketanserin is more effective than clioquinol cream or zinc paste. Topical phenytoin (two studies) may be more effective than saline dressing regarding ulcer healing. For the other dressings the results were equivocal. Canvas shoes were a little better than PVC-boots, but not significantly, and the effect of double <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> compared to below-knee plasters was no different in promoting the healing of ulcers. No side effects were documented...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomised, {{clinical}} trial. Objective. To {{compare the}} effectiveness of rocker sole footwear to traditional flat sole footwear {{as part of the}} management for people with low back pain (LBP). Summary of Background Data. Over the past decade, persistent advertising has claimed that footwear constructed with a rocker sole will reduce LBP. However, there is no robust evidence to support these claims. Methods. 115 people with chronic LBP were randomised to wear a <b>rocker</b> sole <b>shoe</b> or a flat sole shoe for a minimum of two hours each day while standing and walking. Primary outcome was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). In addition, participants attended an exercise and education programme once a week for four weeks and wore their assigned shoes during these sessions. Participants were assessed without knowledge of group allocation pre-randomisation, and at six weeks, six months and one year (main outcome point). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Results. At 12 months, data from 44 / 58 (77 ?? 2 %) of the rocker sole group and 49 / 57 (84 ?? 5 %) of the flat sole group was available for analysis. In the rocker sole group, mean reduction in RMDQ was - 3. 1 (95 % C. I - 4. 5 to - 1. 6) and in the flat sole group - 4. 4 (95 % C. I - 5. 8 to - 3. 1) (a greater negative value represents a greater reduction in disability). At six months, more people wearing flat <b>shoes</b> compared to <b>rocker</b> <b>shoes</b> demonstrated a minimal clinically important improvement in disability (53. 2 % and 31. 1 % respectively, p = 0. 03). Between-group differences were not significant for RMDQ or any secondary outcomes (e. g. pain) at any time. People reporting pain when standing and walking at baseline (n = 59) reported a greater reduction in RMDQ at 12 months in the flat sole group (- 4. 4 (95 % C. I - 6. 0 to - 2. 8), n = 29)) than the rocker sole group (- 2. 0 (95 % C. I - 3. 6 to - 0. 4), n = 30)) (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. <b>Rocker</b> sole <b>shoes</b> appear to be no more beneficial than flat sole shoes in affecting disability and pain outcomes in people with CLBP. Flat shoes are more beneficial for LBP aggravated by standing or walking...|$|R
