40|$|The avian {{inner ear}} {{possesses}} a remarkable ability to regenerate sensory hair cells after ototoxic injury. Regenerated hair cells possess phenotypes and innervation {{that are similar}} to those found in the undamaged ear, but {{little is known about the}} signaling pathways that guide hair cell differentiation during the regenerative process. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors that specify the orientation of hair cell stereocilia bundles during regeneration. Using organ cultures of the chick utricle, we show that hair cells are properly oriented after having regenerated entirely in vitro and that orientation is not affected by surgical removal of the striolar <b>reversal</b> <b>zone.</b> These results suggest that the orientation of regenerating stereocilia is not guided by the release of a diffusible morphogen from the striolar <b>reversal</b> <b>zone</b> but is specified locally within the regenerating sensory organ. In order to determine the nature of the reorientation cues, we examined the expression patterns of the core planar cell polarity molecule Vangl 2 in the normal and regenerating utricle. We found that Vangl 2 is asymmetrically expressed on cells within the sensory epithelium and that this expression pattern is maintained after ototoxic injury and throughout regeneration. Notably, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase disrupted the orientation of regenerated hair cells. Both of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that noncanonical Wnt signaling guides hair cell orientation during regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Performance-limiting {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) instabilities on ASDEX Upgrade are discussed. In {{the conventional}} H-mode scenario, the main MHD performance limitation {{is found to}} be the neoclassical tearing mode (NTM). The onset beta of NTMs in ASDEX Upgrade scales with the poloidal ion gyroradius, in agreement with theoretical expectations. At higher beta values, NTMs occur in a more benign form, the frequently-interrupted-regime NTMs, which lead to a smaller confinement degradation than normal NTMs. Active control of NTMs by electron cyclotron current drive in the island has been demonstrated on ASDEX Upgrade. In advanced tokamak regimes with reversed shear, a variety of performance-limiting instabilities has been observed. The shear <b>reversal</b> <b>zone</b> can be unstable to double tearing modes or to infernal modes; both have been identified in ASDEX Upgrade. Due to the broad current profile in advanced tokamak discharges, the ideal external kink mode can be unstable at relatively low beta(N) {{less than or equal to}} 2; this is a main limitation to strongly reversed shear discharges with peaked pressure profiles. Finally, it is shown that fast-particle-driven modes such as fishbones can also have beneficial effects, such as providing stationary current profiles or triggering internal transport barriers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: Significant {{progress}} has been made in the field of mechanotransduction in bone cells. The increasing knowledge about the role of the osteocyte as the professional mechanosensor cell of bone, and the lacuno-canalicular porosity as the structure that mediates mechanosensing, might result in a new paradigm for understanding the bone formation response to mechanical loading, and the bone resorption response to disuse. Strain-derived flow of interstitial fluid through the lacuno-canalicular porosity seems to mechanically activate the osteocytes, as well as ensures transport of cell signaling molecules, nutrients, and waste products. This concept allows explanation of local bone gain and loss, as well as remodeling in response to fatigue damage, as processes supervised by mechanosensitive osteocytes. Recent findings: The osteogenic activity of bone cells in vitro have been quantitatively correlated with varying stress stimulations highlighting the importance of the rate of loading. Theoretically, a possible mechanism for the stress response by osteocytes is due to strain-amplification at the pericellular matrix. Hence, single cell studies on molecular responses of osteocytes are on their way. These findings contribute insight on local architectural alignment in bone during remodeling. Alignment seems to occur as a result of the osteocyte's sensing different canalicular flow patterns around cutting cone and <b>reversal</b> <b>zone</b> during loading, thus determining the bone's structure. Summary: Uncovering the cellular and mechanical basis of the osteocyte's response to loading represents a significant challenge to our understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and bone remodeling. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|We present {{detailed}} paleomagnetic {{and rock}} magnetic results of rock samples recovered during Leg 173. The Leg 173 cores display a multicomponent magnetization nature. Variations in magnetic properties correlate {{with changes in}} lithology that result from differences in the abundance and size of magnetic minerals. The combined investigation suggests that the magnetic properties of the "fresher" peridotite samples from Site 1070 are controlled mainly by titanomagnetite, with a strong Verwey transition {{in the vicinity of}} 110 K, and with field- and frequency-dependent susceptibility curves that resemble those of titanomagnetites. These results are in excellent agreement with thermomagnetic characteristics where titanomagnetites with Curie temperature ~ 580 °C were identified from the "fresher" peridotites. In contrast to the magnetic properties observed from the "fresher" peridotites, the low-temperature curves for the "altered" peridotites did not show any Verwey transition. Thermomagnetic analysis using the high-temperature vibrating sample magnetometer also failed to show evidence for titanomagnetites. The remanent magnetization is carried by a thermally unstable mineral that breaks down at ~ 420 °C, probably maghemite. The field- and frequency-dependent relationships are also directly opposite to those in the <b>reversal</b> <b>zone,</b> with no signs of titanomagnetite characteristics. Altogether, these rock magnetic data seem to be sensitive indicators of alteration and support the contention that maghemite is responsible for the magnetic signatures displayed in the altered peridotites of the upper section. The magnetic minerals of the basement rocks from Sites 1068, 1069, and 1070 are of variable particle size but fall within the pseudo-single-domain size range (0. 2 - 14 µm). The average natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity of recovered serpenitinized peridotite is typically on the order of 20 mA/m for samples from Site 1068, but ~ 120 mA/m for samples from Site 1070. The much stronger magnetization intensity of Site 1070 is apparently in excellent agreement with the observed magnetic anomaly high. Nearly half of the NRM intensity remained after 400 °C demagnetization, suggesting that the remanence can contribute significantly to the marine magnetic anomaly...|$|E

Reliable magnetostratigraphy from these six sites is presented in this paper. Sedimentary sections from Holes 897 C, 898 A, 900 A, 1067 A, 1068 A, and 1069 A have recorded a pattern of magnetic polarity reversals that correlates well with the known magnetic polarity timescale for the past 56 m. y. The polarity patterns from the Pliocene-Pleistocene turbidite sequence at the Leg 149 sites show that a reliable magnetostratigraphy can be established from the early Pliocene to Holocene, including the Gilbert/Gauss boundary (3. 58 m. y.) through the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary (0. 78 m. y.). On the basis of distinct intervals of magnetic <b>reversal</b> <b>zones</b> and biostratigraphic datums, five magnetozones (C 21 n-C 25 n) can be recognized at the three Leg 173 sites that range from middle Eocene to late Paleocene in age.

30|$|Pre-drill {{prediction}} of formation pore pressure from surface seismic survey {{is very important}} for drilling, production, and reservoir engineering because it affects drilling operations and well-planning processes. If it is not properly evaluated, it can lead to numerous drilling problems such as dangerous well kicks, lost circulation, blowouts, stuck pipe, excessive costs, and borehole instability. Pre-drill pore pressure estimation has been obtained from transform models using seismic interval velocities. However, the accuracy of this estimate of pore pressure {{is directly related to the}} reliability of these interval velocities. Bulk density was estimated from seismic interval velocity and transit time. Normal pore pressure gradient is estimated from the slope of a trendline that is generated from logarithm transit times versus depth. Overburden pressure at any depth was calculated from the integration of the average interval bulk densities and thicknesses above that depth. Pore pressure has been obtained from overburden pressure and observed interval velocities using modified Eaton’s equation. 154 CDPs were used along 28 seismic lines at Beni Suef basin, Western Desert, Egypt, to accomplish the purpose of this study. Two velocity <b>reversal</b> <b>zones</b> showing abnormally high pore pressure were detected and correlated to Abu Roash and Bahariya Formations. Moreover, pore pressure gradient maps were established for these two zones to predict the possible horizontal fluid flow (migration paths) for the proposal of prospects with lower pressures and less drilling risks.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. Here, we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near posthatch day P 7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining <b>reversal</b> <b>zones</b> forming at E 8. Less {{than half of all}} immature hair cells observed had nonpolarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E 6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E 8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E 10; however, no mature calyces were observed until E 12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only Type I hair cells did not develop until E 14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and Type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{pressure}} drop – flow relations in myocardial bridges and {{the assessment of}} vascular heart disease via fractional flow reserve (FFR) have motivated many researchers the last decades. The {{aim of this study}} is to simulate several clinical conditions present in myocardial bridges to determine the flow reserve and consequently the clinical relevance of the disease. From a fluid mechanical point of view the pathophysiological situation in myocardial bridges involves fluid flow in a time dependent flow geometry, caused by contracting cardiac muscles overlying an intramural segment of the coronary artery. These flows mostly involve flow separation and secondary motions, which are difficult to calculate and analyse. Methods Because a three dimensional simulation of the haemodynamic conditions in myocardial bridges in a network of coronary arteries is time-consuming, we present a boundary layer model for the calculation of the {{pressure drop}} and flow separation. The approach is based on the assumption that the flow can be sufficiently well described by the interaction of an inviscid core and a viscous boundary layer. Under the assumption that the idealised flow through a constriction is given by near-equilibrium velocity profiles of the Falkner-Skan-Cooke (FSC) family, the evolution of the boundary layer is obtained by the simultaneous solution of the Falkner-Skan equation and the transient von-Kármán integral momentum equation. Results The model was used to investigate the relative importance of several physical parameters present in myocardial bridges. Results have been obtained for steady and unsteady flow through vessels with 0 – 85 % diameter stenosis. We compare two clinical relevant cases of a myocardial bridge in the middle segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The pressure derived FFR of fixed and dynamic lesions has shown that the flow is less affected in the dynamic case, because the distal pressure partially recovers during re-opening of the vessel in diastole. We have further calculated the wall shear stress (WSS) distributions in addition to the location and length of the flow <b>reversal</b> <b>zones</b> in dependence on the severity of the disease. Conclusion The described boundary layer method can be used to simulate frictional forces and wall shear stresses in the entrance region of vessels. Earlier models are supplemented by the viscous effects in a quasi three-dimensional vessel geometry with a prescribed wall motion. The results indicate that the translesional pressure drop and the mean FFR compares favourably to clinical findings in the literature. We have further shown that the mean FFR under the assumption of Hagen-Poiseuille flow is overestimated in developing flow conditions. </p...|$|R

Four young male subjects were studied during each of two protocols, those being a simulated 12 -h time zone shift and a 6. 5 -h meal shift. During the baseline day, plasma leptin demonstrated a strong diurnal rhythm with an amplitude of 21 %, zenith at 2400 h, and nadir between 0900 and 1200 h. Acute sleep deprivation did not alter plasma leptin, but day/night <b>reversal</b> (time <b>zone</b> shift) caused a 12 +/- 2 h shift (P < 0. 01) in {{the timing of}} the zenith and nadir. When meals were shifted 6. 5 h without changing the light or sleep cycles, the plasma leptin rhythm was shifted by 5 - 7 h (P < 0. 01). The phase change occurred rapidly when compared with changes in the diurnal rhythm of cortisol, suggesting that leptin levels are not acutely entrained to the circadian clock. The leptin rhythm was altered by meal timing in a manner very similar to the rhythm of de novo cholesterol synthesis. We conclude that the diurnal rhythm of plasma leptin in young males is entrained to meal timing...|$|R

Two records from Holes 1063 A and 1063 B are very consistent, and provide the highest resolution of the detailed field behaviour during the IB excursion obtained so far. Inclination records from Holes 983 B and 983 C in the far North Atlantic are also very consistent, whereas declination anomalies deviate more notably. The pseudo-Thellier (PT) technique was applied along with more conventional palaeointensity proxies (NRM/ARM and NRM/kappa) to recover relative palaeointensity (RPI) estimates from Hole 1063 A and Hole 983 B. As expected, these proxies indicate that the field intensity generally dropped at both sites during the IB excursion, but also {{that the history of}} RPI from the two sites is different. VGPs from Site 1063 indicate that the field at this location experienced some stop-and-go behaviour between patches of intense vertical flux over North America and the tip of South America, areas which coincide fairly well with patches of preferred transitional VGP clustering from <b>reversals</b> and <b>zones</b> of high seismic velocity in the lower mantle. Changes in RPI at this location were generally gradual, possibly due to the proximity of these flux patches, and the first period of VGP-clustering over North America was accompanied by a conspicuous increase in RPI. VGPs from Site 983 track along a different path, and the associated RPI changes are very abrupt and completely synchronous with the onset and termination of the excursion.

Although the magnetospheric plasma source (s) of the 16 MLT events are not easily identified from these ground-based data alone, it is suggested that the lower and higher latitude components, may map to the plasma sheet boundary layer and along open field lines to the magnetopause boundary, respectively. The events occur at the time of enhancements of westward ionospheric ion flow and corresponding eastward electrojet current south of 74 ° MLAT.

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} solitary waves {{are for the}} weakly nonlinear regime, where models such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation are commonly obtained. However, observations of solitary waves often show that these waves can have large amplitudes, {{to the extent that}} they may contain vortex cores, that is, regions of recirculating flow. In this work, we report on theoretical asymptotic models, which describe explicitly the structure of solitary waves with recirculation zones, for certain special but important upstream flow configurations. The key feature which enables this construction is that, both for stratified shear flows and for axisymmetric swirling flows, the steady state vorticity equation is almost linear when the upstream flow is almost uniform. That is, for stratified shear flows the upstream flow and the upstream stratification are almost constant, while for rotating flows the upstream axial flow and angular velocity are almost constant. This feature enables the asymptotic construction of solitary waves described by a steady-state generalised Korteweg-de Vries equation in an outer zone, matched to an inner zone containing a recirculation zone. These recirculation zones exist for wave amplitudes just greater than a certain critical amplitude for which there is incipient flow <b>reversal.</b> The recirculation <b>zones</b> have a universal structure such that their width increases without limit as the wave amplitude increases from the critical amplitude to a certain maximum amplitude, but their existence can be sensitive to the actual upstream flow configuration.

40|$|Nearly {{half of all}} active {{subduction}} zones initiated {{during the}} Cenozoic. All subduction zones associated with active back arc extension have initiated since the Eocene, hinting that back arc extension may be intimately associated with an interval (several tens of Myr) following subduction initiation. That such {{a large proportion of}} subduction zones are young indicates that subduction initiation is a continuous process in which the net resisting force associated with forming a new subduction zone can be overcome during the normal evolution of plates. Subduction initiation is known to have occurred in a variety of tectonic settings: old fracture zones, transform faults, and extinct spreading centers and through polarity reversal behind active subduction zones. Although occurring within different tectonic settings, four known subduction initiation events (Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) along a fracture zone, Tonga-Kermadec along an extinct subduction boundary, New Hebrides within a back arc, and Puysegur-Fiordland along a spreading center) were typified by rapid uplift within the forearc followed by sudden subsidence. Other constraints corroborate the compressive nature of IBM and Tonga-Kermadec during initiation. Using an explicit finite element method within a two-dimensional domain, we explore the evolving force balance during initiation in which elastic flexure, viscous flow, plastic failure, and heat transport are all considered. In order to tie theory with observation, known tectonic settings of subduction initiation are used as initial and boundary conditions. We systematically explore incipient compression of a homogeneous plate, a former spreading center, and a fracture zone. The force balance is typified by a rapid growth in resisting force as the plate begins bending, reaching a maximum value dependent on plate thickness, but typically ranging from 2 to 3 × 1012 N/m for cases that become self-sustaining. This is followed by a drop in stress once a shear zone extends through the plate. The formation of a throughgoing fault is associated with rapid uplift on the hanging wall and subsidence on the footwall. Cumulative convergence, not the rate of convergence, is the dominant control on the force balance. Viscous tractions influence the force balance only if the viscosity of the asthenosphere is > 1020 Pa s, and then only after plate failure. Following plate failure, buoyancy of the oceanic crust leads to a linear increase with crustal thickness in the work required to initiate subduction. The total work done is also influenced by the rate of lithospheric failure. A self-sustaining subduction zone does not form from a homogeneous plate. A ridge placed under compression localizes subduction initiation, but the resisting ridge push force is not nearly as large as the force required to bend the subducting plate. The large initial bending resistance can be entirely eliminated in ridge models, explaining the propensity for new subduction zones to form through polarity <b>reversals.</b> A fracture <b>zone</b> (FZ) placed in compression leads to subduction initiation with rapid extension of the overriding plate. A FZ must be underthrust by the older plate for ~ 100 – 150 km before a transition from forced to self-sustaining states is reached. In FZ models the change in force during transition is reflected by a shift from forearc uplift to subsidence. Subduction initiation is followed by trench retreat and back arc extension. Moderate resisting forces associated with modeled subduction initiation are consistent with the observed youth of Pacific subduction zones. The models provide an explanation for the compressive state of western Pacific margins before and during subduction initiation, including IBM and Tonga-Kermadec in the Eocene, and the association of active back arcs with young subduction zones. On the basis of our dynamic models and the relative poles of rotation between Pacific and Australia during the Eocene, we predict that the northern segment of the Tonga-Kermadec convergent margin would have initiated earlier with a progressive southern migration of the transition between forced and self-sustaining states...|$|R
