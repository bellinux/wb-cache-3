5000|$|The {{youngest}} of four children, Friederun Köhnen {{was born in}} Dresden during the war. [...] When she was 23, with startup capital of 600 Marks, she launched herself as a freelance experimental chef. Working from improvised premises in the cellar of her parents' home, she quickly made an impression on the German food industry with her innovative ideas. Early on she successfully approached {{the owners of the}} Müller’s Mühle food conglomerate, a major producer of dried peas, beans and other pulses, with a proposal that many customers would prefer to buy these products in cans/tins, in order to avoid having to soak the contents overnight before they could be used for cooking. The idea caught on with consumers, and the resulting canned products can be seen as Germany's original [...] "ready meals" [...] ("Fertiggerichte").The business launch coincided with wider changes in the food industry. A breakthrough came when Köhnen addressed the issues arising from the appearance in homes, during the 1960s and 1970s, of domestic freezers. Another branch of her entrepreneurial zeal ripe for expansion involved the recent arrival of supermarkets in West Germany. Many products which till that point had been sold fresh now needed to be packaged, and Köhnen was able to supply recipes and pictures of prepared dishes that could be printed on the packaging. In this way she was able to introduce consumers to new recipe ideas. In a contract with the Galbani company, at that time little known outside Italy, she was able to introduce consumers to hitherto unknown culinary ingredients such as Mozzarella, Mascarpone and <b>Rucola.</b> She {{was one of those who}} revealed Tiramisu to sweet toothed West Germans. Köhnen also popularised little known Asiatic ingredients such as Tofu and Soy sauce, including them in her recipes which by this time were appearing in her own cookery books.|$|E

This study investigated {{the use of the}} volatilome of <b>rucola</b> (Eruca sativa) as a powerful natural nematicidal agent against the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Analysis of the composition of the volatilome, using GC-MS-SPME, showed that the compound (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate was the most abundant, followed by (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and erucin, with relative percentages of 22. 7 ± 1. 6, 15. 9 ± 2. 3, and 8. 6 ± 1. 3, respectively. Testing of the nematicidal activity of <b>rucola</b> volatile compounds revealed that erucin, pentyl isothiocyanate, hexyl isothiocyanate, (E) - 2 -hexenal, 2 -ethylfuran, and methyl thiocyanate were the most active with EC 50 values of 3. 2 ± 1. 7, 11. 1 ± 5. 0, 11. 3 ± 2. 6, 15. 0 ± 3. 3, 16. 0 ± 5. 0, and 18. 1 ± 0. 6 mg/L, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. Moreover, the nematicidal activity of fresh <b>rucola</b> used as soil amendant in a containerized culture of tomato decreased the nematode infection in a dose-response manner (EC 50 = 20. 03 mg/g) and plant growth was improved. On the basis of these results, E. sativa can be considered as a promising companion plant in intercropping strategies for tomato growers to control root-knot nematode...|$|E

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of indoxacarb, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on <b>rucola,</b> cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of indoxacarb on the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of indoxacarb on <b>rucola,</b> cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

Berteroin decreased LPS-induced release of inflammatory mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines in Raw 264. 7 macrophages. Berteroin inhibited LPS-induced degradation of inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) and nuclear factor-κB p 65 translocation to the nucleus and DNA binding activity. Furthermore, berteroin suppressed degradation of IL- 1 receptor-associated kinase and phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β activated kinase- 1. Berteroin also inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK, ERK 1 / 2, and AKT. In the mouse ear, berteroin effectively suppressed TPA-induced edema formation and down-regulated iNOS and COX- 2 expression {{as well as}} phosphorylation of AKT and ERK 1 / 2.

The influence of five different pulsed electric field protocols with different pulse polarity, number of pulses (25, 50, 75, 100, 250, and 500), and intervals between pulses (no intervals and 1 - and 2 -ms intervals) on the reversible permeabilization of <b>rucola</b> (Eruca sativa) leaves was investigated. The electric field intensity was 600 V/cm. Electrical resistance of the bulk tissue was measured before and after electroporation, and propidium iodide was used to analyze the electroporation at the surface of the leaf. Leaf viability was assessed from survival in storage, and cell viability was investigated with fluorescein diacetate. Results indicate that the viability of the leaves could not be predicted by measurements of electrical resistance or permeabilization levels of the leaf surface. Higher survival rate was demonstrated when applying bipolar pulses compared with monopolar pulses, but the latter proved to be more effective than bipolar pulses for permeabilizing the surface of the leaves. Longer intervals between bipolar pulses resulted in increased viability preservation, while the number of electroporated cells on the leaf surface was comparable for all tested protocols...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to investigate the biological role of four different types of baby-leaf salads and to study their potential as natural sources of antioxidants and antimicrobials against several isolates from important human pathogenic bacteria. Four single types of salads (green lettuce, red lettuce, <b>rucola</b> and watercress) and two mixtures [(1) red lettuce+green lettuce; (2) green lettuce + red lettuce + watercress + rucola] were assayed. The HPLC analysis revealed interesting levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates. The results showed a significant variation (p < 0. 05) of polyphenols and glucosinolates with plant material. Nine different types of polyphenols grouped in three major classes were found: gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (phenolic acids); quercitin- 3 -O-rutinoside, quercitin- 3 -O-rhamnoside, luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside and isorhamnetin (flavonoids); and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside (anthocyanins).

Six concentrations of each aqueous extract were tested (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 100 %) and compared to control (distilled water), with five replicates of each concentration, being ten seeds of each crop distributed in each replicate. The aqueous extracts of E. globulus and C. sylvestris reduced significantly the percentage of seed germination, the index of germination speed and the initial growth of the above ground part and roots of all cultivated species, being the reduction of these parameters higher with the increment of the aqueous extracts concentration, which led to thicker and atrophied roots with a higher number of absorbent hairs. Therefore, the results indicate an existence of allelopathic potential of E. globulus and C. sylvestris.

40|$|In the {{production}} of greenhouse vegetables, {{the decline of the}} wholesale price of tomato and cucumber has impaired the profitability of greenhouse enterprises. New species are sought for production to improve the profitability. In Finland only one quarter of {{the production}} of sweet pepper is domestic and the proportion of organic production is small. There is a remarkable market for domestic sweet pepper. However, the shortage of nutrients and water as well as the tolerance of stress are limiting the yield of sweet pepper. In the organic greenhouse production commercial liquid fertilizers are used to insure the availability of nutrients during the formation of the yield. They are significantly more expensive than chemical fertilizers. The cost of supplemental liquid fertilizer could be reduced by developing a fertilizer based on animal urine. Urine is commonly available for free on farms. On the other hand, the sales of urine could when proven a functional liquid fertilizer, in principle make a significant source of income of the same order of the income from milk, when the price of urine would be derived from the price of the nutrients in the organic liquid fertilizers. Some entrepreneurs have already tried to use urine as a liquid fertilizer with great success. In the greenhouse production the availability of nutrients, the uptake of water, the growth of plants, flowering and the tolerance of stress could be improved by mycorrhizal inoculation. Actually, almost all the plants cultivated in the greenhouse; vegetables, spices and berries (except cabbages e. g. <b>rucola)</b> benefit from mycorrhiza when the conditions for the function of these fungi are optimal. Because mycorrhiza supplies the plants especially with phosphorus there is not much use of mycorrhiza when the phosphorus content of the media is high. Mycorrhiza works best when the solubility of phosphorus in the media is low. On the contrary, a high nitrogen content does not impair the function of mycorrhiza. From the Finnish soil, effective mycorrhiza strains have been isolated but these are not yet developed to commercial preparations. However, there have been positive experience of their advantages e. g. in spices, strawberry and flowers. The aim of this part of study is to develop an animal originating affordable ecological liquid fertilizer for production of organic sweet pepper in greenhouses and clarify the feasibility of mycorrhiza inoculation in {{the production of}} spices and vegetables on different medias. Materials and methods MTT Agricultural Engineering develops in co-operation with the University of Helsinki an animal urine originated liquid fertilizer suitable for organic greenhouse production. There is in {{the first phase of the}} research a test in a greenhouse lasting whole the production period (approx. 6 months) where 1) bovine urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 2) pig urine as a supplemental fertilizer, 3) a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer, 4) media fertilized with chicken manure (natural fertilizer by Biolan) and 5) media fertilized with chicken manure (natural fertilizer by Biolan) with a commercial organic liquid fertilizer by Biolan as a supplemental fertilizer are tested. In the same greenhouse but in a separate test the effect of sea algal on the production of sweet pepper is studied. The treatments of the second phase are selected according to the results of the first phase. MTT Agricultural Engineering is responsible for planning the use of liquid fertilizer and installations of the instruments needed and participates in the reporting. The University of Helsinki is responsible for management of the test in co-operation with the enterprises.

40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to gain insight in processes governing bank strength and the influence of bank strength on channel patterns in flume experiments. Variables such as root length, root branching, plant density and spatial and temporal distribution of fines have not been quantified in terms of bank strength in flume experiments. Therefore supporting experiments have been done to study these variables. In the past attempts have been done to create dynamic meandering rivers in flume experiments (Friedkin, 1945; Schumm and Khan, 1972; Tal and Paola, 2007; Braudrick et al., 2009). In none of these experiments effects of vegetation and cohesive fines on bank strength and channel pattern have been studied in a systematic way. Bank cohesion for a range of substrates and effects of vegetation on bank strength have been studied in past experiments (Hoendervoogt, 2008; Van de Lageweg, 2009). However, the governing processes behind bank strength have not been studied thoroughly. The effect of vegetation on bank strength has been studied for natural rivers (Pollen and Simon, 2005; Pollen, 2007, Pollen-Bankhead and Simon, 2010). Vegetation provides cohesion to banks through tensile strength (pulling strength). Field data has shown that tensile strength decreases as vegetation bends due to shearing forces of flow. This bending has been parameterized as the angle of shear distortion (Pollen and Simon, 2005). In order to calibrate initial fluvio-dynamical parameters and channel pattern for the flume experiments, the physics-based Struiksma bar theory has been used (Struiksma et al., 1985; Crosato and Mosselman, 2009). This theory predicts channel pattern, bar type and bar length for natural rivers. Therefore parameters can be calibrated to obtain single-thread meandering rivers with alternating bars. However, the Struiksma bar theory lacks the effect of vegetation and cohesive fines on channel pattern development. In order to study the effect of vegetation on bank strength, supporting Friedkin bank erosion tests have been done. For practical purposes Alfalfa and <b>Rucola</b> shoots have been used. The effect of both high and low plant densities and growth duration on bank erosion rate have been investigated on both plant species. These tests have shown a decrease in bank erosion in the presence of vegetation. Growth duration is the dominant variable, as bank erosion rate is related to plant species after long growth durations. Subsequently, these plant densities and growth durations have been extrapolated to the flume experiments. However, bank strength of river banks is not governed by vegetation only. Previous studies have shown that water retention in varying substrates has a significant effect on bank strength (Simon et al., 2000; Simon and Collison, 2002; Hillel, 2004). Therefore retention curves of mixtures of cohesive fines have been produced as supporting experiments. The range of mixtures consisted of silica flour and poorly sorted sand. Mixtures have been chosen so that the effect of silica flour on water retention could be tested. Flume experiments serve as the synthesis of all the supporting experiments. Effects of both cohesive fines and vegetation have been observed. Seeds have been sown in two scenarios. In the first seeding scenario seeds have been sown at low flow in the same plant densities as in the bank erosion tests. Shoots have grown at low flow in the same duration as the bank erosion tests. In the second seeding scenario seeds have been added periodically to the flow as bed-load at the upstream end of the flume. This has been done daily during 1 hour bankfull flow events. Finally tests have been done in which silica flour has been added periodically at the upstream end. The second seeding scenario has produced vegetation patterns which originate from opportunistic settling of seeds at high-water marks. In conclusion all the tests show a decreasing bank erosion rate in the presence of vegetation and cohesive fines. Results of the bank erosion tests and the flume experiments show that bank erosion rate decreases most significantly with increasing plant growth duration. Therefore the effect of rooting depth seems to be dominant in governing bank strength, not plant density. Furthermore, deposition of silica flour on the floodplains led to a rapid decrease in bank erosion. Similar results have been observed for the experiments with opportunistic seed settling. Seeds settled predominantly on high-water marks, such as levees and scroll bars. After prolonged plant growth the banks are increasingly stable, which has been observed by a decrease in cut-off frequency and occurrence of one single-thread dominant channel. Abovementioned results of this study can be implemented in future flume studies for channel pattern behaviour. Especially effects of varying growth conditions of vegetation and seeding methods on channel patterns are useful for future study...|$|E
