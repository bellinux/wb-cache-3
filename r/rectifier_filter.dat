It was ordered from Siemens in 1999 for $60 million and installation was completed around 2002. The plant receives 69 kV, three phase, 60 Hz power from the PECO Energy Company. Although the exact electrical architecture of the converter modules is unknown, they are presumably of the DC link variety (<b>Rectifier,</b> <b>filtering</b> capacity, and inverter placed back to back) based on other Siemens traction power converters. The 2006 traction network shutdown originated {{in one of the}} converter modules at this plant. Richmond output power is scheduled with PECO, although the units themselves are operated by Amtrak remotely from Philadelphia. Generally, the three PECO-supplied converters (Richmond, Metuchen, and Lamokin) are scheduled as a block with PECO.|$|R

The design for the suply was based on three factors: low cost, small size to fit {{existing}} substation pads, and good protection against damage to the klystron including klystrong gun arcs. The supply uses a 12 pulse 12. 5 KV primary thyristor “star point controller ” with primary filter inductor to provide rapid voltage control, good voltage regulation, and fast turn off during klystron tube faults. The supply also uses a unique secondary <b>rectifier,</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor configuration to minimize the energy available under a klystron fault. The voltage control is from O- 90 KV with a regulation of < 0. 1 % and voltage ripple of c 1 % P-P, (< 0. 2 % RMS.) above 60 KV. The supply utilizes a thyristor crowbar, which under a klystron tube arc limits the energy in the klystron arc to < 5 joules.

40|$|Abstract — This thesis aims at {{developing}} a technique for stabilising the feedback loop of a high-frequency DC / DC converter followed with design of an EMI filter. This type of dc-dc converters {{can be used}} in solar power system to obtain a stable output under varying input conditions. A DC / DC converter consists of a Pulse modulated controller, MOSFET switches, switching transformers, <b>rectifier,</b> <b>filter</b> and output sensing mechanism for feedback control. Initially design of the power supply to meet the output voltage and current requirements was carried out. An analog controller UC- 1825 is used for the PWM control of the converter circuitry. The converter circuit was implemented using a voltage fed push pull topology and is also provided with additional windings for control and telemetry. The switching frequency is kept at a high value so as to minimise the size of filter components. Then the circuit elements are linearized and test the stability of the system using frequency response analysis in MATLAB software. A type 2 compensator was identified and implemented in the circuit to achieve necessary phase margin, gain margin, and bandwidth. And finally an EMI filter was designed based on the obtained bandwidth. The overall stability of the system including the filter was analysed and step response plot was also checked to test the adequacy of the design. The overall system including input filter was simulated in MATLAB and the results are verified...|$|E

40|$|A {{very fast}} phase angle {{estimation}} algorithm for a single-phase system under a sudden phase angle jump condition is proposed in this work. When a source voltage {{changes in a}} step manner, e. g., when an electrical railway traction crosses over to the power section supplied by another voltage source, the phase angle detector of normal use such as a phase locked loop (PLL), a low pass or notch filter typically generates phase delay and results in a sluggish response, and causes some time-critical machine to malfunction. In this work, a method of estimating the fundamental component and the phase angle of the source voltage without a significant delay is presented, by using the weighted least-squares estimation (WLSE) method with the covariance resetting technique.

50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the <b>rectifier</b> and <b>filter</b> capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|R
