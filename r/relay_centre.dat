In the Western high plateau region of Cameroon, maize is a cash crop but the farmers do not understand the marketing system giving way to middlemen traders to benefit from the disorganisation of the maize trade to exploit the relationship between the farme rs and the market. This paper seeks to know whether maize trade through middlemen can help peasant farmers to adequately fight against poverty. Findings show that in spite of adequate maize production the trade through middlemen presents limitations. The middlemen attend only the periodic markets and those one located in accessible places. They buy maize in small quantities at very low prices and stock in small <b>relay</b> <b>centres</b> for short periods of time. These centres therefore function simply loading maize and cannot serve as veritable poles of economic development.

This choice was due both to the strong presence in the region of small and medium sized enterprises, and to the well known lack of social capital among local firms.

While type A interneurons ('small bipolar cells') showed a significant reduction of their soma size in schizophrenics, type B interneurons ('small multipolar cells') of schizophrenic patients exhibited a marked decrease in the extent of their dendritic system.

40|$|NiFe] hydrogenases are metalloenzymes {{that act}} as highly {{efficient}} molecular electrocatalysts for the interconversion of protons and molecular hydrogen. Unlike any other known molecular electrocatalyst, {{the members of a}} subgroup of respiratory membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases are able to maintain H 2 catalysis in the sustained presence of O 2. This O 2 -tolerance depends on the ability to respond to oxidative inactivation by O 2 by exclusively forming rapidly reactivated active site states, thus implying a catalytic cycle in which O 2 acts as a competing substrate to H 2. Using isotope ratio mass spectrometry it is proven that the O 2 -tolerant Escherichia coli Hydrogenase 1 responds to O 2 attack by acting as a four-electron oxidoreductase, catalysing the reaction 2 H 2 + O 2 &# 8594; 2 H 2 O, equivalent to hydrogen combustion. Special features of the enzyme’s electron relay system enable delivery of the required electrons. A small fraction of the H 2 O produced arises from side reactions proceeding via reactive oxygen species, an unavoidable consequence of the presence of low-potential <b>relay</b> <b>centres</b> that release electrons from H 2 oxidation. While the ability to fully reduce O 2 to harmless H 2 O at the active site to generate the rapidly reactivated state Ni-B, determines if a hydrogenase is O 2 -tolerant, the ratio of oxidative inactivation to reductive reactivation rates determines how tolerant the enzyme is. It is shown by protein film electrochemistry that the (&# 945;&# 946;) 2 dimeric assembly of Hyd- 1 {{plays an important role in}} O 2 -tolerance by aiding reactivation of one catalytic unit through electron transfer from the other. The teamwork between two redundant partners implicates a new role for dimerisation and represents a new example of cooperativity in biology. Finally, the non-natural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine was synthesised and incorporated into Hyd- 1, testing the possibility of introducing labels at specific sites.

The structure is not merely a <b>relay</b> <b>centre</b> but is involved in processing nociceptive information before transmitting the information to various parts of the cortex.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The paper {{presents}} an innovative model of knowledge transfer, drawing upon {{the nature of}} the knowledge creation process as well as the specific features of a communication act. Such a model {{is the result of the}} hybridization of economic literature regarding services and technology transfer with linguistic and semiotic theories. Six classes of functions were identified, which can be articulated in a recursive sequence of activities. The heuristic virtues of the model were tested by analyzing the case of the Innovation <b>Relay</b> <b>Centre</b> of Southern Italy. We focused our attention upon IRC activities in the Apulian region. This choice was due both, to the strong presence in the region of small and medium sized enterprises and to the social capital absence that is usually ascribed to local firms.

Moreover it has allowed for the identification strengths and weaknesses which could be useful for the elaboration of future innovation policies.

This paper aims at modelling a proper production function for the TT brokers, providing insights on how to compare their performance and investigating the influence of external factors on their efficiency, in order to drawuseful managerial and policy implications. Data drawnfrom a survey conducted among the nodes belonging to the technology transfer network IRC (Innovation <b>Relay</b> <b>Centre)</b> have been utilised to investigate how endogenous and exogenous factors may affect brokers' efficiency. Results showed how brokers can pursue more productive and targeted strategy in order to increase their impact and improve their performance ("inter alia", by taking into account a "pull" approach to technology and the need of a long-lasting relationship with the clients, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular).

The rats of both sexes (n= 20), with an average weight of 200 g were randomly assigned into treatment (n= 10) and control (n= 10) groups. The rats in the treatment group received 600 mg/ 70 kg body weight of efavirenz dissolved in distilled water daily for 30 days through the orogastric tube. The control group received equal volume of distilled water daily for 30 days through the same route. The rats were fed with growerÕs mash obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Ewu, Edo state, Nigeria and given water liberally. ˚The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation method on the thirty-first day of the experiment. The inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10 % formal saline for histological study. The histological findings indicated that the treated sections of the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body showed that the chromatophilics substances were less intensely stained as compared to the control. The parenchyme was vacuolated and with evidence of hypertrophy and more spaces between the axonal mesh around the sparsely distributed neurons as compared to the control group.

40|$|The way {{in which}} {{adaptation}} to a particular environment takes place within {{the central nervous system}} of vertebrates {{has been the subject of}} research for over a hundred years. The development of specific reflexes from generalized action patterns, the precedence of changes in motor systems over changes in sensory systems, and the metamorphosis of sensory <b>relay</b> nuclei and <b>centres</b> of primary integration into areas subserving more complex functions (Herrick, 1948) are some of the ways in which adaptation is reported to have occurred. Furthermore, Bishop (1961) has suggested that the emphasis upon functional criteria alone as a key to the function of a specific nervous system neglects those features of the system which owe their presence to its evolution from a nervous system adapted to perform other tasks. During their evolution, the newer centres of integration which have developed as a result of new requirements have not abolished the older centres, which may retain many of their old properties. It is clearly of interest to determine whether nervous systems of groups other than vertebrates exhibit the same regularities in their adaptation, and if possible to examine the alterations in response to different selective forces at the single-unit level. The choice of a particular experimental animal depends upon the extent of knowledge of the functional morphology and physiology of the nervous system of other closely related animals at the single-unit level.
