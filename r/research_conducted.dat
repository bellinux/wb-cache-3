5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour.

5|$|Early {{research}} on the galactic habitable zone, including the 2001 paper by Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward, did not demarcate any specific boundaries, merely stating that the zone was an annulus encompassing a region of the galaxy that was both enriched with metals and spared from excessive radiation, and that habitability {{would be more likely}} in the galaxy's thin disk.

5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>conducted</b> in 2003 {{suggests}} that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>conducted</b> on {{the effects}} of partial epileptic {{seizures}} on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due {{probably}} {{to a combination of}} various organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, phenolic compounds and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps. Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study. Porcini were thought to have anti-cancer properties according to Hungarian <b>research</b> <b>conducted</b> in the 1950s, but later investigations in the United States did not support this.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>research</b> <b>conducted</b> after the fires, a new fire {{management}} plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Based upon {{scientific}} <b>research</b> <b>conducted</b> by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division in 2003, the cyclone {{is estimated}} to have first begun as a 60mph (100km/h) tropical storm south of Mayaguana in the Bahamas early on September9. However, due to scarce observations, its genesis likely occurred earlier than this time but was undetected operationally. Moving slowly northwest, the cyclone quickly strengthened into a hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h), equivalent to Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, early the next day. By 00:00UTC on September11, it reached sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) while centered about 15miles (25km) west of New Providence Island. Turning to the west-northwest, the cyclone maintained its intensity while passing {{just north of the}} Bimini Islands. Around 23:00UTC on September12, the cyclone struck South Florida near Fort Lauderdale with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Thereafter, the hurricane weakened upon crossing the Everglades, weakening to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on September12.|$|E
