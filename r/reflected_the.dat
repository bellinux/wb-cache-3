Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
