In this competition, the loved ones watched rocks fall into a crater. Once they believed 1000 rocks fell into the crater, they hit their buzzer.

40|$|We {{delineate}} Hong Kong listed corporations {{into three}} levels of privatization: the fully privatized blue chips, semi-privatized <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> and the least privatized H shares. Both H shares and <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> are mixed enterprises that mimic private ownership with joint government and private stock ownership. We find that mixed enterprises are less profitable and lower valued than the fully privatized blue chips, but <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> are more efficient and perform better than blue chips when market confidence swings to their favor. Regression analysis suggests that increased stock ownership {{by the government and}} increased emolument incentives are counterproductive to profitability, especially in bad economic times of the 1997 - 98 Asian financial crisis.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the information flow between China-backed securities, namely H shares, <b>red</b> <b>chips,</b> Shanghai and Shenzhen listed common shares. We document several findings. We find that an exponential generalized {{autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity}} in mean (EGARCH-M) model appears to describe adequately the return process of the China-backed securities. Our empirical findings show that both H shares and <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> (which are listed in Hong Kong) are more sensitive to 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 news than 2 ̆ 7 bad 2 ̆ 7 news, while stocks listed in the China market are more sensitive to 2 ̆ 7 bad 2 ̆ 7 news than 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 news. Using a multivariate EGARCH-M model, we have found significant return and volatility spillover effects among the China-backed securities. Our study indicates that the <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> appear to spread information to other China-backed markets 2 ̆ 7 directly 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 indirectly 2 ̆ 7. The results imply that the red chip market processes information faster than the other markets...|$|E

40|$|Colors carry {{meaningful}} psychological signals. We {{hypothesized that}} the color red serves as a powerful cue in competition, affecting both actors and perceivers. Using simplified poker games we investigated the psychological meaning of color in competitive interaction, by examining how the color of chips (red vs. blue or white) used by participants or their competitors affected behavior. Although chip color was objectively unrelated to the chips' value or competitors' strength, perceiving competitors using <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> renders competitors more intimidating, which leads perceivers to withdraw. Furthermore, actors who used <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> felt more dominant, which led them to enhanced competitive approach.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of thesis, we {{investigated}} the influence and explanatory power of aggregate insider trading activities on momentum trading strategies in US stock markets. We find that aggregate insider trading activities have ability in predicting cross-sectional returns and can strengthen the naive momentum effects. The risk factors such as size and book-to-market ratio cannot explain the strong momentum effects in our refined momentum strategies. We further extend the time horizon to as long as 3 years and find that the reversal patterns. We interpret our findings as follows: The continuous overreaction causes the mediate term (3 - to 12 months) momentum effects and overly pricing. In long-term horizon, these overly priced stocks will be corrected with the time passing. The correction of overly pricing causes long-term reversals. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we studied relationships between the efficiency of external market and the capital allocation processes in internal market by investigating the performance of <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> traded in Hong Kong. Because of its special role between China and international capital market, it is difficult for international investors to monitor how <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> allocated their Hong Kong raised capital in China. The evidences show that <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> made poor investments in the past decades. However, the external market failed to reflect the unprofitable investment made by the management groups in the internal market. At least, our evidences show that the <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> made diversified but unprofitable investments in aggregate level in the past decade. Jihong Xiang. "December 2001.

40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} {{existence}} of contagion using data on China's five parallel markets with different entry barriers for foreign capital. Taking the 1997 stock market crash as our experiment and using data on A, B and H shares, <b>red</b> <b>chips</b> and American depository receipts, the present paper tests whether these China-backed market returns respond differently to foreign shocks during the pre- 1997 and post- 1997 crash period. Evidence suggests that the contagion effects are stronger in markets with fewer entry barriers. An important implication of our findings is that countries vulnerable to contagion could be justified to impose some limits on capital flows.
