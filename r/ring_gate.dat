40|$|This work uses {{numerical}} {{methods to}} investigate the hydrodynamic forces that act on a turbine <b>ring</b> <b>gate</b> during emergency shutdown. Accurately predicting the hydrodynamic forces on such gates is important because the forces constitute a design criterion of ring gates, {{especially in the case}} of the downward-pulling hydrodynamic force, which directly affects the opening or closing of the gate. In this article, we use Fluent, which is a computational fluid dynamics code, to simulate the flow patterns around the <b>ring</b> <b>gate</b> and to calculate the hydrodynamic forces on the gate. We numerically simulate the three-dimensional unsteady turbulence over the entire flow passage of the turbine. The numerical results show that the hydrodynamic forces are induced mainly by flow acceleration under the bottom surface of the <b>ring</b> <b>gate.</b> When the <b>ring</b> <b>gate</b> is at 90 % closing position, the downward-pulling hydrodynamic force is maximal; near the completely closed position, the hydrodynamic force is more sensitive to the position of the <b>ring</b> <b>gate.</b> This investigation of the hydrodynamic forces that act on the ring gates provides the theoretical basis for determining the operational capacity and the optimal design of ring gates...|$|E

In order to reduce testing efforts on the component, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the material characteristic values under cyclic loading on specimens and develop a FEA-based methodology to transfer them to the component. The multiaxial fatigue behaviour of short fibre reinforced polyamide 6. 6 (PA 66 -GF 35) has been already investigated on tubular hollow specimens in a previous work [1]. In order to develop and validate a fatigue failure criterion capable to account for the presence of notches and multiaxial stress distributions, this characterisation has to be extended to notched specimens. This paper presents the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of notched hollow tubular specimens made of short fibre reinforced polyamide 6. 6 (PA 66 -GF 35).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture and achievable performance for a time-to-digital converter, for 3 D time-of-flight cameras. This design is partitioned in two levels. In the first level, an analog time expansion, where the time interval {{to be measured}} is stretched by a factor k, is achieved by charging a capacitor with current I, followed by discharging the capacitor with a current Ik. In the second level, the final time to digital conversion is performed by a global <b>gated</b> <b>ring</b> oscillator based time-to-digital converter. The performance can be increased by exploiting its properties of intrinsic scrambling of quantization noise and mismatch error, and first order noise shaping. The stretched time interval is measured by counting full clock cycles and storing the states of nine phases of the <b>gated</b> <b>ring</b> oscillator. The frequency of the <b>gated</b> <b>ring</b> oscillator is approximately 131 MHz, and an appropriate stretch factor k, can give a resolution of ≈ 57 ps. The combined low nonlinearity of the time stretcher and the <b>gated</b> <b>ring</b> oscillator-based time-to-digital converter can achieve a distance resolution of a few centimeters with low power consumption and small area occupation.

Here, we have analyzed the structure of Kch, a channel of this type from Escherichia coli, in a lipid environment using electron crystallography. By combining information from the 3 D map of the transmembrane part of the protein and docking of an atomic model of a potassium channel, we conclude that the RCK domains face the solution and that an RCK octameric <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> arrangement does not form under our crystallization condition.

40|$|Calcium ions bind at the <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> which {{triggers}} the gating of BK channels.

Here, we applied Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Targeted MD to the integrated <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> of BK channels, and achieved {{the transition from the}} closed state to a half-open state.

40|$|AbstractIon {{channels}} are proteins {{that control the}} flux of ions across cell membranes by opening and closing (gating) their pores. It has been proposed that channels gated by internal agonists have an intracellular <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> that extracts free energy from agonist binding to open the gates using linkers that directly connect the <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> to the <b>gates.</b> Here we find for a voltage- and Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channel that shortening the linkers increases channel activity and lengthening the linkers decreases channel activity, both in the presence and absence of intracellular Ca 2 +. These observations are consistent with a mechanical model in which the linker-gating ring complex forms a passive spring that applies force to the gates {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 + to modulate the voltage-dependent gating. Adding Ca 2 + then changes the force to further activate the channel. Both the passive and Ca 2 +-induced forces contribute to the gating of the channel...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMthK is a prokaryotic Ca 2 +-gated K+ channel that, {{like other}} ligand-gated channels, {{converts}} the chemical energy of ligand binding to the mechanical force of channel opening.

Here we present the crystal {{structures of the}} MthK <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> in closed and partially open states at 2. 8 Å, both obtained from the same crystal grown {{in the absence of}} Ca 2 +. Furthermore, our biochemical and electrophysiological analyses demonstrate that MthK is regulated by both Ca 2 + and pH. Ca 2 + regulates the channel by changing the equilibrium of the <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> between closed and open states, while pH regulates channel gating by affecting gating-ring stability. Our findings, along with the previously determined open MthK structure, allow us to elucidate the ligand gating mechanism of RCK-regulated K+ channels...|$|R

40|$|In MthK, a Ca 2 +-gated K+ channel from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, eight cytoplasmic RCK domains form an octameric <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> that {{controls}} the intracellular gate of the ion conduction pore. The binding of Ca 2 + ions to the RCK domains alters the conformation of the <b>gating</b> <b>ring,</b> thereby opening the gate. In the present study, we examined the Ca 2 +- and pH-regulated gating and the rectifying conduction properties of MthK at the single-channel level. The open probability (Po) of MthK exhibits a sigmoidal relationship with intracellular [Ca 2 +], and a Hill coefficient > 1 is required to describe the dependence of Po on [Ca 2 +], suggesting cooperative Ca 2 + activation of the channel. Additionally, intracellular Ca 2 + also blocks the MthK pore in a voltage-dependent manner, rendering an apparently inwardly rectifying I-V relation. Intracellular pH has a dual effect on MthK gating. Below pH 7. 5, the channel becomes insensitive to Ca 2 +. This occurs because the <b>gating</b> <b>ring</b> is structurally unstable at this pH and tends to disassemble (Ye, S., Y. Li, L. Chen, and Y. Jiang. 2006. Cell. 126 : 1161 – 1173). In contrast, above pH 7. 5, a further increase in pH shifts the Po-[Ca 2 +] relation towards a lower Ca 2 + concentration, augments Po at saturating [Ca 2 +], and activates the channel {{even in the absence}} of Ca 2 +. Channel activity is marked by bursts of rapid openings and closings separated by relatively longer interburst closings. The duration of interburst closing and the burst length are highly Ca 2 + and pH dependent, whereas the kinetics of intraburst events is Ca 2 + and pH independent. The rapid intraburst openings and closings are also observed with the isolated MthK pore lacking the attached intracellular <b>gating</b> <b>ring.</b> The fast kinetic events, independent of both Ca 2 + and pH, therefore appear to be determined by processes occurring within the ion conduction pore, whereas the slow events reflect the gating process controlled by Ca 2 + and pH through the <b>gating</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R
