40|$|The Nyssa School Board {{placed the}} book “Then Again Maybe I Won’t” {{on the school}} <b>restricted</b> <b>reserve</b> shelf in the junior high library. A review board handled the {{complaint}} of a parent who felt the book wasn’t appropriate for junior high students. The committee said it didn’t want to single the book out and end up placing it in a special place. Only {{by word of mouth}} do students know which books are restricted until the librarian tells them when they are checking that book out. Books that are restricted need a parent’s approval before check out. Ontario High School avoids the problem of complaints by only ordering from the ALA book list. All books that are ordered for the library are read before being put on shelves, and some are sent back to the publisher. Books that are on the required reading list that are challenged may end up being moved to the supplemental list instead. A school official said that the matter was not so much the students being unable to handle the material, it was more the parents couldn’t handle the books...|$|E

After three seasons at the club, West Ham United bought McPherson for £30,000 in a three-year deal, which, {{dependent}} upon appearances, would have risen to £200,000. His time at Upton Park was riddled with injury; the longest period of fitness being three months. He was <b>restricted</b> to <b>reserve</b> team games.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{previous}} day's 2012 Paralympic marathon and also for capacity reasons, the viewing area along The Mall between Admiralty Arch and the Memorial were <b>restricted,</b> <b>reserved</b> and ticketed only for those groups who had made invaluable contributions to the Games and their athletes. The infrastructure from the marathon was reused for the parade. The groups included members of the emergency services, military personnel, Team GB and Paralympics GB coaches and support staff, and friends and family of the athletes involved. Around 1000 school students were also invited, the numbers coming from every London borough with schools that participated in LOCOG Get Set Network. This was to ensure that one in eight 10 - 18-year-olds could view the parade free of charge. Invitations were also been extended to Team London Ambassadors and volunteers from across the UK. In addition, an estimated 9,000 of the 70,000 volunteers (including Games Makers and Ceremonies Volunteers) won places via a ballot in The Mall in early September. The rest of the Games Makers were encouraged to line {{the remainder of the}} parade, wearing their uniforms.|$|R

50|$|Johnson {{was born}} in West Bromwich and {{attended}} Stuart Bathurst Catholic High School. He left in year nine and moved to Leeds to start his career at Leeds United, where he was recognised as a tenacious and skilful target man. He signed his first professional contract at Elland Road in July 2000, but {{with a number of}} strikers ahead of him in the pecking order, he was <b>restricted</b> to <b>reserve</b> team football and did not make his senior debut until he was loaned to Hull City. In his first match for the Tigers, on 13 August 2002 at Bristol Rovers, he was brought on as a substitute and scored an 85th-minute equaliser which secured a 1-1 draw. Late in the 2002-03 season he made his Premier League debut for Leeds in the 6-1 defeat of Charlton Athletic, replacing Alan Smith. Over the next two seasons, Johnson only made sporadic appearances for Leeds and was loaned to several clubs for first team experience.|$|R

40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas can prevent over-exploitation, but {{their effect on}} marine diseases is less clear. We examined how marine reserves can reduce diseases affecting reef-building corals following acute and chronic disturbances. One year after a severe tropical cyclone, corals inside reserves had sevenfold lower levels of disease than those in non-reserves. Similarly, disease prevalence was threefold lower on reserve reefs following chronic exposure to terrestrial run-off from a degraded river catchment, when exposure duration was below the long-term site average. Examination of 35 predictor variables indicated that lower levels of derelict fishing line and injured corals inside reserves were correlated {{with lower levels of}} coral disease in both case studies, signifying that successful disease mitigation occurs when activities that damage reefs are <b>restricted.</b> Conversely, <b>reserves</b> were ineffective in moderating disease when sites were exposed to higher than average levels of run-off, demonstrating that reductions in water quality undermine resilience afforded by reserve protection. In addition to implementing {{protected areas}}, we highlight that disease management efforts should also target improving water quality and limiting anthropogenic activities that cause injury...|$|R
40|$|There exists {{no formal}} {{treatment}} of non-renewable resource (NRR) supply, systematically deriving quantity as function of price. We establish instantaneous <b>restricted</b> (fixed <b>reserves)</b> and unrestricted NRR supply functions. The supply of a NRR at any date and location not only {{depends on the}} local contemporary price of the resource but also on prices at all other dates and locations. Besides the usual law of supply, which characterizes the own-price effect, cross-price effects have their own law. They can be decomposed into a substitution effect and a stock compensation effect. We show that the substitution effect always dominates: a price increase {{at some point in}} space and time causes NRR supply to decrease at all other points. This new but orthodox supply setting extends to NRRs the partial equilibrium analysis of demand and supply policies. The properties of restricted and unrestricted supply functions are characterized for Hotelling (homogenous) as well as Ricardian (non homogenous) reserves, for a single deposit as well as for several deposits that endogenously come into production or cease to be active...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{myocardial}} energy balance of increasing oxygen demand without altering basal myocardial perfusion rate was assessed in isolated, isovolumic, retrograde blood perfused rabbit hearts. Myocardial energy requirements were increased with paired stimulation. The capacity of rapid paired stimulation to increase mechanical energy consumption was {{demonstrated in the}} presence of increased perfusion with the rate X pressure product and oxygen consumption increasing 86 and 148 %, respectively, compared with control values. In contrast, rapid paired stimulation under constant, basal flow conditions did not alter the rate X pressure product, while oxygen extraction and consumption increased only 40 % relative to control. Myocardial ATP, creatine-phosphate, and lactate content were identical under control and constant flow-paired stimulation conditions. The results {{of this study indicate that}} no detectable energy imbalance was produced by rapid paired stimulation with flow held constant at basal rates. These results suggest that the myocardium does not increase mechanical energy expenditure in response to inotropic or rate stimulation {{in the presence of}} <b>restricted</b> flow <b>reserve</b> and are inconsistent with the concept of "demand-induced" or "relative" myocardial ischemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{facility}} layout design has {{been regarded as}} the key to improve plant productivity, which are relevant to both manufacturing and service sectors. Facility Layout Problems (FLPs) are known to be NP-hard problems; various optimization approaches for small problems and heuristic approaches for the larger problems have been proposed to elucidate the problem. A mathematical model is developed for the unequal size {{facility layout}} problem with fixed flow between departments. We are considering the orientations of the departments with various sizes and aims to minimize the distance traveled by people, material, and other supporting services in the safest and most effective manner. Some of the constraints considered in the modeling are the <b>restricted</b> areas, <b>reserved</b> departmentry locations, and also the irregularity of the shapes of manufacturing layout. This paper focuses on the mathematical model and the solution of the non-quadratic assignment problem (non-QAP) by hybridizing the meta-heuristic methods i. e. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). This work could be used in future as a reference for those researchers interested in tackling this challenging unequal facility layout proble...|$|R
50|$|The desert {{ecosystem}} of {{the sanctuary}} has been affected by several factors. Some of the key factors identified are: <b>restricting</b> the <b>reserve</b> area and allocating limestone areas for mining, which not only encroached on this precious forest but also disturbed the habitat of avifauna and flora of the forest; the encroachment for cultivation by farmers is also a major factor that reduces the <b>reserve</b> area and <b>restricts</b> movement of wildlife; cattle grazing and cutting of trees for fuel and other purposes has also caused denudation that affects bird habitats. The conservation measures suggested include preservation of wetland, particularly the water bodies in the sanctuary to retain and attract migratory birds, availability and creation of hole-nester by prevention of clearance of dead trees, and attention to globally or nationally threatened species by protecting their habitats; the two species specifically referred are the pied tit (white-napped tit) considered endemic to India and the Macqueen's bustard (houbara bustard); in this context, the yellow-crowned woodpecker is also mentioned, as their numbers are reported to be small.|$|R
