It is said that milk produced by tired cows coming down <b>from</b> the <b>alpine</b> <b>pastures</b> in the autumn is richer in fats and more acidic.

It {{has been suggested that}} seed shape should also be linked to the ease of burial and, thus, to seed persistence, even if some studies failed to show this. The relationship between seed size and shape and persistence in soil was analysed for 259 species of the Italian flora, belonging {{to a wide range of}} habitats, <b>from</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>pasture</b> to limestone prairies and meadows of the Prealps, and from woodlands to Mediterranean maquis and garigues. Seed size was related to persistence in soil in the same way as in most other floras examined. Furthermore, seed shape was highly related to persistence in soil among the species analysed, when considered both altogether and divided among the different habitats. Our results suggest that not only seed size, but also seed shape, are key factors in determining seed fate and seed persistence in soil...|$|R

50|$|The Mongols {{in what is}} now Mongolia, Russia and China, and the Tatars or Turkic {{people of}} Eastern Europe and Central Asia were nomadic people who practiced nomadic {{transhumance}} on harsh Asian steppes. Some remnants of these populations are nomadic to this day. In Mongolia, about 40% of the population continues to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle. In China, it is estimated that a little over five million herders are dispersed over the pastoral counties, and more than 11 million over the semi-pastoral counties. This brings the total of the (semi)nomadic herder population to over 16 million, in general living in remote, scattered and resource-poor communities.In the Middle Hills and Himalaya of Nepal, people living above about 2,000 m practise transhumance and nomadic pastoralism because settled agriculture becomes less productive due to steep slopes, cooler temperatures and limited irrigation possibilities. Distances between summer and winter pasture may be short, for example in the vicinity of Pokhara where a valley at about 800 meters elevation is less than 20 km. <b>from</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>pastures</b> just below the Annapurna Himalaya, or distances may be 100 km or more. For example, in Rapti zone some 100 km west of Pokhara the Kham Magar move their herds between winter pastures just north of India and summer pastures on the southern slopes of Dhaulagiri Himalaya. In far western Nepal, ethnic Tibetans living in Dolpo and other valleys north among the high Himalaya moved their herds north to winter on the plains of the upper Brahmaputra basin in Tibet proper, until this practice was prohibited after China took over Tibet in 1950-51.|$|R
40|$|Transhumance is {{a ritual}} that happenes {{every year for}} ages, it liven up many traditions and recollections, also for tourist and {{cultural}} purposes. Nowadays this pratice is becomming more frequent {{all over the world}} as support for those areas which may otherwise be abandoned. One of the principal problems that this practice may face concerns the sostitution of the local autoctone breeds, which are the principal actors of this custom for ages, with Holstain and Brown cows with an high productitivity. With this study we tried to asses how dairy cows are able to deal with stressful situations such as a 50 Km transhumance. We monitored 19 cows, 10 Holstain and 9 Brown, evaluating the quantities of their milk production and their metabolic parameters before and after the stress of a journey of 24 hours when coming back <b>from</b> <b>alpine</b> <b>pasture.</b> We try to evaluate possible changes in the status of animal welfare. Individual quantities of milk production and blood samples were collected both before departure and on arrival of the dairy cows as their own farm. The obtained data were statistically processed in order to assess any changes attributable to the practice of transhumance, the impact that breed could have and the production level of cows on this phenomenon. Results showed that some dairy cows have to forcedly abandon the path because of locomotion and metabolic problems. Milk production, in the most productivity animals, showed a sharp reduction and a metabolic situation to the arrival to their own farm such as a tipical chetosis in the lactation start. The two breeds monitored didn't show important variations in the assessed parameters but Holstain results must sensible to the fisical effort due to the transhumance...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an important Q fever human epidemic involving 415 serologically confirmed {{cases in the}} Val de Bagnes (Valais, Switzerland) during the autumn of 1983. The ages of the 415 cases with acute Q fever ranged from 8 to 82 years {{with a mean of}} 35 years, of whom 58 % (240) were men and 42 % (175) were women. This outbreak started about three weeks after 12 flocks of sheep (between 850 and 900 animals) descended <b>from</b> the <b>alpine</b> <b>pastures</b> to the valley. Geographically, the epidemic reached all the villages in {{the lower part of the}} Val de Bagnes located along the road followed by the sheep. As a result, 21. 1 % of the population of these villages contracted Q fever during this period. In contrast (p < 0. 001), the inhabitants of the higher villages away from the road followed by the sheep were only slightly affected (2. 9 %). Better collaboration between physicians and veterinarians would prevent such outbreaks in the future. Coxiella burnetii, Q fever agent, is a very small bacteria (0. 3 - 0. 5 urn), which develops only intracellularly, and is classically included in the rickettsial group. This bacteria shows a particular resistance to physical and chemical agents. MacCaul and Williams 1 have shown that C. burnetii forms spores when conditions are inad-equate for its development.

30|$|The present paper {{explores the}} {{diversity}} of mycobiota inhabiting raw milk sampled at different altitudes (1400 m, 1800 m, 2200 m) <b>from</b> cows grazing <b>Alpine</b> <b>pastures</b> of Valle d’Aosta (North-Western Italian Alps). To this aim, multilocus sequencing was performed at barcodes commonly used for fungal identification (ITS 1, D 1 /D 2 domains of the 26 S rRNA gene, {{and part of the}} β-tubulin gene). A total of 31 species were detected, most of them yeasts, followed by moulds and by 2 sequences of macroscopic fungi. Several yeasts and moulds were well-characterized inhabitants of the dairy environment, known to positively contribute to cheesemaking. Among these, Candida was the most represented genus with a tendency to cluster at the highest altitudes (6 over 8 observations at ≥ 1800 m), and Kluyveromyces marxianus the most abundant single species, retrieved at all altitudes. The environmental ascomycetous Atrotorquata lineata, never put in relation with food nor described outside North-America, was another species among those most frequently retrieved and was detected in 6 milks at 1400 and 1800 m. The remaining fungi, in general never reported in milk, were mostly environmental. Many of them resulted associated with plants as pathogens or symbionts. Finally, the highest sampled altitude yielded a significant fungal diversity (17 species). This work enlarges the knowledge of fungal consortia inhabiting raw milk and introduces microbial ecology among the altitude-dependent factors, in the composition of <b>Alpine</b> <b>pastures,</b> with the potential of shaping the properties of milks and cheeses, together with the already described physical, chemical and botanical variables.|$|R
