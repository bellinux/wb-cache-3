Figures for the final section before it joins the River Idle show that the levels of ammonia and {{dissolved}} oxygen are those which would be expected in a natural ecosystem.

Water quality is also measured by two biological indexes. These are NTAXA, which relates to the total number of invertebrate species found in samples of the water, and ASPT, (the Average Score Per Taxon), calculated from the numbers of specific invertebrates which are graded according to their sensitivity to organic pollution. The assessment for the years 2004 to 2006 rated the final section as grade A (very good) on the first index, and grade B (good) on the second. This indicates that the water is not far short from unpolluted.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that PPIs have {{revolutionized}} the treatment of GERD, there is still <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>improvement</b> in the speed of onset of acid suppression as well as mode of action that is independent of an acidic environment and also better inhibition of the proton pump. Therefore, {{a new class of}} PPIs, potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) or acid pump antagonists (APAs), have been under development the past years and will most likely be the next generation of drugs that suppress gastric activity. These new agents can in a reversible and competitive fashion inhibit the final step in the gastric acid secretion with respect to K+ binding to the parietal cell gastric H+/K+ ATPase. That is, they block the action of the H+/K+ ATPase by binding to or near the site of the K+ channel. Since the binding is competitive and reversible these agents have the potential to achieve faster inhibition of acid secretion and longer duration of action compared to PPIs, resulting in quicker symptom relief and healing. The imidazopyridine-based compound SCH28080 was the prototype of this class, and turned out to be hepatotoxic. Newer agents that are currently in development include CS-526, linaprazan, soraprazan and revaprazan in which the latter have reached clinical trials. Studies remain to determine whether these or other related compounds can become useful. In June 2006, Yuhan obtained approval from the Korean FDA for the use of revaprazan (brand name Revanex) in the treatment of gastritis.|$|E
