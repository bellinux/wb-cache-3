60|$|As Gravity {{makes the}} Sea flow round the denser and weightier Parts of the Globe of the Earth, so the Attraction {{may make the}} watry Acid flow round the denser and {{compacter}} Particles of Earth for composing the Particles of Salt. For otherwise the Acid would not do the Office of a Medium between the Earth and common Water, for making Salts dissolvable in the Water; nor would Salt of Tartar readily draw off the Acid from dissolved Metals, nor Metals the Acid from Mercury. Now, as in the great Globe of the Earth and Sea, the densest Bodies by their Gravity sink down in Water, and always endeavour to go towards the Center of the Globe; so in Particles of Salt, the densest Matter may always endeavour to approach the Center of the Particle: So that a Particle of Salt may be compared to a Chaos; being dense, hard, dry, and earthy in the Center; and rare, soft, moist, and watry in the Circumference. And hence {{it seems to be}} that Salts are of a lasting Nature, being scarce destroy'd, unless by drawing away their watry Parts by violence, or by letting them soak into the Pores of the central Earth by a gentle Heat <b>in</b> <b>Putrefaction,</b> until the Earth be dissolved by the Water, and separated into smaller Particles, which by reason of their Smallness make the rotten Compound appear of a black Colour. Hence also it may be, that the Parts of Animals and Vegetables preserve their several Forms, and assimilate their Nourishment; the soft and moist Nourishment easily changing its Texture by a gentle Heat and Motion, till it becomes like the dense, hard, dry, and durable Earth in the Center of each Particle. But when the Nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central Earth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the Motion ends <b>in</b> Confusion, <b>Putrefaction,</b> and Death.|$|R

40|$|As wild felids are obligate carnivores, it {{is likely}} that poorly enzymatically {{digestible}} animal tissues determine hindgut fermentation, instead of plant fibre. Therefore, faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA, including branched-chain fatty acids, BCFA), indole and phenol were evaluated in 14 captive cheetahs, fed two different diets differing in proportion of poorly enzymatically digestible animal tissue. Using a cross-over design, the cheetahs were fed exclusively whole rabbit or supplemented beef for 1 month each. Feeding whole rabbit decreased faecal propionic (p < 0. 001) and butyric (p = 0. 013) acid concentrations, yet total SCFA was unaltered (p = 0. 146). Also, a remarkably higher acetic acid to propionic acid ratio (p = 0. 013) was present when fed whole rabbit. Total BCFA (p = 0. 011) and putrefactive indole (p = 0. 004) and phenol (p = 0. 002) were lower when fed whole rabbit. Additionally, serum indoxyl sulphate, a toxic metabolite of indole, was analysed and showed a quadratic decrease (p = 0. 050) when fed whole rabbit. The divergent SCFA ratios and the decrease <b>in</b> <b>putrefaction</b> when fed whole rabbit could be caused by the presence of undigested tissue, such as skin, bone and cartilage, that might have fibre-like functions. The concept of animal fibre is an unexplored area of interest relevant to gastrointestinal health of captive cheetahs and likely other felids...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of different levels (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 %) and durations (30, 45 and 60 days) of salt preservation for controlling putrefaction on sheepskin at low (Metehara), mid (Debre Zeit) and high (Debre Birhan) altitudes of Ethiopia to determine technically acceptable levels of salting and stocking periods. A randomized complete block design was applied, in which site (altitude) and stocking (preservation) period in shed were taken as blocks over the five treatments. Each treatment group had ten replications across sites and treatments, to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference <b>in</b> <b>putrefaction</b> due to different levels of salt, stocking periods and altitude. Therefore, a total of 3 x 3 x 5 x 10, or 450 individual skins were used in the trial. The experimental skins were collected from the major central market in Addis Ababa, and were randomly allocated to the three sites. The proportion of skin area putrefied (%) was used as the response variable. The results of the aggregate analysis for the three sites showed that the proportion of skin area putrefied differed highly significantly (P< 0. 0001) between sites, salt levels and stocking periods. The largest overall least squares mean putrefaction proportion of 17. 15 % was observed in Metehara, followed by 5. 05 % for Debre Zeit and 0. 39 % for Debre Birhan. The interaction of site with salt levels was found to be very highly significant, which led to separate analysis of the data by site. The results showed that in Metehara up to 40 % salt level is required to meaningfully arrest <b>putrefaction</b> <b>in</b> preserved sheepskin for stocking periods of up to 60 days. For Debre Zeit and similar agro-ecological areas, a salt level of 30 % suffices to provide similar protection. For areas like Debre Birhan, and possibly those at higher altitudes, salt levels between 20 and 30 % provide adequate preservative for up to 60 days...|$|R
