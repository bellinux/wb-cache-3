Combining the GIS spatial analysis method with the scenario—planning, simulating and contrasting scenarios for <b>regional</b> <b>key</b> development zones, this study determines regional development strategies. Findings show that the GIS-SCENARIO analysis method can quantitatively analyze factors influencing the spatial distribution more accurately. Considering fully complex real situation and combined with reasonable value judgments, the GIS can provide various factors with a spatial analysis platform to contact and contrast with each other. As a strategic planning approach, it enables decision makers decide relatively reasonably in an uncertain and unpredictable situation and improves rationality in planning...|$|E

In this context, both its general social profile and marked, cohort-specific internal differentiations will be analysed.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{regional}} development policies are {{to focus on}} programs to identify key industries or clusters to promote regional competitiveness.

Turkey has seven geographical regions which are typically different with respect to economic development. The paper aims to identify key industries in each region which could further be explored to specify regional industry clusters. Clusters are interconnected enterprises and institutions in a particular field that encompasses an array of linked concentration of industries. Such a concentration will benefit from external economies. The basic idea behind clusters is that a firm will benefit from being part o...|$|E
