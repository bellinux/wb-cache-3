500|$|By {{the end of}} the Seven Years' War, Custine was maestre de camp. The Duc de Choiseul {{recognized}} his talent and created a regiment of dragoons for him, but Custine exchanged this for a regiment of infantry that was heading for America, where he could continue military action, acquire additional experience, and obtain promotion. His regiment, the Regiment de Saintonge (1,322 men and officers), embarked for the Thirteen Colonies in April 1780 from Brest. There, he served with distinction against the British as a colonel in the expeditionary force of [...] Count Rochambeau in the War of American Independence. The regiment participated in the Virginia campaign of 1781 and received distinguished commendations for action at the Battle of Yorktown; Custine received individual <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> and a brevet from the United States government. Rouchambeau's reports praised his honesty, zeal, courage and talents. Following the surrender of the British, his regiment wintered in Williamsburg, Virginia and departed for the Antilles in December 1782, {{with the rest of the}} expeditionary force. On his return to France, Custine was named maréchal de camp (brigadier general) and appointed governor of Toulon. He also resumed responsibilities as the proprietor of the dragoon regiment de Rouergue.|$|E
2500|$|Lawyers {{continue}} to be appointed Queen's Counsel {{by the federal government}} and seven of the ten Canadian provinces. [...] The award has been criticised in the past on the basis that appointment as Queen's Counsel depended largely on political affilitiation, as well as suggestions that its monarchical connotations were not consistent with modern Canadian identity. [...] However, in those provinces which {{continue to}} appoint lawyers as Queen's Counsel reforms have been made to de-politicise the award. Candidates are increasingly screened by committees composed of representatives of the bench and the bar, who give advice to the relevant Attorney General on appointments. [...] The reforms have been designed to make the award a <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> by individual members of the bar, often coupled with community service.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{received}} this assurance {{as a young}} soldier, still panting from a slight skirmish {{in which he has}} come off with honour, might receive a pat on the shoulder from his colonel. Like such a <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> it seemed to come with authority. How could the lightest word do less {{on the part of a}} person who was prepared to say, of almost everything Isabel told her, [...] "Oh, I've been in that, my dear; it passes, like everything else." [...] On many of her interlocutors Madame Merle might have produced an irritating effect; it was disconcertingly difficult to surprise her. But Isabel, though by no means incapable of desiring to be effective, had not at present this impulse. She was too sincere, too interested in her judicious companion. And then moreover Madame Merle never said such things in the tone of triumph or of boastfulness; they dropped from her like cold confessions.|$|E
