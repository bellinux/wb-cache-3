40|$|When supernates {{from the}} {{established}} human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7 {{were applied to}} fetal rat long bones that had been labeled with 45 Ca and devitalized to remove endogenous bone cells, mineral {{was released from the}} bones. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> bone mineral by MCF- 7 supernates was associated with increased basal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> hydrolytic enzyme activity by the tumor cells. The basal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> lysosomal enzymes and collagenolytic activity by MCF- 7 cells with approximately twice that of mouse 3 T 3 cells, which did not cause mineral release by the fetal rat bones. <b>Release</b> <b>of</b> hydrolytic enzymes and bone mineral-releasing activity was increased by colchicine and vinblastine, drugs that inhibit microtubule assembly, but not affected by lumicolchicine. Time-course experiments performed on MCF- 7 cells with or without colchicine showed that <b>release</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D and collagenolytic activity was associated more closely with <b>release</b> <b>of</b> bone mineral and degradation of bone matrix than was the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> N-acetylglucosaminidase. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> previously incorporated [3 H]proline from the bones exposed to MCF- 7 cell cultures was more closely associated with <b>release</b> <b>of</b> collagenolytic activity by MCF- 7 cells than with <b>release</b> <b>of</b> cathepsin D or N-acetylglucosaminidase. These data suggest that breast cancer-mediated bone resorption in vitro is positively correlated with <b>release</b> <b>of</b> hydrolytic enzymes by the tumor cells, and <b>release</b> <b>of</b> these enzymes is enhanced by disassembly of microtubules...|$|R
40|$|The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> {{gamma-aminobutyric acid}} (GABA) and {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) from the strips of guinea-pig ileum {{was investigated in}} the presence of neurotensin. Neurotensin evoked the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-GABA from the strips preloaded with [3 H]-GABA, and the evoked release was Ca 2 +-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive. Hexamethonium, scopolamine, [D-Pro 2,D-Trp 7, 9] substance P and pretreatment with substance P did not alter the neurotensin-evoked <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-GABA. Pretreatment with neurotensin inhibited the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-GABA evoked by neurotensin but not by high K+, thereby indicating that neurotensin induced a specific desensitization of its own receptor. These observations indicate that neurotensin may stimulate the GABAergic neurone through its own receptor. Neurotensin evoked the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-ACh from strips preloaded with [3 H]-choline and this release was Ca 2 +-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive. The evoked <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-ACh was not affected by hexamethonium, scopolamine and [D-Pro 2,D-Trp 7, 9] substance P. Bicuculline partly inhibited the neurotensin-evoked <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]-ACh; thus neurotensin seems to induce a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh partly through the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> endogenous GABA. All this evidence indicates that neurotensin induces <b>release</b> <b>of</b> GABA as well as ACh from the myenteric neurones of the guinea-pig ileum...|$|R

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) {{stimulated the}} <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid in hippocampal neurons cocultured with glial cells {{but not in}} glial {{cultures}} alone. Similar results were observed for the 5 -HT-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> inositol phosphates. These results suggest a neural but not glial origin of both responses. Pharmacological studies suggested that <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid and inositol phosphates was mediated by a type 2 5 -HT (5 -HT 2) receptor. 5 -HT-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid was also detected in cortical neurons, which contain high levels of 5 -HT 2 receptors, but not striatum, spinal cord, or cerebellar granule cells, which have very low levels or are devoid of 5 -HT 2 receptors. The phorbol ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate augmented the 5 -HT-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid but inhibited the 5 -HT-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> inositol phosphates. 5 -HT-stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid, but not inositol phosphates, was dependent on extracellular calcium. 5 -HT stimulated the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]lysophosphatidylcholine from [3 H]choline-labeled cells with no increase in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> [3 H]choline or phospho[3 H]choline. These data suggest that 5 -HT stimulated the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> arachidonic acid in hippocampal neurons through the activation of phospholipase A 2, independent of the activation of phospholipase C...|$|R

40|$|The {{action of}} certain {{substances}} on the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin {{has been studied}} in unanaesthetized lactating rats. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin has been assessed by the increase in weight after suckling of rats separated overnight from the mother. A large variety of substances appear to block the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin. These include pentolinium, atropine and chlorpromazine. Adrenaline and noradrenaline also cause a block in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin, and {{it is suggested that}} adrenaline blocks the central <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin as well as blocking its peripheral action. Reserpine and oestradiol in the doses administered did not block the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> oxytocin. Block also occurred after the ingestion of water, ethanol and normal saline, an effect which may be produced indirectly by impulses from the gastro-intestinal tract...|$|R
40|$|The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> dynorphin-(1 - 17), {{somatostatin}} {{and substance}} P into the venous effluate of the isolated and vascularly perfused guinea-pig small intestine was measured during rest and peristaltic activity. The peptides {{were determined by}} specific radioimmunoassays. Increasing the intraluminal pressure by 5 mbar increased the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> dynorphin-(1 - 17), somatostatin and substance P. A substantial increase in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> substance P was only seen {{in the presence of}} naloxone (1. 5 microM) indicating an inhibitory influence of opioid peptide-containing neurones on the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> substance P. The pressure-induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> substance P and dynorphin-(1 - 17) was completely prevented by tetrodotoxin (1. 3 microM), which suggests a neural origin of these two peptides. The pressure-induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> somatostatin was only partially inhibited by tetrodotoxin (1. 3 microM) suggesting that somatostatin may also be released from non-neuronal sources, i. e. endocrine mucosal cells. Dimethylphenylpiperazinium (32 microM) increased the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> somatostatin and substance P and this effect was inhibited by tetrodotoxin (1. 3 microM). Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (38 nM) induced a large increase in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> somatostatin but only a minute increase in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> substance P; these effects of cholecystokinin-octapeptide were not blocked by tetrodotoxin (1. 3 microM). Noradrenaline (59 microM) inhibited the pressure-induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> substance P but not that induced by dimethylphenylpiperazinium (32 microM). Neither the pressure-induced nor the dimethylphenylpiperazinium-evoked <b>release</b> <b>of</b> somatostatin was significantly diminished by noradrenaline. These results indicate that dynorphin-(1 - 17), somatostatin and substance P may be transmitters involved in the coordination of the peristaltic reflex. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} theatrical <b>releases</b> <b>of</b> {{the original}} Star Wars trilogy, Jabba the Hutt {{first appeared in}} Return of the Jedi (1983), though he is mentioned in Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt {{was added to the}} 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media <b>releases</b> <b>of</b> Star Wars. Jabba is introduced as the de facto leader of the Desilijic-Hutt Cartel, and the most powerful crime boss on Tatooine, who has a bounty on Han Solo's head. Jabba employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. He keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal at his palace: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has a grim sense of humor, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls, and torture.|$|E
40|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to roentgenographic contrast media (RCM) {{are associated with}} the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> mediators including complement components (anaphylatoxins), histamine and serotonin. In an in vitro study of platelets and leukocytes from 20 healthy individuals, RCM-induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> granules from basophils and platelets was correlated with the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> histamine and serotonin respectively. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> histamine from basophils was augmented in the presence of exogenous complement; in contrast, the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> serotonin from platelets was not dependent on the addition of exogenous complement.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> {{adenosine}} on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> acetylcholine (ACh) {{was investigated}} in slices of rat cortex perfused with Krebs solution, at rest and during electrical stimulation at frequencies between 0. 2 and 20 Hz. Electrical stimulation brought about a linear increase in <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh. Adenosine, in concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 microM, reduced in a dose-dependent manner the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh and was more active on the stimulated than on the resting release. However, the fractional reduction by adenosine <b>of</b> stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh did not vary with increasing stimulation rate. Adenosine triphosphate was less active than adenosine in reducing <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh. The inhibitory effect of adenosine was antagonized by aminophylline (0. 5 mM) and did not occur when the stimulated <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh was enhanced by blocking muscarinic autoreceptors with atropine (15 nM). Aminophylline (0. 1 and 0. 5 mM) itself exerted a biphasic effect on <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh, increasing it at rest and during stimulation at low frequencies, and decreasing it at higher stimulation rates. The manipulation of endogenous adenosine concentrations by adding adenosine deaminase or diphyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine uptake, {{had little effect on}} <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh. Dipyridamole, (4 microM), only significantly decreased <b>release</b> <b>of</b> ACh at the 20 Hz stimulation rate...|$|R
40|$|The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> leukotrienes and {{histamine}} from {{guinea pig}} lung and trachea after immunological and nonimmunological stimulation were compared. Antigen, ionophore A 23187 and melittin caused the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> leukotriene (LT) B 4, LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4 from lung and trachea {{as determined by}} reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and bioassay. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTB 4 by lung and trachea was maximum after 5 min of ionophore stimulation (128 +/- 40 and 142 +/- 29 pmol/g tissue, respectively). Lung, but not trachea, also released the 20 -OH-LTB 4 and 20 -COOH-LTB 4. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTC 4 by lung tissues was maximum after 5 min, whereas maximal tracheal responses occurred at 10 min (27 +/- 11 and 9 +/- 3. 5 pmol/g tissue, respectively). Maximal <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTD 4 by lung and trachea respectively occurred after 10 and 15 min (103 +/- 21 and 20 +/- 6 pmol/g tissue, respectively). The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTD 4 in response to ionophore by both tissues decreased after 15 min, whereas the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTE 4 continued to increase. <b>Release</b> <b>of</b> leukotrienes from melittin stimulated lung was 2 - 3 -fold less than in ionophore stimulation. In contrast, tracheal responses to melittin and ionophore for the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTB 4 were equivalent, whereas <b>release</b> <b>of</b> peptidoleukotrienes in response to melittin was approximately 50 % that resulting from ionophore. Antigen challenge was the least potent stimulus for LTB 4 release in both tissues, whereas {{it was at least}} as potent as melittin for the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> peptidoleukotrienes. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> histamine by lung tissue was approximately 2 - 3 -fold greater than by trachea (7 +/- 1 and 2 +/- 0. 5 nmol/g tissue, respectively) after 5 min of stimulation with either ionophore, melittin or antigen. These data demonstrate that lung tissues and trachea respond to immunologic stimulations by <b>releasing</b> the mediators <b>of</b> inflammation and immediate hypersensitivity. The lung releases peptidoleukotrienes and histamine 2 - 5 -fold greater than the trachea, whereas the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> LTB 4 in both tissues are approximately equal...|$|R
