500|$|Described by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as [...] "a female Humphrey Bogart", Bela is [...] "a {{little bit}} manipulative" [...] and she [...] "always {{wants to be}} in control". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] <b>really</b> <b>never</b> come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] give a shit about the cause". Gamble believed that Bela [...] "finds it quite amusing" [...] that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, [...] "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".|$|E
500|$|Böcker and the arrangers {{intended}} the arrangements in the concert to be [...] "about telling {{the stories of}} the games". In order to [...] "capture the atmosphere of the games", they limited the concert to three games from the series, so as not to spread the concert too thin. They chose the games to be Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X, not only because they liked the music in the games but because they felt previous concerts, including to an extent Symphonic Fantasies and Odysseys, had failed to evoke the feeling of the games due to focusing on the battle music in an unbalanced manner. In an interview Böcker used Final Fantasy VII as an example, stating that only part of [...] "the game's dark, romantic, melancholic, and hopeful story" [...] was being portrayed by solely orchestrating the battle music from the game. Böcker wanted to focus on [...] "longer pieces [...] deeper storytelling" [...] than other concerts like the Distant Worlds series, so as to offer fans [...] "something they <b>really</b> <b>never</b> heard before". Final Symphony was the first concert produced by Merregnon Studios without outside financial support, and Böcker regards it as the riskiest venture Merregnon Studios had undertaken to date, as they could only rely on their own belief that audiences would respond strongly enough to the concert for it to be successful despite the production costs of producing a concert of the quality they wanted.|$|E
500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} <b>really</b> <b>never</b> been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E

2500|$|Just as Harris {{appeared}} {{poised to}} join the first ranks of Broadway stars, she stopped appearing on stage after The Apple Tree, except for the off-Broadway first American production of Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny in 1970, in which she {{played the role of}} Jenny, originally created by Lotte Lenya. In the 2002 interview, Harris said, [...] "Who wants to be up on the stage all the time? It isn't easy. You have to be awfully invested in the fame aspect, and I <b>really</b> <b>never</b> was. What I cared about was the discipline of acting, whether I did well or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contrary {{to public}} rumor, Hammer {{claimed he was}} <b>really</b> <b>never</b> [...] "down-and-out" [...] as {{reported}} by the media (eventually expressed on The Opie & Anthony Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2009). Originally having an estimated net worth of over $33 million according to Forbes magazine, speculations about Hammer's status first emerged during delays between albums Too Legit to Quit and The Funky Headhunter, with Hammer having spent much of his money on staff and personal luxuries. In addition to excessive spending while supporting friends and family, Hammer ultimately became $13 million in debt. With dwindling album sales, unpaid loans, a large payroll, and a lavish lifestyle, Hammer eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Oakland, California on April 1, 1996. The case was converted to Chapter 7 on September 23, 1998, but Hammer was denied a bankruptcy discharge on April 23, 2002.|$|E
