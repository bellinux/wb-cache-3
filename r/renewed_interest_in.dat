Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.

5|$|By {{the time}} Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck—about an Aylesbury duck {{although}} set in Cumbria—caused <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements {{such as the}} incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed.

The last few decades of the 20th century saw a <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth. There was also a <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla.
