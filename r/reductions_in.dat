40|$|This {{research}} {{measured the}} effects of Michigan's compulsory safety belt use law on traffic crashes and injuries of various severities. Using time-series methods, the authors analyzed monthly frequencies of crash-induced injuries and fatalities from January 1978 through December 1987. Exposure to risk of occupant injury was controlled statistically by including aggregate frequency of crashes as a covariate in time-series models. Effects of economic conditions on traffic crashes were controlled by including an index of unemployment as a covariate. The following statistically significant effects {{were associated with the}} safety belt law: (a) In crashes with minor vehicle damage, there was a 14. 6 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> B-level injuries, an 11. 0 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> C-level injuries, and a 13. 0 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> aggregate (KABC) injuries; (b) in crashes with moderate vehicle damage, there was a 16. 8 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> A-level injuries, an 11. 6 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> B-level injuries, a 10. 7 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> C-level injuries, and a 3. 6 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> aggregate (KABC) injuries; (c) in crashes with severe vehicle damage, there was a 6. 3 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> fatalities, an 11. 8 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> B-level injuries, a 4. 7 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> c-level injuries, and a 5. 8 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> aggregate (KABC) injuries; (d) for all vehicle damage severities, there was a 14. 0 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> B-level injuries, an 8. 3 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> C-level injuries, and a 6. 4 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> injuries to front-seat occupants.

40|$|Sanitary {{challenges}} {{negatively affect}} feed intake and growth, {{leading to a}} negative impact on animal well-being and economic losses. The aim {{of this study was to}} carry out a meta-analysis to quantify the dynamic feed intake and growth responses of growing pigs after a sanitary challenge. A database was constructed using 122 published experiments reporting the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the average daily gain (ADG) of pigs subjected to one of six sanitary challenges: digestive bacterial infections, poor housing conditions, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges, mycotoxicoses, parasitic infections and respiratory diseases. The responses to experimental challenges were calculated relative to that of a control group. Statistical analyses were carried out for each challenge to quantify the mean and the dynamic responses in feed intake and growth and to identify the basis of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> growth (i. e. <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> feed intake or <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> feed efficiency related to changes in maintenance requirements). All challenges resulted <b>in</b> a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADFI and ADG, with the strongest responses for mycotoxicoses, respiratory diseases and digestive bacterial infections (8 % to 23 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADFI and 16 % to 29 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADG). The <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADG was linearly related to the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADFI for digestive bacterial infections, LPS challenge, parasitic infections and respiratory diseases. For poor housing conditions and mycotoxicoses, the relationship was curvilinear. A 10 % <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADFI resulted <b>in</b> a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADG varying from 10 % for mycotoxicoses to 43 % for digestive bacterial infections. More than 70 % of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADG could be explained by the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADFI for mycotoxicoses, LPS challenge and respiratory diseases. For challenges associated with the gastrointestinal tract, a large part of the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> ADG was due to an increase in maintenance requirements, suggesting digestive and metabolic changes. A dynamic pattern <b>in</b> the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> feed intake and growth rate could be identified for digestive bacterial infections, mycotoxicoses and respiratory diseases. For digestive bacterial infections and mycotoxicoses, pigs did not fully recover from the challenge during the experimental period. The results of this study can be used to quantify the effects of a sanitary challenge in growth models of pigs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on plasma viscosity, serum levels of thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and vascular impedance in the uterine, bladder wall, internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries in normotensive and hypertensive postmenopausal patients. METHODS: Thirty postmenopausal patients underwent continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation at a dose of 50 microg/day and 12 -day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day every 2 months. The women {{were divided into two}} groups according to their blood pressure: normotensive women (Group 1, n= 14) and hypertensive subjects (Group 2, n= 16). Before starting HRT and after 6 months of therapy, the patients underwent: transvaginal ultrasonographic examination of the pelvic organs; Doppler examination of the blood flow velocities in the uterine, bladder wall, internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries; and analysis of plasma viscosity and plasma TXB 2. RESULTS: After 6 months of HRT plasma viscosity had decreased in both groups (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (14 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (10 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005) as had the TXB 2 levels (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (93 +/- 2) %, P< 0. 001; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (92 +/- 3) %, P< 0. 001). The mean percentage <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> plasma viscosity was smaller in hypertensive women than in normotensive women (P< 0. 05). There was also a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> vascular impedance in the uterine artery (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (16 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (19 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005), the bladder wall arteries (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (23 +/- 2) %, P= 0. 005; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (18 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005), the internal carotid artery (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (25 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (26 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005) and the ophthalmic artery (mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 1, (24 +/- 2) %, P= 0. 005; mean <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> Group 2, (16 +/- 1) %, P= 0. 005). The percentage <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> vascular impedance did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that transdermal HRT is effective in reducing plasma viscosity, TXB 2 levels and vascular impedance in the peripheral and central vessels both in normotensive and hypertensive postmenopausal patients...|$|R
