Presence of moisture in canal before obturation may posit {{a negative effect}} on the quality of canal sealing. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of canal contamination with saliva on apical microleakage. Methods: In this laboratory study, 58 human uni-root teeth were cleaned and shaped for obturation with gutta percha and sealer AH 26. In the case group, specimens were contaminated with human saliva immediately before obturation, whereas the teeth in the control group were kept dry. All canals were filled by lateral condensation technique. Moreover, the teeth were placed in methylene blue dye for 3 days. Dye penetration was measured using a stereomicrosope. As a matter of fact, the study data were analyzed via utilizing t-test. Results: A significant difference was found between the two groups in regard with the apical leakage(P< 0. 001). The microleakage mean of dye in the dry group was 3 / 48 mm, whereas it was 6 / 36 mm in the saliva contaminated group.

Consider a {{tree network}} {{that has been}} {{contaminated}} by a persistent and active virus: when infected, a network site will continuously attempt to spread the virus to all its neighbours. The decontamination problem is that of disinfecting the entire network using a team of mobile antiviral system agents, called cleaners, avoiding any recontamination of decontaminated areas. A cleaner is able to decontaminate any infected node it visits; once the cleaner departs, the decontaminated node is immune for t ≥ 0 time units to viral attacks from infected neighbours.

40|$|Abstract. The rise of {{the water}} level of the Pripyat river and the erosion {{associated}} with ice-jam events lead to the periodic inundation of the contaminated plain surrounding the Chernobyl power plant. This results in the re-suspension and dissolution of radioactive particles and their discharge into the Pripyat and Dnieper waters.

In a first phase, the estimated collective dose reduction associated with the construction of the dyke is presented. Then, the construction and maintenance costs of the dyke, as well as the expected benefits associated with dose reduction, are evaluated. The cost-benefit ratios which can be calculated on this basis are around unit, which tends to show that the benefits associated with the construction of the dyke would just compensate the construction and maintenance costs of the project.

De-contamination and, significantly, prevention of <b>re-contamination</b> of the environment could help in preventing/reducing this threat. Goldshield (GS 5) is a novel organosilane biocide marketed as a single application product with residual biocidal activity. We tested the hypothesis that GS 5 could provide longer-term residual antimicrobial activity than existing disinfectants once applied to surfaces. Thus, the residual bactericidal properties of GS 5, Actichlor and Distel against repeated challenge with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 were tested, and showed that GS 5 alone exhibited longer-term bactericidal activity for up to 6 days on 316 I stainless steel surfaces. Having established efficacy against S. aureus, we tested GS 5 against common healthcare acquired pathogens, and demonstrated that, on average, a 1 log 10 bactericidal effect was exhibited by GS 5 treated surfaces, although biocidal activity varied depending upon the surface type and the species of bacteria. The ability of GS 5 to prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation was measured in standard microtitre plate assays, where it had no significant effect on either biofilm formation or development. Taken together the data suggests that GS 5 treatment of surfaces may be a useful means to reducing bacterial contamination in the context of infection control practices...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of pathogens in semen can compromise {{the outcome of}} assisted reproductive treatment, together {{with the possibility of}} the female partner or offspring becoming infected. This is cause for concern, especially in South Africa with a high prevalence of HIV- 1. Most of these infected individuals are in their reproductive years with the desire to have their own genetically related children. Therefore, assisted reproductive treatment with effective risk reduction procedures, such as semen processing for the elimination of these pathogens is crucial. However, during sperm preparation by standard discontinuous density gradient centrifugation, the supernatant is aspirated to allow access to the purified sperm pellet. Pathogens from the upper layers can adhere to the inside surface of the test tube and flow down to re-infect the purified sperm sample. The use of a centrifuge tube insert may prevent the <b>re-contamination</b> of sperm samples after discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, seminal pathogens can bind specifically or non-specifically to spermatozoa, rendering semen decontamination procedures ineffective. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, have been demonstrated to effectively inactivate viruses and to break pathogen-sperm bonds. However, the addition of a protease to density gradient layers during semen processing could {{have a negative impact on}} sperm parameters. This research was therefore aimed towards the determination of: i) The effect of semen processing with trypsin and trypsin inhibitor on sperm parameters. ii) The prevalence of various bacteria in semen samples from men attending the Reproductive and Endocrine Unit at Steve Biko Academic Hospital. iii) The effectiveness of semen processing by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with a centrifuge tube insert, for the elimination of some of the most prevalent bacteria, white blood cells and in vivo derived HIV- 1. Evaluation of sperm parameters after semen processing indicated that trypsin and trypsin inhibitor did not have an impact on sperm mitochondrial membrane potential, vitality, motility and zona binding potential, or acrosin activity, respectively. Seminal bacteria were highly prevalent in patients wishing to participate in the Unit’s assisted reproductive program, with 49. 5 % of semen samples presenting with positive bacterial cultures. Semen processing by means of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with the tube insert, eliminated significantly more in vitro derived (spiked) bacteria and white blood cells from semen compared to processing without the insert. Furthermore, the semen decontamination procedure was effective in removing HIV- 1 RNA from 100 % of samples and proviral DNA from 98. 1 % of semen samples from HIV- 1 sero-positive patients. The effectiveness of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation for the elimination of seminal pathogens could, therefore, be improved by the addition of trypsin to the upper density layer, without supplementing the bottom layer with trypsin inhibitor. Additionally, semen decontamination efficiency could also be improved by the prevention of <b>re-contamination</b> of processed sperm samples by the utilization of a tube insert during discontinuous density gradient centrifugation.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to describe the temporal behaviour of the concentrations of a pollutant tracer within the urban environment of Barrow-in-Furness, NW England. The tracer used was 137 Cs derived primarily from wet deposition, on 3 May 1986, of the radioactive cloud from the Chernobyl reactor accident (28 April 1986). The 137 Cs activity deposited during this primary event was supplemented by a small secondary atmospheric deposition input of resuspended activity. The model was validated against the measured temporal behaviour of 137 Cs in urban dust for two outdoor reservoirs in which the only observed input of dust and activity was by atmospheric deposition. Further modelling studies on other reservoirs (both outdoors and indoors) confirmed the existence of additional input fluxes of dust and activity; the most significant of these being the mechanical transport of soil and degradation of construction material (outdoors) and the mechanical transport of outdoor dust and soil and incorporation of organic material (indoors). The model enabled estimates of the magnitudes of these additional fluxes to be made and mean dust mass residence times to be calculated (outdoors, 250 ± 110 d; indoors 29 ± 1 d, indicating {{the length of time}} that conservative dust-bound pollutants would be expected to remain in urban reservoirs with no secondary inputs following the primary contamination event.

For Bacillus cereus, it was identified that during post-process storage in an aseptic tank, there was potentially an air <b>re-contamination</b> due to filter efficiency loss (efficiency loss due to successive in-place sterilizations after cleaning operations), followed by B. cereus growth. Two options were then evaluated: i) reducing by one fifth of the number of filter sterilizations before renewing the filters, ii) designing new UHT-aseptic lines without an aseptic tank, i. e. without a storage period after the thermal process and before filling. Considering the uncertainty in the model, {{it was not possible to}} confirm whether these options had a significant influence on the risk associated with B. cereus. On the other hand, for Geobacillus stearothermophilus, combinations of heat-treatment time and temperature enabling the control or reduction in risk by a factor of ca. 100 were determined; for ease of operational implementation, they were presented graphically in the form of iso-risk curves. For instance, it was established that a heat treatment of 138 °C for 31 s (instead of 138 °C for 25 s) enabled a reduction in risk to 18 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[10; 34]× 10 (- 8)), instead of 578 × 10 (- 8) (95 % CI=[429; 754]× 10 (- 8)) initially. In conclusion, a modular risk model, as the one exemplified here with a UHT-aseptic line, is a valuable tool in process design and operation, bringing definitive quantitative elements into the decision making process...|$|E
40|$|In the South African context, {{upgrading}} to, {{and delivery}} of a basic water-supply service to small-community households is expected to bring benefits such as reduced exposure to contaminated drinking water. A basic water-supply service mostly means that water is distributed to the community via communal taps that {{are not on the}} households’ premises (DWA, 2003). While this is seen as an improvement, people still have to use plastic containers (mostly 20 - 25 ℓ volume) to collect water from the taps and store in their houses (Nala et al., 2003). Authors report that, from a health-related microbial water quality perspective, the management (e. g. poor container-hygiene practices) of household containers cause microbial <b>re-contamination</b> of good quality water (Gundry et al., 2004; Jagals et al., 2004; Jensen et al., 2002). This implies that household container water pose a risk of microbial infection to an individual if used for drinking without any household level disinfection. Providing clean water to households, even thought they might still have to use the containers, does limit the extent of the recontamination because of consistent use with the clean water as opposed to when communities use these containers to source contaminated surface waters (Mokoena et al., 2010). When the supply system fails, which was reported to happen frequently in the study area (Rietveld et al., 2009), the affected communities will return to their original source of water, using the same containers to collect what is often contaminated water (Momba et al., 2006). While it is plausible that the probable risk of infection will change with these service inconsistencies, it has not conclusively been shown what the effect of it might be on risk. This submission demonstrates how a quantitative microbial risk assessment (WHO, 2004) {{can be used as a}} tool to assess these shifts in risk, offering another technique to assess the effectiveness of a small-community water supply service. The aim of the study was assess, after implementation with subsequent operation and maintenance of two small-community water supply schemes, the effect of service delivery on the annual risk of bacterial infection for individuals based on pathogenic E. coli in the water that the people in the community drink...|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on the microbial contamination of orthodontic materials received from the manufacturer and if orthodontists pre-sterilise new products prior to use. These items may also become contaminated on the clinic or during laboratory construction. Recent regulations for decontamination in primary dental care (HTM 01 - 05) have been introduced requiring a 60 day limit for storage time of sterilised instruments. The aims of this investigation were to determine whether components of fixed and removable orthodontic appliances are free from microbial contamination prior to clinical use; to establish the current practice in orthodontics with regard to pre- sterilisation of new products and to investigate possible <b>re-contamination</b> of sterilised dental instruments. A range of orthodontic materials "as received" from the manufacturer and "bench-top exposed" items were investigated. Bacterial contamination during the construction of removable appliances was evaluated from initial impression, through to delivery of the final appliance. Molecular microbiological techniques were used to obtain bacterial DGGE profiles and facilitate 16 S rDNA identification. Questionnaires were distributed to consultant orthodontists to determine their current pre-sterilisation regimes for new orthodontic products. Twenty five dental mirrors were sterilised. These were tested (5 mirrors at each time point) for microbial contamination immediately after autoclaving and then at 31, 60, 90 and 124 days. Bacteria were isolated from "as received" bands, archwires and impression trays, but the level of contamination was low (0 - 3. 65 x 102 cfu ml"). This was similar for clinic items. Much higher levels were found on removable appliances (0. 97 x 102 - 1. 52 xl 03 cfu mll). There was no cross-contamination from patients to the laboratory; contamination occurred within the laboratory itself. The majority of consultant-led departments do not pre-sterilise materials from the manufacturer (88 - 97 %). There was no bacterial growth from sterilised dental mirrors after 5 days of incubation at 37 °C at any time period from 0 to 124 days post sterilisation. In conclusion, materials and appliances are not free from bacterial contamination prior to use in patients; improved cross infection control procedures are needed within the orthodontic laboratory. There is no current evidence for the 60 -day storage of sterilised dental instruments as advised by the Department of Health. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} practice, the {{radiation}} technologies for food product processing are extensively used; with that, free radicals {{are found in}} products. Scientists have not made a final conclusion about the complete safety of the method of radiation sterilization, so {{it is very important}} to control irradiated food products to determine a fact of irradiation and residual effects. The experimental data obtained on the domestic spectrometer EPR series Labrador Expert X, which was developed by Spektr LLC with the assistance of the research team of the authors from the Institute of Natural Sciences of UrFU named after Yeltsin B. N., indicate the presence of free radicals in the samples of boneless beef, which is probably associated with °Ccurrence of ante-mortem technological and slaughter stress in animals. Irradiation of the chicken meat samples carried out in laboratory conditions allows a comparison of the spectra before and after irradiation. The dose of irradiation of poultry was 12 kGy. This dose was selected based on the practice of recognizing the radiation doses of 10 - 12 kGy as safe, which was established in many countries. It was found that in the range of the magnetic fields from 3272 to 3280 Gs, there was a weak EPR signal with an amplitude of 7. 28 e- 05 and D less than 1. Such a background signal can be explained by stress in the birds, peculiarities of feeding and other factors. After irradiation at a dose of 12 kGy, the ESR signal increased in the range of the magnetic fields from 3273 to 3286 Gs and D was higher than 1. This technology or, in other words, radappertization, is an industrial sterilization of food products for long storage at positive temperatures, which precludes <b>re-contamination</b> by microorganisms. After irradiation, the fivefold increase in the amplitude of the ESR signal was observed and two additional signals with small amplitude appeared. The fact of irradiation/absence of irradiation of the samples was also confirmed by calculation according to GOST R 52529 - 2006. The need for further research of meat and meat products by the EPR method is obvious: to determine a fact of sterilization or radurization, to determine a radiation dose, to accumulate reliably established information on radiation sensitivity and to develop a methodological base for the use of an EPR spectrometer...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the impact of the}} adoption and implementation of the emerging concept of sustainable remediation to the practice of remediation in Nigeria. The study strategy was by desktop site risk assessment, conceptual site modelling, remediation options appraisal and sustainability assessment of a simulated petroleum-contaminated site (AIREGIN) in the Niger Delta of Nigeria coupled with stakeholder engagement. The literature available on the environmental and industrial geography of the Niger Delta was drawn upon {{in the creation of the}} simulated site for the assessment. Questionnaires were used to identify readily available remediation options for the treatment of petroleum-contaminated soil in Nigeria. The questionnaire, which was sent to thirty (30) respondents (ten (10) each from operators, regulators and contractors) identified eight remediation options (Monitored Natural Attenuation, Enhanced In-situ Bioremediation, Bio-piles, Composting, Land farming, Incineration, Thermal desorption and Excavation, retrieval and offsite disposal) as widely used in Nigeria and six (6) options (Bioventing, Phytoremediation, Soil flushing, Soil Vapour Extraction (SVE), Chemical Reduction and Oxidation and Soil washing) as easily importable into Nigeria. Remediation options appraisal carried out identified seven (7) options (Enhanced In-situ Bioremediation, Bio-piles, Composting, Landfarming, Incineration, Thermal Desorption and Bio-venting) as feasible for the site. This reflects the general practice in Nigeria, as most remediation projects are mostly biological and thermal treatments. Face to face and telephone interviews conducted with ten practitioners revealed a lack of knowledge, the existing legal framework, funding and incessant site <b>re-contamination</b> as major setbacks to the adoption of risk based land management in general and sustainable remediation in particular. The sustainability assessment and sensitivity analysis resulted in identifying Enhanced In-situ Bioremediation as the most sustainable remediation option for the AIREGIN site. The research identified as critical limitations to the implementation of sustainable remediation the lack of regulatory framework, lack of awareness and expertise, ambiguous target and intervention values leading to lack of consensus on remedial objectives, poor implementation of the existing risk assessment and options appraisal methods, lack of transparency and commitment in the implementation of existing regulatory regime and general lack of literature on sustainable remediation in Nigeria. The research has shown that existing legislation and guidelines in contaminated land management need to be revised to include sustainability assessment, the harmonization of the target and intervention values using scientific means to determine background values, extensive training and education of regulators; and the clear definition of the involvement and strategy of engagement of local communities in the remediation process by the Nigerian regulators. The impact of the adoption and implementation of sustainable development in Nigeria were viewed from legal, economic, social and environmental dimensions. It has been concluded that sustainable remediation brings to bear a structured and transparent means of deciding how to remediate contaminated lands and is implementable in Nigeria if the recommendations of this research are taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|The former El Paso ASARCO Smelting and Refining Co. {{operated}} between 1877 and 1999, the pyrometallurgic {{activity was}} estimated to have discharged excess of a 1, 000 tons of lead (Pb) into the atmosphere from 1969 - 71. It was estimated 96 tons of (Pb) were emitted {{on an annual basis}} from the standing ore and fluid beds. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that lead (Pb) is the heavy metal of the highest concentration within the vicinity of the smelter. After the smelter production ceased, flash flooding common to the southwest, such as the 2006 historic flood, increased transportation of superficial contaminants and was expected to have reduced initial concentrations located on the mountain east of the demolition zone of impact. This served as a “new” time stamp to base retrospective analysis of (Pb) distribution. Lead absorption by humans has been epidemiologically associated with delayed effects after exposure and chronic health issues including, but not limited to, renal disease, neurodegenerative disease, hypertension, and cognitive dysfunction at sub-regulatory levels 3 ̆c 10 µg/dL. The ASARCO smoke stacks were demolished in 2013. A discrepancy in the duration of run-time among the air-quality monitors the day of the demolition suggests that bystanders observing this event may have been exposed to (Pb) and other heavy metal contaminants. This study sought to investigate temporal changes in lead concentration within the vicinity of the former ASARCO site using pre-demolition recorded (Pb) concentrations and observations collected in 2015 {{to determine the extent to}} which lead may have been redistributed during the demolition event, or other plausible environmental agents governing redistribution processes. Lead concentrations were measured in the leaves of Creosote Bush (Larrea tridentata) and soil at the base of the plant. Creosote is a known bioaccumulator of lead that is susceptible to aeolian deposition, and to similar lead protein interactions that may result in oxidative stress as observed from human exposure to lead. This has rationalized it as a suitable bioindicator for lead recontamination and health impacts indicative of air quality corresponding to sub-regulatory Blood Lead Levels (BLL) 3 ̆c 10 µg/dL. Temporal comparison and analysis of soil (Pb) concentrations from 1993, 2001, and 2015 showed anomalously high (Pb) concentrations in 2015, suggesting the force of impact from the demolition of the former ASARCO smoke stacks in 2013 caused a localized <b>re-contamination</b> event 0. 5 to 0. 75 mile east of the designated demolition zone. Spatial analysis of azimuthal trends in (Pb) distribution provided evidence that long-term trends in wind direction appear to have been the dominant source of (Pb) distribution during the smelter operation. However, after smelter production seized, seasonal rain events and flash flooding likely served as the primary mode of transportation of these surficial contaminants, which is complicated by topography, flow dynamics, metal speciation, and particulate size and mass. ...|$|E
40|$|Fouling {{deposits}} were {{suspected of}} playing {{a pivotal role}} in the thermophile contamination problem experienced in the dairy industry during milk powder manufacture. The objective of this work was to investigate thermophile growth and develop an understanding of how fouling deposits affect thermophile contamination in milk powder plants. Pilot plant and laboratory scale studies were carried out investigating: The release of thermophiles from fouled and un-fouled surfaces; The survival of thermophiles in fouling during cleaning: The rate of <b>re-contamination</b> of thermal equipment after incomplete cleaning; and the adhesion of thermophiles to fouled and clean stainless steel. Thermophile contamination from the pilot plant equipment was also modelled mathematically. The bulk milk thermophile contamination from sanitised fouled and un-fouled surfaces was found to be not significantly different, showing that fouling deposits by themselves do not increase the steady state amount of bulk contamination and that the more important factor is the amount of surface area available for colonisation within the temperature growth range of the thermophiles. Milk fouling layers provided much greater protection against cleaning than that of biofilms alone. Thermophiles that survive cleaning or greater initial thermophile concentrations in the raw milk were shown to reduce the plant production time available before concentrations of thermophiles in the bulk milk became excessive (> 1 x 10 6 cfu. ml- 1). Therefore, cleaning procedures in milk powder plants need to remove or destroy all traces of thermophiles to allow the maximum possible run length. It is similarly important to obtain raw milk with the lowest possible thermophile load before processing. During adhesion studies, the number of thermophilic bacteria adhering to stainless steel surfaces increased with bulk cell concentration and increasing contact time for adhesion. The adhesion rate of thermophiles to whole milk fouling layers was found to be around ten times higher than the adhesion rate to stainless steel. Steady state modelling provided a quick estimate of the level of bulk milk contamination that can be expected, however it was dependent on obtaining accurate measurements of the surface numbers. Since surface numbers were underestimated by approximately a decade using techniques that dislodged but did not enumerate loosely adhered cells, the model under predicted the bulk milk contamination. Unsteady state modelling predicted the trends observed in the experimental data and provided reasonable estimates of the bulk contamination that can be expected over time from the pilot plant. Predictions from the model after changes in key parameters provide an insight to the magnitude of any reduction in contamination that can be made. The results of this work have demonstrated that thermopile contamination during dairy processing can be minimised through: Re/design operating equipment to minimise the residence time of the product in the range of 40 - 70 °C. Minimising the contact surface area of thermal equipment by use of alternative direct heating technologies. Minimising fouling by management of milk quality, optimising processing conditions, hygienic design of the plant equipment and ensuring the product mix is suited to the plant.

40|$|Adequate {{access to}} good quality {{drinking}} water {{is an important}} prerequisite for the wellbeing and survival of people. Increasing competition over scarce freshwater resources with continuous quality deterioration is becoming a serious problem {{in many developing countries}} like Ethiopia, where the technical, socioeconomic and political conditions are impeding the proper utilization of the required resource. The concern of low quality water is either due to direct health impacts of poor quality drinking water or a reduction in the palatability of water for humans or animal consumption. The use of contaminated water in food production and/or processing can also be a considerable health concern for people. In rural households, water is used for multiple purposes including income generating activities such as livestock farming. Generally, the interactions among livestock, water and rural communities are very complex. Studies addressing the extent of water scarcity and quality problems in Ethiopia in such contexts are still limited. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of water utilization by farmers and their livestock with respect to potential health and food safety impacts was carried out in two districts of Ethiopia. The specific objectives of the present study were to: (1) assess the constraints and challenges in meeting the water requirements of livestock kept by typical rural communities, (2) assess the utilization of water sources by livestock and people, (3) assess the suitability of water sources for human and livestock consumption based on microbiological and chemical quality indicators, (4) examine the microbiological quality of water at household levels and the potential health impacts, and (5) investigate the potential impacts of poor water quality on the microbiological safety of milk and milk products. The study was carried out in Lume and Siraro districts, both located in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Methodologically, the study encompassed different components: (1) a questionnaire survey complemented by focus group discussions with farmers, (2) assessments of the microbiological and chemical quality of water destined for human and/or livestock consumption, (3) microbiological assessments of milk and milk products produced and consumed by the local communities, and (4) a compilation of secondary data focusing on common human health problems in the districts. The questionnaire survey with 320 randomly selected farmers, the focus group discussions (n= 16) and the compilation of secondary data were carried out from July to October 2010. Water samples were collected from sources and household containers from December 2010 to January 2011 and July to August 2011, corresponding to dry and wet seasons, respectively. During both sampling periods, a total of 25 water sources (sites where water was utilised or fetched for the purpose of human and/or livestock consumption) were assessed for microbiological and chemical quality parameters. A total of 126 and 109 water samples from household containers were collected in the dry and wet season, respectively. In addition, a total of 53 samples of milk and milk products were collected during the wet season and analyzed for E. coli contamination. Water samples collected from ground and surface water sources were analysed for total dissolved solids, pH, manganese, chromium, fluoride, E. coli and total coliforms. The assessed parameters were selected based on their importance to health or aesthetic aspects of water for human and/or livestock uses. The water samples from household containers were only analyzed for microbiological parameters. A summary of disease reports (July 2009 -June 2010) was obtained from the Health Offices of the respective districts to assess the occurrence and impact of water-related human diseases. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the questionnaire survey data. Qualitative data collected in farmers’ group discussions were analyzed by organising the raised issues into logical categories. Mean ranks were calculated to compare the various constraints for livestock production mentioned by farmers. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare E. coli counts of water or milk between seasons and districts. The suitability of water sources for livestock and human consumption was evaluated by comparing the assessed quality parameters with recommended values. The study results showed that water sources intended for domestic and livestock uses were either ground water (hand-dug wells, boreholes) or surface water (river, dugout, surface runoff from roadsides). Challenges in the provision of water for livestock and/or people were associated with physical inaccessibility and high seasonal variation in the availability of water sources. Poor quality water for livestock drinking was rather a concern for communities in the proximity of urban settlements or industrial establishments. The mismanagement of harvested rainwater due to indiscriminate access of livestock to the sources was also found to pose high health risks on both livestock and people. Taking E. coli as an indicator of faecal pollution, the assessment of water samples showed that most of the surface water sources were contaminated with faecal materials and did not meet the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. On the other hand, groundwater sources were microbiologically safe, but chemically contaminated with elements such as fluoride and manganese. In total, 76 % of the water sources (n= 25 points) assessed in this study failed to comply with WHO guidelines for human drinking water in both, the dry and the wet season for at least one parameter of health or aesthetic concern. Regarding pH, fluoride, manganese and chromium, 32 % and 20 % of the water sources were found unfit for livestock consumption in the dry and wet season, respectively. Another potential water-related health risk identified in this study was the considerable <b>re-contamination</b> of water after collection from sources. This can severely compromise the expected health benefits from the installation of improved water sources. For the overall assessed water samples from household containers, it was found that E. coli contamination was higher during the rainy season compared to the dry season. The microbiological assessment of milk produced and consumed in the study area showed a considerable contamination with E. coli. Although the correlation between the E. coli counts of milk and water was weak (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient r= 0. 1), the recorded poor quality water still might have contributed to the low microbiological quality and safety of dairy products produced and consumed in the area. According to the secondary data collected from health offices, water-related human health problems potentially associated with the scarcity, poor quality and mismanagement of water sources were malaria, diarrhoea and gastro-intestinal parasites. Water-related livestock health problems were also reported by the farmers to be mainly associated with drinking water from stagnant dugouts and the industrially polluted Mojo River. In conclusion, the rural communities in the Rift Valley area of Ethiopia lack reliable access to safe water sources, with potential adverse health impacts. A possible priority of action that emanates from this study is a minimization of industrially associated water quality deterioration through the enforcement of existing environmental protection rules and regulations. Concurrently, awareness creation of the owners of the industries on the proper waste disposal mechanisms and environmental accountability should be targeted as one of the key aspects to alleviate the industry-related water pollution. On the other hand, in order to minimize the health risk associated with the mismanagement of rainwater harvesting systems, farmers should be technically supported by the local government in the proper design and management of the systems. Health education remains a necessary and crucial intervention to reduce the <b>re-contamination</b> of water. In this respect particularly women should be addressed, since they are customarily responsible for the collection and handling of water for domestic consumption...|$|E
40|$|Point-of-use (POU) {{drinking}} water treatment {{is a common}} method of providing {{drinking water}} in disaster relief situations when critical water infrastructure is damaged. In these cases, POU treatment devices {{can be used to}} treat local water until relief organizations set up more permanent water provision methods. One such POU technology is PŪR® Purifier of Water, a combined coagulation/flocculation and disinfection chemical treatment sachet produced by Procter 2 ̆ 6 Gamble. PŪR® has been shown to treat contaminated water to meet water quality standards and guidelines set by the U. S. EPA for water purifiers and by the World Health Organization and The Sphere Project for emergency relief. However, the standard two-bucket method of use for PŪR® has two primary drawbacks: (1) the need for appurtenances that may not be readily available in disaster relief situations and (2) lack of a means to protect treated water from <b>re-contamination</b> post-treatment. An alternative to the two-bucket method is a waterbag system under development at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. The waterbag is a ten-liter plastic bladder with integrated filter that incorporates an all-in-one approach to drinking water treatment during emergencies. In previous studies, the first version of the waterbag consistently met World Health Organization and The Sphere Project emergency drinking water guidelines, but did not meet the pathogen reduction requirements of the U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. A second (Mark II) version, with internal mixing baffles and a microfilter, was developed to overcome the inability of the first design to meet the U. S. EPA guidelines. The main purposes of the research presented herein were to (1) optimize the method of use and baffle configuration for the improved Mark II version of the waterbag, (2) determine ability of the waterbag to treat test waters with challenging initial water quality conditions, and (3) test the ability of the Mark II design and optimized method to meet the U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. For the first and second objectives, the main metric of treatment performance was the extent of flocculation, which was characterized by the turbidity of waterbag supernatant after 30 minutes of settling. The waterbag procedure was varied in several ways. The variables tested were mixing duration, mixing motion type, and the effect of a mixing delay. Several waterbag baffle designs were tested to determine the physical configuration of the waterbag which resulted in best turbulence during mixing. In addition, experiments were performed to test the ability of the Mark II waterbag to treat waters with various initial qualities, such as high organic carbon content and elevated E. coli concentrations. The results of these experiments helped to prepare for a final test in meeting the pathogen removal requirements of the U. S. EPA Guide Standard and Protocol for Testing Microbiological Water Purifiers. The procedure determined to be optimal for the Mark II waterbag treatment included five minutes of mixing using rapid 180 ° twisting motions at a moderate frequency of seventy 180 °-twists per minute. The optimal baffle design was a 12. 7 cm-wide internal mixing baffle with two cut circular holes for the promotion of turbulence during mixing. The desired post-treatment chlorine residual was achieved for different durations depending on initial organic carbon concentration. Optimal PŪR® dose to provide pathogen removals required by the U. S. EPA in the presence of Challenge Water conditions was two sachets per 10 L of water to be treated. The optimization of these design and operational procedures led to the ability of the Mark II waterbag to meet the pathogen, turbidity, pH, and non-microbiological constituent removals required by the U. S. EPA, The Sphere Project, and World Health Organization for emergency relief...|$|E
