5|$|The real Brian is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> but Stewie {{admits that}} he already gambled away their return tickets. Brian {{admits that he}} cannot call for help after taking money from Lois. Using money they got from a loan shark, they bet on a {{basketball}} game and lose yet again. Preparing to leave, the duplicated pair sitting nearby accidentally take the empty backpack from the unlucky pair, while the real Stewie takes the duplicated pair's backpack, which is full of money.|$|E
500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison said when he got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E
2500|$|Josie Pracht {{said this}} about boot camp, [...] "The {{first two weeks}} were miserable. I was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> I went to bed crying one night. The next day when I awoke, {{everything}} looked good to me. I found myself in a new worlda world of new friends, patriotism, and pride in serving my county as best I possibly could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very {{beautiful}} and right, Joe, and I honor you for it; {{but you were}} not meant to tend babies, so sing your last lullabies, and be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Home</b> as soon as I can get you there." ...|$|R
60|$|Now she {{was coming}} across the Green Meadows {{on her way to}} her home behind the Purple Hills, and as she came she opened the big bag she carried and called to her children, the Merry Little Breezes, who had been playing hard on the Green Meadows all the long day. One by one they crept into the big bag, for they were tired, too, and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> their <b>home</b> behind the Purple Hills.|$|R
5000|$|Karthik a {{last time}} <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> see father and son, before {{he wants to}} leave for Chennai, when then {{suddenly}} a car tries to hit Imman to death. Karthik, who was just <b>readying</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> comes back {{and is able to}} save Imman. Shocked by that incident, Karthik doesn’t believe that it was merely an accident and wants Naushad to tell the truth, who has been admitted to hospital after having been injured in the accident. Karthik then gets to know about Eashwar, who was the man in the car, and his intentions. Eashwar has bought the same car, which [...] "killed" [...] his family members and seeks revenge for their death by killing Naushad’s son Imaan in return to [...] "equal it". Karthik then decides to take Imaan along him to a nearby place, where he had stayed before, promising Naushad, that he will protect and look after Imaan.|$|R
2500|$|..... we well {{remember}} his giving a [...] "simultaneous" [...] at the Lincoln Chess Club in 1924, winning 17 and drawing two. One {{of his more}} elderly opponents (a notorious non-resigner) who for 30 moves had been wobbling along with a piece down until [...] "time" [...] had to be called, then proceeded to [...] "demonstrate a draw" [...] by concocting a continuation so optimistic that even clubmates with lifelong experience of his powers stood aghast. Atkins, with his greatcoat on <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> {{made no attempt to}} refute this analytical masterpiece but merely remarked with great deference: [...] "I don't think we can play it quite like that!" [...] and then beat a craven retreat [...] "escorted by Club Officials".|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Basil ran {{up with a}} message that Lady Delmar was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{donation}} {{party was}} at an end, that was clear, and the people began to get <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Bettie started to thank Lyman for his help.|$|E
60|$|All the {{afternoon}} they hunted and hunted and hunted, and all {{the afternoon}} Spotty the Turtle, with the nut in his mouth, was slowly, oh, so slowly, crawling straight back across the Green Meadows towards the old butternut tree. Round, red Mr. Sun was getting {{very close to the}} Purple Hills, where he <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> bed every night, {{and all the}} little meadow folks were getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> their <b>homes.</b> They were wondering and wondering what could have happened to the racers, when Sammy Jay spied the Merry Little Breezes dancing across the Green Meadows.|$|R
50|$|In January 1990, {{her career}} took an {{unexpected}} turn when Wayland Hicks, then a senior executive, offered Burns {{a job as}} his executive assistant. She accepted and worked for him for roughly nine months when she was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>home</b> because {{she was about to}} be married to Lloyd Bean. In June 1991, she became executive assistant to then chairman and chief executive Paul Allaire. In 1999, she was named vice president for global manufacturing.|$|R
60|$|He was {{naturally}} a pure-minded, simple-hearted man, {{and when}} {{one of the leaders of}} the moral party of his State was dragged out of a low resort, drunk and disorderly, in company with a leader of the Senate, his heart failed him. He was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resign and <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I made a bee-line for Mis Bascum's; {{told her}} the whole story, had a good cry, and was all <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> in half an hour, but Lisha didn't come.|$|E
6000|$|He was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> by November, but by {{no means}} had he had [...] enough of England. He really had some thought of {{returning}} there [...] permanently. In a letter to Mrs. Crane, at Quarry Farm, he wrote: ...|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hand}} in his, with {{the air of a}} child who was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Her wan face brightened for the first time. [...] "Thank you, sir," [...] she said; [...] "I'll go {{anywhere}} along with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|From the decided way {{in which}} Jenny Wren had popped into the little round doorway of her home, Peter knew that {{to wait in the}} hope of more gossip with her would be a waste of time. He wasn't <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>home</b> <b>to</b> the dear Old Briar-patch, yet there seemed nothing else to do, for {{everybody}} in the Old Orchard was too busy for idle gossip. Peter scratched a long ear with a long hind foot, trying to think of some place <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Just then he heard the clear [...] "peep, peep, peep" [...] of the Hylas, the sweet singers of the Smiling Pool.|$|R
50|$|At this point, Bill is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{leave and}} <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Graeme, however, decides that the Goodies should stay, and remain as {{competitors}} in the Eisteddfod, and to be as entertaining as possible. As a consequence, they put on an enthusiastic display of entertainment, and they bring down {{the wrath of the}} Reverend on their heads. The Reverend decides to sacrifice the Goodies.|$|R
5000|$|In 1975, Diallo was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Mali. In the {{newspaper}} {{he saw a}} contest in which the winner would {{get a job at}} the Department of Geology at the University du Quebec in Montreal. He took a piece of paper, identified 9 mistakes out of 10 in the formulation of the problem and won the contest. He was hired to work with a double collector mass spectrograph. In the Geology Department, Dr. Claude-Marcel Hillaire {{was in charge of the}} project. Using the stable isotope, Carbon-13 for dating instead of Carbon-14 which was radioactive. In the entire world, there were only four double collector mass spectrograph. One was in London where they were conceived and built. One was in Australia, another in Montreal, and the last, Yaya has forgotten where it was sold.|$|R
60|$|I waited as patiently and inconspicuously as I could, and at {{ten o'clock}} I saw that my man had {{obviously}} finished his work for the morning and had finally come down the stairs <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> I followed him.|$|E
60|$|All the confidences {{and all the}} caresses had, however, taken {{quite as}} long as the G.F.S. class, and before Constance had cleared a space on the table for Dolores's letter, there was a summons to say that Gillian was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rollo found a {{great many}} other things to {{interest}} him in the various stalls and stands that he visited; but at length he got tired of them all, and, {{coming back to the}} carriage, told his father that he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
6000|$|After {{they went}} out, Bradley {{sat down and}} {{wrote a letter to}} Judge Brown, embodying the main part of this conversation: [...] "It's enough to make a man curse his country and his God to see how things run," [...] he said, at the end of writing out the ex-clerk's terrible indictment. [...] "I feel that he is right. I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resign, and <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and never <b>go</b> into {{politics}} again. The whole thing is rotten to the bottom." ...|$|R
5|$|Cats are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> new <b>homes</b> {{at about}} 12 weeks of age, {{when they are}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around {{six to nine months}} of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|R
60|$|Again I {{found my}} way through Haymarket Square to Tremont street and so at last to the Common, which {{presented}} a cold and dismal face at this time. The glory of my dream had fled. The trees, bare and brown and dripping with rain, offered no shelter. The benches were sodden, the paths muddy, and the sky, lost in a desolate mist shut down over my head with oppressive weight. I crawled along the muddy walk feeling about as important as a belated beetle in a July thunderstorm. Half of me was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> surrender and <b>go</b> <b>home</b> on the next train but the other half, the obstinate half, sullenly forged ahead, busy {{with the problem of}} a roof and bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I suppose I am,' he answered; 'but then, you see, I {{have been}} making toys for {{hundreds}} of years, and I make so many {{it is no wonder}} I am skillful. And now, if you are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> I 'll hitch up the reindeer and take you back again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{our third}} day, I {{suggested}} Boston. To this he replied, [...] "No, I've had enough," [...] and there was a tired droop in his voice. [...] "I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> I'm all tired out with 'seeing things,' and besides it's time to be getting back to my garden." ...|$|E
60|$|Paul {{found his}} mother <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> She smiled on her son. He took the great bunch of flowers. Mr. and Mrs. Leivers {{walked down the}} fields with them. The hills were golden with evening; deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells. It was {{everywhere}} perfectly stiff, save for the rustling of leaves and birds.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Davis told The Wall Street Journal {{about his}} early career and his {{breakthrough}} with EC: I was about <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> give up, <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Georgia and {{be either a}} forest ranger or a farmer. But I <b>went</b> down <b>to</b> Canal Street and Lafayette, up in an old rickety elevator and through a glass door to Entertaining Comics where Al Feldstein and Bill Gaines were putting out horror comic books. They looked at my work and it was horrible and {{they gave me a}} job right away! [...] Every time you <b>went</b> in <b>to</b> see Bill Gaines, he would write you a check when you brought in a story. You didn't have to put in a bill or anything. I was very, very hungry and I was thinking about getting married. So I kept the road pretty hot between home and Canal Street. I would go in for that almighty check, <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and do the work, bring it in and get another check and pick up another story. the actual cross street to Lafayette was Spring Street, not Canal.|$|R
50|$|Supplies {{sent out}} by Sir Oliph Leigh arrived in January; they found {{everybody}} ill. Leigh himself was very weak and much changed. He resolved <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> promising {{the men that}} {{he would come back}} to them as soon as possible. He was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> but fell ill and died aboard his ship. He was buried on shore 20 March 1605.|$|R
50|$|After {{things have}} calmed down {{everyone}} <b>goes</b> <b>home</b> {{and we see}} Woody asleep and Lol getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
60|$|In {{this dilemma}} Troy at once {{went out to}} reconnoitre. It {{occurred}} to him that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible, would be a very wise act. He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the establishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field. It was now almost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts and gigs <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
60|$|The public-house is ubiquitous. It flourishes {{on every}} corner and between corners, and it is frequented almost as much by women as by men. Children {{are to be found}} in it as well, waiting till their fathers and mothers are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> sipping from the glasses of their elders, {{listening}} to the coarse language and degrading conversation, catching the contagion of it, familiarising themselves with licentiousness and debauchery.|$|E
6000|$|I had a wild {{desire to}} laugh at what followed, {{and yet it was}} not without its pathos. [...] "I--I--hm! hm! I--cannot see Mr. Kendricks just at present. I--the fact is, I {{do not want to see}} him. It is better--not. I think you had better get <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with me at once, daughter. I--hm!--cannot approve of any {{engagement}} to Mr. Kendricks, and I--prefer not to meet him." [...] He stopped.|$|E
60|$|Certainly things couldn't {{look much}} darker {{than they did}} to Happy Jack Squirrel {{as he sat in}} the big maple tree at the side of Farmer Brown's house, and saw jolly, round, red Mr. Sun getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed behind the Purple Hills. He was afraid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> his <b>home</b> in the Green Forest because Shadow the Weasel might be waiting for him there. He was afraid of the night which would soon come. He was cold, and he was hungry. Altogether he was as miserable a little Squirrel as ever was seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> or stay," [...] Archie said; [...] "I have no {{experience}} in your weather here, and would not urge you against your own judgment, whatever it be; but if you put out I am <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Then he bade all his {{servants}} and retainers <b>to</b> make <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> London Town, {{to see and}} speak with the King.|$|R
