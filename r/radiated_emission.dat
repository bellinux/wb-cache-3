40|$|This {{packaging}} design approach can help heritage hardware meet a flight project's stringent EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> requirement. The approach requires only minor modifications to a hardware's chassis and mainly concentrates on its connector interfaces. The {{solution is to}} raise the surface area where the connector is mounted by a few millimeters using a pedestal, and then wrapping with conductive tape from the cable backshell down to the surface-mounted connector. This design approach {{has been applied to}} JPL flight project subsystems. The EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> requirements for flight projects can vary from benign to mission critical. If the project's EMC requirements are stringent, the best approach to meet EMC requirements would be to design an EMC control program for the project early on and implement EMC design techniques starting with the circuit board layout. This is the ideal scenario for hardware that is built from scratch. Implementation of EMC <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> mitigation techniques can mature as the design progresses, with minimal impact to the design cycle. The real challenge exists for hardware that is planned to be flown following a built-to-print approach, in which heritage hardware from a past project with a different set of requirements is expected to perform satisfactorily for a new project. With acceptance of heritage, the design would already be established (circuit board layout and components have already been pre-determined), and hence any <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> mitigation techniques would only be applicable at the packaging level. The key is to take a heritage design with its known <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> spectrum and repackage, or modify its chassis design so that it would {{have a better chance of}} meeting the new project s <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> requirements...|$|R

50|$|Known as compromising emanations or TEMPEST radiation, a {{code word}} for a U.S. {{government}} programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data {{has been a significant}} concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations. Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the video display unit from the <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> by means of a normal television receiver. If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer. If more sophisticated receiving and decoding equipment is used, the maximum distance can be much greater.|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} fusion device the neutral atom density is small. Therefore, {{the amount of}} <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> that results from charge {{exchange}} between impurity ions and neutrals is also small. On MST, the neutral density is enhanced by injection of fast hydrogen atoms via a diagnostic neutral beam (DNB). As a result, the <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> is greatly increased, though primarily along the beam injection path (the DNB is located below the deck, and cannot be seen from here; the injection path is {{from right to left}} across the plasma).Perpendicular to the beam path, there exist a number of optical ports for viewing the plasma at different radial positions. For a given plasma discharge, a fiber bundle system is placed on one of these ports, and is used to collect emission along its line-of-sight (black tubes on top of the machine contain light collection optics; fibers are placed in the long, curved white tube when not in use). This emission is sent to a spectrometer (located in big purple box), where it is dispersed over a finite wavelength range — which is centered on the emission line of interest — by a pair of optical gratings. However, because the collected emission is dominated by radiation from along the beam path, the measurements are effectively localized to the intersection volume between the fiber view and the beam. On MST, this intersection volume is small (~ 2 cm3) compared to the plasma volume, allowing spatially resolved measurements of Ti and vi to be obtained. Data collected from a number of plasma discharges — for which the location of the fiber bundle system is varied — are used to construct radial profiles of the impurity ion temperature and velocity, providing important information for understanding the physics of plasmas in MST. Typical ion temperatures measured by CHERS on MST are in the range of 100 to 800 eV (2 million to 17 million degrees Fahrenheit), depending on position in the plasma and type of discharge. Likewise, measured equilibrium ion velocities are on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 meters per second.|$|E

Consequently, in the product it is essential to investigate, identify, model and predict the PCB <b>radiated</b> <b>emission</b> before compliance test is performed for cost and time saving. In this paper, a simple double layer PCB board is fabricated to investigate the PCB <b>radiated</b> <b>emission.</b> Three PCB configurations are investigated for the level of emissions and to correlate with the common-mode currents.

Given the complexity of directly measuring vehicular <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> in real traffic, the main contribution of this PhD thesis is to propose an indirect solution to estimate such type of vehicular emissions. Relating the on-road vehicular <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> with the driving profile is a complicated task. This is because {{it is not possible to}} directly measure the vehicular radiated interferences in real traffic due to potential interferences from another electromagnetic wave sources. This thesis presents a microscopic artificial intelligence model based on neural networks to estimate real traffic <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> of electric vehicles in terms of the driving dynamics. Instantaneous values of measured speed and calculated acceleration have been used to characterize the driving profile. Experimental electromagnetic interference tests have been carried out with a Vectrix electric motorcycle as well as Twizy electric cars in semi-anechoic chambers. Both the motorcycle and the car have been subjected to different urban and interurban driving profiles. Time Domain measurement methodology of electromagnetic <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> has been adopted in this work to save the overall measurement time. The relationship between the magnetic <b>radiated</b> <b>emissions</b> of the Twizy and the corresponding speed has been very noticeable. Maximum magnetic field levels have been observed during high speed cruising in extra-urban driving and acceleration in urban environments. A comparative study of the prediction performance between various static and dynamic neural models has been introduced. The Multilayer Perceptron feedforward neural network trained with Extreme Learning Machines has achieved the best estimation results of magnetic radiated disturbances as function of instantaneous speed and acceleration.
