5000|$|When {{the season}} is right, Duluth offers waves [...] "that can compare {{to some of the}} best surfing in Hawaii or California". In Duluth the right season for surfing is winter, {{especially}} during one of Lake Superior's infamous gales of November. Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, Minnesota Public Radio featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as [...] "...standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy." [...] Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. [...] "There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety." [...] Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up. The Lake Superior Surf Club maintains a website where they share information and photos.|$|E
5000|$|The Daily Mail had {{meanwhile}} discovered Bessell's whereabouts in California, and on 3 February 1976 {{carried a}} long {{interview with the}} former MP. Bessell's claim {{that he had been}} blackmailed by Scott provided Thorpe with temporary cover. On 6 March newspapers reported Holmes's purchase of Scott's dossier from Gleadle, and a few days later David Steel discovered from Dinshaw, a personal friend, that £20,000 of funds intended for the party had been diverted to Holmes and were unaccounted for. Steel told Thorpe that he should resign, but he refused. In an attempt to reassure his wavering parliamentary colleagues, on 14 March Thorpe made arrangements with The Sunday Times newspaper to publish a detailed rebuttal of Scott's charges, under the heading [...] "The Lies of Norman Scott". The [...] "Bunnies" [...] letter, February 1962"Since my letters normally go to the House, yours arrived all by itself at my breakfast table at the Reform, and gave me tremendous pleasure. I cannot tell you just how happy I am to feel that you are really settling down ... you can always feel that whatever happens Jimmy and Mary are <b>right</b> <b>behind</b> <b>you</b> ... no more bloody clinics ... In haste. Bunnies can (and will) go to France. I miss you" [...] Extracts from a letter from Thorpe to Josiffe, February 1962. Newton's trial took place at Exeter Crown Court from 16 to 19 March 1976, where Scott repeated his allegations against Thorpe despite the efforts of the prosecution's lawyers to steer him away. Newton was found guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, but he did not incriminate Thorpe. However, Thorpe's difficulties increased when Bessell, fearing for his own position and perhaps scenting the possibility of making money, changed his stance and confessed in the Daily Mail on 6 May that he had lied to protect his former friend. A further concern for Thorpe was the danger that newspapers would publish letters he had sent to Scott early in their friendship. In an effort to forestall this, Thorpe arranged for the publication of two of the letters in The Sunday Times, a paper generally sympathetic towards him. In one of these letters Thorpe referred to Scott by the pet name [...] "Bunnies". The tone of this letter convinced readers and commentators that Thorpe had not been frank {{about the nature of the}} relationship. On 10 May 1976 he resigned as Liberal leader amid rising criticism, again categorically denying Scott's allegations but acknowledging the damage that they were inflicting on the party.|$|E

And the scene was with Jason, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to burst into laughter.

In the spring of 2012, she was contacted again by the series and she auditioned for the role of [...] "Maya." [...] Castillo admitted that she didn't think they even came up with her character's real name until the day before she was to start taping her first scenes. She once again tested with Thompson. Castillo was chosen out of hundreds of other actresses for the role of Sabrina. After several weeks of waiting, she was contacted by the show again and read for executive producer, Frank Valentini. She went back for another chemistry test in late August. Castillo began filming her scenes on August 31, 2012. During the audition, the actresses started out getting [...] "pretty" [...] to do a fantasy scene in which the character admits her love for Patrick, and then transforming into a nerdy girl with glasses for the rest of the scene. To make sure she stood out from the 9 other actresses that the producers had called back, Castillo admitted that she [...] "decided to have fun." [...] Several days later, Castillo learned from her manager that she had booked the role. The character first appeared on September 19, despite some sources stating the first air date to be September 14. The date may have been confused with Emily Wilson's first appearance as Ellie Trout, who did appear on the 14th. Castillo originated the role on a contractual basis.|$|E
