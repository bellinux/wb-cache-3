40|$|On May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice decided, in {{the case}} of Google Spain, that search engines are bound to remove, upon request, results {{pointing}} to websites holding “inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive” information about European citizens, thus granting the latter a so-called ‘Right to be Forgotten,’ or more precisely a ‘Right to be Delisted. ’ In the case at hand, it was found that European principles of data protection applied to Google’s search engine business through the presence of Google Spain, a locally-focused advertising management office established in Madrid. Left unexplored, however, was the question of whether other foreign search engines that have fewer contacts with the legal order of the European Union, such as Duck Duck Go, also fall under its scope. With this interrogation over the extraterritorial application of EU data protection law as a starting point, the paper confronts, {{through the use of a}} private international law inspired methodology, the scope rules of Directive 95 / 46 /EC on data protection against hypothetical cases involving search result delisting requests. Through the results so obtained, it highlights that, due to a rift between the individual, personality focused nature of the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Delisted</b> and the processing, data controller oriented nature of the scope rules of the Directive, answering these questions remains a convoluted and inconsistent process akin to hammering square pegs into round holes. It concludes by proposing solutions, both de lege lata and de lege ferenda, which may inspire further developments...|$|E
40|$|The {{digital era}} invoked new {{challenges}} to judicial systems. The Internet enabled {{violation of privacy}} and intellectual property rights and enhanced the magnitude of criminal activity. Recognizing the inability of courts to handle a high magnitude of lawsuits, along with enforcement difficulties, policymakers worldwide chose to delegate quasi-judicial powers to online intermediaries that facilitate or enable such potential violations or infringements of rights. Search engines <b>were</b> first tasked <b>to</b> perform a quasi-judicial role under a notice-and-takedown regime to combat copyright infringement around the world. Recently, the European Union (EU) decided to delegate judicial authority to search engines by granting rights of erasure, or delisting of personal data, about EU individuals under certain circumstances. Effectively, the EU placed search engines—mainly Google currently—as a judiciary, tasked to balance different fundamental human rights. This privatization of the judiciary represents a new paradigm in legal systems and possesses vast global ramifications, which must be further scrutinized. This Article provides such scrutiny. It begins by briefly exploring the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgotten and <b>delisted.</b> It then {{provides an overview of}} the quasi-judicial roles played by search engines prior to the new EU rights regime and compares them to their new judicial role. Following an examination of the pragmatic and normative difficulties in the implementation of the EU rights regime, this Article evaluates and discusses the future of the private judiciary. It examines the drawbacks and benefits of judicial privatization; explores whether other means of regulation are more appropriate; and proposes modest solutions to properly address the shortcomings of the new privatized judiciary. This Article warns against such form of privatization and its current implementation, especially when fundamental rights are at stake. If policymakers insist on adjudicating search engines, they must also restrain their judicial power and provide adequate safeguards for society in the form of transparency and proper oversight on both their removal procedure and decisions...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that firm asset growth predicts {{cross-sectional}} stock returns.
