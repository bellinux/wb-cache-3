Along with the [...] "receipt" [...] with the number 300,353, Eyman claimed to have kept weekly logs {{of the number of}} signatures collected, and wrote the weight (although not the number of pages or signatures) of each box of petitions on the boxes themselves. The Secretary of State's office could not provide the boxes, as they were recycled upon the cataloging of the signatures. It also denied the credibility of Eyman's receipt, noting that official counting had not even begun at that point, and calling attention to their own official receipts. Eyman has been completely unable to substantiate his claim of submitting 300,353 signatures, as he claims to have not made copies of the petitions. On July 28, the Secretary of State's office announced that it had conducted a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> <b>test</b> of 4% of the signatures, finding an invalidation rate of 17.96%. Based upon this number, the initiative failed to make the ballot. A full check of all signatures collected confirmed this conclusion.|$|E

In this proposed RANSAC algorithm, a parameter model is estimated by using a <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>test</b> set. Based on this estimated model, all points are tested to evaluate the fitness of current parameter model and their probabilities are updated by using a total probability formula during the iterations. The maximum size of inlier set containing the test point is taken into account to get a more reliable evaluation for test points by using DS evidence theory. Furthermore, the theories of forgetting are utilized to filter out the unstable inliers and improve the stability of the proposed algorithm. In order to boost a high performance, an inverse mapping sampling strategy is adopted based on the updated probabilities of points.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} and prognosis of cell degradation in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries {{are essential for}} assuring the reliability and safety of electric and hybrid vehicles. This paper aims to develop a reliable and accurate model for online, simultaneous state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimations of Li-ion batteries. Through the analysis of battery cycle-life test data, the instantaneous discharging voltage (V) and its unit time voltage drop, V′, are proposed {{as the model parameters}} for the SOC equation. The SOH equation is found to have a linear relationship with 1 /V′ times the modification factor, which is a function of SOC. Four batteries are tested in the laboratory, and the data are regressed for the model coefficients. The results show that the model built upon the data from one single cell is able to estimate the SOC and SOH of the three other cells within a 5 % error bound. The derived model is also proven to be robust.

AIMS: To compare incidence of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency in random and unrelated subjects, present and previous study and as per their original habitat. Incidence of heterozygous deficiency and clinical implication of deficiency was also determined. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Camps were organized in Katargaon and Amroli regions. Blood specimens, with relevant demographic information, {{were collected from}} those who attended the camp. METHODS AND MATERIAL: A total of 1644 <b>random</b> blood <b>samples</b> were collected from 404 families participating in the camps. Nitroblue tetrazolium dye test was used for G 6 PD deficiency screening and quantitative assay for measurement of G 6 PD enzyme activity. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: 2 {{test was used to}} evaluate significance and mean values were compared by the Student&#x 2032;s "t" test. RESULTS: Incidence of G 6 PD deficiency was found as 22 &#x 0025; among all the <b>random</b> <b>samples</b> <b>tested.</b> However, the G 6 PD deficiency among unrelated members was 27. 9 &#x 0025; in males and 12. 4 &#x 0025; (P< 0. 001,df 1). The 13. 9 &#x 0025; of the females with heterozygous G 6 PD deficient status, together with the homozygous deficient phenotype makes the incidence comparable with males. Incidence of deficiency was comparable with previous study, in Katargam and Amroli and in Amerli and Bhavganar districts. Deficient subjects had mild anemia and hemolytic crisis rarely occurred.

40|$|The 20 th Century saw an {{astonishing}} advance {{in our understanding}} of genetics and the scientific basis of the genetic improvement of farm animals. The application of genetic principles to chickens in the 1950 s and 1960 s led to a rapid change in the productivity and efficiency of laying hens and broiler chickens, turkeys and ducks. Subsequently, the application of increasingly powerful computers and sophisticated mathematical algorithms has increased the range of traits that could be successfully incorporated into breeding programs. <b>Random</b> <b>sample</b> <b>tests</b> of the performance of laying hens enjoyed a period of popularity and more recently the few remaining tests included husbandry systems in addition to strain evaluation. Characterisation of avian blood groups has led to the identification of the B 21 haplotype that confers resistance to Marek's disease and to selection for this locus in commercial lines. The decade following the millennium saw the publication of the genome sequence of the chicken and the identification of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms that, coupled with technological advances, made the application of whole genome selection practical in poultry. In parallel, the molecular basis for some Mendelian traits described a century ago is now being deciphered. Similar technologies have been applied to study genetic diversity in chickens and have provided insights into the evolution and domestication of chicken breeds.
