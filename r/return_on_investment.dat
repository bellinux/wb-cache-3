5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

(Financial Management) The risk-return {{relationship}} is a paramount {{component of the}} optimal investment choice, and {{is essential to the}} development of models that seek to explain patterns of stock market predictability. During this study, a risk-return relationship analysis of South African venture capital providing companies was undertaken and relationships to comparable investment vehicles were compared. Risk, <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> and risk-adjusted <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> of South African venture capital providing companies were compared to small capitalisation, medium capitalisation, top 40 and all-share index companies, based on 10 years of market data. The results for the entire study period were used for analysis, and different market conditions (bull and bear) that existed during the study period were taken into consideration. Results illustrate the highest <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> and poor risk-adjusted <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> for venture capital providing companies, while small capitalisation companies exhibited the best risk-adjusted <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment.</b> It was found that different market conditions do not affect the risk-adjusted returns ranking amongst the observed companies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{marginal}} productivity {{of investment in}} the world’s poorest economies. The aim is to estimate the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> financed by foreign aid {{as well as by}} domestic resource mobilization, using cross-country aggregate data. In practice the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> both <b>investment</b> categories can be expected to vary considerably across countries and time. As a conse-quence we develop a correlated random coefficients approach to the issue at hand, which allows us to estimate the average aggregate rate of <b>return</b> <b>on</b> “aid <b>investments</b> ” and “domestic investments”. Across a wide array of estimators our principal finding is remarkably robust; the average aggregate gross <b>return</b> <b>on</b> “aid <b>investments</b> ” falls in a 20 - 30 percent range, roughly the same as the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> funded by other sources than aid. This finding is well in accord with micro estimates of the economic return to aid...|$|R
30|$|Despite {{a greater}} {{emphasis}} on precious metals in the literature, more recently, there is a paucity of full-scale research examining the variability of the <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> in precious metals. This is an important field of study, rooted in the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which stresses that prices should incorporate all available information and former prices cannot be used to predict returns (Malkiel and Fama, 1970). If <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> in precious metals can be anticipated, investors may benefit from the lack of return variability, this, in turn, would imply that the EMH does not hold. Therefore, the predictability of <b>returns</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> in precious metals is remarkably intriguing to both academics and investors.|$|R
