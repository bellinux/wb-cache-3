25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text {{at the end of the}} scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|E

2500|$|Giroux {{worked with}} Kerouac {{on his first}} novel, The Town and the City, and on the {{manuscript}} for his Beat classic On the Road. The former was dedicated to him. In a documentary interview, Giroux recalled how {{he tried to explain}} to Kerouac that the novel, typed out on a huge, single <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> needed to be worked on, to which Kerouac replied: [...] "There shall be no editing of this manuscript, this manuscript was dictated by the Holy Ghost." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jack Kerouac, a fast typist at 100 {{words per}} minute, typed On the Road on a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{so he would}} not be {{interrupted}} by having to change the paper. Within two weeks of starting to write On the Road, Kerouac had one single-spaced paragraph, 120 feet long. Some scholars say the scroll was shelf paper; others contend it was a Thermo-fax roll; another theory is that the roll consisted of sheets of architect’s paper taped together. His rapid work earned the famous rebuke from Truman Capote, [...] "That's not writing, it's typing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{papermaking}} {{began in}} the early 19th century in Europe with the development of the Fourdrinier machine. [...] This machine produces a continuous <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> rather than individual sheets. These machines are large. [...] Some produce paper 150 meters in length and 10 meters wide. [...] They can produce paper at a rate of 100km/h. In 1844, Canadian Charles Fenerty and German F.G. Keller had invented the machine and associated process to make use of wood pulp in papermaking. This innovation ended the nearly 2,000-year use of pulped rags and start a new era for the production of newsprint and eventually almost all paper was made out of pulped wood.|$|E

2500|$|The {{identity}} of the architect as Thomas Parlby, the uncle of Lady Anne Pole and business partner of her father the self made magnate James Templer, was first discovered by Maureen Turner in her 1999 MA dissertation. The identity had eluded both Pevsner and Bridie, the principal historian of [...] the two buildings. Pevsner had written [...] "One {{would like to know}} the architect of this handsome late Palladian composition of 1787". Whilst at Antony House in Cornwall researching the Pole family Turner inspected closely the <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> held in the right hand of Sir John Pole the builder in his portrait, and discovered thereon drawn a partial plan of the new house with the following words written beneath: [...] "Plan of Shute House built by Sir John William De la Pole Bt. July 1787, T. Parlby Esqr. Archt." [...] Thomas Parlby (1727–1802) was of humble origins, the son of John Parlby of Chatham, Kent [...] or possibly from Gravesend. He was for all of his adult life one of a trio of business partners with John Line and James Templer (1722–1782), in the business of constructing dockyards, generally under government contract.|$|E
2500|$|One-dollar {{bills were}} again {{the subject of}} {{experimentation}} in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a web-fed Intaglio printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRN's, the BEP sent out a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes {{within the confines of}} their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was actually designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems, operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996. [...] Web notes can be identified by the back plate number next to [...] and the removal of face check letters and quadrant numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{procedure}} {{in most cases}} was the so-called rolprocedure (after the rol (<b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or parchment) on which the particulars of the cases were entered during the rolzitting (audience), which took place weekly on Monday before two councillors, taking turns, in the Rolzaal of the Binnenhof at The Hague where the Hof sat since 1511). A case was initiated by a petition for a mandement van dagvaarding (writ of civil summons) by an impetrant (plaintiff). This was executed by a deurwaarder (bailiff) to summon the gedaagde (defendant) to appear on a specific date at the audience, where the sollicitor of the plaintiff handed over a conclusie van eis ( [...] comparable to a complaint) as the first pleading. These were followed by further written pleadings: conclusie van antwoord (counter-plea), conclusie van repliek (reply), and conclusie van dupliek (rejoinder) on successive audiences. These four pleadings could be augmented by other documents of all kinds after special petitions (rekest civiel) from the parties had obtained leave to do this. At a certain point {{there were no more}} documents to exchange and parties would enter a final pleidooi (closing argument) and ask for justice in a conclusie in rechte. If the parties contradicted each other on the facts the court could order an enqueste (evidentiary hearing) before a commissaris (one of the councillors appointed as commissioner). In such a hearing the parties and witnesses would be interrogated under oath. Finally, the case would be summed up in the rapport by another councillor, the rapporteur, for the full court to deliberate. The court decided by majority vote. Minority opinions were not published. In case the vote was a draw the complaint was rejected. The final verdict (dictum) was read at an audience (not before all fees were paid) and the written verdict with the opinion on which it was based were handed to the triumfant party.|$|E
