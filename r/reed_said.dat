25|$|According to Braves team {{president}} John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $150million in renovation costs merely for structural upkeep (i.e., not for fan experience improvements). He estimated that fan improvement renovations {{would have cost}} an additional $200million. The Braves were in talks in 2013 with the Recreational Authority over extending the team's original lease, Plant said, but those talks broke down. Atlanta mayor Kasim <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> the city {{could not afford to}} support the kind of renovations the Braves desired.|$|E
500|$|Along with Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, Reed {{was a major}} {{proponent of}} a {{campaign}} for a transportation special-purpose local-option sales tax, which would have levied a 1% local sales tax for ten years, from 2013 until 2022, to fund transportation infrastructure projects. <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that {{the passage of the}} referendum would add jobs and alleviate congestion in the city, while [...] "failing to pass the measure would be economically damaging" [...] for Atlanta. The proposal was defeated in a referendum, however. Reed stated that he would [...] "work with opponents on the next plan to ease congestion." ...|$|E

He told a {{neighbor}} and they both walked back up {{the road to a}} water well near the barn, where they were approached by Milam. Milam asked if they heard anything. Reed responded [...] "No". Others passed by the shed and heard yelling. A local neighbor also spotted Leroy [...] "Too Tight" [...] Collins {{at the back of the}} barn washing blood off the truck and noticed Till's boot. Milam explained he had killed a deer and that the boot belonged to him.|$|E
500|$|A {{substantial}} number of artists and other figures have professed admiration for West's work, including hip hop artists Rakim, RZA of Wu-Tang Clan, Chuck D of Public Enemy, and DJ Premier of Gang Starr. Experimental rock pioneer and Velvet Underground founder Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> of West that [...] "the guy really, really, really is talented. He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's {{not even on the}} same planet." [...] Musicians such as Paul McCartney and Prince have also commended West's work. Famed Tesla Motors CEO and inventor Elon Musk complimented West in a piece for Time Magazines 100 most influential people list, writing that: ...|$|E
500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works couldn't translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> {{in an interview that he}} thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious". [...] "That's the kind of stuff you might read. Why wouldn't you listen to it? You have the fun of reading that, and you get the fun of rock on top of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Robson plays left-handed, with a two-handed backhand. One of her {{strengths}} is her [...] "dominant" [...] serve. She has {{a strong}} game {{from the back of}} the court and is also noted for having an aggressive forehand return. However, she has been criticised for having [...] "poor lateral movement", as well as an inconsistent second serve, resulting in a considerable number of double faults. She has been praised for showing [...] "extraordinary poise", and having [...] "the attitude and technique required of a leading player". Commentator Simon <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that she [...] "has every tool she needs", and former Grand Slam champion Pat Cash called her [...] "a special talent" [...] who [...] "seems to have all the attributes to progress". Former WTA player Ana Ivanovic said that Robson [...] "hits the ball really, really hard", former top British player Samantha Smith said that [...] "she doesn't have any weaknesses at all", and Serena Williams stated that Robson is an [...] "all-around good player". Robson's favourite surface to play on is grass and her favourite shot is her forehand down the line.|$|E
500|$|God of War II {{received}} similar {{praise for}} its voice acting. Chris Roper of IGN said the characters were timeless {{and the voice}} acting was great. Kristan <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that the voice acting was [...] "top notch." [...] Alex Navarro of GameSpot wrote that [...] "The voice acting is...all-around excellent, though it's not quite as enjoyable {{as it was in}} the last game", and that [...] "Kratos is as gruff and over the top as ever." [...] He praised the supporting voice performances, such as [...] Linda Hunt as Gaia and the narrator, Corey Burton as Zeus, and Harry Hamlin as Perseus, as [...] "top-notch work." [...] However, Navarro said [...] that a few of the performances felt [...] "a bit labored or overwrought. In particular, Michael Clarke Duncan as Atlas feels more wooden than imposing. The voice is right, but his performance is oddly subdued." [...] With these exceptions, Navarro said that [...] "this is another enjoyable voice cast." [...] GameSpy described Kratos as a [...] "sympathetic antihero" [...] and Game Guru claimed [...] "Practically anyone, even if they hadn't played any of the God of War games, would know about Kratos." ...|$|E
500|$|Haunting Ground {{received}} [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics {{were quick}} {{to compare it to}} the Clock Tower series, specifically its 2002 installment, Clock Tower 3 (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay were found to be highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to Ico. Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor pacing. The graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as [...] "some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced." [...] Kill Screen's Zach Budgor compared Haunting Ground's [...] "psychological landscape" [...] to Dario Argento's film Suspiria (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that Haunting Ground was too predictable and relied heavily on clichés previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> it [...] "becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures." [...] The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released Resident Evil 4 (2005), but said, [...] "Haunting Ground isn't without merit, it's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{member of}} the First Presbyterian Church of Greenville, Reed has also served as the {{treasurer}} of the Los Angeles-based Presbyterian Forum. In his early years, <b>Reed</b> once <b>said</b> that the church was about his only activity outside of school or work.|$|R

500|$|The Whistleblower {{focuses on}} sexual slavery, human {{trafficking}}, and corruption. Kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure {{how to create}} a moving, original plot. Her mother was born in Ukraine, and she was aware of what she described as the country's [...] "epidemic" [...] of trafficking. Victor Malarek's book The Natashas inspired her to produce a film on the subject. She said of her initiative being a challenge, [...] "No one wants to watch a film of an enslaved girl being raped for two hours." [...] Bolkovac's experiences gave Kondracki a framework for the film and added the themes of corruption and wide-scale cover-ups. Film critic Rex <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that the abuse of power featured prominently in The Whistleblower; a number of government officials participate in the sex trade or {{turn a blind eye to}} it (including peacekeepers, UN members and mercenaries). Wallace Baine of the Santa Cruz Sentinel wrote that these aspects' portrayal made the movie [...] "slippery and true-to-life". She said, [...] "There are clear and vivid monsters in this film, but there are also those existing in the shades-of-gray middle, nice-enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity." [...] Justice, another prominent theme, does not materialize by the end. The sex trafficking victim Raya is killed, and none of the peacekeepers who participated in the trafficking are prosecuted (although several are sent home). According to Baine, viewers are left with the impression that [...] "the worst violence in Bolkovac's story was the violence done to justice".|$|E
2500|$|Auditing clerk Anthony <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> he was {{instructed}} by Ahmed Paruk {{to effect the}} write-off. Paruk said he {{was instructed}} by Shaik to do it. He said Shaik told him that there was [...] "no {{way in which he}} owed that type of money to his companies".|$|E
2500|$|But these pacifist {{religious}} beliefs were not {{protected by the}} First Amendment, <b>Reed</b> <b>said.</b> Relying on Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California, 293 U.S. 245 (1934), he declared conscientious objection a [...] "grace of Congressional recognition" [...] and noted {{that the state of}} Illinois recognized no such rights.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Reed</b> has <b>said</b> in {{numerous}} interviews that her early home life was [...] "complicated". Her parents divorced when Reed was two, {{and she was}} raised by her mother. Her mother is of Cherokee and Italian descent. Her father is Jewish. Reed was raised without religion and has identified as Jewish. She grew up around some Jewish practices, as her brother had a Bar Mitzvah.|$|R

2500|$|Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education, – <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> he was proudest of his {{dissent in}} Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Education. The ruling {{was the first}} to declare that a state had {{violated}} the Establishment Clause. Reed disliked the phrase [...] "wall of separation between church and state," [...] and his dissent contains his famous dictum about the phrase: [...] "A rule of law should not be drawn from a figure of speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, <b>Reed</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his term, President Clinton {{also used}} the power of {{executive}} orders to implement gun control policies. [...] On April 6, 1998 Clinton signed an order that permanently banned the importation of more than 50 types of semiautomatic [...] "assault weapons". [...] In 1999 White House domestic policy chief Bruce D. <b>Reed</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The country is tired of waiting for Congress {{to respond to the}} tragedy in Littleton. The administration is going to do every thing in its power to make progress on guns." ...|$|E
5000|$|After his death, Reed's Brady Bunch co-stars - {{most notably}} Barry Williams and Henderson - {{publicly}} acknowledged Reed's sexual orientation, and admitted {{that most of}} the cast and crew of The Brady Bunch were aware, but they did not discuss it with <b>Reed.</b> Williams <b>said</b> about <b>Reed's</b> homosexuality: [...] "Robert didn't want to go there. I don't think he talked about it with anyone. I just don't think it was a discussion - period." ...|$|R
60|$|SINCE {{years ago}} for evermore My cedar ship I drew to shore; And to the road and {{riverbed}} And the green, nodding <b>reeds,</b> I <b>said</b> Mine ignorant and last farewell: Now with content at home I dwell, And now divide my sluggish life Betwixt my verses and my wife: In vain; for when the lamp is lit And by the laughing fire I sit, Still with the tattered atlas spread Interminable roads I tread.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city hall}} tower {{is home to}} a {{peregrine}} falcon named Clara, and her current tiercel, named [...] "Esteban Colbert" [...] after Stephen Colbert, of whom San Jose Mayor Chuck <b>Reed</b> is <b>said</b> to be a fan. The original falcons, named Jose and Clara after the city and Santa Clara County produced three offspring, named Spirit, Hiko, and Esperanza. In 2008, Clara and her then-mate Carlos had three chicks, Cielo and Meyye, both girls, and Mercury, a boy.|$|R
2500|$|Quoting {{extensively}} from Congressional {{debates over}} Section 304 of the Taft-Hartley Act, Reed concluded that Congress clearly {{did not intend}} for the act to cover union newspapers supported by advertising or member subscriptions. Reed acknowledged that some members of Congress contemplated a different reading of Section 304. However, such contradictory statements could be dismissed as not indicative {{of the sense of}} Congress, <b>Reed</b> <b>said,</b> as [...] "the language itself, coupled with the dangers of unconstitutionality, supports the interpretation which we have placed upon it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bailey {{commented on}} the band's {{reduction}} to a trio in a 1983 interview: [...] "When we reformed the band, we were making a statement. We weren't {{going to be a}} rock 'n' roll band, we weren't going to have a guitar. We were going to move on. You know, Lou <b>Reed</b> <b>said</b> whenever he played live he ended up going back to heroin music. There are old associations, associations we don't want because they don't reflect the way we feel today. ... Right now, technology is what's important, and that's what our music tries to reflect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Muhammad Ali– {{formerly known}} as Cassius Clay– declared himself a conscientious objector and refused to go to war. According to a writer for Sports Illustrated, the governor of Illinois, Otto Kerner, Jr., called Ali [...] "disgusting" [...] and the governor of Maine, John H. <b>Reed,</b> <b>said</b> that Ali [...] "should be held in utter contempt by every patriotic American." [...] In 1967 Ali was sentenced to 5 {{years in prison for}} draft evasion, but his conviction was later overturned on appeal. In addition, he was stripped of his title and banned from professional boxing for more than three years.|$|E

[...] In 1974, Moon struck up a friendship with actor Oliver Reed while working on {{the film version of}} Tommy. Although Reed matched Moon drink for drink, he appeared on set the next morning ready to perform; Moon, on the other hand, would cost several hours of filming time. <b>Reed</b> later <b>said</b> that Moon [...] "showed me the way to insanity." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Netflix CEO <b>Reed</b> Hastings <b>said</b> that {{he would}} be {{interested}} in producing another season of Arrested Development: [...] "If the talent were willing to do more, and interested in that, I'm sure we would be willing". [...] Producer Brian Grazer said that [...] "We are in conversations with them to do another season".

Former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission <b>Reed</b> Hundt <b>said</b> that this law gives the most understanding to {{the workings of the}} Internet.
