5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata, {{commonly}} known as granite banksia or Albany banksia, is a species of shrub or (rarely) tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 3m (10ft) in height. It can grow taller to 5m (16ft) in sheltered areas, and much smaller in more exposed areas. This species has elliptic green leaves and large, bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes, appearing in summer and autumn. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) is the most prominent pollinator, although several other species of honeyeater, as well as bees, visit the flower spikes.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2011, Young {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to $4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7–1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he was a free agent.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium (formerly protoactinium) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids. It forms various chemical compounds where protactinium is usually {{present in the}} oxidation state +5, but can also assume +4 and even +3 or +2 states. The average concentrations of protactinium in the Earth's crust is typically {{on the order of}} a few parts per trillion, but may <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to a few parts per million in some uraninite ore deposits. Because of its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research, and for this purpose, protactinium is mostly extracted from spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|Today, The Sai Baba Temple in Shirdi is {{visited by}} an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day, and during {{religious}} festivals, this number can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 1,00,000. The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Sai Baba accepted the state of samadhi and attained nirvana in Dwarkamai. His remains were buried at Buti Wada, today known as the Samadhi Mandir. Inside the temple, The statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and is seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands.The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold. As per rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, Four Aarti's are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the Samadhi Mandir.|$|E

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, <b>reach</b> <b>up</b> to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue quails and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E
