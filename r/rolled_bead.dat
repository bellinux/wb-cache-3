[...] A single heishe is a <b>rolled</b> <b>bead</b> of shell, turquoise, or coral, which is cut very thin. Shells used for heishe included mother-of-pearl, spiny oyster, abalone, coral, conch and clam. Tiny, thin heishe was strung together by the Santo Domingo to create necklaces, which were important trade items.|$|E

6000|$|A hundred winding steps convey That {{conclave}} to {{the upper}} day; But, ere they breathed the fresher air, They heard the shriekings of despair, [...] And many a stifled groan: With speed their upward way they take, Such speed as age and fear can make, And crossed themselves for terror's sake, [...] As hurrying, tottering on: Even in the vesper's heavenly tone, They seemed to hear a dying groan, And bade the passing knell to toll For welfare of a parting soul. Slow o'er the midnight wave it swung, Northumbrian rocks in answer rung; To Warkworth cell the echoes <b>rolled,</b> His <b>beads</b> the wakeful hermit told, The Bamborough peasant raised his head, But slept ere half a prayer he said; So far was heard the mighty knell, The stag sprung up on Cheviot Fell, Spread his broad nostril to the wind, Listed before, aside, behind, Then couched him down beside the hind, And quaked among the mountain fern, To hear that sound so dull and stern.|$|R

With regard to measuring performance this research first conducted a comparative study on the pavement marking evaluation process through a comparison of subjective and objective pavement marking durability rating techniques. The subjective and objective performance evaluation processes reported slight differences. In an effort to address pavement marking quality and efficiencies during installation another {{study was conducted to}} develop a methodology for evaluating different bead guns used in the pavement marking application process. An experiment evaluated the performance of the bead guns at various speeds.

Shall that not satisfy you, and will you not greet me kindly and with a kiss of peace, who have come from far to be your sister, Zinita?"

30|$|Apple and pear (Malus domestica and Pyrus communis) are anatomically hard to distinguish, {{therefore}} they are discussed together. The wood {{of those two}} species is still appreciated for furniture making and veneer production. Nevertheless, the wood could be challenged much more. In former times apple and pear were often utilized because of their combination of high resistance against abrasion, hardness, strength and comparable low sliding friction (Fig.  5). It was used for planes, spindles, cogwheels, shafts, axis and rolls. There are also other parameters like lubricity, {{which is one of}} the properties difficult to measure. They can be evaluated by analyzing historical objects representing the result of a long-term empirical process. Pear and apple were conspicuously often used for friction bearing where the named property is of great importance. Folkloristic literature mentions <b>rolls</b> for prayers <b>beads</b> [19], pounders [20], plows [21], oil presses [22] and windmills [21].|$|R

40|$|Open {{fractures}} {{account for}} approximately 20 % of all combat-related injuries in soldiers. Because of {{the severity of}} wounding mechanisms and high rates of wound infection, open fractures from combat pose greater problems to surgeons and result in higher morbidity than similar injuries suffered by civilians. Standard care for open fractures requires multiple procedures, including irrigation, débridement, stabilization, and antibiotic therapy. A commonly used method to provide local antibiotics through elution and to fill dead space is the application of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) combined with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, <b>rolled</b> into <b>beads,</b> and placed in the bone defect. Although effective for treating infection, these cement beads are not bioabsorbable and will eventually retard bone growth if not removed during a second surgical procedure. Yet a third procedure for bone autografting is often required for definitive treatment. Current standard care with multiple procedures and delayed definitive treatment results in high patient morbidity and increased cost of treatment. To evaluate potential alternatives to current standard care we have developed a large animal open fracture model in goats. Thus far we have tested different osteoconductive or osteoinductive bone graft substitutes impregnated with antibiotics to determine the ability of each product to reduce infection rates. All products have been as effective as standard care treatment in preventing infection in this contaminated bone defect model. Current research is evaluating the use of similar, but commercially available products that have been approved, or are pending approval, by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The use of antimicrobial bone graft substitutes may reduce morbidity, the number of surgical interventions, and associated medical costs for military personnel and civilians alike. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Quasi-two-dimensional bidisperse {{amorphous}} {{systems of}} steel beads are fluidized by a uniform upflow of air, {{so that the}} <b>beads</b> <b>roll</b> on a horizontal plane. The short-time ballistic motion of the beads is stochastic, with non-Gaussian speed distributions and with different average kinetic energies for the two species.

These quantities all exhibit tell-tale features as the dynamics become more constrained closer to jamming. In particular the pair distribution function and the Voronoi cell shape distribution function both develop split peaks. And the mean-squared displacement develops a plateau of subdiffusive motion separating ballistic and diffusive regimes. Though the system is driven and athermal, this behavior is remarkably reminiscent of that in dense colloidal suspensions and supercooled liquids.

40|$|In multiple-roll coaters thin liquid {{films are}} {{transferred}} from roll to roll {{by means of}} liquid ‘beads’ which occupy the small gaps between adjacent <b>rolls.</b> Double-Film-Fed (DFF) <b>beads</b> are those which feature two ingoing films {{instead of the usual}} one, and arise in the intermediate stages of certain types of roll coater. One of the ingoing films, h 1, is supplied from the previous inter-roll gap while the other, h 2, ‘returns’ from the subsequent gap. Such a flow is investigated here under the conditions of low flow rate, small capillary number and negligible gravity and inertia, using lubrication theory and finite element analysis. The thickness of film h 1 is fixed independently, while that of h 2 is specified as a fraction, [zeta], of the film output on the same roll. This simple approach allows a degree of feedback between the output and input of the bead, and enables one to simulate different conditions in the subsequent gap. Predictions of outgoing film thicknesses made using the two models agree extremely well and show that, for each value of [zeta] < 1, one outgoing film thickness decreases monotonically with speed ratio, S, while the other features a maximum. Good agreement is also seen in the pressure profiles, which are entirely sub-ambient in keeping with the small capillary number conditions. The finite element solutions reveal that in the ‘zero-flux’ case (when [zeta] = 1) the flow structures are very similar to those seen in an idealized cavity problem. In the more general ([zeta] < 1) situation, as in single-film-fed meniscus roll coating, several liquid transfer-jets occur by which liquid is conveyed through the <b>bead</b> from one <b>roll</b> to the other. The lubrication model is used to calculate several critical flow rates at which the flow is transformed, and it is shown that when the total dimensionless flow rate through the bead exceeds 1 / 3, the downstream flow structure is independent of the relative sizes of the ingoing films...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses technological, {{social and}} economIC aspects of gold production and {{use in the}} Late Iron Age of southern Africa. The topic is approached in two ways. The first is to define the fabrication technology employed in producing gold artefacts. The second is to use trace element fingerprinting to try to determine which geological deposits were exploited by gold miners of this period. Three assemblages exist that allow these questions to be addressed; Mapungubwe (1 ath - 13 th century AD), Great Zimbabwe (12 th - 15 th century AD) and Thulamela (l 4 th - 17 th century AD). Previous descriptions of the fabrication technology of southern African gold exist, {{but this is the}} first, systematic study of all three assemblages. The fabrication technology reconstruction used three lines of analysis; visual inspection with the naked eye, microscopy of the surfaces, and microhardness testing and metallography of selected polished samples. Fifty eight specimens were studied from Mapungubwe, two hundred and sixty eight pieces from Great Zimbabwe and fifteen from Thulamela. Trade and socio-economic effects of southern Africa's Later Iron Age are discussed {{in the light of the}} now available trace element analysis and fabrication technology of the gold artefacts studied here. No tools for working gold have been found, and inferences have been made by modelling them on tools for copper and iron working. The basic toolkit consisted of a blade, hammer, chisel, a punch and an anvil. There were four basic artefact types; wire, beads, foil and tacks. There was no significant stylistic change in artefact types and the number of artefact types in the three assemblages. Cold working and annealing were standard practices in fabrication. Ten finished artefacts types have been identified; wrapped, <b>rolled</b> and punched <b>beads,</b> foil, strips cut from foil, tacks, straight and coiled wire, rod sections and links. Other gold artefacts were recovered but were either offeuts or in the process of being made into one of the ten types described above. These are prills, discs and offcuts. Trace element groups were based on grouping the samples by similarities in the signature profiles. Identification was on the basis of the presence and absence of metallic impurities. It was deduced that alluvial gold mining was practised alongside reef gold mining. Mixing of gold ores occurred. Alloying was not intentionally practised. Identification of the gold sources would require further analysis of unworked material from potential geological sources...|$|R
