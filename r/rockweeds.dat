50|$|Phlorotannins are {{a type of}} tannins {{found in}} brown algae such as kelps and <b>rockweeds</b> or sargassacean species, and in a lower amount also in some red algae. Contrary to hydrolysable or {{condensed}} tannins, these compounds are oligomers of phloroglucinol (polyphloroglucinols). As they are called tannins, {{they have the ability}} to precipitate proteins. It has been noticed that some phlorotannins have the ability to oxidize and form covalent bonds with some proteins. In contrast, under similar experimental conditions three types of terrestrial tannins (procyanidins, profisetinidins, and gallotannins) apparently did not form covalent complexes with proteins.|$|E
50|$|Many algae have a {{flattened}} portion that may resemble a leaf, {{and this is}} termed a blade, lamina, or frond. The name blade is most often applied to a single undivided structure, while frond may be applied to {{all or most of}} an algal body that is flattened, but this distinction is not universally applied. The name lamina refers to that portion of a structurally differentiated alga that is flattened. It may be a single or a divided structure, and may be spread over {{a substantial portion of the}} alga. In <b>rockweeds,</b> for example, the lamina is a broad wing of tissue that runs continuously along both sides of a branched midrib. The midrib and lamina together constitute almost all of a rockweed, so that the lamina is spread throughout the alga rather than existing as a localized portion of it.|$|E

A commonly accepted explanation is that these ecosystems contain multiple stable points, but experimental tests conWrming multiple stable states have proven elusive. Here we present a novel approach and show that mussel beds and <b>rockweed</b> stands are multiple stable states on intertidal shores in the Gulf of Maine, USA. Using broad-scale observational data and long-term data from experimental clearings, we show that the removal of <b>rockweed</b> by winter ice scour can tip persistent <b>rockweed</b> stands to mussel beds. The observational data were analyzed with Anderson???s discriminant analysis of principal coordinates, which provided an objective function to separate mussel beds from <b>rockweed</b> stands.

50|$|Brown algae {{exist in}} a wide range of sizes and forms. The {{smallest}} members of the group grow as tiny, feathery tufts of threadlike cells no more than a few centimeters long. Some species have a stage in their life cycle that consists of only a few cells, making the entire alga microscopic. Other groups of brown algae grow to much larger sizes. The <b>rockweeds</b> and leathery kelps are often the most conspicuous algae in their habitats. Kelps can range in size from the two-foot-tall sea palm Postelsia to the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, which grows to over 45 m (150 ft) long and is the largest of all the algae. In form, the brown algae range from small crusts or cushions to leafy free-floating mats formed by species of Sargassum. They may consist of delicate felt-like strands of cells, as in Ectocarpus, or of foot-long flattened branches resembling a fan, as in Padina.|$|E
40|$|Patches of {{stranded}} macrophytes (wrack) are {{a distinctive}} feature of sandy beaches worldwide {{and a potential}} food subsidy for their resident communities. Despite their relevance, the spatial variation of wrack and its potential influence on upper shore beach organisms remain poorly understood. Wrack and macrofauna were surveyed on seven sandy beaches associated with dunes, till bluffs and sandstone cliffs along {{the north shore of}} Prince Edward Island, Atlantic Canada. Wrack patch density, cover, and water content were measured, and their associated macrofauna was compared to the communities inhabiting nearby bare sediments. The survey found among-site spatial differences in wrack characteristics and identified <b>rockweeds</b> (Fucus serratus) and eelgrass (Zostera marina) as the main macrophyte species in the area. Macrofaunal abundances were higher in wrack than in bare sediments but this varied among locations. A field manipulation was then conducted at two sandy beaches to measure macrofauna colonization on patches of fresh and aged rockweed and eelgrass. Regardless of macrophyte's age, macrofaunal organisms preferentially colonized sediments associated with <b>rockweeds.</b> In addition, calculations across treatments detected positive relationships between macrofaunal abundance and wet mass, dry mass and water content of the wrack patches, regardless of macrophyte species or state. Macrophyte preferences were further explored by comparing the nutritional value of the plant tissues and assessing macrofauna feeding rates under laboratory conditions. Rockweed tissues had consistently higher protein, lipid and carbohydrate contents than eelgrass and were affected by higher invertebrate consumption rates. Overall, these results suggest that spatial variation and wrack features and species composition play key roles on the structure of the supralittoral macrofauna...|$|E
40|$|Tight {{coupling}} between pelagic and benthic {{communities is}} {{accepted as a}} general principle on Arctic shelves. Whereas this paradigm has been useful for guiding ecological research, it has perhaps led to a disproportionate focus on POM and ice algae as the most likely sources of carbon for the benthic food web. Arctic shelves are complex systems, including banks, fjords, and trough systems up to 350 m or more in depth. In this stable-isotope study, 13 different potential carbon sources were analyzed for their contribution to the food-webs of Isfjorden, Svalbard. A mixing model with herbivorous copepods and grazing sea urchins as end-members was applied to determine the relative contributions of the most likely carbon sources to pelagic and benthic taxa. Most taxa from the benthos feed on a broad mixture of POM and macroalgal detritus, even at depths down to 410 m. Most suspension-feeding bivalves had isotopic signals consistent {{with more than a}} 50 % contribution from kelps and <b>rockweeds.</b> In contrast, nearly all pelagic species had diets consistent with an overwhelming contribution of pelagic POM. These results indicate that macroalgal detritus can contribute significantly to near-shore Arctic food-webs, a trophic link that may increase if macroalgae increase in the Arctic as predicted. These weaker quantitative links between pelagic and benthic components of coastal systems highlight the need for thorough sampling of potential carbon-baselines in food-web studies. A large detrital-carbon component in diets of Arctic benthos may dampen the impacts of strong seasonality in polar primary producers, leading to higher ecosystem resilience, but may also result in lower secondary productivity...|$|E

40|$|Northern {{hemisphere}} <b>rockweeds</b> (Fucus) {{are thought}} to have evolved in the North Pacific and then spread to the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait. They have dispersed and widely speciated in the North Atlantic and its tributary seas. Fucus distichus is likely near the ancestral member of this genus, and studies have shown that there are several species/subspecies in this complex (i. e. F. evanescens and F. gardneri). We used phylogenetic and haplotype analyses to test the phylogenetic relationships and biogeogra- phy of F. distichus. Our data and subsequent analyses demonstrate that, unlike previous studies that lacked samples from an extensive geographical area of the Arctic and Subarc- tic, there is a distinct Arctic haplotype that is the source of subspecies in both the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Fucus distichus occupies a low tide zone habitat, and in Arctic/ Subarctic regions it is adapted to the severe stress of sea ice coverage and disturbance dur- ing many months per year. We hypothesize that the very large geographic area of Arctic and Subarctic rocky shores available to this species during interglacials, supported by large Arctic/Subarctic fringe areas as well as unglaciated refugia during glacial cycles, provided a robust population and gene pool (described by the Thermogeographic Model). This gene pool dilutes that of the more fragmented and area-limited Temperate/Boreal area popula- tions when they are brought together during glacial cycles. We suggest that similar subspe- cies complexes for a variety of Arctic/Subarctic shore biota should be examined further in this context, rather than arbitrarily being split up into numerous species.

40|$|European {{colonization}} of North America severely altered terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems alike. Here, we integrate archaeological, historical, and recent data to derive the ecological {{history of the}} Quoddy Region, Bay of Fundy, Canada, an upwelling region rich in marine diversity and productivity. We document successive changes on all trophic levels from primary producers to top predators over the last centuries. Our objectives were to (1) construct a baseline of "what was natural in the coastal ocean," and (2) analyze the sequence and potential interaction of multiple human impacts. Archaeological records highlight the abundance and diversity of marine species used by indigenous people over the last 2000 - 3000 years. Europeans colonized {{the area in the}} late 1700 s and rapidly transformed the environment by multiple "top-down" (exploitation), "bottom-up" (nutrient loading), and "side-in" (habitat destruction, pollution) impacts. Most large vertebrates were severely overexploited by 1900, leading. to the extinction of three mammal and six bird species. Diadromous fish dramatically declined after river dam- ming in the early 1800 s, and recovery was prevented by subsequent river pollution. Over- fishing of groundfish stocks started in the late 1800 s, gradually leading to a final collapse in the 1970 s. In the 20 th century, decline of traditional fisheries induced a shift to low trophic level harvesting and aquaculture, which increased exponentially over the past 20 years. Eutrophication caused shifts in seaweed and phytoplankton communities: Some long- lived <b>rockweeds</b> were replaced by annual bloom-forming algae, and diatoms were replaced by dinoflagellates. Today, the once unique Quoddy Region shows the most common signs of degradation found in highly impacted coastal areas worldwide. Multiple human influences have altered abundance and composition of every trophic level in the food web and reduced upper trophic levels by at least one order of magnitude. We highlight cumulative and indirect effects that impair the ability to predict and manage highly impacted coastal ecosystems. On the other hand, simple protection and restoration measures in the 20 th century led to the recovery of some species. It is these successes that provide guidance for a more sus- tainable interaction of humans with their marine environment...|$|E

As {{a test of}} this hypothesis, experimental clearings of different sizes were established in stands of the <b>rockweed</b> Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jolis to determine if successional changes in large clearings developed species assemblages distinctly different from the surrounding A. nodosum stands. Clearings ranging from 1 to 8 m in diameter were created at 12 sites in 4 bays on Swan???s Island, Maine, in 1996 to mimic the effects of ice scour, and abundances of gastropods, barnacles, mussels and fucoid algae were monitored until 2002. ANOVAs and MDS showed strong effects of clearing size and divergent successional changes in large clearings. Large clearings were quickly filled in and remained dominated by the alga Fucus vesiculosus L. and the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides (L). There was no evidence for site-specific effects, and Mantel tests showed clearing size was a better predictor of species composition than geographic distances among sites. Results suggest that large pulse disturbances using clearings of 8 m in diameter can initiate divergent successional pathways and have a protracted effect on species composition.

S. and worldwide, affecting nearly 2 billion people (WHO, 2008). Often Fe deficiency is attributed to poor Fe bioavailability in foods, especially in plant-based diets. With the U. S. Dietary Guidelines suggesting a reduced intake of meat and increased intake in fresh produce and whole grains, the prevalence of Fe deficiency could increase. Thus, there exists a need to discover novel plant foods that supply bioavailable Fe to the diet. Seaweeds {{have been shown to be}} rich sources of Fe and are grown and commonly eaten in Hawaiʻi. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mineral content and Fe bioavailability of various seaweeds to determine their potential nutritive value as a good source of Fe. In this study the mineral content of eleven common and Hawaiian seaweeds (Aonoriko, Dulse, Gorilla Ogo, Green Ogo, Hijiki, Nori, Red Ogo, <b>Rockweed,</b> Sea Lettuce, Wakame, and Wawae'iole) was determined via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the eleven seaweeds, six (Nori, Red Ogo, <b>Rockweed,</b> Sea Lettuce, Wakame, and Wawaei'ole) were selected on the basis of popularity in western diets, total iron content, and native Hawaiian origin for further analysis of their Fe bioavailability relative to spinach. Relative Fe bioavailability was assessed using a Caco- 2 cell/ in vitro digestion method. Results showed no significant difference in bioavailable iron between spinach and <b>Rockweed,</b> Wakame, or Wawaei'ole. Similarly, while Red Ogo contained five times as much Fe as spinach, the bioavailability of that Fe was low even when enhanced with Vitamin C. In contrast, Nori and Sea Lettuce provided 2 - 4 times more bioavailable Fe per gram dry weight than spinach. When supplemented with vitamin C, an enhancer of Fe absorption, all seaweeds showed a significant increase in Fe bioavailability as expected (except Red Ogo). This suggests that variation between seaweeds may stem from different contents of enhancers (Vit C) and inhibitors (possibly polyphenols or manganese) in the seaweeds themselves. We conclude that Nori and Sea Lettuce provide more bioavailable Fe than spinach and thus should be considered good sources of dietary Fe. Red Ogo is a poor source of Fe possibly due to either high polyphenol or manganese content. It remains to be determined if seaweeds can be recommended in practical amounts to improve Fe status, and if increased consumption will raise concerns for excessive intakes of potentially toxic minerals such as iodine...|$|R
