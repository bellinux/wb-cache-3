At 0. 277, 1. 5, and 2. 07 keV, and for radii of 3 arcsec and larger, our measurements have estimated 1 sigma errors of 0. 6 to 1. 5 percent.

30|$|The {{validation}} data with <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> (r) {{in the range}} of 0.14 – 0.22  % vol compare well to the <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> found in the literature. For example, the German reference procedure [distillation/pycnometry (Anon. 1982)] reported r =  0.19  % vol, while the EU reference method (European Commission 2000) reported r =  0.30  % vol (distillation/pycnometry) and r =  0.12  % vol (distillation/electronic densimetry). Our previous {{validation data}} using steam distillation (old instrument) were also very similar [r range 0.15 – 0.23  % vol (Lachenmeier et al. 2003)]. Because the method’s precision was already very high using the old instrument, and further improvement was not detectable using the new instrument, it is suggested that the major part of the method uncertainty derives from factors apart from the distillation step such as the uncertainty of the density measurement as well as the volumetric errors in pipetting and filling up the graduated flaks with the distillate, which appear to have the highest influence. Indirect evidence for this finding is also provided by the fact that infrared spectroscopic methods for quantifying alcoholic strength (which are conducted in the beverage itself without any need for sample preparation) usually had a much lower repeatability [for example, r =  0.02  % vol for both spirits (Lachenmeier 2007) and wine (Patz et al. 2004), and 0.05  % vol for liqueurs (Arzberger and Lachenmeier 2008)].|$|R

Based on relative deviation and <b>repeatability</b> <b>limit</b> analysis about indexes of these samples, the results show there had been significant changes in diagnostic ratios among the initial and weathered samples of different oils during this process. Changes of selected n-alkane diagnostic ratios of all oil samples displayed more obviously than diagnostic ratios of terpanes, steranes and PAHs in this process. Almost all selected diagnostic ratios of terpanes, steranes and PAHs can be efficiently used in tracking sources of hydrocarbon pollution, differentiating from the n-alkane diagnostic ratios.

40|$|The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) {{is widely}} used for the {{clinical}} evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). We assessed the rater variability of the UPDRS Motor examination (UPDRS-ME) of nurse practitioners, residents in neurology, and a movement disorders specialist (MDS) compared to a senior MDS. We assessed the videotaped UPDRS-ME of 50 PD patients. Inter-rater and intra-rater variability were estimated using weighted kappa (kappa(w)) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Additionally, inter-rater agreement was quantified by calculation of the mean difference between 2 raters and its 95 % limits of agreement. Intra-rater agreement was also estimated by calculation of a 95 % <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits.</b> The kappa(w) and ICC statistics indicated good to very good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability {{for the majority of}} individual UPDRS items and the sum score of the UPDRS-ME in all raters. However, for inter-rater agreement, it appeared that both nurses, residents, and the MDS consistently assigned higher scores than the senior MDS. Mean differences ranged between 1. 7 and 5. 4 (all differences P < 0. 05), with rather wide 95 % limits of agreement. The intra-rater 95 % <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> were rather wide. We found considerable rater difference for the whole range of UPDRS-ME scores between a senior MDS and nurse practitioners, residents in neurology, and the MDS.

40|$|Purpose. To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of the Galilei dual Scheimpflug analyzer (GDSA) in anterior segment examination. Methods. Fifty-two eyes from 52 healthy volunteers were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Anatomic, axial, refractive, and instantaneous parameters were measured with GDSA {{to provide a}} complete characterization of the anterior segment. Repeatability was assessed calculating intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and coefficient of variation (COV). Results. Correlation among repeated measurements showed almost perfect reliability (ICC > 0. 81) for all parameters except thinnest central corneal thickness (CCT) (0. 78), corneal thickness average out (0. 79), and posterior axial curvature average out (0. 60). Repeatability was excellent (COV < 10 %) for all parameters except anterior chamber volume and, superior iridocorneal angle and eccentricities. In these last three parameters, <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> were excessively high compared to the mean. Conclusions. GDSA in healthy young persons had an almost perfect correlation in measuring anatomic, axial, instantaneous, and refractive parameters with greater variability for peripheral terms.

Seven FFSB samples were processed by dry extrusion at temperatures ranging from 110 to 164 °C and analysed on the PDI. Processed FFSB samples were also assessed in a growth trial of broilers. The analysis of the FFSBs by the PDI method generated adequately-processed FFSB values of between 8. 49 % and 10. 3 %. Values above 10. 3 % described under-processed and below 8. 49 % over-processed FFSBs.

The RSD {{of most of the}} diagnostic ratios of MTAS ranged from 9 to 84 % during the photo-oxidation process. However, the RSDs of such ratios derived from MTAS were all < 5 % even in high biodegradation, and such parameters may also provide new methods on oil spill identification. The parameters of monoaromatic sterane and monoaromatic sterane are not used well for oil spilt identification after photo-oxidation.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{optimize}} the diagnostic {{accuracy of the}} functional diffusion map for monitoring tumor treatment response in cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Monte Carlo simulations, measurement precision of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and particularly accuracy of threshold determination from healthy reference tissue, are evaluated by investigating the <b>repeatability</b> <b>limit</b> of the ADC {{as a function of}} different degrees of diffusion weighting of the sequence. Phantom and in-vivo experiments are performed to verify and illustrate the results of the simulations. RESULTS: While diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map is hardly diminished by differing values of the T(2) relaxation time in tumor and reference tissue, it is shown to be impaired by differing ADCs, resulting in erroneously determined segmentation thresholds. This problem can be addressed by decreasing the maximum b-factor and increasing the number of signal averages at the maximum b-factor or, alternatively, the number of b-factors while favoring schemes with higher b-factors. Phantom experiments confirm the results of the simulations. In-vivo data are presented to illustrate the effect of sequence optimization on the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map. CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrates that the diagnostic accuracy of the functional diffusion map can be impaired by inaccurate segmentation thresholds and derives means for its optimization that will increase the fidelity of future clinical studies...|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{reservoir}} monitoring {{has become}} an impor-tant tool {{in the management of}} many fields. Monitoring subtle changes in the seismic properties of a reservoir caused by production places strong demands on seis-mic repeatability. A lack of <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> how fre-quently reservoir changes can be monitored or the ap-plicability of seismic monitoring at all. In this paper we show that towing many streamers with narrow separa-tion, combined with cross-line interpolation of data onto predefined sail lines, can give highly repeatable marine seismic data. Results from two controlled zero time lag monitoring experiments in the North Sea demonstrate high sensi-tivity to changing water level and variations in lateral positions. After corrections by deterministic tidal time shifts and spatial interpolation of the irregularly sampled streamer data, relative rms difference amplitude levels are as low as 12 % for a deep, structurally complex field and as low as 6 % for a shallow, structurally simple field. Reducing the degree of nonrepeatability to as low as 6 % to 12 % allows monitoring of smaller reflectiv-ity changes. In terms of reservoir management this has three important benefits: (1) reservoirs with small seis-mic changes resulting from production can be moni-tored, (2) reservoirs with large seismic changes can be monitored more frequently, and (3) monitoring data can be used more quantitatively...|$|R

A further objective was to find out the influence of image type, land cover or parcel size on the area measurement variability. In our experiment, five independent operators measured 185 parcels, 3 times, on each image. Next, the buffer width, calculated as the difference between measured and reference parcel area, was derived and was the subject of statistical analysis. Prior to verifying the normality of the buffer widths, a detection of anomalous measurements is recommended. This detection of outliers within each group of observations (i. e. parcels) was made using the Jacknife distance test on each type of imagery (Cartosat Aft, Cartosat Fore). Then, the General Linear Model procedure to identify major significant effects and interactions was followed by analysis of variance to ease the interpretation of the variability observed of the area measurement.

In contrast, Z (3,± 1) RMS aberrations (mean= 0. 85 μm; SW= 0. 06 μm; r= 0. 16 μm) and Z (4,± 2) RMS aberrations (mean= 0. 40 μm; SW= 0. 07 μm; r= 0. 18 μm) showed comparatively better repeatability. Conclusions: The lower-order and higher-order aberrations measured in this group of keratoconic patients showed higher levels of variability compared to previous investigations of visually-normal subjects. These results may {{be of interest to}} eyecare practitioners involved in the design and fitting of aberration-controlling contact lenses for patients with keratoconus...|$|E
40|$|Three compounds, {{hypothesized}} as fumonisin A 1 (FA 1), fumonisin A 2 (FA 2), and fumonisin A 3 (FA 3), {{were detected}} in a corn sample contaminated with mycotoxins by high-resolution liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS). One {{of them has}} been identified as FA 1 synthesized by the acetylation of fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), and established a method for its quantification. Herein, we identified the two remaining compounds as FA 2 and FA 3, which were acetylated fumonisin B 2 (FB 2) and fumonisin B 3 (FB 3), respectively. Moreover, we examined a method for the simultaneous analysis of FA 1, FA 2, FA 3, FB 1, FB 2, and FB 3. The corn samples were prepared by extraction using a QuEChERS kit and purification using a multifunctional cartridge. The linearity, recovery, <b>repeatability,</b> <b>limit</b> of detection, and limit of quantification of the method were > 0. 99, 82. 9 %– 104. 6 %, 3. 7 %– 9. 5 %, 0. 02 – 0. 60 μg/kg, and 0. 05 – 1. 98 μg/kg, respectively. The simultaneous analysis of the six fumonisins revealed that FA 1, FA 2, and FA 3 were present in all corn samples contaminated with FB 1, FB 2, and FB 3. The results suggested that corn marketed for consumption can be considered as being contaminated with both the fumonisin B-series and with fumonisin A-series. This report presents the first identification and quantification of FA 1, FA 2, and FA 3 in corn samples...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preparation {{of highly}} {{standardized}} herbal products {{with respect to}} chemical composition and biological activity {{is considered to be}} a valuable approach in this field. SJT-DI- 02 polyherbal formulation was successfully developed at our institute and filed for patent at Mumbai patent office. Objective: The present work was marker based standardization of patented, novel and efficacious polyherbal formulation namely SJT-DI- 02 for the treatment of diabetes. The SJT-DI- 02 was comprised of dried extracts of rhizomes of Acorus calamus, leaves of Aegle marmelose, fruits of Benincasa hispida, roots of Chlorophytum arendinaceum, seeds of Eugenia jambolana, leaves of Ocimum sanctum, pericarp of Punica granatum, seeds of Tamarindus indica. Selected plants were collected, dried and extracted with suitable solvents. The formulation was prepared by mixing different fractions of extracts. Materials and Methods: For successful and best standardization, first of all selection and procurement was carried out. Selection is done on the basis of therapeutic efficacy and amount of the marker present in the particular plant part. At the time of procurement side by side phytochemical screening and estimation of phytoconstituents was carried out. After completion of preliminary screening using characterized markers, we tried to develop best TLC systems using selected solvent composition. Finally well-developed TLC systems were applied in HPTLC. In the present study polyherbal formulation was standardized by using different four markers. TLC Densitometric methods were developed using HPTLC for the quantification of these marker compounds. Solvent systems were optimized to achieve best resolution of the marker compounds from other components of the sample extract. The identity of the bands in the sample extracts were confirmed by comparing the Rf and the absorption spectra by overlaying their UV absorption spectra with those of their respective standards. The purity of the bands due to marker compounds in the sample extracts were confirmed by overlaying the absorption spectra recorded at start, middle and end position of the band in the sample tracks. After conforming all these things fingerprints were developed for all three formulations which will be act as authentification and quality control tool. Results: % w/w of asarones is 3. 61, % w/w of marmelosin is 4. 60, % w/w of gallic acid is 10. 80 and % w/w of lupeol is 4. 13. The method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, <b>repeatability,</b> <b>limit</b> of detection, limit of quantification and accuracy. In well-developed mobile phase system linearity was found to be in the range of 0. 983 - 0. 995, % recovery was found to be in the range of 97. 48 - 99. 63, % RSD for intraday and interday was found to be 0. 13 - 0. 70 and 0. 32 - 1. 41 and LOD and LOQ was found to be in the range of 0. 15 - 0. 61 and 0. 45 - 1. 83 microgram per ml. Conclusion: Thus High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) methods were developed and validated in terms of linearity, precision, <b>repeatability,</b> <b>limit</b> of detection, limit of quantification and accuracy. The methods were rapid, sensitive, reproducible and economical. It does not suffer any positive or negative interference due to common other component present in the formulation and would also serve as a tool for authentication of herbal products containing marmelosin, gallic acid, lupeol and asarones. Thus this work provides standardized and therapeutically active polyherbal formulations for the different ailments...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that free d-Asp has a crucial role in N-methyl d-Asp receptor-mediated neurotransmission playing very important functions in physiological and pathological processes. This paper describes the development of an analytical procedure for the direct and simultaneous determination of free d-Asp, l-Asp and N-methyl d-Asp in specimens of different mouse brain tissues using chiral LC-MS/MS in Multiple Reaction Monitoring scan mode. After comparing three procedures and different buffers and extraction solvents, a simple preparation procedure was selected the analytes of extraction. The method was validated by analyzing l-Asp, d-Asp and N-methyl d-Asp recovery at different spiked concentrations (50, 100 and 200 pg/μl) yielding satisfactory recoveries (75 - 110 %), and good <b>repeatability.</b> <b>Limits</b> of detection (LOD) resulted to be 0. 52 pg/μl for d-Asp, 0. 46 pg/μl for l-Asp and 0. 54 pg/μl for NMDA, respectively. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were 1. 57 pg/μl for d-Asp, 1. 41 pg/μl for l-Asp and 1. 64 pg/μl for NMDA, respectively. Different concentration levels were used for constructing the calibration curves which showed good linearity. The validated method was then successfully applied to the simultaneous detection of d-Asp, l-Asp and NMDA in mouse brain tissues. The concurrent, sensitive, fast, and reproducible measurement of these metabolites in brain tissues will be useful to correlate the amount of free d-Asp with relevant neurological processes, making the LC-MS/MS MRM method well suited, not only for research work but also for clinical analyses...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nasal {{potential}} difference (NPD) test {{has long been}} used {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and more recently as an outcome measure in clinical trials of new CF therapies. This test has also been adapted to the mouse nose. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating variability of the NPD measurements in CF patients displaying two severe CFTR mutations and in sex-matched healthy controls. NPD recorded from F 508 del-CF and normal wild-type mice were also compared. Methods and Results: In each setting, tests were performed by a single qualified operator. In the clinical setting, the latest standardized operation protocol of the CF foundation was followed. A total of 80 trac-ings were obtained from 10 patients (23. 2 y; range 14 to 32) and 10 healthy subjects (34 y; range 24 to 53), each tested twice, in both nostrils. Two CF and two controls were excluded from the statistical data analysis due to the presence of a single non interpretable NPD tracing (4 / 80, 5 %). To achieve equal sample size, tests were obtained from 8 CF mice and normal wild-type. Comprehensive multivariate analysis of paired data showed a good reproducibility of NPD pa-rameters in the clinical and the preclinical setting; lower variability was observed in mice. However, 95 % <b>repeatability</b> <b>limits</b> of NPD parameters were large indicating a large measurement error, poor precision and low within-subject re-peatability. In both settings, chloride secretion was shown to be the most reproducible and repeatable parameter. Con...|$|R
