5000|$|The {{outline of}} the design is made of bought tape. Manufacturers {{produced}} {{a huge number of}} suitable tapes in different widths and sometimes with picots or other decoration. The lacemaker bought the tape and sewed it onto a paper with the pattern. Then she filled up the empty spaces with a needle using a variety of stitches. Finally the lace was cut from the paper. [...] The tape laces varied from well-worked versions with a variety of filling stitches to those where the tapes were simply joined with a few needle-made bars. Some regard the whole genre as being <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Lace,</b> with varying forms such as Branscombe, Princess and Battenberg. Others regard <b>Renaissance</b> <b>Lace</b> as one of the types.|$|E
