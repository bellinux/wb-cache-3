These recommendations included improving the rostering process both in the pre-deployment and deployment phases to ensure registration of all workers involved and better communication and transmission of guidance about environmental risks. Additional recommendations for the deployment phase included increased personal protective equipment (PPE) use, better management of heat stress, and improved <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures,</b> illnesses, and injuries.

Tanzania HCWs experience one to nine needle stick injuries (NSIs) per year, yet the use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is largely undocumented. We assessed factors influencing use of PEP among HCWs following occupational exposure to HIV. A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} Mbeya Referral Hospital, Mbozi and Mbarali District Hospitals from December 2009 to January 2010 with a sample size of 360 HCWs. Participants were randomly selected from a list of eligible HCWs in Mbeya hospital and all eligible HCWs were enrolled in the two District Hospitals. Information regarding risk of exposure to body fluids and NSIs were collected using a questionnaire. Logistic regression was done to identify predictors for PEP use using Epi Info 3. 5. 1 at 95 % confidence interval. Of 291 HCWs who participated in the study, 35. 1 % (102 / 291) were exposed to NSIs and body fluids, with NSIs accounting for 62. 9 % (64 / 102). Exposure was highest among medical attendants 38. 8 % (33 / 85).

40|$|Thesis (M. Fam. Med.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health Sciences, 2014. Background: Health Care Workers (HCWs) {{are at risk}} of many blood borne infections at the {{workplace}} following injuries from sharp instruments and also from exposure of skin and mucous membranes to contaminated blood and body fluids. While the risk of exposure to blood and body fluids (BBF) among first level HCWs can be extrapolated to some degree from the literature on secondary and tertiary level HCWs, the rate of <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> and the reasons for not reporting may be very different. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the rate of, and reasons for underreporting of blood and body fluid exposures by doctors and nurses working in the public primary health care setting of sub district F in the Johannesburg metropolitan district.

40|$|Background: Occupational {{exposure}} to blood or other body fluids in healthcare settings constitutes {{a small but}} significant risk of transmission of the Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) to Health Care Workers (HCWs). It is estimated that up to 1000 HIV infections are transmitted annually to HCWs worldwide. Tanzanian HCWs experience one to nine needle stick injuries (NSIs) per year, yet use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) {{to reduce the risk}} of HIV transmission is undocumented. Use of PEP reduces the rate of HIV infection from workplace exposures by 81 %. To better understand this phenomenon the factors influencing use of PEP among HCWs after occupational {{exposure to}} HIV were assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mbeya referral hospital, Mbozi and Mbarali District hospitals from December 2009 to January 2010. A structured questionnaire was administered to HCWs at risk of exposure to body fluids and NSIs. Participants were randomly selected from a list of eligible HCWs in these hospitals. Data were analysed using Epi Info version 3. 5. 1. Stepwise logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with PEP use. Results: A total of 291 HCWs participated in the study with 19. 2 % non-response proportion. Out of 291 HCWs, 102 (35. 1 %) were exposed to body fluids, of which needle stick injuries accounted for 62. 7 % (94 / 150). Prevalence of exposure was high among medical attendants 38. 8 % (33 / 85). Out of exposed HCWs, 23 / 102 (22. 5 %) used HIV PEP; with females more likely to use PEP than males (1 : 2, M: F). <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> (AOR= 21. 1, CI= 3. 85 - 115. 62), and having PEP knowledge (AOR = 6. 5, CI= 1. 78 - 23. 99) were significant factors for PEP use. However, working departments, type of injury, age, educational level and accessibility of PEP service were not statistically significant in this study. Conclusion and recommendations: Despite the high rate of occupational exposure to HCWs in Tanzania, use of PEP is still low even though PEP drugs were available. Reporting of occupational exposures and having PEP knowledge were the factors influenced use of PEP among HCWs. Given the shortage of HCWs in Tanzania, effective prevention against HIV 	 IX infection in work places is required with proper training of HCWs on PEP and emphasis on timely <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures.</b> Efforts to reduce rate of NSls among HCWs should be conducted routinely in hospitals...|$|E
40|$|THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE DEBATE ABOUT THE NEED for {{mandatory}} serologic {{testing of}} individuals who {{are the source of}} bloodborne pathogen exposures in health care and other occupational settings. The transmission of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV between patients and health care workers (HCWs) is related to the frequency of exposures capable of allowing transmission, the prevalence of disease in the source populations, the risk of transmission given exposure to an infected source and the effectiveness of postexposure management. Transmission of HBV from patients to HCWs has been substantially reduced by vaccination and universal precautions. The transmission of HCV and HIV to HCWs does occur, although postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available {{to reduce the risk of}} HIV transmission. Transmission of bloodborne pathogens from infected HCWs to patients has also been documented. Policy-making concerning the mandatory postexposure testing of patients who may be the source of infection must weigh the relative infrequency of patients' refusals to be tested and the consequences for PEP recommendations with the ethical and legal considerations of bypassing informed consent and mandating testing. Mandatory postexposure testing of HCWs who are the source of infection will have a limited impact on reducing transmission because of the lack of recognition and <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures.</b> Comprehensive approaches have been recommended to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne virus infections...|$|E

A workshop hosted by the National Interagency Biodefense Campus was held in October 2007 and was attended by representatives of all existing and planned BSL- 4 research facilities in the U.

This report summarizes important points of discussion and recommendations for future coordinated action, including guidelines for the engineering and operational controls appropriate for a hospital care and isolation unit. Recommendations pertained to initial management of exposures (ie, immediate treatment of penetrating injuries, <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures,</b> initial evaluation, and triage). Isolation and medical care in a referral hospital (including minimum standards for isolation units), staff recruitment and training, and community outreach also were addressed. Workshop participants agreed that any unit designated for the isolation and treatment of laboratory employees accidentally infected with a BSL- 3 or - 4 pathogen should be designed to maximize the efficacy of patient care while minimizing the risk of transmission of infection. Further, participants concurred that there is no medically based rationale for building care and isolation units to standards approximating a BSL- 4 laboratory. Instead, laboratory workers accidentally exposed to pathogens should be cared for in hospital isolation suites staffed by highly trained professionals following strict infection control procedures...|$|E

Method: Samples of consecutive parents of infants 12 months of age or younger who attended Hunter Region public child health and immunisation clinics were approached to complete a questionnaire and to allow a urine sample to be obtained from their infant during December and January 1998 / 99. Infant urine samples were analysed for cotinine and information obtained regarding the smoking status of household members, infant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during the previous three days, and parent and infant characteristics and demographics. Results: 85 (47 %) [95 % CI 40 – 54] infants in the combined sample had detectable levels of cotinine. Sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> infant <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> 86 % was achieved through the combined measure <b>of</b> parent <b>report</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and smoking status of households. The odds <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for infants <b>of</b> smoking parents were 14 times that of infants of non-smokers [CI 5. 26 – 50. 0]. Conclusions: Almost half of the infants in this study had detectable levels of cotinine in their urine. Future interventions targeting infant exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should incorporate quit smoking strategies for both parents and other household members, as well as strategies for changing the pattern of smoking behaviour around infants.

Memory-based reports obtained from smoking mothers showed moderately strong and consistent linear relationships with urine cotinine measures of their infants and children (r = 0. 50  to r = 0. 63), but not for reports obtained from non-smoking mothers.  CONCLUSIONS—Memory-based parental <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> short-term ETS <b>exposure</b> can {{play an important role in}} quantifying ETS exposure in infants and children.    Keywords: environmental tobacco smoke; parental smoking; passive smokin...|$|R

40|$|The {{recommended}} {{standard is}} given limiting employee exposure {{to less than}} 15 milligrams of hydrogen-sulfide (7783064) per cubic meter of air (10 ppm) during a 10 minute sampling period {{for up to a}} 10 -hour work shift in a 40 -hour workweek with evacuation of the area if the concentration equals or exceeds 70 milligrams per cubic meter. In addition, standards are given for medical surveillance, labeling and posting, personal protective equipment, work practices, sanitation, and monitoring and recordkeeping. The criteria for the standards are also given, including extent <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> in the United States, historical <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> effects on humans, epidemiological studies, animal toxicity, correlation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and effect, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, effects on reproduction, environmental concentrations to which workers have been exposed, various attempts at controlling exposure, environmental sampling and analytical methods, biological monitoring, work practices and safety precautions for handling carbon-disulfide, the bases upon which previous and the present standards are recommended, and research needs. Appendices give the recommended air sampling method, analytical method, specifications for monitors, material safety data sheet, and NIOSH interim work practice recommendations for the gas and oil industry issued in August, 1976. Tables give physical and chemical properties, occupations with potential exposure, and calibration setup for personal sampling pump.

40|$|Anti-cancer {{drugs are}} {{reactive}} compounds with known adverse health effects. To prevent occupational exposure to these drugs, there are, in most countries, regulations for handling anti-cancer drugs. Many preparation systems are available, e. g. isolators, {{biological safety cabinets}} (BSCs), filter spikes (venting spikes with micro-pore filter) and closed systems (e. g. PhaSealTM). Although these systems are used, there are <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> This causes con-cern over how efficient these systems are to prevent spill and leakage that may cause undesired exposure when handling cytotoxic drugs. Today, this knowledge is lacking. This paper presents a method (Tc-method) for testing drug preparation systems for spill and leakage. The Tc-method is based on 99 Tcm as a tracer, with which drug vials used for test preparations are spiked. Wipe samples are then collected around the working area to measure spill and leakage. The Tc-method has been validated using an independent method, showing good agree-ment between the methods. Spills down to 1 nl cm 2 can be determined. In an appendix, the Tc-method is described in a detailed step-by-step procedure...|$|R
