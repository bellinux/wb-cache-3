50|$|Penning traps use {{a strong}} {{homogeneous}} axial magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially. The static electric potential {{can be generated}} using a set of three electrodes: a ring and two endcaps. In an ideal Penning trap the ring and endcaps are hyperboloids of revolution. For trapping of positive (negative) ions, the endcap electrodes are kept at a positive (negative) potential relative to the ring. This potential produces a saddle point in {{the centre of the}} trap, which traps ions along the axial direction. The electric field causes ions to oscillate (harmonically {{in the case of an}} ideal Penning trap) along the trap axis. The magnetic field in combination with the electric field causes charged particles to move in the <b>radial</b> <b>plane</b> with a motion which traces out an epitrochoid.|$|E
5000|$|Rotating stall {{is a local}} {{disruption}} of airflow within the compressor which continues to provide compressed air but with reduced effectiveness. Rotating stall arises when {{a small proportion of}} airfoils experience airfoil stall disrupting the local airflow without destabilising the compressor. The stalled airfoils create pockets of relatively stagnant air (referred to as stall cells) which, rather than moving in the flow direction, rotate around the circumference of the compressor. The stall cells rotate with the rotor blades but at 50 to 70% of their speed, affecting subsequent airfoils around the rotor as each encounters the stall cell. Propagation of the instability around the flow path annulus is driven by stall cell blockage causing an incidence spike on the adjacent blade. The adjacent blade stalls {{as a result of the}} incidence spike, thus causing stall cell [...] "rotation" [...] around the rotor. Stable local stalls can also occur which are axi-symmetric, covering the complete circumference of the compressor disc but only a portion of its <b>radial</b> <b>plane,</b> with the remainder of the face of the compressor continuing to pass normal flow.|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} of femoral head sphericity and related risk for femoroacetabularimpingement is currently limited to an angular estimate-the alpha angle-whose relevance and accuracy have been challenged. We developed a three-dimensional approach for both automated digital {{measurement of the}} alpha angle and the detection of camdeformities. Accuracy and diagnostic relevance of the alpha angle estimated {{by means of the}} oblique axial and multiple <b>radial</b> <b>plane</b> protocol were compared with the computed results. Using subject-specific statistical information of the femur head and mid-neck region, a method was developed to accurately compute the maximum alpha angle and to define aspherical eccentric areas at the femoral head-neck junction. The method was evaluated on 102 dry cadaver femur specimens. Average detection limit for bony prominences at the head-neck transition was 0. 98 mm. Pixel size of the investigated CT data was 0. 79 mm. Mean maximum computed alpha angle of the femurs with cam-type morphology as identified by the morphological method was 67. 72 A degrees (range 53. 04 - 88. 02 A degrees). Mean maximum computed alpha angle of the femurs without cam deformity was 47. 65 A degrees (range 38. 67 - 59. 81 A degrees).

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} a novel {{multipass}} optical arrangement for use with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) in the quadrupole ion trap is presented. This design circumvents previous problems of limited IR laser power, small IR absorption cross sections for many molecules, and the limited ion statistics of trapping and detection of ions for IRMPD in the quadrupole ion trap. In contrast to previous designs that utilized the quadrupole ion store, the quadrupole ion trap was operated in the mass selective instability mode with concurrent resonance ejection. The instrumental design consisted of a modified ring electrode with three spherical concave mirrors mounted on the inner surface of the ring. This modified design allowed for eight laser passes across the <b>radial</b> <b>plane</b> of the ring electrode. IRMPD of protonated bis(2 -methoxyethyl) ether (diglyme) was used to characterize {{the performance of the}} multipass ring electrode.
