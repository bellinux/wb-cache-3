40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of ultrasonication, thermosonication and UV-C irradiation on the quality attributes of strawberries (Fragaria anannassa) and <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> (Capsicum annuum, L.). Thermosonication {{studies were carried out}} at 50 ºC and 65 ºC. Control water treatments at the same temperatures were conducted. The analysed quality factors were colour and texture for both products, in addition to anthocyanins content in the case of strawberries. Results showed that UV-C constituted a harmless treatment, with little or no effect on color, texture or anthocyanins content. Ultrasonication caused small colour changes and no significant effects on texture of both products. Thermosonication at 65 ºC resulted in undesirable changes of color, anthocyanins and texture of strawberries, and color of <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers.</b> When compared to water treated samples, thermosonicated ones showed higher texture retention. This effect was much more pronounced on <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{continuous}} exposure to ozone on quality changes during {{the storage of}} <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers,</b> cucumbers and zucchini was investigated. Peppers were stored at 14 °C and were exposed to ozone at 0. 1 and 0. 3 μmol mol− 1, while cucumbers and zucchini were stored at 12 and 8 °C, respectively, and exposed to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1. The content of fructose (2. 75 g/ 100 g FW) and glucose (2. 00 g/ 100 g FW) in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> exposed to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1 was increased by 8 and 7 %, respectively, when compared to controls. Continuous exposure to ozone at 0. 3 μmol mol− 1, on the other hand, {{had no effect on}} fructose (2. 52 g/ 100 g FW) and glucose (1. 88 g/ 100 g FW) content. The content of vitamin C was significantly enhanced in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> exposed to ozone at 0. 1 and 0. 3 μmol mol− 1 after 7 d of storage, however, this effect was not maintained. After 14 d, vitamin C content in peppers exposed to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1 was not significantly different from the control, whereas it was reduced at 0. 3 μmol mol− 1. Total phenolics content was increased in peppers exposed to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1, but was unaffected at 0. 3 μmol mol− 1. Continuous exposure of <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> to ozone at 0. 1 and 0. 3 μmol mol− 1 had no significant effect on weight loss, texture and colour. In cucumbers and zucchini, continuous exposure to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1 reduced weight loss by more than 40 % and improved texture maintenance, while having no significant effect on their biochemistry. The findings from this study suggest that continuous exposure to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1 is a promising method for shelf-life extension of cucumbers and zucchini. Even though in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> continuously exposed to ozone at 0. 1 μmol mol− 1 sugars and phenolics content was increased, further work is still needed to better understand the exact mechanism of ozone action and its potential for the industrial use...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} non-thermal {{technologies}} (ozone in aqueous solution, ultrasounds and ultraviolet C radiation) and washings with chemical solutions (sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide) on Listeria innocua survival was studied in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers.</b> Quality attributes such as total colour difference, firmness, pH and ascorbic and dehydroascorbic acid content were also evaluated. The treatments were applied before product storage under frozen conditions (− 7 and − 30 °C). Pre-washings with hydrogen peroxide solutions allowed obtaining frozen shred <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> with lower microbial loads, {{when compared to}} the results obtained with the remaining treatments. However, those washings had a negative impact on colour and firmness. Alternatively, ozonation provided microbial reductions significantly higher than water-washings and improved, or at least allowed to preserve, all quality parameters analysed under both storage conditions. Storage at − 7 °C provided higher microbial reductions in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers.</b> However, this temperature implied higher colour alterations and ascorbic acid losses. Industrial relevance: The native microbial flora of fresh fruits and vegetables may include pathogens which are dangerous threats to consumers. Thermal treatments are conventionally used to attain safety standards; however, overall quality may be negatively affected by heat. Chemical treatments (environmental friendly) or non-thermal processes such as ozone, UV-C radiation and ultrasonication are promising technologies. From an industrial point of view, these processes may have potential application if safe and high quality produce is to be attained...|$|R
