The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

However later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of <b>requirements,</b> <b>in</b> order to secure jobs in the North East's heavy manufacturing industries.
