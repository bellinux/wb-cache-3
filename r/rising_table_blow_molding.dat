5000|$|<b>Blow</b> <b>molding</b> ( [...] BrE {{moulding}} [...] ) is {{a manufacturing}} {{process by which}} hollow plastic parts are formed: It is also used for forming glass bottles. In general, there are three main types of blow molding: extrusion <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> and injection stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b> The <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process begins with melting down the plastic and forming it into a [...] {{or in the case}} of injection and injection stretch blow moulding (ISB) a preform. The parison is a tube-like piece of plastic with a hole in one end through which compressed air can pass.|$|R
50|$|For {{amorphous}} metals, {{also known}} as bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> has been recently demonstrated under pressures and temperatures comparable to plastic <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{a cooling}} period the <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> opens and the core rod is rotated to the {{ejection}} position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod {{and as an}} option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> can have many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent preform injection, <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and ejection.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} {{rotational}} molding {{can be used}} as a feasible alternative to <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> this is due to the similarity in product outputs, with products such as plastic bottles and cylindrical containers, this is only effective on a smaller scale as it much more costly to <b>blow</b> <b>mold</b> regarding a small output, and with fewer resulting products rotational molding is much cheaper, due to <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> relying on economies of scale regarding efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The process {{principle}} {{comes from}} the idea of glassblowing. Someone produced a <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> machine and sold it to Hartford Empire Company in 1938. This {{was the beginning of the}} commercial <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process. During the 1940s the variety and number of products was still very limited and therefore <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> did not take off until later. Once the variety and production rates went up the number of products created followed soon afterwards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Variable speed drives used in <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> {{have changed}} {{little in the}} last 20 years or more even though {{substantial}} technology advances {{have taken place in}} other areas of the <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> process. A new variable speed technology has become available in the last 5 years and several <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> manufacturers and users have taken advantage of this advancement and are using Brushless D. C. drives for the extruder function as well as for rotating molds. This paper addresses the advantages this new Brushless technology brings to variable speed drives in general and <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> Machines in particular. Areas specifically addressed include efficiency, accuracy, power factor, size, harmonics, and speed range. A basic description of how Brushless D. C. works and a comparison to other types of variable speed is given. With increasing emphasis on product quality at lower costs, the need for modernizing the <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> Machine becomes ever more important. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{injection}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> (IBM) {{is used for}} the production of hollow glass and plastic objects in large quantities. In the IBM process, the polymer is injection molded onto a core pin; then the core pin is rotated to a <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> station to be inflated and cooled. This is the least-used of the three <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> processes, and is typically used to make small medical and single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection, blowing and ejection.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} shaping {{technique}} is injection molding, {{which is used}} for parts such as cups, cutlery, vials, caps, containers, housewares, and automotive parts such as batteries. The related techniques of <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and injection-stretch <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> are also used, which involve both extrusion and molding.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThanks to {{the single}} stage {{injection}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process, specific hollow parts can be produced with standard injection molding machine. A specific mold is designed, enabling the preform injection molding, {{as well as its}} <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> on the same machine. The preform is <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> right after its injection molding. This particular process does not involve preform storage and reheating before the <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> stage. This implies that the preform has to remain sufficiently malleable to be blown while being viscous enough to avoid being pierced during the <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> stage. The polymer used is a polypropylene random copolymer. Therefore the process takes place between the melting temperature and the crystallization one. As the preform is <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> right after being injected, this single stage process involves high temperature before the blowing. The polymer rheological behavior is investigated through dynamic rheometry in its molten state at various temperatures. A viscous Cross model is used with the thermal dependence assumed by an Arrhenius law. The process is simulated through a finite element code (Polyflow) in the ANSYS Workbench framework. The geometry allows an axisymmetric approach. The transient simulation is run under anisothermal conditions and viscous heating is taken into account. Two geometries are simulated. First, the flask geometry has been used to show the process efficiency. The yoghurt pot geometry has been designed later for industrial application in a more sophisticated mold than the flask <b>mold.</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>molded</b> parts are analyzed by tomography and the thickness has been measured by the tomography data image analysis. The simulation results are compared to the experimental ones. The simulation fits well with the experimental results concerning both geometries. The simple numerical model proposed proves to be robust enough to predict well the <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> parts final thickness repartitions provided that the relevant temperature and pressure conditions are well defined...|$|R

40|$|Non-linear {{finite element}} {{simulations}} of the <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> and thermoforming processes {{have been used}} to provide accurate predictions of the material thinning. However, this powerful simulation tool has provided limited assistance to the design and optimization of the wall thickness distribution of preforms used in injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b> Trial-and-error methods are often used in design. This paper presents a technique that converts finite element analysis of the injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> process into a design/optimization tool. A systematic optimization technique for preform design that uses an iterative series of non-linear finite element simulations will be described. The series of simulations converges on a preform wall thickness distribution that will result in a specified thickness distribution in the <b>blow</b> <b>molded</b> product. This design technique is especially effective for non-circular or irregular shaped products. Preform Optimization Goal Injection <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> involves three stages. The first stage is the injection molding of the plastic preform that is commonly shaped like a test tube. The second stage is the conditioning of the preform, bringing its temperature to the proper level for molding. In the third stage the preform is placed insid...|$|R
