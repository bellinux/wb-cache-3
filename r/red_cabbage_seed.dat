In this test three commercial varieties of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> <b>seeds</b> were tested for the ability of regeneration by organogenesis from hypocotyls, cotyledons, and stem segments. Our results have shown us that the intensity of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> head regeneration depends on the genotype used but also the type of explant. Hipocotil fragments taken from seedlings to "Cabeza Negra 2 "had the greatest total capacity to produce shoots than the other two genotypes tested when the combination of phytohormones was used consisting of 2 mg / l 6 -benzyl-aminopurine (BAP) and type auxine ß indolilacetic acid (IBA) and α naftilacetic acid (NAA) at concentrations of 0. 2 to 0. 4 mg /l.

50|$|It is {{recommended}} to start <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> <b>seeds</b> indoors 4 {{weeks before the}} last frost. Sow in containers that allow for movement of water through {{the bottom of a}} cell. Popular seedling starting containers are peat pots, egg cartons, plug trays or milk cartons. Once the seedlings grow to about 2 inch cm tall, and have developed their first leaves, they can be hardened off and moved outside for transplanting. Red cabbage prefers climates that remain moist and cool for most of its vegetative growth stage, so they can be placed in the ground shortly after the last frost, while the spring is still cool. The cabbage plants can be spaced about 12 - 26 inch cm from one another. They will need watering often but are otherwise low maintenance plants.|$|R

The protocol used entailed ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose followed by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono S. The protein hindered mycelial growth in Mycosphaerella arachidicola (with an IC 50 = 5 μM), Setospaeria turcica, and Bipolaris maydis. It also inhibited the yeast Candida albicans with an IC 50 = 96 μM. It exerted its antifungal action by permeabilizing the fungal membrane as evidenced by staining with Sytox green. The antifungal activity was stable from pH 3 to 11 and from 0 to 65 °C. It manifested antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IC 50 = 53 μM).

The {{study showed that}} <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice (RC) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-induced inflammation of splenocytes via increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 10 and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6 secretions. The maximum absorption peaks of RC and its heated products, but not activated charcoal-adsorbed products, appeared at 280 nm with a small shoulder around 310 - 330 nm while there existed a minor peak at 560 nm (range from 480 to 630 nm), reflecting <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice included phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. The lyophilized powder of chromatographic fractions F 2, F 3, and F 4 through Sephadex LH- 20 column were rich in phenolics (5. 9 +/- 0. 2 %, 4. 4 +/- 0. 0 %, and 3. 9 +/- 0. 0 %, respectively) and flavonoids (1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 %, and 1. 1 +/- 0. 3 %, respectively). The results suggest that anti-inflammatory pigment compounds in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> juice were heat stable.

40|$|Genistein (GNT), an isoflavone, {{is used in}} the {{clinical}} treatment of various health disorders. GNT is found in primary food source plants and some medical plants. However, studies on the functions of GNT in plants are rarely reported. In this study, we demonstrated that GNT {{plays an important role in}} promoting anthocyanin accumulation in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage.</b> GNT solutions (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/L) as foliar fertilizers were applied to <b>red</b> <b>cabbage.</b> Consequently, anthocyanin accumulation in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> increased in a light-dependent manner. GNT solution at 30 mg/L exhibited the optimal effect on anthocyanin accumulation, which was twice that of the control. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that GNT application upregulated the expression of all structural genes, contributing to anthocyanin biosynthesis under light conditions. Under dark conditions, GNT exerted no significant promotive effect on anthocyanin accumulation; only early biosynthetic genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis responded to GNT. The promotive effect of GNT on anthocyanin biosynthesis is directly attributable to the regulation of structural gene expression. Transcription factors exhibited no response to GNT. The levels of anthocyanin in <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> positively correlated with the enzyme activities of antioxidant systems. This finding correlation suggested that the promotive effect of GNT on anthocyanin levels was correlated with improved antioxidant activity in the <b>red</b> <b>cabbage...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{estimate}} the shelf life of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts (stored at 4 and 10 °C), {{the numbers of}} total aerobic bacteria were determined during storage. Parameters for the Gompertz model were determined and the shelf life was predicted using a modified Gompertz equation. The estimated shelf lives of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts packed with polyolefin film and polyamide/polyamide/polyethylene (PA/PA/PE) film at 4 °C were 49. 4 and 52. 3 h, respectively, whereas those of <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts packed with polyolefin film and PA/PA/PE film at 10 °C were 19. 7 and 22. 6, respectively. The shelf life prediction equation was appropriate, based on the statistical analysis of the accuracy factor, bias factor, and mean square error. On the other hand, for <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> sprouts treated with aqueous ClO 2 /fumaric acid and UV-C then packed with polyolefin film or PA/PA/PE film, the shelf life was predicted to be longer than 168 h.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on anthocyanin extraction from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> using water as a solvent. Mashed cabbage was placed in a batch treatment chamber and subjected to PEF (2. 5 kV/cm electric field strength; 15 μs pulse width and 50 pulses, specific energy 15. 63 J/g). Extracted anthocyanin concentrations (16 to 889 μg/mL) were determined using HPLC. Heat and light stabilities of the control and PEF-treated samples, having approximately the same initial concentrations, were studied. PEF treatments enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> by 2. 15 times with a higher proportion of nonacylated forms than the control (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The heat and light stabilities of the PEF-treated samples and control samples were not significantly different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Practical Application: An innovative pretreatment technology, pulsed electric field processing, enhanced total anthocyanin extraction in water from <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> by 2. 15 times.

40|$|Application of {{high voltage}} pulsed {{electric}} fields (PEF) to plant tissues increases porosity {{of the plant}} cells, enhancing juice extraction from fruits and vegetables. Red cabbage and beetroot are rich sources of bioactive compounds anthocyanins and betalains, respectively. Pulsed electric field (red cabbage: 1 kV/cm electric field strength, 0. 66 µF and 20 pulses; red beets: 1. 5 kV/cm electric field strength, 0. 66 µF and 20 pulses) was applied to whole <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> and beetroot to enhance juice extraction. Total polyphenols, anthocyanins (<b>red</b> <b>cabbage),</b> betalains (beetroot) and total antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH) of the extracted juice was determined. The bioactivity of the juices on colon cancer cell line HCT- 116 (p 53 +/+ and p 53 -/-) were analyzed. The anti-proliferative activity, apoptosis and cytotoxicity were determined.
