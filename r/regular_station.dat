2500|$|Railway: The {{opening of}} the London to Brighton railway in 1841 {{triggered}} a further expansion of the town, although Burgess Hill railway station was for many years a request stop and not a <b>regular</b> <b>station.</b> In 1877 the present station replaced the original one; some of the former buildings remain, however. Wivelsfield railway station serves {{the north end of}} Burgess Hill and was opened in 1886. Thameslink and Southern provide regular train services towards London and Brighton from both Burgess Hill stations. In addition, from Burgess Hill, one can travel on the branch of the West Coastway Line to , [...] and Portsmouth, and from Wivelsfield, one can travel on a branch of the East Coastway Line towards [...]|$|E
2500|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of the TRE line is Dallas Union Station on {{the west}} side of downtown Dallas. [...] The line runs northwest, past the American Airlines Center and Southwestern Medical Center, through Irving, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Hurst, and Richland Hills before ending with two stops in downtown Fort Worth (the Fort Worth Intermodal Transportation Center at 9th and Jones Streets and the T Station on Throckmorton Street). There are a total of ten <b>regular</b> <b>station</b> stops, including a stop at Victory Station (which until the opening of DART's Green line in September 2009, was used only for special events). Not all trains are through trains - a number of trains either terminate or originate at the CentrePort/DFW Airport Station.|$|E

60|$|They {{returned}} to the ships, and after touching at St. Catherine and leaving there enough men to defend it, {{under the command of}} a Frenchman named Le Sieur Simon, they sailed for Jamaica. Everything at St. Catherine was arranged for permanent occupation; there was plenty of fresh water, and the ground could be cultivated, and Simon was promised that additional forces should be sent him so that he could hold the island as a <b>regular</b> <b>station</b> for the assembling and fitting out of pirate vessels.|$|E
60|$|I wrote a few lines, upon {{my arrival}} here two days ago; {{but as the}} post was upon the point of starting, I could not do more than state that the rumours which had reached us down below {{respecting}} the King of Tigré were untrue, and that that monarch was at present pursuing a course of masterly inactivity. I will now, therefore, resume my letter {{at the point where}} my last regular communication ended—namely, at the station of Sooro, in the pass leading to this place. I do not apologise for making my description of this pass very detailed, for at present the whole interest of the expedition centres in the passage of the troops and baggage from Zulla to this point, and I feel sure that any particulars which may enable the public to picture to themselves the country through which our soldiers are marching will be read with keen interest. From Sooro to Rayray Guddy, the next <b>regular</b> <b>station,</b> is, according to the official report, twenty-eight miles; but I am convinced, and in this opinion I am borne out by every officer I have spoken to, that thirty-three would be much nearer the fact. Indeed, in every march up here the official distances are a good deal under the truth. But, indeed, the officers of the exploring force appear to have seen everything through rose-coloured spectacles. At Zulla they reported plenty of water, and they found, a short way further, an abundance of forage, which no one else has been able to discover before or since. It was on the strength of these reports of forage and water that the baggage-animals were hurried forward. I am not blaming the officers who made the reports. They simply acted as it is the nature of explorers to act. Every father thinks his own child a prodigy. Every discoverer believes that the country, or river, or lake which he has been the first to report on, is a country, river, or lake such as no man ever saw before. Over and over again this has happened, and disastrous consequences have ere now arisen from the persistent use by explorers of these rose-coloured spectacles. It is not more than four or five years—to give one example out of a thousand—since Dr. Livingstone reported that he had discovered a magnificent navigable river in Eastern Africa, with rice, cotton, and corn abounding upon its banks, and a climate beyond reproach. In consequence of this report the “Universities Mission” was organised, and a band of missionaries, headed by their bishop, Mackenzie, started. After months of struggle they arrived at the place of disembarkation, having already discovered that their noble stream was, at a good average time of year, about three feet deep. There they set up their mission; there, one by one, these noble fellows died of want and of fever, victims of an explorer’s rose-coloured spectacles. After that we must not grudge the few hundred mules that have fallen a sacrifice to the want of springs and forage which could be seen only through the glasses of the chiefs of the exploring party.|$|E

50|$|Some metro {{stations}} are interchanges, serving to transfer passengers between lines or transport systems. The platforms may be multi-level. Transfer stations handle more passengers than <b>regular</b> <b>stations,</b> with additional connecting tunnels and larger concourses to reduce walking times and manage crowd flows.|$|R

50|$|The {{line was}} laid in a 11-metre-deep cutting in Rosengarten {{so that the}} descent to Frankfurt station would be only 41 metres. The line went into {{operation}} on 23 October 1842. Passenger trains between Berlin and Frankfurt did not stop in the Rosengarten. But the 1843 timetable shows stops in Rosengarten for freight trains that also carried passengers. Later Rosengarten became a <b>regular</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{stations}} on the Waterbury Branch {{have two}} major differences {{in comparison to}} most other stations in the Metro-North system. None have station houses or ticket machines, {{making it possible to}} buy fares on board with no surcharge. All stations, except for Waterbury, have low-level platforms (with the exception of Merritt 7 on the Danbury Branch, no other <b>regular</b> <b>stations</b> east of the Hudson have such platforms).|$|R
50|$|Subways are {{underground}} railways {{so they do}} {{not require}} buildings to be bulldozed, {{which makes it a}} more sensible choice for dense cities. They are more expensive to build than ordinary railways, about 8 in-game currency per tile, however, making it more sensible not to use them to link parts of your city that are far away from each other and do not have buildings in between them.Subway stations are also smaller than train stations, occupying a 1x1 square rather than a 3x3 square for <b>regular</b> <b>stations.</b> Subway stations are also easier to link to rails than ordinary railway stations.|$|R

Of late, stations like Sachal FM 105 and some others have gained popularity. But the unavailability of an up-to-date news and current affairs platform renders the services of such stations of not much value to the masses but nonetheless appealing to youngsters.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{in light}} of intense {{competition}} public broadcasting faces from a greatly expanded media environment, other stations, especially radio, have aimed to eliminate pledge drives altogether, or significantly reduce their length, by asking for contributions throughout the year during <b>regular</b> <b>station</b> identification breaks.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of April 1, 2004, as an April Fool's joke, Wild 100's morning show was {{replaced}} by a pre-recorded episode of The Russ Martin Show. Later that day, Russ Martin was back on his <b>regular</b> <b>station,</b> Live 105.3, where he got calls from Russ Martin show listeners who thought this change was for good.

A two-track spur with two side platforms {{of its own}} runs north of the main station and connects with the non-revenue tracks on Chestnut Hill Avenue. This spur, built after the loop removal in 1980, is sometimes used to detrain passengers from cars short-turning at Reservoir {{so as not to}} block the main tracks. A sidewalk ramp runs alongside the spur line, serving as a handicapped-accessible route to the station platforms from the north.|$|E
