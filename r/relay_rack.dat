50|$|Ladder logic was {{originally}} a written method {{to document the}} design and construction of relay racks as used in manufacturing and process control. Each device in the <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> would be represented by a symbol on the ladder diagram with connections between those devices shown. In addition, other items external to the <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> such as pumps, heaters, and so forth would also be shown on the ladder diagram. See relay logic.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> {{appeared}} {{first in}} the world of telephony.By 1911, the term was also being used in railroad signaling. There is little evidence that the dimensions of these early racks were standardized.|$|E
50|$|Each KWT-37 filled {{an entire}} <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> with five stacked modules. A {{precision}} time reference occupied the bottom, three key generators (stream cyphers in civilian parlance) occupied {{the middle and}} an alarm panel occupied the top position. The outputs of the three key generators were combined in a voting circuit. If one of the units' output did not match the other two, an alarm was sounded and the output from the two units that did agree continued to be used.|$|E

50|$|Junctor Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} Junctor Circuits, had Intraoffice Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal Trunk Frames as interoffice trunks. They carried overflow traffic when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in <b>relay</b> <b>racks</b> similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{information}} {{on display in}} 2002 at the NSA's National Cryptologic Museum, the KY-3 provided high fidelity secure voice over special wideband circuits known as [...] "4-wire dedicated drops". It was used by executives, diplomats, military leaders and the intelligence community. Some 2500 units were produced between 1965 and 1967 {{and it was one}} of the first telecommunication security devices to use transistors packaged into functional modules. The unit was packaged in a grey <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> cabinet. The KY-3 was replaced by the STU-I and STU-II.|$|E

50|$|The first {{adaptive}} equalizer, in 1964, used 13 adjustable gains, {{each set}} by 8 <b>relays.</b> The <b>rack</b> of equipment was about 5 foot high. Its use immediately made possible data transmission at 9600 {{bits per second}} - four times the highest previously attainable speed.|$|R
30|$|As {{soon as it}} has tuned back to {{the primary}} channel, the relay node waits a PIFS and then sends a <b>Relay</b> ACK (<b>RACK)</b> back to the AP. This {{prevents}} the relay node from causing a collision with any existing transmission or its acknowledgement frame, but also gives it priority access over any new transmission.|$|R

40|$|HE accuracy, {{speed and}} {{simplicity}} with T which measurements {{can be made}} with the electronic frequency counter have made {{it one of the most}} useful and popular instruments available. In the ten years since it was first offered commercially, considerable industry effort has been devoted to further refinement of digital counting techniques and to expanding the versatility of equipment employing these techniques. Drawing from the experience of its years of leadership in this field, Hewlett-Packard has recently introduced the electronic counters shown below as the first of a new generation of digital frequency and time-measuring instruments. Of the two new counters one operates over the frequency range from 2 cps to 1. 2 megacycles and the other from 2 cps to 300 kilocycles. Both will measure frequency, period, and the average of up to lo 5 periods as well as the ratio of two frequencies, and both will operate on signals down to 0. 1 volt rms. The higher frequency counter presents its measurements on a 6 -digit display system, while the 300 kc counter has a 5 -digit display system. Each counter is available with either an in-line readout or with an improved arrangement of the familiar column readout. Both counters are fully transistorized and are packaged in cabinets only 34 ” high. The cabinet style is such that the standard bench-type instrument can also be used in a <b>relay</b> <b>rack,</b> if desired, by adding a pair of simple brackets supplied with the instrument...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is thought}} that WSJM-FM {{was one of the}} world's first {{completely}} automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called [...] "More Good Music (MGM)" [...] and five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch Ampex machine which provided the main program audio and a second RCA seven inch machine which provided [...] "fill" [...] music. The tapes that these machines played were originally produced in the MWF's Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with special sub-audible cue tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was [...] "programmed" [...] by slide switches {{in the front of the}} two <b>relay</b> <b>racks</b> which housed the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 20-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM, whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce [...] "This is WSJM AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan." [...] This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.|$|R
30|$|The relay sends a Request-to-send, Borrowed Channel (RTSBC) {{frame to}} the {{destination}} node, indicating that {{it intends to}} send a relayed packet on another channel and therefore the destination node should retune its transceiver to that channel. The RTSBC is also overheard by the AP, and serves as the acknowledgement for the RDATA frame (indicated by the dotted line in the figure). As such, the RTSBC is sent an SIFS interval after the RDATA frame. When the AP receives the RTSBC frame, it knows that the relay is in progress and adds both the relay and destination nodes to its forbidden list (this is intended to prevent the AP from attempting to transmit to nodes that cannot hear it and is described in Section 4.4). The AP also sets a Forbidden List Timer for {{an amount of time}} longer than the relay is expected to take. If the AP does not receive a <b>Relay</b> ACK (<b>RACK)</b> within this time interval, it assumes that the relay has failed and removes both nodes from the forbidden list.|$|R
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in <b>relay</b> <b>racks</b> R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|R
40|$|The {{test unit}} is a custom photodetector/event timer, PET, {{built for the}} Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, SAO, by Los Alamos which records elapsed time in 10 ps steps. The 1 Kg, 12 cm {{diameter}} PET unit uses 10 watts of electrical power and was tested to SAO`s specified flight conditions. The event timer has two inputs [...] a reference clock oscillator input and a stop signal. Like a stop watch with split timing capability, the event timer records the instant a stop signal arrives. At that sample instant, the number of elapsed clock cycles are stored and the sample instant position between two reference clock edges is interpolated and stored. Then that stored data can be shifted serially to an external computer. The photodetector part of the PET responds to an optical input and provides the electrical output signal to the event timer specifying the sample instant. This test report discusses the event timer test results. Test equipment is shown {{for most of the}} operational tests. The <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> contains test pursers and clocks. The environmental chamber controls temperature. The computer reads and records the serial data from the PET.

40|$|A low-noise {{microwave}} receiver {{was designed}} and fabricated to provide the necessary sensitivity to detect the helium 3 line. In order to achieve ultra-low noise amplification in the input states of this receiver, cascaded non-degenerate cryogenically cooled parametric amplifiers were used. These amplifiers were followed by a tunnel diode amplifier and a mixer-preamplifier which provides a total system gain of approximately 60 db. The parametric amplifiers were cooled to the cryogenic temperature by a closed-cycle gaseous helium refrigerator. The ambient operating temperature provided by the refrigerator was approximately 18 °K. The parametric amplifiers were pumped with a Ka-band klystron which provides a signal-to-idler ratio of approximately 0. 38. Gain stability was achieved by using waveguide ferrite current variable attenuators which were used to control the pump power as required to maintain a constant varactor current. The system was designed to consist of two major assemblies. One of the assemblies is packaged in a 30 x 30 x 60 inch weather proof enclosure for mounting at {{the focal point of}} the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 140 foot radio telescope. This enclosure includes a thermoelectric cooling and heating system to maintain a constant temperature inside the assembly under all weather condition. The second assembly was packaged in a standard <b>relay</b> <b>rack</b> type cabinet. This unit contains all of the receiver control, monitoring and special remote test circuits. The two assemblies were designed to operate with connecting cable lengths of up to 500 feet. During the first observing period, the noise temperature performance of the receiver was about three times that expected, i. e., 100 °K. However, the stability of the system was sufficient to allow long integration periods so that usable data was obtained. To correct the noise temperature performance, the parametric amplifiers were redesigned, particularly in the area of thermal conductivity. In addition, the manufacturer and package style of the varactor was changed to terminate the high failure rate that had occurred in the diodes. In addition to the low-noise temperature and excellent gain stability achieved by this receiver, several new concepts were utilized in the design of the system which greatly improved its mechanical and thermal properties. One of these is a special non-contacting choke flange on the input line to the parametric amplifiers which allows the input line to be short and unrestricted in location. The system will be utilized again in the summer of 1970. The present performance of the system should provide data which is far superior to that obtained in the last observing period since for the same signal-to-noise ratio, the integration time should be reduced by a factor of four or more...|$|E
