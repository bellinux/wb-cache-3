The program focuses on the development of new GA technologies including bad weather flight and landing systems, complete with graphic displays of weather and guidance information; emergency coping and avoidance measures that use on-board systems to support decision-making; traffic avoidance systems; systems that <b>reduce</b> the <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> workload and enhance passenger safety; and systems designed to improve passenger comfort, aircraft performance and efficiency. The success of AGATE will be measured in terms of increases in pilot population, flight hours, airport utilization and new aircraft deliveries.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDale E. SchinstockThe {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop methods and tools for generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A method of generating <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> is needed to describe data collection missions, such as taking aerial photographs. The <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are two-dimensional and exist in a plane a fixed distance above the Earth. Since the flight areas are typically small, the Earth's curvature is not accounted for in <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation. Designed to completely cover a specified field area, the plans consist of a series of line and arc segments and are described in a format that is recognized by the Piccolo autopilot used by the Kansas State University Autonomous Vehicle Systems (AVS) Lab. Grids are designed to cover the field area, and turn maneuvers are designed to ensure efficient <b>flight</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation process is broken into several parts. Once a field area is defined, path lines covering this area are calculated. Optimal turn maneuvers are calculated to smoothly connect the path lines in a continuous <b>flight</b> <b>plan.</b> Two methods of determining path line order are discussed. One method flies the lines in the order that they are arranged spatially; the other method decides line order by calculating the shortest turn maneuver to another path line. After the <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> is generated, a text file is created in a format that is readable for the autopilot. In order to easily generate <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created. This GUI allows a user to easily generate a <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> without modifying any code. The <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> generation software is used to build example <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> for this thesis.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this continuing effort are {{to develop and}} evaluate new algorithms and advanced concepts for flight management and <b>flight</b> <b>planning.</b> This includes the minimization of fuel or direct operating costs, {{the integration of the}} airborne flight management and ground-based <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> processes, and the enhancement of future traffic management systems design. Flight management (FMS) concepts are for on-board profile computation and steering of transport aircraft in the vertical plane between a city pair and along a given horizontal path. <b>Flight</b> <b>planning</b> (FPS) concepts are for the pre-flight ground based computation of the three-dimensional reference trajectory that connects the city pair and specifies the horizontal path, fuel load, and weather profiles for initializing the FMS. As part of these objectives, a new computer program called EFPLAN has been developed and utilized to study advanced <b>flight</b> <b>planning</b> concepts.

5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>plans</b> are {{documents}} {{filed by}} a pilot or flight dispatcher {{with the local}} Civil Aviation Authority (e.g. FAA in the USA) prior to departure which indicate the plane's <b>planned</b> route or <b>flight</b> path. <b>Flight</b> <b>plan</b> format is specified in the ICAO Doc 4444. They generally include basic information such as departure and arrival points, estimated time en route, alternate airports in case of bad weather, type of flight (whether instrument flight rules IFR or visual flight rules VFR), the pilot's information, number of people on board and information about the aircraft itself. In most countries, <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are required for flights under IFR, but may be optional for flying VFR unless crossing international borders. <b>Flight</b> <b>plans</b> are highly recommended, especially when flying over inhospitable areas, such as water, as they provide a way of alerting rescuers if the flight is overdue. In the United States and Canada, when an aircraft is crossing the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), either an IFR or a special type of VFR <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> called a DVFR (Defense VFR) <b>flight</b> <b>plan</b> must be filed.For IFR <b>flights,</b> <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> are used by air traffic control to initiate tracking and routing services. For VFR flights, their only purpose is to provide needed information should search and rescue operations be required, or for use by air traffic control when flying in a [...] "Special Flight Rules Area".|$|R

50|$|Despite all {{the effort}} taken to {{optimise}} <b>flight</b> <b>plans,</b> {{there are certain}} circumstances {{in which it is}} advantageous to file suboptimal plans.

This problem can be worse in busy periods, such as when everyone wants to arrive at an airport as soon as it opens for the day. If all the aircraft file optimal <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> then to avoid overloading, air traffic control may refuse permission for some of the <b>flight</b> <b>plans</b> or delay the allocated takeoff slots.
