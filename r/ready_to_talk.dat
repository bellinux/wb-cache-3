500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: [...] "that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which he—so <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the genesis of his poems—has told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet's sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death." [...] Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth's poetic technique. Durrant argued that [...] "The four 'Lucy' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth's experiment." [...] Alan Grob (1932–2007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that [...] "the principal importance of the 'Matthew' and 'Lucy' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown caused {{problems}} for Fred Trueman when he managed the English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59. Trueman and others believed {{that people like}} Brown and his colleague Gubby Allen [...] "epitomised the pompous nature of English cricket {{in the days of}} amateurs and professionals, gentlemen and players". It was not just professionals as Brown quarreled with the amateur Trevor Bailey, which led to long-standing mutual antipathy. In Trueman's autobiography, he refers to Brown as [...] "a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot". Trueman made a formal complaint about Brown to the team captain, Peter May. Although May was another public school-educated amateur, he supported Trueman and told Brown to [...] "act in a manner befitting someone with managerial responsibility". Tom Graveney commented on the lack of team spirit on the tour, saying that [...] "Freddie Brown, in particular, did a very bad job" [...] and was rude to several team members. Graveney called Brown [...] "a very stuck-up individual – at least when he was sober". Kay said Brown had a tendency to be bombastic in speech and could be forthright and ruthless, sometimes being churlish and rude to sensation-seeking reporters, but was always <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> amicably to genuine cricket journalists.|$|E

50|$|Things {{start to}} fall into place and the trip quickly turns into mental crisis, anxiety and resentment. Edward starts to wonder if his mother and sister have created this whole holiday with ulterior motives of their own. He seems all too <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>talked</b> out of his African plan, because he {{actually}} doesn't have the smallest {{idea what to do}} with his life and comes close to trying to seduce Rose.|$|R

60|$|Yet {{this was}} only the portly figure of Master Pyot, the petty constable, {{who seemed to be}} {{mounting}} guard just outside the cottage, and who was vastly amused at Toogood's pusillanimity. He entered into converse with the young man--no doubt he, too, had been feeling somewhat lonely {{in the midst of this}} darkness, which was peopled with unseen shadows. Master Courage was <b>ready</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> He had acquired some of Master Busy's eloquence on the subject of secret investigations, and the mystery which had gained an intensity this afternoon, through the revelations of the old Quakeress, was an all-engrossing one to all.|$|R

40|$|We are {{experiencing}} {{a crisis of}} confidence in the idea of objectivity. In scholarly circles, many are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> discontinue <b>talk</b> of objectivity altogether, {{on the grounds that it}} has been nothing more than a mask for the oppressive practices of politically and economically privileged groups, promising neutrality where in fact there are only power relations. Some feminist legal scholars, some critical race scholars, and some critical legal studies scholars, along with some contemporary philosophers, argue that objectivity is inevitably a problematic, dangerous idea or ideal. Critics of objectivity sometimes argue that it can never be genuinely had, only claimed under false pretenses and then used oppressively...|$|R
