5|$|Areas along Fishing Creek contain pools {{followed}} by <b>riffles,</b> which are further {{followed by}} more pools. This configuration of pools and <b>riffles</b> creates an ideal situation for fly-fishing.

5|$|The Shimna {{is a short}} spate river, {{meaning it}} becomes deep and fast flowing after periods of rain and is slow, with low water levels, in drier weather. In {{sections}} of the river where the gradient is low, there are <b>riffles</b> and pools, sandy banks, and pebbles and scattered boulders on the river bed.

5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged <b>riffles,</b> rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{began to}} {{experience}} the effects of Amara on December20, when strong gusts caused by the tropical cyclone swept across the island. These initial winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, resulting in power outage. At the height of power outages, over 12,000households were without power, primarily in Port Sud-Est, Mount Lubin, and Rivière-Cocos. By the afternoon of December22, only 20%of homes had access to electricity. Some of the fallen trees rendered roads impassable. Heavy rains caused some creeks to overflow their banks, and <b>riffles</b> became impassable. The rainfall also caused extensive soil erosion. Amara also triggered a strong storm surge, resulting in coastal flooding. Despite the heavy rainfall, total precipitation amounts remained relatively low, peaking at 78mm (3.07in) in Citronelle. On December21, a wind gust of 152km/h (94mph) {{was reported in the}} locality of Pointe Canon, which was the highest wind measurement recorded in associated with Amara. Another station at Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport reported a similarly strong wind gust clocked at 135km/h (84mph). The strong winds tore metal sheets off of buildings and cut telecommunications between Rodrigues {{and the rest of the}} world. Despite the widespread precautionary measures taken beforehand, Port Mathurin suffered marginal impacts. Following the storm, local police groups and the Special Mobile Force were mobilized in order to assist in relief efforts. Technicians from the Mauritius Central Electricity Board were dispatched to resolve power issues.|$|E

25|$|Elimia virginica {{is found}} in {{freshwater}} rivers and streams with cobble bottoms and boulders. (Pleurocerids are usually found in lotic erosional environments, in <b>riffles</b> or shoals with rock or sand substrate, and especially frequently on rocks in slower areas of medium size reaches.) Elimia virginica usually inhabits slow to medium velocity rivers and streams with firm and clean gravel, cobble and rock substrate. Pleurocerids in general are sensitive to abiotic stresses, and Elimia virginica is not tolerant to siltation.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog {{was only}} recorded in pristine rainforests {{where the only}} form of human disturbance was poorly defined walking tracks.

The water in these streams was cool and clear, and the frogs hid away beneath or between boulders in the current or in backwaters.|$|E

25|$|Male {{pink salmon}} and some sockeye salmon develop {{pronounced}} humps {{just before they}} spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, <b>riffles</b> can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in {{the image on the}} right. Predators, such as bears, {{will be more likely to}} catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of industry and the Dearne and Dove Canal, the river became grossly polluted {{in the early nineteenth}} century, and fish populations died. The West Riding River Board tried to address the problems as early as 1896, with limited success, and much of the river remained dead until the 1980s, when concerted attempts were made to clean industrial effluents before they were discharged, and to improve sewage treatment processes. Despite some setbacks, fish populations had been partially reinstated by the early 1990s. Channel engineering was carried out at Denaby in the 1990s, to re-introduce bends, deep pools and shallow gravel <b>riffles,</b> to assist fish spawning. In June 2015, salmon were reported in the river {{for the first time in}} 150 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Representing {{distributions}} over permutations can be {{a daunting}} task {{due to the fact}} that the number of permutations of n objects scales factorially in n. One recent way that has been used to reduce storage complexity has been to exploit probabilistic independence, but as we argue, full independence assumptions impose strong sparsity constraints on distributions and are unsuitable for modeling rankings. We identify a novel class of independence structures, called <b>riffled</b> independence, encompassing a more expressive family of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for performing efficient inference and reducing sample complexity. In <b>riffled</b> independence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the <b>riffle</b> shuffle, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to form a single permutation. Within the context of ranking, <b>riffled</b> independence corresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then interleaving those rankings. In this paper, we provide a formal introduction to <b>riffled</b> independence and propose an automated method for discovering sets of items which are <b>riffle</b> independent from a training set of rankings. We show that our clustering-like algorithms can be used to discover meaningful latent coalitions from real preference ranking datasets and to learn the structure of hierarchically decomposable models based on <b>riffled</b> independence...|$|R
