40|$|In {{large-scale}} networking environments, such as data centers, a key {{difficulty is}} {{the assignment of}} labels to network elements. Labels can be assigned statically, e. g. MAC-addresses in traditional Layer 2 networks, or by a central authority as in DHCP in Layer 3 networks. On the other hand, networks requiring a dynamic solution often use a Consensus-based state machine approach. While designing Alias [2], a protocol for automatically assigning hierarchically meaningful addresses in data center networks, we encountered an instance of label assignment with entirely different requirements. In this case, the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>labels</b> depend on connectivity, and connectivity (and hence, labels) changes over time. Thus, neither static assignment nor a state machine approach is ideal. In the context of large scale data center networks, practical constraints are important. A centralized solution introduces a {{single point of failure}} and necessitates either flooding or a separate out-of-band control network to establish communication between the centralized component and all network elements; this is problematic at the scale of a data center.

The main {{labeling}} {{laws are}} the “Act on Securing Liquor Tax and on Liquor Business Associations,” “Food Sanitation Act,” and “Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations.” The first law regulates the <b>labeling</b> <b>for</b> the producer’s name and address, capacity, item of liquor, ratio of alcohol, and so on. Moreover, notification of the National Tax Agency {{depends on the}} law that sets the standard <b>rule</b> <b>for</b> <b>labeling</b> geographical indications. The second law regulates <b>labeling</b> <b>for</b> food additives, allergen contents, genetically modified contents, and so on. Notification no. 370 of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare based on the Food Sanitation Law also contains a standard for food additives. In this notification, sodium sulfite and sodium hyposulfite (antioxidant additives) for fruit liquor must be below 0.35 g/kg (residues as SO 2). The third law prohibits any representation to general consumers that the food item {{is much better than}} that of the actual goods or services, or are portrayed as being, contrary to the fact, much better than those of the other entrepreneurs who supply the same kind or similar goods or services as those supplied by the producer. On the other hand, many foreign countries have their own laws related to wine that outline <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>labeling</b> the production area, grade, ripening conditions, alcohol content, and so on.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{geometries}} of the 20 geneti-cally encoded {{amino acids}} were optimized at the restricted Hartree–Fock level of theory using the 6 - 31 G * basis set. A detailed comparison showed the calculated geometries {{to be in}} excellent agree-ment with those determined by X-ray crystallogra-phy. The study demonstrated that the geometric parameters for the main-chain group and for the bonds and common functional groups of the side-chains exhibit {{a high degree of}} transferability among the members of this set of molecules. This geometric transferability is a necessary prerequisite for the corresponding transferability of their electron den-sity distributions and hence of their bond and atomic properties. The transferability of the electron distri-butions will be demonstrated and exploited in the following paper of this series, which uses the topol-ogy of the electron density to define an atom within the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. Particu-lar features of the geometries of the amino acids are discussed. It has been shown, for example, how the apparent anomaly of the CON bond length in a peptide being shorter than in the charged species CONH 3 is resolved when the charge separation is gauged by the differences in the charges of the C and N atoms as opposed to the use of formal charges. A compilation of literature sources on experimental geometries covering each member of the 20 amino acids is presented. A set of <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>labeling</b> the atoms and bonds, complementing the generally ac-cepted IUPAC-IUB rules, is proposed to uniquely identify every atom and bond in the amino acids...|$|R

The second critical point was related to PCR inhibitors.

In both examples, the inhibition affects the PCR efficiency. Another critical point in the GMO detection is use of screening elements. That work was focused on false positive results.

40|$|In {{this series}} of papers {{we set out to}} generalize the notion of {{classical}} analytic deduction (i. e., deduction via elimination rules) by combining the methodology of labelled deductive systems (LDS) with the classical systemKE. LDS is a unifying framework for the study of logics and of their interactions. In the LDS approach the basic units of logical derivation are not just formulae butlabelled formulae, where the labels belong to a given labelling algebra. The derivation rules act on the labels {{as well as on the}} formulae, according to certain fixed rules of propagation. By virtue of the extra power of the labelling algebras, standard (classical or intuitionistic) proof systems can be extended to cover a much wider territory without modifying their structure. The systemKE is a new tree method for classical analytic deduction based on analytic cut. KE is a refutation system, like analytic tableaux and resolution, but it is essentially more efficient than tableaux and, unlike resolution, does not require any reduction to normal form. We start our investigation with the family of substructural logics. These are logical systems (such as Lambek"s calculus, Anderson and Belnap"s relevance logic, and Girard"s linear logic) which arise from disallowing some or all of the usual structural properties of the notion of logical consequence. This extension of traditional logic yields a subtle analysis of the logical operators which is more in tune with the needs of applications. In this paper we generalize the classicalKE system via the LDS methodology to provide a uniform refutation system for the family of substructural logics. The main features of this generalized method are the following: (a) each logic in the family is associated with a labelling algebra; (b) the tree-expansion <b>rules</b> (<b>for</b> <b>labelled</b> formulae) are the same for all the logics in the family; (c) the difference between one logic and the other is captured by the conditions under which a branch is declared closed; (d) such conditions depend only on the labelling algebra associated with each logic; and (e) classical and intuitionistic negations are characterized uniformly, by means of the same tree-expansion rules, and their difference is reduced to a difference in the labelling algebra used in closing a branch. In this first part we lay the theoretical foundations of our method. In the second part we shall continue our investigation of substructural logics and discuss the algorithmic aspects of our approach...|$|R
