5000|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>option</b> is a {{derivative}} exposed {{to two or}} more sources of uncertainty, {{as opposed to a}} simple option that is exposed to one source of uncertainty, such as the price of underlying asset.|$|E
5000|$|Simulation can {{similarly}} be used {{to value}} options where the payoff depends {{on the value of}} multiple underlying assets [...] such as a Basket option or <b>Rainbow</b> <b>option.</b> Here, correlation between asset returns is likewise incorporated.|$|E
40|$|The general {{approach}} for the pricing of <b>rainbow</b> (or colored) <b>options</b> with fixed transaction costs is {{developed from the}} game theoretic point of view. The evolution of the underlying common stocks is considered in discrete time. The main result consists in the explicit calculation of the hedge price {{for a variety of}} the <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> including option delivering the best of J risky assets and cash, calls on the maximum of J risky assets and the multiple-strike options. The results obtained can be also used in the framework of real <b>options.</b> Coloured (or <b>rainbow)</b> <b>options,</b> explicit formulas for hedge, transaction costs, interval model, submodular functions...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>options</b> are used, for example, {{to value}} natural {{resources}} deposits. Such assets {{are exposed to}} two uncertainties—price and quantity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>options</b> {{refer to}} all options whose payoff depends {{on more than}} one {{underlying}} risky asset;each asset is referred to as a color of the rainbow.|$|R
5000|$|A simple {{example is}} a call <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> written on [...] FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&P 500 [...] which will pay out the {{difference}} between the strike price and the level of the index that has risen by the largest amount of the three.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike a <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> which {{considers}} {{a group of}} assets but ultimately pays out {{on the level of}} one, a basket option is written on a basket of underlying assets but will pay out on a weighted average gain of the basket as a whole.|$|E
50|$|Uncertainty on {{correlation}} parameters {{is another}} important source of model risk. Cont and Deguest propose a method for computing model risk exposures in multi-asset equity derivatives and show that options which depend on the worst or best performances in a basket (so called <b>rainbow</b> <b>option)</b> are more exposed to model uncertainty than index options.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>options</b> {{are usually}} priced using an {{appropriate}} industry-standard model (such as Black-Scholes) {{for each individual}} basket component, and a matrix of correlation coefficients applied to the underlying stochastic drivers for the various models.|$|R

5000|$|Like <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> basket {{options are}} most {{commonly}} {{written on a}} basket of [...] equity indices, though they are frequently written on a basket of individual equities as well. For example, a call option could be written on a basket of ten healthcare stocks, where the basket was composed of ten stocks in weighted proportions.|$|R
5000|$|Rainbow {{options are}} usually calls or {{puts on the}} best or worst of n {{underlying}} assets. Like basket option, which is written {{on a group of}} assets and pays out on a weighted-average gain on the basket as a whole, a <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> also considers a group of assets, but usually pays out on the level of one of them.|$|E
50|$|The name of rainbow {{comes from}} Rubinstein (1991), who emphasises that this option {{was based on}} a {{combination}} of various assets like a rainbow is a combination of various colors. More generally, rainbow options are multiasset options, also referred to as correlation options, or basket options. Rainbow can take various other forms but the combining idea is to have a payoff that is depending on the assets sorted by their performance at maturity. When the rainbow only pays the best (respectively worst) performing asset of the basket, it is also called best-of, (respectively worst-of). Other popular options that can be reformulated as a <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> are spread and exchange options.|$|E
5000|$|Closed form, Black-Scholes-like {{solutions}} are sometimes employed. These are applicable only for European styled options or perpetual American options. Note that this application of Black-Scholes assumes constant — i.e. deterministic — costs: {{in cases where}} the project's costs, like its revenue, are also assumed stochastic, then Margrabe's formula can (should) be applied instead, here valuing the option to [...] "exchange" [...] expenses for revenue. (Relatedly, where the project is exposed to two (or more) uncertainties — e.g. for natural resources, price and quantity — some analysts attempt to use an overall volatility; this, though, is more correctly treated as a <b>rainbow</b> <b>option,</b> typically valued using simulation as below.) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel lattice method of option {{valuation}} that is especially suitable to American-style options whose values depend on multiple factors. The {{key to the}} method is multidimensional interpolation, which allows using sparse lattices and thus mitigates the curse of dimensionality. A pricing algorithm and suitable methods of interpolation are discussed in detail. Some results about convergence and stability of the algorithm are derived. The method is illustrated by an application to <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> and compared to various benchmark results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multi-asset {{options are}} options with payoffs {{affected}} {{by at least}} two underlying instruments. These instruments can be assets such as stocks, indices, currencies or commo-dities. An important factor infl uencing values of multi-asset options is correlation among log-returns of underlying assets. Thus the options are also called correlation options. In the paper there are presented description and models for pricing selected correlation options: quotient, product, spread and two-color <b>rainbow</b> <b>options.</b> There are also given some exam-ples of their use on the grain market in Poland...|$|R
40|$|This note {{proposes a}} method for pricing high-dimensional American options based on modern methods of multidimensional interpolation.

A framework of the pricing algorithm and the corresponding interpolation methods are discussed, and a theorem is demonstrated that suggests that the pricing method is less vulnerable to the curse of dimensionality. The method is illustrated by an application to <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> and compared to Least Squares Monte Carlo and other benchmarks. Comment: 12 pages, tables omitte...|$|R

The simultaneous compound option accounting and the sequential compound option accounting are discussed on the compound option accounting. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> accounting is explained using the quadranomial approach. The <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> accounting with independent uncertainties and the <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> accounting with correlated uncertainties are discussed in order.

40|$|The {{key issue}} in {{importance}} sampling {{is the choice}} of the alternative sampling distribution, which is often chosen from the exponential tilt family of the underlying distribution. However, when the problem exhibits certain kind of nonconvexity, it is very likely that a single exponential change of measure will never attain asymptotic optimality and can lead to erroneous estimates. In this paper we introduce an explicit iterative scheme which combines the traditional cross-entropy method and the EM algorithm to find an efficient alternative sampling distribution in the form of mixtures. We also study the applications of this scheme to the estimation of <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> prices...|$|E
40|$|The COS {{method for}} pricing European and Bermudan options with one {{underlying}} asset {{was developed in}} [10] and [11]. In this paper, we extend the method to higher dimensions, with a multi-dimensional asset price process. The algorithm can be applied to, for example, pricing two-color <b>rainbow</b> <b>options,</b> but also to pricing under the popular Heston stochastic volatility model. For smooth density functions, the resulting method converges exponentially {{in the number of}} terms in the Fourier cosine series summations, otherwise we achieve algebraic convergence. The use of an FFT algorithm, for asset prices modelled by Lévy processes, makes the algorithm highly efficient. We perform extensive numerical experiments...|$|R
40|$|Plain vanilla options have {{a single}} {{underlying}} asset and a single condition on the payoff at the expiration date. For this class of options, a well-known result of Duffie, Pan and Singleton (2000) shows how to invert the characteristic function to obtain a closed-form formula for their prices. However, multiple-asset and multiple-condition derivatives such as <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> cannot be priced within this framework. Utilizing inversion of the Fourier transform - and resorting to neither the Black-Scholes framework nor the affine models settings - the authors provide an analytical solution for options whose payoffs depend on two or more conditions. Numerical experiments based on the multiple-asset and multiple-condition derivatives are provided to illustrate {{the usefulness of the}} proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The SWIFT {{method for}} pricing European-style options on one {{underlying}} asset was recently published and presented as an accurate, robust and highly efficient technique. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to extend the method to higher dimensions by pricing exotic <b>option</b> contracts, called <b>rainbow</b> <b>options,</b> whose payoff depends on multiple assets. The multidimensional extension inherits the properties of the one-dimensional method, being the exponential convergence one of them. Thanks to the nature of local Shannon wavelets basis, we do not need to rely on a-priori truncation of the integration range, we have an error bound estimate and we use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms to speed up computations. We test the method for similar examples with state-of-the-art methods found in the literature, and we compare our results with analytical expressions when available...|$|R
40|$|Bivariate Fréchet (BF) copulas {{characterize}} dependence as {{a mixture}} of three simple structures: comonotonicity, independence and countermonotonicity. They are easily interpretable but have limitations when used as approximations to general dependence structures. To improve the approximation property of the BF copulas and keep the advantage of easy interpretation, we develop a new copula approximation scheme by using BF copulas locally and patching the local pieces together. Error bounds and a probabilistic interpretation of this approximation scheme are developed. The new approximation scheme is compared with several existing copula approximations, including shuffle of min, checkmin, checkerboard and Bernstein approximations and exhibits better performance, especially in characterizing the local dependence. The utility of the new approximation scheme in insurance and finance is illustrated in the computation of the <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> prices and stop-loss premiums. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a continuous real option model {{on the best}} of two commodities when their price spread follows an arithmetic mean-reverting process. The co-integration of the two variables effectively allows the complexity to be reduced from two sources of uncertainty to only one {{by focusing on the}} spread, which is why the model can also be applied to continuous entry/exit problems on a single mean-reverting variable. We provide a quasi-analytical solution for valuing this real <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> and the trigger levels when to switch between the two operating modes by incurring a switching cost. All parameters of our solution are estimated from empirical data and consistent riskadjusted discounting is applied. We apply the theoretical model to value a polyethylene plant based on the spread between polyethylene and ethylene. The spread is shown to be stationary and the parameters of the stochastic process are estimated by OLS regression and tested for validity. The sensitivity analysis reveals important implications for the investment timing and operation decisions of investors in a flexible plant, both depending on the extent of mean-reversion in the value-driver...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical model to value a real option {{on the best}} of two output commodities with continuous switching and temporary suspension possibilities and applies the model to a flexible fertilizer plant. The real options approach to flexibility sometimes suggests counter-intuitive decisions insofar as multi-million investments can be justified even if not currently profitable. Despite the high correlation between the two alternative commodities Ammonia and Urea, the value of flexibility may exceed the required investment cost for the downstream Urea plant, making a case for investment in flexible assets. The switching boundaries between the two operating states {{are found to be}} influenced more by the operating costs than by the switching costs. While the Continuous <b>Rainbow</b> <b>option</b> determines the shape of the asset value surface particularly for moderate to high commodity prices, the option to temporarily suspend the operation is highly relevant when prices are low. Both strategic and policy implications for stakeholders of flexible assets are discussed drawing on our numerical application to the fertilizer industry. ...|$|E

The objective was to apply the method proposed by Copeland & Antikarov for <b>rainbow</b> <b>options,</b> due to three stochastic variables selected with decision of abandonment if the project value with flexibility was less than {{the value of the}} underlying stock. It enabled the flexibility value generation in order to entrepreneurs to have more confidence in their decision when they are investing in a project with Agroforestry System, with different scenarios visualization in a single analysis. The results evidenced that the economic viability analysis, using Real Options, provided the best view of the possible scenarios, within a range generated by the prices volatility.

Typical examples are quanto, basket, spread, outside barrier options and options on the minimum /maximum of several assets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This paper {{investigates the}} use of copulae for non {{parametric}} pricing of multivariate contingent claims. Price estimates and no-arbitrage bounds for various types of two-colour <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> on the South African equity and bond markets were calculated. Implied marginal risk-neutral distributions were derived nonparametrically from each assets option price spread. This was achieved in a very simple manner by assuming that, {{for each of the}} underlying assets in question, a continuum of option prices exist. Cubic splines were used to fit this continuum to the implied volatilities of the actual options available. Two nonparametric copulae were considered: an empirical copula based directly upon the data and a kernel copula derived from a smooth two-dimensional kernel approximation of the historic density function. In addition, various parametric copulae were considered for comparison purposes. The differences between each of these approaches was found to vary from one type of rainbow to another...|$|R
40|$|Scrubber {{technology}} {{is one of}} the valid alternatives to comply with the tightening sulphur regulation. Due to the high uncertainty associated with the oil price and shipping market, making decision about whether and when to invest in marine scrubber is very difficult. In contrast to the previous works that examine the economic feasibility of scrubber retrofitting through the net present value rule, this paper applies the Real Option Analysis to find the optimal investment strategies. The proposed decision-making framework addresses the uncertainty and the value of deferral option embedded in the scrubber investment. The multiple sources of investment uncertainties are explicitly analyzed and integrated in the modeling by using <b>Rainbow</b> <b>option.</b> The results demonstrate that the value of the scrubber investment has significantly increased for several cases by considering the deferral option. It is thus important for ship owners to consider the available options before proceeding with abandoning or investing strategy. The proposed framework can be widely applied to other ship retrofitting investment evaluations, which include similar investment alternatives and uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, various {{option pricing}} models {{are used to}} provide {{analytical}} solutions to valuing defined pension liabilities (or securitised parts of pension liabilities) in incomplete markets. Unlike when markets are complete, {{there is not a}} single arbitrage-free price for liabilities but instead a range of prices consistent with the absence of arbitrage. We analyse and compare the application of incomplete market variants of the following models to pension liabilities: i) the standard Black-Scholes (1973) option model ii) the Margrabe (1978) exchange options model; iii) the Stulz (1982) <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> model to price pension schemes liabilities. No matter which approach is used, we find the range of liability prices to be broad, implying it is difficult to put a precise market value on pension liabilities. However, we also find that the implication for strategic asset allocation is relatively minimal; strategic asset allocations, at least in the models we looked at, appear to be relatively robust to incomplete markets. This conclusion is more about risk exposure than the financial instruments used to achieve a given level of risk exposure, as the desired financial instruments may depend considerably on the degree of market completeness. ...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{development}} (R&D) in pharmaceutical sector {{are characterized by}} long planning horizon, high uncertainty and irreversibility. A critical component in drug development is determining the financial value of the potential compound {{in the light of}} the substantial technical and economic uncertainty (Rogers et al, 2005). Given the well-know shortcomings of DCF, real option approach is considered to capture the substantial flexibility and value of strategy involve in the R&D project. Considerable efforts have been made in modeling of real R&D options given uncertainty and managerial flexibility as the key consideration. Case study in this paper confirms the superiority of ROA in capturing the value of operating options embedded in the drug process These value have been reflected in the higher project value obtained by treating three compulsory clinical phases as a compound <b>rainbow</b> <b>option</b> than the one obtained from augmented NPV. The implication is that optimal decision can be made by management according to the different result of ROA whenever new information comes over the life of the R&D.

40|$|This paper {{conducts a}} {{tractability}} analysis through {{the theory of}} Black-Scholes simplex options. Simplex options are a general category of options with simplex payoffs characterized by simplex-eventwise linearity. In contrast to such a simple characterization, they include {{a wide range of}} complex options, e. g., path-dependent <b>rainbow</b> <b>options.</b> The generic piece of simplex options is priced as a simplex expectation. Once such a generic piece is tractable (i. e., has a closed-form formula) under an underlying instruments model, any simplex option is tractable under that model. To illustrate this approach, we examine generalized Black-Scholes (GBS) underlying prices, including elementary Black-Scholes (EBS) underlying prices as a special case. The two scopes of underlying prices can be regarded as two underlyings models as well. Under the GBS/EBS model, the simplex expectation is evaluated as the GBS/EBS formula. Hence any Black-Scholes simplex option is tractable. Moreover, we show how to identify Black-Scholes simplex options and tailor them for concrete applications. This paper gives nice partial answers to identification, valuation, and design of tractable options, and sheds light on the future tractability analysis...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{determines the}} optimal investment timing using real options valuation to support decision-making for economic sustainability assessment. This paper illustrates an option pricing model using the Black-Scholes model {{applied to a}} case project to understand the model performance. Applicability of the project to the model requires two Monte Carlo simulations to satisfy a Markov process and a Wiener process. The position of project developers {{is not only the}} seller of products, but it is also the buyer of raw materials. Real options valuation can be influenced by the volatility of cash outflow, as well as the volatility of cash inflow. This study suggests two-color <b>rainbow</b> <b>options</b> valuation to overcome this issue, which is demonstrated for a steel plant project. The asymmetric results of the case study show that cash outflow (put option) influences the value of the steel plant project more than cash inflow (call option) does of which the discussion of the results is referred to a sensitivity analysis. The real options valuation method proposed in this study contributes to the literature on applying the new model, taking into consideration that investors maximize project profitability for economic sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{a general}} {{analytic}} approximation for pricing basket options on N assets, which is ex-tended to analytic approximations for pricing general <b>rainbow</b> <b>options,</b> including best-of and worst-of N asset options. The key {{idea is to}} express the option’s price as a sum of prices of various compound exchange options, each with different pairs of sub-ordinate multi- or single-asset op-tions. For some multi-asset options a strong condition holds, whereby each compound exchange option is equivalent to a standard single-asset option under a modified measure, and in such cases an almost exact analytic price exists for the multi-asset option. The underlying asset prices are assumed to follow log-normal processes, although the strong condition can be extended to certain other price processes for the underlying. More generally, approximate analytic prices for multi-asset options are derived using a weak log-normality condition, where the approximation stems from making constant volatility assumptions on the price processes that drive the prices of the sub-ordinate basket options. The analytic formulae for multi-asset option prices, and their Greeks, are defined in a recursive framework. For instance, the option delta is {{defined in terms of}} the delta relative to sub-ordinate multi-asset options, and the deltas of these sub-ordinate option...|$|R
