40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine the {{putative}} growth of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Singapore. A key impetus for the nascent CSR movement in twenty-first century Singapore is the economic imperative. As a trade-dependent industrializing economy, the economic development drive coupled {{with the need for}} international expansion has made it necessary for Singapore businesses to be cognizant of the growing CSR movement in the western, industrialized world. The government supports the CSR endeavour with an instrumental bent, where CSR ideas and concepts are adapted, incorporated, and promoted in various sectors of the economy. This paper assesses the state’s active encouragement of CSR in various facets of economic life in Singapore. The government sees itself as a promoter and practitioner of CSR. For instance, Singapore’s unique tripartite labor relations have recently emphasized a CSR gloss while CSR is also touted as being beneficial for corporate governance as well as improving the competitiveness of companies and improving the quality of life. However, CSR is too often seen as another form of corporate governance. This paper argues that the CSR drive in Singapore coheres with the government’s pragmatic approach to governance broadly conceived. There are many intrinsic and tangible benefits in the government being seen as an active promoter of CSR in various facets of Singapore life. The close association with the various concerns of CSR ensures that the government is seen to be involved in issues, such as environmentalism, work–life balance, anti-corruption, and philanthropy, that concern and appeal to the younger generation of Singaporeans. The CSR endorsement by the state, while not taking a legislative framework and still very much a private sector-driven initiative, is in accord with Singapore’s political and cultural values where the promotion of social <b>responsibility</b> (<b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group),</b> harmony, cohesion, and stability in a multi-racial, multi-religious, and multi-lingual society are very much valued. In studying the putative CSR movement in Singapore, a sense of the values that the state, in partnership with the business world, hopes to inculcate would be evident...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a transaction cost {{analysis of the}} internal business processes of firms. Business processes are collections of activities which are technologically or managerially linked so that they jointly affect value added. Their organisation is characterised by their 'architecture'—the allocation of <b>responsibilities</b> amongst <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> communication between them for information and coordination—and their incentive structure. The overall costs of organisation are determined by losses due to imperfect motivation of process members, which flows from the incentive structure, and imperfect information and coordination, which flow from the architecture, together with the resource costs associated with incentives and architecture. Perfect motivation corresponds to 'team behaviour' and a quantitative model, based on team theory, indicates how the best architecture depends on the degree interaction between activities comprising the business process.

The DHDR addresses simultaneously the <b>responsibilities</b> of <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups.</b> It states: “As the holders of human rights and fundamental freedoms, all <b>individuals,</b> peoples <b>and</b> communities in the exercise of their rights and freedoms, have the duty and responsibility to respect those of others, and a duty to strive for the promotion and observance thereof”. This statement continues appropriately the way initiated by the UDHR in Article 29 and reiterates the interaction of duties, responsibilities and rights of the International Covenants on Human Rights of 1966.|$|R

40|$|With {{the point}} of {{departure}} in the ongoing discussion of the professional and moral responsibility {{for those who are}} not equally included in the established health services, {{the question of how to}} include <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> facing marginalisation is one of the major challenges within the ethics of care. This makes marginalisation a core concept in our time, which is challenged by, among other things, differentness with respect to ethnicity and social status as well as breach with norms and laws. The representation of <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> facing marginalisation is not merely an intellectual question, however, but an epistemological one with political, practical and ethical implications. This article discusses a pilot project exploring what we can do within nursing education to sensitise students to professional <b>and</b> moral <b>responsibility</b> for <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> facing marginalisation. A dialogical approach to knowledge, including cooperation with voluntary organisations and low-threshold facilities with a long tradition of trying to prevent people from falling through the net', was chosen to highlight the professional challenges and the ethical dilemmas that arise in the interface between closeness and distance, caring and marginalisation. Evaluation of data indicated that such an approach to knowledge seems to benefit the students' learnin...|$|R

40|$|Master of Public HealthDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyKatherine StenskeOver {{the past}} few decades, animal and public health {{professionals}} have become increasingly concerned about the global animal population’s vulnerability to Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). Through analysis of the lessons learned by the United Kingdom (UK), Taiwan, and Egypt in responding to FMD outbreaks in their countries, it becomes apparent that even with response plans {{in place at the}} time of an outbreak, problems still arose as the outbreaks progressed. To better understand why these deviations from the planned course occur, the concept of “disconnects” in the various “domains” of TAD emergency preparedness and response were explored for the United States (U. S.). Particular emphasis was placed on issues related to the collaboration and cooperation between the federal and state levels of government. The domains of communication, knowledge, and resourcing were selected to be analyzed due to their importance in TAD emergency outbreak preparedness and response. The research questions this thesis explores concern three domains of TAD emergency preparedness and response that experience disconnects between federal and state levels of government. They also explore how these disconnects affect Food and Agriculture Security in the U. S. Three different methods were used to research these topics. Literature reviews of lessons learned and after action reports from TAD outbreak exercises and real events were conducted. Direct observations of the author’s experiences at conferences, seminars, and training events were also included. Finally, personal interviews were conducted with Food and Agriculture Security experts. Through this analysis, numerous disconnects emerged in each of the domains. Several disconnects traverse all three domains. These disconnects related to laboratory collaboration with the federal government, the process of declaring a federal emergency, and the roles <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> involved in TAD outbreak preparedness and response. Overall, the disconnects affect the ability of state and federal governments to rapidly respond to and coordinate response efforts. This affects Food and Agriculture Security by compromising the safety, security, and ongoing operation of the food and agriculture sector. Further study will be needed to alleviate these disconnects so that better cooperation and collaboration can occur between federal and state levels of government...|$|R

They stand in {{the front line of}} struggle and dignifying human rights to utter the victims of human rights violation (the voice of the voiceless). Their existence is obviously recognized in United Nations' General Assembly Mr. 53 / 144 on "Declaration on the Right <b>and</b> <b>Responsibility</b> of <b>Individuals,</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>and</b> Organ of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom" that was legalized on December 9, 1996. This declaration reaffirms the advocates' rights that is factually protected by UDHR (article 19 and 20), ICCPR (article 21 and 22), ICESCR (article 8), CERD (article 5 d viii and ix) and some other UN's resolution on human rights. Indonesia is a country having problems with human rights defenders. Their existence is legally recognized by article 28 C (2) of the Indonesian Constitution (UUDNRI 1945) but there is no a single regulation that specifically states about protection to them in conducting their activities. This fact makes human rights violation against them easily and frequently happen. This is also a proof picturing that the State's duty to protect, promote, erect, and prevail human rights as stated in article 28 I (4) of UUDNRI 1945 has not been well accomplished As part of international society, Indonesia {{would not be able to}} escape from the present global trend, that is to put human rights matter as one of the central issues in international relations.

50|$|The American Association of Group Workers (1949) {{describes}} as: “The group worker enables {{various types}} of groups to function {{in such a way}} that both <b>group</b> interaction <b>and</b> programme activities contribute to the growth of the <b>individual,</b> <b>and</b> the achievement of the desirable social goal. The objectives of the group worker include provision for personal growth according to <b>individual</b> capacity <b>and</b> need; the adjustment of the individual to other persons, to <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> to society, the motivation of the individual toward the improvement of society and; the recognition by the individual of his own rights, abilities and differences of others. Through his participation the group worker aims to effect the group process so that decisions come about as a result of knowledge and a sharing and integration of ideas, experiences and knowledge, rather than as a result of domination from within or without the group. Social Work Intervention with <b>Individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>Groups</b> through experience he/she aims to produce those relationship with other <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> the wider community which contributes to responsible citizenship, mutual understanding between cultural, religious, economic or special groupings in the community, and a participation in the constant improvement of our society towards democratic goals. The guiding purpose behind such leadership rests upon the common assumptions of a democratic society; namely, the opportunity for each individual to fulfill his capacities in freedom, to respect and appreciate others and to assume his social responsibility in maintaining and constantly improving our democratic societies. Underlying the practice of group work is the knowledge of <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> behaviour <b>and</b> of social conditions and community relations which is based on the modern social sciences. On the basis of this knowledge the group worker contributes to the group with which he works with a skill in leadership which enables the members to use their capacities to the full and to create socially constructive group activities. He is aware of both programme activities and of the interplay of personalities, within the <b>group</b> <b>and</b> between the <b>group</b> <b>and</b> its surrounding community. According to the interests and needs of each, he assists them to get from the group experience, the satisfaction provided by the programme activities, the enjoyment and personal growth available through the social relations, and the opportunity to participate as a responsible citizen. The group worker makes conscious use of his relations to the group, his knowledge of programme as a tool and his understanding of the <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> of the <b>group</b> process <b>and</b> recognizes his <b>responsibility</b> both to <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> with whom he works and the larger social values he represents”.|$|R
40|$|The doping culture {{represents}} {{an issue for}} sport and for society. Normative debates on doping have been mainly concerned with questions of the justifiability of doping. The practice of assigning responsibility for doping behaviour has chiefly been individual-based, focusing mainly on the individual athlete’s doping behaviour. The overarching aim of this thesis is to investigate the relevance {{and the importance of}} the ideas of responsibility in relation to ethical debates on doping. The more specific aim is to examine the possibility of broadening the scope of <b>responsibility</b> beyond the <b>individual</b> athlete, <b>and</b> to sketch a theoretical framework within which this expansion could be accommodated.  In the first study, it is argued that bioethicists have a moral/professional responsibility to start out from a realistic and up-to-date view of genetics in ethical debates on gene doping, and that good bioethics requires good empirics. In study 2, the role played by affective processes in influencing athletes’ attitudes towards doping behaviour is investigated, both on an <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> on a collective level. It is concluded that an exclusive focus on individual-level rule violation and sanctions may entail overlooking the greater social picture and would prove to be ineffective in the long term. In study 3, the common doping-is-cheating arguments are examined and it is argued that they fail to capture vital features of people’s moral responses to doping behaviour. An alternative account of cheating in sport is presented in terms of failure to manifest good will and respect. It is concluded that putting cheating in the broader context of human interpersonal relationships makes evident the need to broaden the scope of moral responsibility and agency beyond the individual athlete. In study 4, the particular case of assigning responsibility for doping to sports physicians is used to examine the current individual-based approach to responsibility. This approach underestimates the scope of the responsibility by leaving out a range of other actors from the discourse of responsibility. The central conclusion of the thesis is that transforming the current doping culture requires broadening the scope of <b>responsibility</b> to include <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> of <b>individuals</b> other than the athletes themselves. ...|$|R

This dissertation examines how a dramatic change in organizational mission and task <b>responsibilities</b> can affect <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> <b>group</b> behavior in a decentralized setting. This study will specifically examine attitudinal and behavioral responses of professional front-line employees working for an Agency experiencing a substantive change in mission deriving from forces within its external task environment. The dissertation will utilize the job of "District Conservationist" as a vehicle for understanding the above focus in the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly known as the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). The NRCS offers an unusual opportunity for studying how relatively dramatic alterations in key-job duties can affect the work behavior and on-the-job coping strategies of employees expected to implement new and complex policy. The dramatic change in job duties was brought about by several components of the Conservation Title of the 1985 Food Security Act (FSA). These changes have significantly affected the task expectations and work attitudes of District Conservationists (DCs), the front-line officers of this evolving Agency. The dynamics taking place in the NRCS will be examined through the lens of a systems model that takes into account several important variables relating to {{the success or failure of}} organizations in adapting to externally imposed role change. These variables are referred to as "strategic performance factors" and will be shown to be significantly related to burnout, which serves a surrogate performance measure for this analysis. Burnout is here defined as a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment among persons doing "people work" of some kind. The strategic performance factors include: leadership credibility, change motivation, the structural design of the organization, the context or environment in which DCs work, and the job characteristics of the DCs' job. The systems model used for this study has within it another model, the "Everyday Organization Diagnostic Model," that has been found to be useful in diagnosing how well organizations adapt to environmental stimuli. Three of the five factors make up this model. Combining various aspects of these two models can help in determining Agency adaptability as well as employee performance...|$|R
