30|$|When the Exothane-based <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> are {{compared}} to the control materials, it can be observed {{that the presence of}} the Exothanes 8, 9, and 32 has improved the degree of conversion, differently to the other two Exothanes (10 and 24), which contributed to convert similarly to the UDMA-based <b>resin</b> <b>bond.</b> Considering this result, it can be inferred that these latter Exothanes present a similar molecular structure of UDMA, as they are also urethane-based monomers. With regard to the degree of conversion obtained with the CLSE <b>resin</b> <b>bond,</b> it is in accordance with previous studies [20, 21]. In addition, the 64 % of monomeric conversion achieved with this adhesive was similar to the UDMA and E 10 groups (Figure  1), but different to the E 24 <b>resin</b> <b>bond,</b> which showed a statistically lower degree of conversion, probably because the Exothane 24 monomer may present low mobility ability, limiting the polymerization reaction [17].|$|R
30|$|The {{polarity}} of a monomer is {{a characteristic}} that shows its hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity ratio [7]. Generally, the primer substance is applied over the dentin substrate, {{which is a}} humid structure that is chemically compatible with hydrophilic molecules; so, the primer should be hydrophilic, enabling the resin monomers infiltration into the demineralized dentin, leading to their entanglement with the exposed collagen fibrils [27]. Nevertheless, hydrophilic substances tend to suffer faster degradation phenomena due to the hydrolysis processes {{that occur in the}} oral environment [7, 24]. In contrast, the <b>resin</b> <b>bond</b> substance, which is applied over the primer, should be a hydrophobic material, as this characteristic implies strength and more stability for the adhesive to resist the degradation phenomena [28]. Even so, the <b>resin</b> <b>bond</b> should be only moderately hydrophobic, as a poor interaction between the primer and the <b>resin</b> <b>bond</b> may occur (phase separation). Considering that the same primer formulation was used in the current study, the Exothane-based adhesives (experimental <b>resin</b> <b>bonds)</b> have probably an extremely hydrophobic nature, as very low bond strength results were obtained (Figure  2), whit complete adhesive failure modes. This characteristic shows that a proper interaction between the primer and the experimental <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> have not occurred, including for the control UDMA-based <b>resin</b> <b>bond.</b> This result may suggest that the urethane derivatives investigated in this study are hydrophobic substances, even when they are mixed with TEGDMA (a more hydrophilic monomer). On the other hand, the control CLSE showed 55 % of cohesive/mixed failure modes, indicating that a strong hybrid layer was created between the dentin substrate and the adhesive components. This is already understood because the CLSE is constituted by 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), which enables a chemical and a micro-mechanical bonding mechanisms [2], improving the bond strength results, as confirmed by the present study.|$|R

30|$|Dental {{adhesive}} {{systems are}} commonly used for bonding the restorative material to the tooth structure.

The bonding mechanism starts with {{the application of a}}n acidic substance, which enables the superficial tooth demineralization; then, another substance is used to prepare the demineralized substrate (primer), followed by the application of a resinous substance (<b>resin</b> <b>bond),</b> which links the tooth to the restorative material.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the degree of conversion and the bond strength of experimental adhesive systems formulated with elastomeric monomers (Exothanes). Two-step self-etch adhesive systems were formulated, where the primer was constituted by HEMA, HEMA-P, water and ethanol, and the <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> were prepared mixing one type of Exothane (8, 9, 10, 24, or 32) (75 wt%) with TEGDMA (25 wt%). CQ, EDAB, and DPI were added as photo-initiation system. UDMA was used as control, so six different <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> were formulated at all. The adhesive system Clearfil SE Bond (CLSE) was used as a commercial control. The degree of conversion (DC) of each <b>resin</b> <b>bond</b> was evaluated in infrared spectroscopy (RT-FTIR, Shimadzu Prestige- 21) using a diamond crystal (n[*]=[*] 3). The microshear bond strength (μSBS) test was performed using a universal testing machine (EMIC DL- 500). While the DC data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey (p[*]<[*] 0.05), the μSBS data was analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test and Student-Newman-Keuls (p[*]<[*] 0.05). The <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> containing the Exothanes 8, 9, and 32 demonstrated DC values higher than 80 %, differently to the other Exothane-based adhesives, which showed DC values close to 50 %. UDMA and CLSE demonstrated lower DC than E 8, E 9, and E 32 (p[*]<[*] 0.001). The Exothane 24 resulted in the lowest DC value of the study (p[*]<[*] 0.001), although it was similar to the E 10 and UDMA adhesives (p[*]>[*] 0.05). Low μSBS results were seen for the Exothane-based materials. CLSE demonstrated significantly higher bond strength than the other materials (p[*]<[*] 0.001). UDMA has also presented low μSBS to the dentin substrate. It can be concluded that the Exothanes evaluated demonstrated satisfactory degree of conversion, with some of them reaching almost full conversion of monomers in polymer. However, considering the formulations investigated, they were not good bonding agents. So, they were not reliable options for composing the polymeric matrix of dental adhesive materials.|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} about the reliability of using the Exothane monomers as polymeric matrix of dental adhesive materials. So, experimental adhesive systems containing these monomers were prepared. It is already known that a satisfactory performance of polymeric dental materials is directly correlated to a proper polymerization reaction of monomers in polymer [7, 12, 14]. Interestingly, within the degree of conversion results obtained from each <b>resin</b> <b>bond</b> formulated it is possible to verify that some Exothanes acquired excellent conversion values (Figure  1). In fact, adhesives containing the Exothanes 8, 9, and 32 showed almost full polymerization, and according to Ferracane (2006) [7] how greater the degree of conversion, higher the material’s stability to the hydrolysis degradation phenomena. This will probably generate a long-durable material with improved physic-mechanical properties [15]. Nevertheless, not by all the experimental Exothane-based <b>resin</b> <b>bonds</b> resulted in excellent conversion values, as the Exothanes 10 and 24 showed degree of conversion near to 50 % (Figure  1).|$|R

It is agreed that {{the resistance of the}} resin-ceramic adhesion zone is controlled primarily by the microstructure and surface treatment of the ceramic [6, 22, 23].
