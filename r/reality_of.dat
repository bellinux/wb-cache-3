5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of classical art mapped the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> classical society.|$|E
5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disparity}} with the Principate, Jones and Elton argue that 4th-century remuneration was attractive {{compared to the}} hard <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> existence at subsistence level that most recruits' peasant families had to endure.

5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E

5|$|His {{works are}} also {{recognized}} {{as being a}} critique of the totalitarian, communist state, a <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> his life in People's Republic of Poland. Science fiction genre, with its outer-worldly, clearly fictional, and often allegorical setting and invented jargon was able to debate fundamentals of such systems with frankness that more mainstream literature would not be allowed to.|$|E
5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} {{another of his}} central notions: the {{question}} of the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.|$|E
5|$|In the ONA's terminology, {{the terms}} Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or {{individuals}} {{who support the}} Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones. One such group is the White Star Acception, who claim to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power; Sieg noted that the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> these actions has not been verified.|$|E

5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
5|$|Stowe, a Connecticut-born {{teacher at}} the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, {{featured}} the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve.

5|$|The {{characters}} in the novel are integral to its understanding. Not only do they highlight the temporal and political context of voodoo and other forces, but they also allow Carpentier to surpass temporal and spatial limitations to reach the ultimate <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> life: the universal essence that lies in every human being.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> {{defeat for}} Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{observations}} of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses. The <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this phenomenon is called the Saxl effect.|$|E
5|$|William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson {{have criticized}} the above {{definition}} as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine {{and the number of}} physicians working internationally. From that point of view, international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for and the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned with the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of}} his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
