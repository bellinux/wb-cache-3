40|$|Introduction: Hypertensive {{crisis is}} a {{life-threatening}} condition, defined as severe hypertension complicated with acute target-organ dysfunction (mainly neurological, renal or cardiac). It rarely occurs in childhood and most {{children and adolescents}} who presents with hypertensive crisis symptoms have secondary hypertension, mainly of renal etiology. Case reports:We present the cases of three children with severe hypertension of different renal etiology who presented with the characteristic features of hypertensive emergency. Case 1 is a 11 -year-old girl with reflux nephropathy who at admission had blood pressure (BP) as high as 250 / 200 mmHg. She was lethargic, with headache, vomiting and a 3 -month history of weight loss. Case 2 is a 13 -year-old boy with renal artery stenosis who had clinical presentation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and BP 220 / 150 mmHg. Case 3 is a 9 -year-old boy with chronic renal insufficiency of unexplained etiology and BP as high as 220 / 135 mmHg. This patient, like two others, presented dominantly with symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy, aswell as signs of renal damage. All three patients have documented hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the patient who had renal artery stenosis, the removal of his dysplastic atrophic right kidney failed to normalize his blood pressure.

These heavily calcified plaques grow into the lumen and can cause significant stenoses, which may lead to malperfusion of the lower limbs, visceral ischemia or hypertension due to renal ischemia. From January 1984 to February 2007, 70 patients (24 men, 46 women, mean age 59. 5 years, range 14 to 81 years) underwent treatment in the Department of Vascular Surgery and Renal Transplantation, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University (Düsseldorf, Germany) for CRA. The present study {{is based on a}} review of patients’ records and the prospective follow-up in the outpatient clinic. The most frequent finding was <b>renovascular</b> arterial <b>hypertension</b> (44. 3 %) causing headache, vertigo and visual symptoms. Intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial occlusive disease was found in 28 patients (40. 0 %). Seventeen patients (24. 3 %) presented with chronic visceral ischemia causing diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain. Sixty-nine of the 70 patients (98. 6 %) underwent surgery; in 57 patients, aortic reconstruction was achieved with thromboendarterectomy, performed on an isolated suprarenal segment in six cases (8. 7 %), an infrarenal segment in 15 cases (21. 7 %), and the supra- and infrarenal aorta in 43 cases (62. 3 %).

We measured whole kidney, cortical, and medullary perfusion and volume with electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 33 hypertensive patients, with well-preserved renal function, scheduled for renal angiography. EBCT-derived whole kidney perfusion was lower in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS; N = 20) than in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD; N = 10) or essential hypertension (N = 28; P < 0. 05), as was cortical perfusion (2. 44 ± 0. 16 vs. 3. 26 ± 0. 17 and 3. 07 ± 0. 09 ml/min/cc tissue, respectively, P < 0. 05), but medullary perfusion was similar.

40|$|AMPA-type {{glutamate}} receptors in {{the nucleus}} tractus solitarii (NTS) {{are necessary for}} the baroreceptor reflex, a primary mechanism for homeostatic regulation of blood pressure. Within NTS, the GluR 1 subunit of the AMPA receptor is found primarily in dendritic spines. We previously showed that both GluR 1 and dendritic spine density are increased in NTS of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We hypothesize that both receptor and synaptic plasticity are induced by a sustained elevation in arterial pressure. To test the general nature of this hypothesis, we examined whether similar changes in GluR 1 density are found in a <b>renovascular</b> model of <b>hypertension,</b> the DOCA-salt rat, and if these changes are preventable by normalizing blood pressure with hydralazine, a peripherally acting vasodilator. Using immunoperoxidase detection, GluR 1 appears as small puncta at the light microscopic level, and is found in dendritic spines at the ultrastructural level. Following the development of hypertension, GluR 1 spine and puncta counts were significantly greater in DOCA-salt rats than controls. Hydralazine treatment (4 - 5 weeks) prevented the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats and reduced blood pressure of SHRs to normotensive levels. The density of GluR 1 puncta in the NTS was significantly reduced by hydralazine treatment in the SHR model. These results show that hypertension alters dendritic spines containing AMPA-type glutamate receptors within NTS, suggesting that adjustments in GluR 1 expression within NTS {{are part of the}} synaptic adaptations to the hypertensive state...|$|R
40|$|In the {{treatment}} of cardiovascular disease, it could be of therapeutic interest to associate the hypotensive effects due to the inhibition of angiotensin II formation with the diuretic and natriuretic responses induced by {{the protection of the}} endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Investigation of this hypothesis requires an orally active compound able to simultaneously inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which is involved in renal ANP metabolism. Such compounds have been rationally designed by taking into account the structural characteristics of the active site of both peptidases. Among them, RB 105, N-[(2 S, 3 R) - 2 -mercaptomethyl- 1 -oxo- 3 -phenylbutyl]-(S) -alanine, inhibited NEP and ACE with Ki values of 1. 7 +/- 0. 3 nM and 4. 2 +/- 0. 5 nM, respectively. Intravenous infusion of RB 105 in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats prevented the pressor response to exogenous angiotensin I and potentiated the natriuretic response to ANP. Infusion of RB 105, at 2. 5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg per hr decreased blood pressure dose-dependently in conscious catheterized spontaneously hypertensive rats and increased diuresis and natriuresis. Infusion of RB 105 as a bolus of 25 mg/kg followed by 25 mg/kg per hr similarly decreased blood pressure and increased natriuresis in three different models of <b>hypertension</b> (<b>renovascular,</b> deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt, and spontaneously hypertensive rats). Mixanpril, a lipophilic prodrug of RB 105 (ED 50 values when given orally to mice, 0. 7 mg/kg for NEP; 7 mg/kg for ACE), elicited dose-dependent hypotensive effects of long duration in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration [- 37 mmHg for 50 mg/kg twice a day (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) and is therefore the first dual NEP/ACE inhibitor potentially useful for clinical investigations...|$|R
40|$|Hormonal {{factors of}} adrenal origin {{belong to the}} {{pathophysiological}} mechanisms of the formation and progression of arterial hypertension (AH) and should be consi­dered while developing differentiated approaches to the treatment and prevention of hypertensive states, their primary, secondary and resistant forms. The first thing we should point up is aldosterone (AL), enzyme aldosterone synthase (AS), which takes a direct part {{in the formation of}} this hormone, as well as gene polymorphisms of AS, which have not only molecular genetic, but also differential diagnostic and therapeutic significance for secondary forms of arterial hypertension, abdominal obesity (AO), metabolic syndrome (MS), adrenal pathology and other endocrine disorders. AL is a steroid (mineralocorticoid) hormone of the adrenal cortex, which is synthesized from cholesterol (CH), mainly in the glomerular zone of the adrenal glands, is released under the action of angiotensin II (A II) and potassium ions (K+). AL acti­vity is mediated through the corresponding mineralocorticoid receptors (MKR). The particular importance in AH and MS development belongs to AL activation and MKR density in adipocytes, this phenomenon is accompanied by increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leptin, an adipogenic effect, and the inhibition of MCR activity is accompanied by increased production of adiponectin, which is more pronounced in patients with AH. Aldosterone synthase, a mitochondrial human enzyme encoded by the CYP 11 B 2  gene (cytochrome P 450, family 11, subfamily B, polypeptide 2) is located on the 8 th chromosome. AS belongs to the superfamily of cytochrome P 450  and regulates the synthesis of AL hormone. The CYP 11 B 2  gene encodes the key enzyme for the synthesis of AL 18 -hydroxylase. In scientific papers, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of AS gene is often studied, such as 5312 T, Intron 2, Lys- 173 /Arg; T- 344 C, 3097  C/A. 227  SNP of the AS gene were identified in different populations. Europeans, Asians, Africans and North Americans were among them and were genotyped by CYP 11 B 2. To date, there is ample evidence that fatty tissue (FT), apart from a source of energy, is an active endocrine organ that {{plays a key role in}} maintaining homeostasis and participating in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. Its excess is accompanied by hyperactivation of tissue renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), strengthening of local and systemic synthesis of AL and the emergence of secondary aldosteronism. AL, in its turn, has a direct effect on FT due to increased MKR density expressed on adipocytes surface, leading to acceleration in the maturation of the latter and a further increase in FT. Getting into the systemic blood circulation and effecting other organs, the excess AL promotes the development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, the progression of systemic inflammatory reactions. MKR activation in FT plays not only the key role in sodium reabsorption by kidneys and the control of BP, but also in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes in FT, induction of inflammation and hyperproduction of cytokines — tumor necrotic factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP- 1) and interleukin 6  (IL- 6) in the white FT, a decrease in the thermogenic activity and trans­cription of the uncoupling protein- 1  (UCP- 1) in brown FT. MCR hyperactivation was detected in mice with AO (obese db/db mice), associated with increased BMI in humans and contributes to the development of IR and associated with AO cardiovascular diseases. The gene polymorphism of AS may be a marker of aggravated pregnancy, the presence of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Some studies found that AS gene polymorphism can affect plasma glucose levels. AS gene polymorphism was not associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN), but is associated with AH in persons with type 2  diabetes mellitus. National authors conclude about the association of the genotype TT(- 344) of the gene CYP 11 B 2  with the risk of MS among residents of the North-West region of Russia. The carrier of 344 T allele of AS gene in patients with AO was associated with an increased risk of hypertension development. The features of AS gene polymorphism and blood levels in acromegaly have been stu­died, and the allelic polymorphism of AS and chymase genes (CMA) has been analyzed to identify the possible association of alleles of these genes with secondary hypertension and hyperaldosteronism in Russians. The congenital defects of the enzymatic activity of AS are of undoubted interest. AS gene is a promising candidate gene in the European and Asian populations for a number of secondary forms of hypertension, MS, diabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, renal pathology, diabe­tic nephropathy, gestational hypertension. Genotyping of AS gene polymorphisms can be useful in differential diagnostic in patients with secondary forms of arterial hypertension, hypertension with low plasma renin activity, <b>renovascular</b> and resistant <b>hypertension,</b> adrenal tumors, primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism, aldosteromas, imaginary excess of mi­neralcorticoids syndrome, congenital hyperplasia of adrenal cortex. The advantages and disadvantages of the therapeutic use of MCR antagonists and the prospects for the administration of aldosterone synthase inhibitors among various categories of patients are considered. Carrying out the genotyping of patients by the CYP 11 B 2  gene before therapy starting will allow take into account the genetic factors of sensitivity to drug in patients with the phenomenon of arterial hypertension and endocrine disorders. New AS inhibitors will not only effectively reduce blood pressure, but also will be able to prevent the development of adverse humoral and hormonal changes, what will prolong the life of patients and will help to reduce the level of total mortality from this pathology...|$|R

Hypertension is also very common in parenchymal renal disease, mainly in chronic renal insufficiency. In this condition, the mechanism is more related to volume dependent factors than in <b>renovascular</b> <b>hypertension</b> which is mainly renin dependent. In the treatment of renal or <b>renovascular</b> <b>hypertension</b> the same type of drugs have been generally used as in essential hypertension although with some specific indications like the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in unilateral renal artery stenosis or furosemide in case of renal insufficiency. Revascularization by angioplasty or surgical bypass, may be indicated in <b>renovascular</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Secondary hypertension represents about 5 - 10 % {{of all forms of}} hypertension, renal and renovascular being the commonest forms.
