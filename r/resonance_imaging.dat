40|$|Resonance energy {{transfer}} molecular imaging (RETI) can markedly improve signal intensity and tissue penetrating capacity of optical imaging, and have huge potential application in the deep-tissue optical <b>imaging</b> in vivo. <b>Resonance</b> {{energy transfer}} (RET) is an energy {{transition from the}} donor to an acceptor that is in close proximity, including non-radiative resonance energy transfer and radiative resonance energy transfer. RETI is an optical imaging technology {{that is based on}} RET. RETI mainly contains fluorescence <b>resonance</b> energy transfer <b>imaging</b> (FRETI), bioluminescence <b>resonance</b> energy transfer <b>imaging</b> (BRETI), chemiluminescence <b>resonance</b> energy transfer <b>imaging</b> (CRETI), and radiative <b>resonance</b> energy transfer <b>imaging</b> (RRETI).

5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence. Brain trauma {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRIs).|$|E
