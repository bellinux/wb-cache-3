2500|$|The Romans built many dams {{for water}} collection, {{such as the}} Subiaco dams, two of which fed Anio Novus, the largest {{aqueduct}} supplying Rome. One of the Subiaco dams was reputedly [...] the highest ever found or inferred. They built 72 dams in Spain, such as those at Mérida, and many more are known across the empire.

60|$|His {{constant}} {{study of}} the staff maps was now of great assistance to him. He determined to turn west {{until he reached the}} river Minho some distance below Lugo, which he could do by skirting the top of the hills. He would therefore strike it somewhere about the point where the <b>river</b> <b>Sil</b> joined it, and, following this, would find himself {{at the foot of the}} Cantabrian Hills, dividing the Asturias from Leon. Then he could be guided by circumstances, and could either cross these mountains and make for a seaport, or could journey down through Leon to Ciudad-Rodrigo, which was still held by a Spanish garrison, and from there make his way through Portugal to Lisbon.|$|E
