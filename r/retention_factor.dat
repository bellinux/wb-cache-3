30|$|It {{has been}} posited that {{differences}} in chemical composition lead to different <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> {{as a function of}} steel grade (Ranawaka and Mahendran [2009 a]). Young’s modulus shows little dependence on steel grade, but <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> for yield stress show a more complicated dependence. Researchers report that high strength steel (i.e. Fy ~ 550 MPa) is more efficient than common (low strength) steel grades at about 400 °C and above (Lee et al. [2003]). However, the available experimental data is limited, and mixed. As shown in Figure 4 -b, the transition temperatures from high to low <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> may be different depending on steel grade (Ranawaka and Mahendran [2009]a), but overall <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> for yield stress are similar across grades. Determining yield stress <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> is itself dependent on strain level, heat level, and the formal method for determining yield stress. The <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> vary according to the yield point and yield strain definitions. Usually, the yield point is based on the 0.2 % offset strain. However, other offset strains might be adopted to define the yield point. For instance, AISC ([2010]) provides yield stress <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> for hot-rolled steel based on 2 % offset strain. In general, the larger the offset strain used to define the yield point, the closer the <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> for yield and ultimate stresses are.|$|R

A three-parameter QSPR (quantitative structure-property relationship) model, based on physico-chemical and structural descriptors was derived, which accounted for about 98 % variations in the <b>retention</b> <b>factors.</b> The model suggests that the indole nucleus occupies the relatively apolar cavity of β-cyclodextrin while the carboxyl group of the indole - 3 -carboxylic acids makes hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of β-cyclodextrin.

40|$|The general aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between the graduateness, employability and satisfaction with <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> of individuals and whether graduateness moderates the relationship between employability and satisfaction. The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional research design on a purposive, non-probability sample (N = 100) of predominant black (93 %), male (49 %) and female (51 %) trainees between the ages of 17 - 29 years (early career). Presenting/applying information skills significantly and negatively predicted compensation while ethical/responsible behaviour significantly and positively predicted satisfaction with job characteristics and organisational commitment. Graduateness related positively to self-perceived general employability. General employability did not significantly predict the participants’ satisfaction with <b>retention</b> <b>factors.</b> Graduate skills and attributes did not significantly moderate the relationship between self-perceived employability and satisfaction with <b>retention</b> <b>factors.</b> Males had significantly stronger perceptions of employability compared to females while females had higher levels of work–life balance satisfaction compared to males.

40|$|Orientation: Retaining {{staff with}} scarce and {{critical}} {{skills in the}} medical and information technology (IT) industry has become a top priority because of skills shortages. Research purpose: The objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate empirically: (1) the relationship between employees’ satisfaction with organisational <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> (measured by the <b>Retention</b> <b>Factors</b> Scale) and their organisational commitment (measured by the Organisational Commitment Questionnaire) and (2) whether gender, age, race and tenure groups differ significantly in terms of these variables. Motivation for the study: Medical and information technology professionals have specialised and hard to replace skills. They also have strong tendencies to leave their organisations and countries. Understanding the <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> that will increase their organisational commitment may benefit the organisations who want to retain their valuable talent. Research design, approach and method: The researchers used a cross-sectional survey design to collect data from a purposive sample of 206 staff members who had scarce skills in a South African medical and information technology services company. Correlational and inferential statistics were computed to achieve the objectives. Main findings: The results showed that the participants’ satisfaction with <b>retention</b> <b>factors</b> has a significant relationship with their organisational commitment and that the biographical groups differ significantly in terms of the variables.

To classify the open-ended questions we used the International Classification of Functioning and disability (ICF). Results Older workers with a chronic health condition reported more problems due to ageing (56 vs 34 %; p <. 001), more obstacles (42 vs 16 %; p <. 001) and more needs (51 vs 31 %; p <. 001) compared to those without a chronic health condition.
