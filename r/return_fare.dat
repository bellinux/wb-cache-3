25|$|On 26 May 1963, BUA began a twice-daily rail-air-rail service {{between the}} city centres of London and Paris. The service, which was marketed as Silver Arrow in the UK and as Flèche d'argent in France, was a joint {{operation}} between British Rail (BR), BUA and Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer français (SNCF). At London's Victoria Station, where BUA check-in facilities were available, Paris-bound passengers boarded a BR train to Gatwick Airport railway station. At Gatwick they transferred to a BUA Viscount, which flew them to Le Touquet Airport. At Le Touquet Airport an SNCF train was waiting {{to take them to}} Paris's Gare du Nord station. The entire journey took five hours and the minimum <b>return</b> <b>fare</b> was £10 9s. This compared with Skyways Coach-Air's London Victoria Coach Station — Lympne Airport — Beauvais Airport — Paris République Coach Station £11 return coach-air-coach fare. BUA's Silver Arrow service was an example of Laker turning an adversity into an opportunity. BUA's lack of traffic rights prevented it from running non-stop Gatwick—Paris scheduled flights although it held a licence for that route, which the ATLB had awarded it in late 1961. Faced with this restriction, Laker hit upon the idea to offer an indirect travel option {{between the city}} centres of London and Paris by combining the existing Victoria—Gatwick rail link with BUA's Gatwick — Le Touquet traffic rights. At the time, Le Touquet Airport was not linked to the French railway network. As a result, the surface journey between the airport and Paris was difficult and time-consuming as this involved an intermodal change between coach and train at Étaples. To overcome this drawback, Laker persuaded the French authorities to build a spur line into Le Touquet Airport so that BUA passengers could be met on arrival by a dedicated SNCF train that took them direct to Gare du Nord train station in the centre of Paris. BUA's new London—Paris rail-air-rail service via Gatwick replaced a coach-air-coach/rail service it had operated on this route via Lydd. BUA Silver Arrow fares were less than what BEA and Air France charged their passengers to fly non-stop between Heathrow and Paris to compensate for the longer travelling times (5 hr vs. 2 hr 45 min.).|$|E

According to the AFA's minute book for the meeting of 26 February 1914, the item heading 'Team Exeter City' replaced that which had read 'Team de Inglaterra'. Club chairman Michael McGahey, directors Fred Parkhouse and George Middleweek (who paid for his own trip) and their wives, and fifteen players set sail in May 1914. Manager Arthur Chadwick was too ill to join the party, hence why McGahey travelled. The boat trip to Argentina lasted three weeks, stopping off at Vigo, Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Santos and Montevideo along the way. Yellow fever prevented passengers from landing in Recife and Salvador da Bahia.|$|E

2500|$|Both the {{universities}} and students alike suffered from continuing financial problems. Correspondence {{during the decade}} preceding the French Revolution gives the impression of an academic world deeply concerned {{about the number of}} prizes the Irish were awarded each year. Dr Plunkett explained that a student ‘will be received gratis as soon as he shall win a premium in the university. Should this happen the first year he will have nothing to pay during the course of his studies.’ [...] “Irish Catholics,” Swords writes, “or at least the strong farmers and well-off shopkeepers who insisted on sending their sons to Paris to be educated – were very loath to pay for them. Dr Charles Kearney, who became superior of the Collège des Irlandais in 1782, complained that often they sent their sons of thirteen or fourteen years of age with only one half-term or quarter-term’s fee and that nothing ever followed despite frequent solicitations.” [...] The scholar’s financial destitute is further illustrated as in 1789, Henry Essex Edgeworth wrote to his friend bishop Francis Moylan of Cork on behalf of one Fitzgerald, a medical student who was obliged to borrow five guineas, to persuade his father to send him money to pay his debts and <b>return</b> <b>fare</b> home. [...] Thus it was in a sense liberating for James Blackwell to be a recipient of a burse, and evidence exists supporting the claim that he was in fact a privileged bursary-holder.|$|E
