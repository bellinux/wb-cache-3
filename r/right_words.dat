5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E

5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor populism, was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E
25|$|On 16 May 2013, Franz Ferdinand officially {{announced}} their fourth album, titled Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action, along with cover art, track listing, and a release date of 26 August 2013.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} the release of Tonight, the band {{released}} their fourth studio album, Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action, in August 2013. In 2015, Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks formed the supergroup FFS and released a self-titled album in June 2015. The band's fifth studio album, Always Ascending, is due for release in February 2018.|$|E

25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the <b>right</b> <b>words,</b> while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E
500|$|Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On the critic review aggregator site Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 71/100, based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable" [...] reviews. At Digital Spy, Adam Silverstein commends that [...] "more often than not, Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction." [...] Commenting on the band's future, {{he says that the}} [...] "half-sorry, half-bitter 'Goodbye Lovers & Friends' is probably not Franz Ferdinand's very last act, even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds 'But this really is the end' would make one awesome blowout. Although after delivering a record as good as this, they can take as long as they want". At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album's tracks compared to the band's prior work, adding: [...] "Admittedly, these more nuanced Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action sounds aren't as easily accessible; it's much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post-punk ('Bullet,' 'Right Action') or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of 'Evil Eye.' But by expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity." ...|$|E

500|$|Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action {{features}} indie rock, dance-punk, and disco-rock throughout. The {{opening line}} to [...] "Right Action" [...] {{was inspired by}} a postcard Alex Kapranos had found in London, which featured the phrase [...] "Come home, practically all is nearly forgiven". The following line [...] "Right thoughts, <b>right</b> <b>words,</b> right action" [...] was thought of as a [...] "great response" [...] to the former by Kapranos. [...] "Evil Eye" [...] is about the evil eye and all-seeing eye, which are things that Kapranos was very interested about. The guitar riff to [...] "Love Illumination" [...] was created by Kapranos and originally thought of as [...] "too rocky" [...] by Nick McCarthy, but he later claimed that he enjoyed playing it. The song was fully written and recorded during a weekend session at McCarthy's Sausage Studio. Kapranos explained the meaning of the song by stating: ...|$|E

500|$|Recorded during 2013, {{the album}} was {{recorded}} in multiple studios in different locations. It also features production from multiple different musicians. Similar to Tonight, the album features more of a dance-oriented sound throughout. The band focused on making a generally positive and uplifting album with Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action. Band member Alex Kapranos, who provided production on the album, labeled it the band's [...] "most positive record", stating that the album title reflects {{the mood of the}} album as well as the mood of the band members during the recording of the album.|$|E

500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find the <b>right</b> <b>words.</b> He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He looked around the studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E
500|$|For Right Thoughts, <b>Right</b> <b>Words,</b> Right Action, Franz Ferdinand {{collaborated with}} other artists for {{parts of the}} album. Hot Chip band members Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor {{produced}} the opening track [...] "Right Action" [...] and co-produced the final track [...] "Goodbye Lovers and Friends", Norwegian DJ Todd Terje co-produced the tracks [...] "Evil Eye" [...] and [...] "Stand on the Horizon", and Peter Bjorn and John band member Björn Yttling produced [...] "Treason! Animals." [...] and co-produced [...] "The Universe Expanded". All tracks on the album were written by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy, with additional writing from Bob Hardy on [...] "Right Action" [...] and [...] "The Universe Expanded" [...] as well as Alexander Ragnew on [...] "Bullet".

500|$|Simpson {{started working}} on the album in mid-July 2000. While {{compiling}} songs for Sweet Kisses, she had expressed inconvenience when a track's lyrics were too suggestive or delivered a message she {{did not agree with}} and thus asked for its modification. However, for Irresistible, she decided to let Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Columbia, take control of the whole project. He enlisted many established composers and producers for the album, hand-picked each song for the track list, and rejected those he felt were not so good. Although she had previously announced that she would write a few songs for her second album, Simpson does not share songwriting credits on any of the tracks. On being asked why, she said that she was very shy when it came to songwriting and felt that it requires a lot of [...] "bravery" [...] to write songs. She also expressed that she could not find the <b>right</b> <b>words</b> for the songs and hence did not write for the record. According to Simpson, the album did not have a definite concept or theme; Mottola selected songs which they felt were good enough for Simpson and compiled them into an album.|$|E

500|$|Writing for musicOMH, Tom Woods {{felt the}} album would [...] "attract swarms of {{internet}} love, but this unstable foundation, built upon the fleeting dreams of thirteen year-olds" [...] would restrict the band's lifetime. Woods compared the band to Panic! at the Disco [...] "without the bounce or the creativity" [...] saying the album [...] "takes the bastardisation of honest musical forms to new heights." [...] Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters felt the songs as [...] "sound like high school gossip." [...] He {{went on to}} note the album has: [...] "Over-the-top drama" [...] combined with [...] "stripped-down, pop-rock hooks," [...] which {{for the most part}} [...] "prevent overbearing emotional mood swings." [...] He concluded by mentioning the band has [...] "much to say, but lacks the <b>right</b> <b>words</b> to say it all." [...] The Skinny reviewer Billy Hamilton noted the album was [...] "Brimming with slickly produced pre-pubescent punk-pop" [...] that made [...] "Blink 182 seem like nihilists." [...] He considered the sound as being [...] "faux-guitar music for a generation yet to move on from the tweeny-rock of Busted." [...] In an artist spotlight for Spin, writer Alyssa Rashbaum described the album as [...] "energetic, youthful power-pop about high school cliques, drama-loving girls, and fake IDs." ...|$|E
500|$|The heavily orchestrated [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] number, at that time, had {{the highest}} number of {{instruments}} used for recording. Choir singers from the Purasawalkam and Vepery areas of Chennai were used in the song. According to film historian and actor Mohan V. Raman, [...] "Kannadasan could not get the <b>right</b> <b>words</b> nor was there a tune ready and Sivaji came to the composing and did a pantomime of what he would like to do and thus was born the line and the song". Cellist R. Selvaraj, whose father {{was a part of the}} orchestration for [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] said 250 instrumentalists were used for playing different instruments in sync. Other sources state that Viswanathan used over 300 instruments for the song. The music directors tried over 100 different ways of composing the tune of [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] before the song was recorded. It was based on the raga Bilaskhani Todi. S. S. Vasan of The Hindu Tamil compared the sombre moments in [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] to that of the song [...] "Mujhko Is Raat Ki Tanhai Me" [...] from Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960). The song [...] "Yae Dushyanta", composed by Bharathwaj for Asal (2010) samples [...] "Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo". Singer Karthik performed [...] "Aha Mella" [...] live at [...] "Two to Tango", an October 2016 concert organised by the Rotary Club of Madras South.|$|E
