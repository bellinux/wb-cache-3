5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at lower <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke—for instance, those without {{a history of}} these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested {{as a component of}} a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, {{they are unable to}} synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise {{in the weeks after}} the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
50|$|One {{study found}} that cat {{ownership}} {{is associated with a}} reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes at the 95% confidence interval.|$|R
50|$|Nissen has led {{a number}} of {{inquiries}} as to the scientific integrity of many medications currently on the market. Starting with linked COX-2 inhibitors, such as Vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2001, Nissen {{was one of the}} first physicians to link it to an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes. Three years later Merck pulled Vioxx from the market when additional studies confirmed that daily, long-term use of the drug could increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{studies show}} rutin could help prevent blood clots, so {{could be used}} to treat {{patients}} at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes.|$|R
25|$|Avorn's {{paper on}} coxibs {{was one of}} the first medical {{research}} papers to demonstrate that Vioxx increased some patients' <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke. In 2006 he testified as a plaintiff’s expert witness in the Vioxx litigation, but he donates all profit from his involvement to Alosa Health.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). FDA analysts estimated that Vioxx caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, {{in the five years}} the drug was on the market.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study that}} {{followed}} 11,000 subjects {{for up to}} eight years concluded that BMI {{is not a good}} measure for the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> stroke or death. A better measure was found to be the waist-to-height ratio. A 2011 study that followed 60,000 participants for up to 13 years found that waist–hip ratio was a better predictor of ischaemic heart disease mortality.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has several}} {{cardiovascular}} adverse effects, including <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> pulmonary hypertension, {{and changes in}} heart rhythm including syncope, bradycardia and atrioventricular block.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that NRT can increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or recent <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> should consult a physician before initiating NRT.|$|R
25|$|In March 2010, an Australian {{class-action lawsuit}} against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> and that Merck had {{breached}} the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.|$|R
25|$|The current US Surgeon General’s Report {{concludes that}} there is no {{established}} risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke. Short exposures to second-hand smoke are believed to cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> New research indicates that private research conducted by cigarette company Philip Morris in the 1980s showed that second-hand smoke was toxic, yet the company suppressed the finding during the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to studies of Western cultures, research {{in other cultures}} has yielded some opposite findings. The landmark INTERHEART Study has revealed that alcohol consumption in South Asians was not protective against CAD in sharp {{contrast to}} other populations who benefit from it. In fact Asian Indians who consume alcohol had a 60% higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> which was greater with local spirits (80%) than branded spirits (50%). The harm was observed in alcohol users classified as occasional as well as regular light, moderate, and heavy consumers.|$|E
25|$|An Australian-led {{international}} {{study of}} patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate is a key indicator for the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> The study, published in The Lancet (September 2008) studied 11,000 people, across 33 countries, who were being treated for heart problems. Those patients whose heart rate was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions {{and the need for}} surgery. Higher heart rate is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.|$|E
50|$|Tiotropium {{and another}} member of its class {{ipratropium}} were linked to increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> stroke and cardiovascular death. The FDA requested further trials; these are now complete, and adequately resolve the previous safety concerns.|$|R
50|$|C-reactive protein (CRP) is {{generated}} {{at a higher}} level in obese people. It raises when there is inflammation throughout the body. Mild elevation in CRP increase <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> strokes, high blood pressure, muscle weakness and fragility.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the decade}} of 2000-2010, {{artificial}} blood was transfused into research subjects across the United States without their consent by Northfield Labs. [...] Later studies showed the artificial blood caused {{a significant increase in}} the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and death.|$|R
25|$|Several {{very large}} {{observational}} {{studies have also}} found elevated <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).|$|E
25|$|However, several COX-2 {{selective}} inhibitors have subsequently been withdrawn after evidence {{emerged that}} COX-2 inhibitors increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> (e.g., see {{the article on}} Vioxx). The underlying mechanism for the deleterious effect proposes that endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body express COX-2, whose selective inhibition results in levels of prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, prostacyclin) down-regulated relative to thromboxane (since COX-1 in platelets is unaffected). Thus, the protective anti-coagulative effect of PGI2 is decreased, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. As platelets have no DNA, {{they are unable to}} synthesize new COX once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference between aspirin and the reversible inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib {{from the}} market because of {{concerns}} about increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib {{was one of the most}} widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn {{from the market}}. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. Merck reserved $970 million to pay for its Vioxx-related legal expenses through 2007, and has set aside $4.85bn for legal claims from US citizens.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{association}} between respiratory infection and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes is well established. However, less evidence exists for an {{association between}} respiratory infection and venous thromboembolism (VTE). In this article, we describe the associations between respiratory infection and VTE...|$|R
50|$|Tegaserod (brand name Zelnorm) {{was removed}} from the general U.S. and Canadian markets in 2007, due to reports <b>of</b> {{increased}} <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke. It is still available to physicians for patients in emergency situations that are life-threatening or require hospitalization.|$|R
2500|$|A {{higher number}} of {{cardiovascular}} events has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%). [...] In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes in patients {{with a history of}} cardiovascular disease.|$|R
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{consequence}} of untreated OSA {{is to the}} heart. Persons with sleep apnea have a 30% higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or death than those unaffected. In severe and prolonged cases, increased in pulmonary pressures are transmitted {{to the right side}} of the heart. This can result in a severe form of congestive heart failure known as cor pulmonale. Dyastolic function of the heart also becomes affected. One prospective study showed patients with OSA, compared with healthy controls, initially had statistically significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (P=.003) and significantly lower levels of nitrite-nitrate (P=.008), which might be pathogenic factors in the cardiovascular complications of OSA. These factors reversed to normal levels after 12 weeks of treatment by CPAP, but further long-term trials are needed to assess the impact of this therapy.|$|E
25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
50|$|In {{preliminary}} research, {{omega-3 fatty}} acids in algal oil, fish oil, fish and seafood {{have been shown to}} lower the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> Other preliminary research indicates that omega-6 fatty acids in sunflower oil and safflower oil may also reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cardiovascular disease.|$|R
5000|$|For example, in 1984, a National Institutes of Health {{consensus}} development conference found that: It {{has been}} established {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that lowering definitely elevated blood cholesterol levels (specifically, blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) will reduce the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> caused by coronary heart disease.|$|R
50|$|The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{stated in}} 2015 {{that neither the}} {{benefits}} nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging. The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility <b>of</b> an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and stroke.|$|R
500|$|A {{combination}} of metformin and rosiglitazone {{was released in}} 2002 and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline. By 2009 it had become the most popular metformin combination. In 2005, the stock of Avandamet {{was removed from the}} market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The drug pair continued to be prescribed separately and Avandamet was again available {{by the end of that}} year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012. However, following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> [...] concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone. In September 2010 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that the drug be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or death associated with the drug.|$|E
2500|$|A 2000 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health found that a middle-age person's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> rises nearly fivefold in the first hour after smoking marijuana, [...] "roughly the same risk seen {{within an hour of}} sexual activity".|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the JUPITER trial (2008) {{suggested}} rosuvastatin may decrease the relative <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke in patients without hyperlipidemia, but with elevated levels of highly sensitive C-reactive protein. This could strongly impact medical practice by [...] placing many patients on statin prophylaxis who {{otherwise would have been}} untreated. As a result of this clinical trial, the FDA approved rosuvastatin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.|$|E
50|$|Regular {{consumption}} of mastic {{has been proven}} to absorb cholesterol, thus easing {{high blood pressure and}} reducing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> Mastic oil also has antibacterial and antifungal properties, and as such is widely used in the preparation of ointments for skin disorders and afflictions. It is also used in the manufacture of plasters.|$|R
25|$|In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (a placebo-controlled, {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} of 5 years duration), simvastatin reduced overall mortality {{in people with}} existing cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol by 30% and reduced cardiovascular mortality by 42%. The <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> stroke, or needing a coronary revascularization procedure were reduced by 37%, 28%, and 37% respectively.|$|R
50|$|A more {{controversial}} link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis. While this intracellular organism {{has been demonstrated}} in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive {{as to whether it}} can be considered a causative factor. Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> or other coronary vascular diseases.|$|R
