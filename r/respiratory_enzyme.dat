Action mode was mixed-type for quinone-dependent activity and noncompe-titive for succinate-dependent activity, indicating {{the proximity of the}} inhibitor-binding site to the quinone-binding site.

40|$|AbstractThe {{activity}} of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>enzyme</b> fumarate reductase (FRD) {{is dependent on the}} covalent attachment of the redox cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).

SdhE interacted with, and flavinylated, the flavoprotein subunit FrdA, whilst mutations in a conserved RGxxE motif impaired the complete flavinylation and activation of FRD.

40|$|In Part 1. {{the author}} investigatad {{the effects of}} the {{unsaturated}} fatty acid fraction extracted from the rabbit liver after x-ray irradiation on the succinic dehydrogenase system in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and in the normal rabbit liver, and it was concluded that although this fraction does not greatly affect the normal liver cells, at a higher concentration it seems to induce cell degeneration which in turn results in a decrease in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity. In the present experiment the author studied the morphological changes brought about by this substance in Ehrlich ascites tumor cell and the in vivo changes induced by it in the succinic dehydrogenase system.

With respect to the morphological changes in the tumor cells, it was observed that this substance acting {{for a short period of}} time will accelerate the <b>respiratory</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity transiently while when acting for a longer period, it decreases the activity.

Insertions in the closely linked narX gene decrease, but do not abolish, nitrate regulation of anaerobic enzyme synthesis. Analysis of sequence similarities suggests that NarX and NarL comprise a two-component regulatory pair. We constructed lacZ operon and gene fusions to investigate the operon structure of narXL. We found evidence for a complex operon with at least two promoters; PXL-narX-PL-narL. We also investigated the role of NarX in nitrate regulation of anaerobic <b>respiratory</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis by constructing nonpolar loss of function narX alleles. These deletions were studied on narL+ lambda specialized transducing bacteriophage. The narX deletions had no effect on nitrate regulation in delta (narXL) strains. This finding suggest that the subtle effects of previously studied narX insertions are due to decreased expression of narL and that narX+ is not essential for normal nitrate regulation. The role of NarX in nitrate regulation remains to be determined...|$|E
