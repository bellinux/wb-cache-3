The film makes use of extensive Arab television footage depicting Islamic radicals preaching hate speech and seeking to incite global jihad.

25|$|The {{formerly}} atheistic Communist Party {{leaders have}} mostly converted to Islam. Small Islamist groups have formed {{in several of}} the countries, but <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> has little history in the region; the Central Asian societies have remained largely secular and all five states enjoy good relations with Israel. Central Asia is still home to a large Jewish population, the largest group being the Bukharan Jews, and important trade and business links have developed between those that left for Israel after independence and those remaining.|$|E
25|$|The film's {{depiction}} of <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> and Islamists was criticized as Islamophobic. Initially supplied to college campuses for free screenings, the film ignited controversy with 30 airing the film, while several declined including the State University of New York {{at the request}} of Jewish groups. Students attending the screenings at New York University were required to register with IsraelActivism.com with photographs of the event forwarded to Hasbara Fellowships, an organization that brings students to Israel and trains them to be pro-Israel activists on college campuses. The forwarding of names was criticised for stifling dissent and intimidating people.|$|E
25|$|Another {{murder that}} caused great {{upheaval}} {{took place on}} 2 November 2004, when film director and publicist Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with radical Islamic beliefs, because of Van Gogh's alleged blasphemy. One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamist terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration. The personal protection of most politicians, especially of the Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was stepped up to unprecedented levels.|$|E

25|$|In early 2011, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) {{told the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation that Tsarnaev was a {{follower}} of <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> and a strong believer. The FSB {{said that he was}} preparing to leave the United States to travel to the Russian region to join unspecified underground groups. The FBI initially denied that it had contacted Tsarnaev, but then said that it actually had after Tsarnaev's mother talked about the FBI's contacts with her son on RT. The FBI said that it interviewed him and relatives of his, but did not find any terrorist activity, and that it provided the results in the summer of 2011. At that point, the FBI asked the FSB for more information, but the Russians did not respond to the American request, and the FBI officially closed the case.|$|E
25|$|Ron Prosor, Israel's {{representative}} to the United Nations, claimed in General Assembly debate on the Question of Palestine, November 2014, that the UN is illogical and tends to lack of sense of justice {{when it comes to}} the case of Israel. He claimed that the UN's focus was solely on Israel, ignoring the thousands murdered and expelled in the Middle East under the tyranny of <b>Radical</b> <b>Islam,</b> and that the Arab–Israeli conflict was never was about the establishment of a Palestinian state but the existence of the Jewish state. He also claimed that the UN is not for peace or the Palestinian people but simply against Israel, and pointed out that if the UN really cared about the situation of the Palestinians, they would have taken at least one decision regarding the situation of the Palestinians in Syria and Lebanon, where Palestinians are being persecuted and systematically discriminated against.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to <b>radical</b> <b>Islam,</b> which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to <b>radical</b> <b>Islam,</b> explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of <b>radical</b> <b>Islam</b> in the problematic regions".|$|E
500|$|The {{first months}} of the {{campaign}} were dominated by the heightened terrorist threat in London, following a series of successful and planned attacks by Islamic State in 2015, particularly the November 2015 Paris attacks and a lone knife attack at Leytonstone tube station in on 6 December. Khan's comments on how British Muslims might respond to the Paris attacks raised positive comments from both supporters and opponents. A subsequent leaflet distributed by Goldmsith's campaign team described Khan as [...] "divisive and radical", comments that Labour claimed were an attempt to associate Khan with <b>radical</b> <b>Islam.</b> The Conservative Party rejected the accusation, claiming that Khan was [...] "playing the race card".|$|E
500|$|The party {{maintained}} that [...] "the protection of cultural identity and social peace in Austria requires {{a stop to}} immigration," [...] maintaining that its concern was not against foreigners, but to safeguard the interests and cultural identity of native Austrians. Although during the late 1990s the party attacked the influence of <b>radical</b> <b>Islam,</b> this was later expanded to include [...] "Islamisation" [...] and {{the increasing number of}} Muslims in general. According to The Economist, the hostility to Muslims is [...] "a strategy that resonates with voters of Serbian background, whom the party has assiduously cultivated." [...] The party has also vowed to outlaw the distribution of free copies of the Koran.|$|E
5000|$|For similar reasons, he was {{an outspoken}} critic of the 2005 {{documentary}} film [...] "Obsession: <b>Radical</b> <b>Islam's</b> War Against the West," [...] which he described as [...] "a thinly-veiled call for disparagement and distrust of all Muslims." ...|$|R
