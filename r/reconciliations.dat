5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite.

The article puts forward a critique of <b>reconciliation</b> in practice and questions mainstream definitions of <b>reconciliation.</b> The principle that these forms of <b>reconciliation</b> are desirable is also questioned. It is argued that examples of genuine <b>reconciliation</b> are difficult to find, that the promotion of <b>reconciliation</b> is frequently emphasised {{at the expense of}} substantive societal change, that emphasis on <b>reconciliation</b> (narrowly defined) risks taking agency away from those affected by conflict and that emphasis on <b>reconciliation</b> may obscure injustice and may promote acceptance of the status quo.

40|$|This {{study is}} a socio-rhetorical {{approach}} to the Pauline theology of <b>reconciliation</b> in 2 Corinthians. Scholars generally focus their attention on where καταλλάσσω and καταλλαγή terminology appears in discussing Paul’s theology of <b>reconciliation.</b> This has led to some scholars reducing Paul’s theology of <b>reconciliation</b> to simply referring to God being reconciled to men and vice versa, while other scholars {{tend to focus on}} <b>reconciliation</b> between human beings, almost to the exclusion of <b>reconciliation</b> between God and men. The current research argues that <b>reconciliation</b> with God is intrinsically linked to <b>reconciliation</b> between people in the church. Chapter One of this study looks at areas of disagreement amongst scholars concerning Paul’s theology of <b>reconciliation.</b> Chapter Two reviews the current state of research on Paul and his theology of <b>reconciliation,</b> while Chapter Three discusses the question of the Socio-historical use of the καταλλάσσειν and διαλλάσσειν terminology in the New Testament, and its uniqueness in Paul.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Cambodia and the national <b>reconciliation</b> process. A qualitative method involving secondary source analysis as well as field study interviews is being used. The point of departure is a theoretical framework of <b>reconciliation</b> assembled from different sources, as {{there seems to be no}} coherent and widely accepted framework available for use. An analysis model is constructed, focusing on the concepts of justice and truth. The findings indicate that <b>reconciliation</b> is nowhere near fulfillment, although a few steps towards national <b>reconciliation</b> have been taken. The Cambodian process of <b>reconciliation</b> is only at its earliest stages. Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is a strong relationship between the tribunal and the <b>reconciliation</b> process, inasmuch as the tribunal is perceived to have positive effects on <b>reconciliation,</b> and that continued <b>reconciliation</b> would not be possible without the tribunal. The tribunal is not the only part in <b>reconciliation</b> though, it is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for continued <b>reconciliation.</b> The tribunal can not bring <b>reconciliation</b> close to fulfillment on its own, other mechanizms must be involved in order to do so...|$|R

25|$|Reconciliation of {{gene and}} species trees entails mapping {{evolutionary}} events onto gene trees {{in a way}} that makes them concordant with the species tree. Different reconciliation models exist, differing in the types of event they consider to explain the incongruences between gene and species tree topologies. Early methods exclusively modelled horizontal transfers (T). More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or homologous recombination (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible <b>reconciliations</b> increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene tree topologies might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the Australian <b>reconciliation</b> {{movement}} has worked to reconcile Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, through educating the wider community about <b>reconciliation</b> and Indigenous issues, addressing Indigenous socio-economic disadvantage and recognising Indigenous peoples and Indigenous rights. One of the most significant strengths of the <b>reconciliation</b> movement during this time has been the development of local <b>reconciliation</b> initiatives and activities throughout the Australian community. This book explores a number of local case studies of <b>reconciliation</b> within the Gippsland region of Victoria. The book brings together several scholars who discuss <b>reconciliation</b> in relation to a range of areas: wider community attitudes, addressing history, educating the wider community, Indigenous socio-economic disadvantage, Indigenous rights and community <b>reconciliation.</b> These case studies illustrate the hopes, outcomes and obstacles regarding the efforts of those working towards <b>reconciliation</b> in this country...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I analyse {{the formal}} {{documents}} of <b>reconciliation</b> {{produced by the}} Council for Aboriginal <b>Reconciliation</b> {{at the conclusion of}} the formal Australian <b>reconciliation</b> process in 2000. These documents were the Australian Declaration towards <b>Reconciliation</b> and the Roadmap for <b>Reconciliation.</b> In particular, I argue that these documents of <b>reconciliation</b> largely failed to substantially recognise and address Indigenous people's Indigenous rights. Unlike human rights, which are universal for all human beings, Indigenous rights are those rights possessed by Indigenous peoples in Australia by virtue of them being the original inhabitants and continuing sovereign owners of this continent. I conclude this paper by arguing the need for formal documents of <b>reconciliation</b> and a substantial <b>reconciliation</b> process that genuinely recognises, addresses and protects both the human rights and the Indigenous rights of Indigenous peoples in Australia...|$|R
40|$|In post-conflict transitions, {{the process}} of {{individual}} and community-oriented <b>reconciliation</b> might leave those who {{were too young to}} participate in the conflict but nevertheless grow up with its legacy excluded. In this thesis I explore the participation of active urban youth in {{the process of}} <b>reconciliation</b> in Timor-Leste. With a memory of the conflict but no active participation in it, and with partial proficiency in both Indonesian and Portuguese, youth constitute an in-between-generation. The association, in Timor-Leste, of <b>reconciliation</b> with the individual and community-oriented process implemented by the Commission for Reception, Truth and <b>Reconciliation,</b> leads youth to place their own forward-looking actions outside the realm of <b>reconciliation.</b> I, however, argue that youth involve in political <b>reconciliation</b> as an act of constitution. I claim that political <b>reconciliation,</b> with its forward-looking impetus, allows for the inclusion of post-conflict generations, opening up possibilities for inter-generational <b>reconciliation.</b> I analyze youth‟s participation in political <b>reconciliation</b> in the arenas of leadership, democratic participation, citizenship education, and national unity. Hereby I illustrate that political <b>reconciliation</b> is inextricably related to dilemmas of nation-building...|$|R
25|$|Teutberga was {{not capable}} of bearing {{children}} and Lothair's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Although quarrels and <b>reconciliations</b> between the three kings followed each other in quick succession, in general it may be said that Louis favoured annulment, and Charles opposed it, while neither {{lost sight of the}} fact that Lothair had no sons to inherit his lands. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was prompted by his affection for his mistress, Waldrada, put away Teutberga, but Hucbert took up arms on her behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862.|$|E
25|$|Reconciliation {{methods can}} rely on a parsimonious or a {{probabilistic}} framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events can be fixed a priori or estimated from the data. The space of DTL <b>reconciliations</b> and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through dynamic programming algorithms. In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario {{as well as the}} initial sequence alignment. More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages, reflecting the loss of efficiency of HR with phylogenetic distance, for ILS, or {{for the fact that the}} actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages. Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scalesmodelling independent evolution of gene fragments or recognising co-evolution of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.|$|E

Second, if <b>reconciliation</b> is granted unhindered access across the borders of theology and politics, what wisdom from the theological tradition has informed the political praxis of <b>reconciliation,</b> and has political praxis in any way challenged our theological understanding of <b>reconciliation?</b> As responses to these questions, the paper looks at the theological development of <b>reconciliation,</b> with particular attention to the New Testament and subsequent historical praxis.

Loveless has been away for ten years, {{dividing}} his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognises his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda lures Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed that he immediately reforms. A minor part that was a great hit with the première audience is the fop Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and Cibber would modestly write in his autobiography 45 years later, [...] "was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion". Combining daring sex scenes with sentimental <b>reconciliations</b> and Sir Novelty's buffoonery, Love's Last Shift offered something for everybody, and was a great box-office hit.|$|E
