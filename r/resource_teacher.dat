40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to ascertain the extent and nature of differences of perceptions which exist between the elementary regular classroom <b>teacher,</b> elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> and building principal relating to the duties and responsibilities of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher.</b> A questionnaire containing nineteen statements regarding the duties and responsibilities of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> was distributed to 40 building principals, 572 elementary regular classroom teachers and 21 elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers.</b> hirty-four building principals, or 85 percent, completed the questionnaire and 370, or 64 percent of the elementary regular classroom teachers completed and returned the questionnaire. A total of twenty, or 95 percent, of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> also completed and returned the questionnaire. The results were analyzed by the chi-square test of independence at the. 05 level of significance to test three null hypotheses in order to determine if perceptions of building principals, elementary regular classroom <b>teachers</b> and elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> were identical or different. A statistical difference in perceptions of the three groups was indicated with regard to elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> keeping the building principal informed of all aspects of the resource room program, including the referral process. The data also indicated a difference in perceptions among the three groups pertaining to the <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> cooperatively implementing and coordinating with the elementary regular classroom teacher skill development tasks of the student which have been included in the individualized educational plan. A difference in perceptions between the three groups was also indicated with respect to the <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> participating in case conferences and assisting in determination of criteria for placement of a child in special programs. Implementation of long term and short term goals for the mildly handicapped child cooperatively by the elementary regular class <b>teacher</b> and elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> was also perceived differently by the three groups as a duty of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher.</b> Recommendations for Further Research 1. A study should be conducted to determine whether the identified duties and responsibilities of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> are actually being performed. 2. A study should be conducted to determine if the perceived duties and responsibilities of the elementary resource room teacherr have changed as the resource room concept has been utilized {{over a longer period of}} time. 3. As the utilization of resource rooms increases in Indiana Public School Corporations, the study should be replicated, as a larger sample may add verification to the results. 4. A study to determine whether years of professional experience of building principals, elementary regular classroom <b>teachers</b> and elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> can be identified as a factor regarding the perceptions of the duties and responsibilities of the elementary <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> should be conducted...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{significant}} achievement of Lacy's short time in government was his {{establishment of the}} Special Assistance Program in Victorian Primary Schools.https://archive.org/stream/AddressingDecliningLiteracyAndNumeracySkillsInVictorianPrimarySchools#page/n0/mode/1up [...] He outlined his ambitious program in a speech he made at a seminar of Special Assistance <b>Resource</b> <b>Teachers</b> in December 1980. In it he announced the {{most significant}} development in remedial education in Victoria with a strategic plan for addressing a reported decline in literacy and numeracy skills amongst secondary students. The totally new component of the Special Assistance Program was the provision of 1000 Special Assistance <b>Resource</b> <b>Teachers</b> [...] "in the delivery of services to children with special needs." [...] They were given [...] "a major on-site responsibility facilitating a productive relationship between parents and pupils and teachers."https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech_862/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-ASpeech#page/n0/mode/1up The program involved the training of these primary teachers as Special Assistance <b>Resource</b> <b>Teachers</b> and their placement in schools. Their role was the early detection and remediation of children at risk of illiteracy and innumeracy.https://archive.org/stream/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement_912/TheSpecialAssistanceProgram-MinisterialStatement#page/n0/mode/1up Lacy's greatest political disappointment came from the Cain Labour Government's actions after their 1982 election directed at de-emphasising and largely dismantling this educationally highly significant and ground breaking program.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{teaching}} reading to 12 second- and third-grade learning-disabled children {{was investigated in}} mainstream classrooms and resource rooms. The study focused on how the process of achieving intersubjectivity in a routine task like reading takes place and how the construction of Intersubjectivity (referred to as scaffolding) can vary {{as a result of}} the teacher norms being brought to t'le task. Transcripts of teacher-child interaction were coded according to Vygotskian principles. <b>Resource</b> <b>teachers</b> were found to apply these principles more consistently than mainstream teachers. As a result, <b>resource</b> <b>teachers</b> had longer interactions with children in which they made more adjustments that catered to a reader's zone of proximal development. Students in resource rooms were also more likely to have successful reading episodes and were more likely to initiate interaction. It is concluded that resource room teacher-child interactions were longer because mainstreau teachers persisted in the use of the recitati. on model of teaching to a greater extent than did <b>resource</b> <b>teachers,</b> and because mainstream classroom settings used a more hierarchical physical arrangement of space and the teacher's position. It is suggcsted that resource rocms are more effective in supporting learning-disabled children academically. (Includes seven references.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the overall {{perceptions}} that <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> had of the required SMART goals, rubric outcome sampling, and the collaborative effort of Personal Program Planning team. This study included a descriptive, embedded single-case study having three sub-units. Each subunit consisted of one <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> who was teaching in a central Saskatchewan urban school division at the elementary level. Each <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> was asked to select one student with a cognitive, behavioural, or multiple disability and a previous PPP document written for him or her (i. e., this is not the student’s first year of meeting the criteria for Intensive Supports) by that particular <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher.</b> Each <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> participated in three separate focus open-ended interviews designed to explore their perceptions of SMART goals, rubric outcome sampling, and the collaborative nature of the PPP process. Pattern-matching and exploration building were the two analytic techniques used in this study. Numerous themes were identified in the data. The themes present in data collected from at least two of the participants included: the need to be flexible with parents; <b>resource</b> room <b>teachers</b> have large workloads; concern over EAs not being able to attend PPP meetings; the need for rubrics to be discussed within the context of a PPP meeting; the effect of having different knowledge bases and levels of expertise represented in a PPP team; the use of visual aides during the PPP meeting; and working with the dual role of <b>resource</b> room <b>teacher</b> and vice principal...|$|R
