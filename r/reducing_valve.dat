40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{attempts to}} solve the BBLAWN challenge. The examined town consists of several pressure zones with significant elevation differences, causing accesses water pressure and pipe leakage. The challenge of optimally resizing the water system, to meet future water demands and minimize leakage, was solved using a successive linear programming, minimum cost, optimal operation model that includes head loss constraints, leakage control, pipe diameter selection and pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> A combination of an optimization model and practical engineering experience {{was used in the}} positioning of the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> and sizing of pump stations and water tanks...|$|R
50|$|In {{his book}} The Doors of Perception, author and psychonaut Aldous Huxley {{presents}} {{the idea of}} the mental <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> in order to explain the significance of the psychedelic experience. According to Huxley, the central nervous system's main function is to shut out the majority of what we perceive; the brain filters those perceptions which are useful for survival. Society aids in this filtering by creating a symbolic system which structures our reality and which reduces our awareness. Psychedelic experiencing has the effect of reducing the strength of the mind's <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> which allows for a broader spectrum of one's overall experience to enter into conscious experience. A person undergoing a psychedelic trip temporarily possesses a higher level of conscious awareness.|$|E

50|$|The {{first version}} was {{designed}} by Fleuss and Davis in about 1906-1910. It had equal balance back and front of the wearer, and avoided projections on the back that could catch when crawling through holes. The more vulnerable parts were in front in sight of the wearer. The <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> was of the constant feed type.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{electricity}} generation from water pipelines was rare because {{the water would}} have been pumped by other engines in the system prior to the intake of water turbines to generate electricity. The energy generated from the turbines would have been offset by the power used in pumping, canceling out the power generation benefit. However, there have been renewed interests to apply this method to recover energy {{when there is a}} need to reduce pressure in the water supply system that is normally done through pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> The conduit hydro{{electricity generation}} in this case can be done by replacing the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> with small turbines and electrical generators.|$|R
40|$|Valve {{stem seal}} leakage {{is a major}} source of {{fugitive}} emissions, and controlling these emissions can result in added expense in leak detection and repair programs. Elastomeric O-rings can be used as valve stem seals, and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric valve stem seals. Valve stem leak measurements were taken to determine if the coated O-rings, alone or with the recommended lubrication, <b>reduced</b> <b>valve</b> stem seal leakage. This research determined that the metallic coating did not <b>reduce</b> <b>valve</b> stem leakage...|$|R

5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> off the Main Reservoir Pipe. The driver's brake handle passes control voltages down three wires to each EP control valve, which allows {{air from the}} brake reservoir to pass into the brake cylinder, thereby activating the disc brake. The presence of the voltage holds the brakes off, providing a Fail Safe system.|$|E

50|$|As the {{pressure}} builds rapidly {{in relation to}} depth, underground mining operations require a fairly complex water system with pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> These devices must be installed at a certain distance interval, usually 600 ft.

5000|$|... ==20th century== After using {{mescaline}} in 1953, Aldous Huxley {{wrote the}} Doors of Perception where he advanced {{the theory that}} psychedelic compounds could produce mystical experiences and knowledge, [...] "what the visionary, the medium, even the mystic were talking about" [...] and what eastern philosophy described with terms like Satcitananda, the Godhead, Suchness, Void, Not-self and Dharmakaya. Huxley also quotes the philosopher C. D. Broad, which held that the brain and nervous might act as a <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> of all the stimuli in the universe: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{low-temperature}} separator is {{a special}} one in which high-pressure well fluid is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule-Thomson effect of expanding well fluid as it flows through the pressure-reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark 5 was a [...] "hot-running" [...] (powered by heated air) torpedo, {{as opposed}} to {{previous}} Whitehead designs, which were [...] "cold-running". It was similar in performance to the Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes of that era. Around 500 units were produced by the Naval Torpedo Station and Vickers Limited. The Mark 5 had variable speed; at a high speed of 40 knots, it had a range of 1000 yards. A low speed of 27 knots allowed the weapon a range of 4000 yards; at medium speed of 36 knots, its range was 2000 yards. This variable speed was set before loading the torpedo in its tube by adjusting the <b>reducing</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Powerbands can surpass 14,000 RPM in {{motorcycles}} {{and some}} racing automobiles. Such high speeds are reached by using lightweight pistons and connecting rods with short strokes to reduce inertia, and thus stresses on parts. Advances in <b>valve</b> technology similarly <b>reduce</b> <b>valve</b> float at such speeds. As an engine grows larger (its stroke in particular), power band moves to lower speeds.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with head}} gasket failure, {{one of the}} least {{reliable}} parts of the early petrol engine was the exhaust valve, which tended to fail by overheating and burning. A monobloc head could provide good water cooling, thus <b>reduced</b> <b>valve</b> wear, as it could extend the water jacket uninterrupted around both head and cylinder. Engines with gaskets required a metal-to-metal contact face here, disrupting water flow.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal pressure management in water distribution systems through the introduction and regulation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> Reduction in pressure is aimed at controlling water leakages which, being in some cases {{a high proportion of}} the total volume supplied, are nowadays one of the major concerns for water utilities. The determination of the number, location, and setting of such valves is formulated as a two criteria optimization problem and is solved with multiobjective genetic algorithms. In particular, the first criterion is represented by the minimization of the number of valves, and the second is the minimization of the total leakage in the system, when maintaining the required pressure at each node. The great advantage of the multiobjective approach resides in the fact that, in one run, several trade-off alternatives are found, thus providing the set of the optimal solutions with a different level of compromise between the conflicting objectives. At the same time, data necessary for practical choice and operation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> may be determined...|$|R
50|$|After reading Osmond's paper, Huxley {{sent him}} a letter on Thursday, 10 April 1952, expressing {{interest}} in the research and putting himself forward as an experimental subject. His letter explained his motivations as being rooted in an idea that the brain is a <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> that restricts consciousness and hoping mescaline might help access {{a greater degree of}} awareness (an idea he later included in the book). Reflecting on his stated motivations, Woodcock wrote that Huxley had realised that the ways to enlightenment were many, including prayer and meditation. He hoped drugs might also break down the barriers of the ego, and both draw him closer to spiritual enlightenment and satisfy his quest as a seeker of knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|During its {{operational}} life, {{the steam}} reservoir was charged to [...] from a charging plant at Kemsley, and a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> admitted steam to the cylinders at [...] It {{was capable of}} working for 8 hours on one charge, although was rarely used for more than 4 hours at a time. It remained the most powerful engine on the site until the 0-4-4-0T Monarch was delivered in 1953. It continued in use until {{the closure of the}} former Lloyd's system, and was acquired by the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway. It is now preserved, but has not worked in preservation, as {{there is no longer a}} source of high-pressure steam available to charge it.|$|E
50|$|Since ACE {{introduced}} its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though {{many of the}} products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point. This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas {{at a much higher}} than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.|$|E
50|$|Automatic control <b>valves</b> include: {{pressure}} <b>reducing</b> <b>valves,</b> {{flow control}} valves, back-pressure sustaining valves, altitude valves, and relief valves. An altitude valve controls {{the level of}} a tank. The altitude valve will remain open while the tank is not full and it will close when the tanks reaches its maximum level. The opening and closing of the valve requires no external power source (electric, pneumatic, or man power), it is done automatically, hence its name.|$|R
50|$|On May 1, 1885 he {{took over}} the {{workshop}} of the brass founder master Wallen in the town of Heide in the federal Land of Schleswig-Holstein and founded the company Gustav Mankenberg. Mr Mankenberg quickly realised the development of the local market and changed the product line to <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> for air and carbonic acid tanks, air pumps etc. and additionally opened a samples stock and a sales warehouse at the Roedingsmarkt avenue in Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|This notable chiton {{can grow}} up to 62mm long and is {{distinguished}} by a wide fleshy girdle that is orange in most individuals, sometimes covered in a greenish algal growth. The <b>reduced</b> <b>valves</b> are sculptured in purple patterns often with white markings, with pustules in lateral areas and five strong radial ribs on the head valve. The ventral underside is orange, a thin film covers the off-white mantle and is easily removed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressure}} {{of a sample}} stream can be lowered by a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> particularly since many analysers are not designed to withstand high pressure. Such pressure reducing or similar valves {{may be used to}} control the flow rate to the online analyser. If the process pressure is insufficient to allow a sample stream to flow by itself to the analyser, a small pump may be used to move it there. The temperature of a hot sample may be lowered by use of an online sample cooler. The sampling and analysis can be done at the command of an operator, periodically (for example, every 15 minutes), or continuously - providing an analysis result vs. time graph on a chart recorder, computer, or other device. For periodic sampling, valves (or other devices) can be switched open to allow a fluid sample stream to flow to the analyser and shut when not sampling.|$|E
50|$|In {{the plant}} design, the units are sized for the maximum {{capacity}} each {{may have to}} handle. Similarly, sizes for pipes, pumps, compressors, and associated equipment are chosen for the flow capacity they have to handle. Utility systems such as electric power and water supply should also {{be included in the}} plant design. Additional piping lines for non-routine or alternate operating procedures, such as plant or unit startups and shutdowns, may have to be included. Fluid systems design commonly includes isolation valves around various units or parts of a plant so that a section of a plant could be isolated in case of a problem such as a leak in a unit. If pneumatically or hydraulically actuated valves are used, a system of pressurizing lines to the actuators is needed. Any points where process samples may have to be taken should have sampling lines, valves, and access to them included in the detailed design. If necessary, provisions should be made for reducing high pressure or temperature of a sampling stream, such including a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> or sample cooler.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) {{is one of}} the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major {{distribution system}} facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high service pump stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 ground storage reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over 4600 mi of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 pressure zones to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major pressure zones (Central Low,North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary pressure zones (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondarypressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or ground storage facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight pressure zones are supplied from an adjacent pressure zone via pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> or single, small booster pump station. These pressure zones do not have storage facilities that establish their static hydraulic gradient.|$|E
40|$|In Uppsala CHP Plant, {{there are}} six {{pressure}} <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> to <b>reduce</b> the pressure from 15 to 3 bars, before six absorption heat pumps. During the process the energy is conserved but losses occur in form of exergy. The aim of this thesis {{is to reduce the}} losses of exergy. This can be done by letting turbines replace the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> In this thesis an investigation has been done of the conditions today, the conditions after the change from pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> to turbines and a comparison of three different types of turbine solutions. The three examined solutions are one turbine, several helical screw expanders and several small turbines in parallel with asynchronous generators. The six absorption heat pumps have been divided into two groups; one group of four and one group of two absorption heat pumps. An investigation of locations and space in nearby switchgears has been done for each group. Contacts with retailers of the examined turbine solutions have been taken to gather technical specifications. These technical specifications have been used to simulate the electricity production and the economical yield of each type of examined solution. The investigation shows that the best solution is the solution with several small turbines with asynchronous generators. It has lower investment cost (15 [MSEK]) and the best yield. The proposed solutions will have an installed capacity of 2. 65 [MW] to a cost of 5 601 [SEK/kW]. The electric energy production will be 15. 7 [GWh/year]. An investment is recommended to a future electric energy price around 400 [SEK/MWh]. Before an investment it is recommended to investigate how to optimize the regulation of the new system with absorptions heat pumps and turbines...|$|R
5000|$|An {{advanced}} {{feature of}} the new Meteor engine was an invention to <b>reduce</b> <b>valve</b> failure, which they decided was caused by lateral vibration. A special design of upper and lower valve guides, without a centre section, meant that the valves had no fulcrum and into the central section they fitted a forked rocker pressed onto a shouldered valve stem. This effectively eliminated the 'rocking' action of the conventional top-end rocker and Vincent top ends set a new performance standard.|$|R
50|$|As {{building}} height increases, {{the vertical}} height of its plumbing also increases. This produces a large water column {{and the weight}} of this water produces very high pressure {{at the bottom of the}} column. Normally, this would require very thick (heavy schedule) plumbing to survive the pressure. Fittings at the bottom of the column would need pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> to operate normally, and municipal water pressure would need to be very high to supply pressure to the top of the column.|$|R
