25|$|In an {{era when}} {{lacrosse}} was notably <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> and players wore no padding, all the while swinging wooden sticks, Lalonde was one never to back down from the toughness aspect of the game. His favourite tactic was to crowd his check and bull his way through opposition. Along with all his goals, the intensely competitive Lalonde also amassed 45 penalties and 356 penalty minutes during his career on the West Coast.|$|E
25|$|Étienne Cabet {{was born}} in Dijon, France in 1788 to a middle-class family of artisans. Cabet {{attended}} a Roman Catholic secondary school and continued his education, ultimately earning a Doctorate of Law degree in 1812. Cabet was not inclined towards jurisprudence, however, preferring the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of politics and journalism. Following the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, Cabet became active {{in the struggle against}} conservative theocratic monarchism, participating in political groups which espoused a constitutional and republican form of government under monarchical leadership.|$|E

During the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.|$|E

25|$|In 1918, Berenberg {{was named}} {{the manager of the}} {{correspondence}} department of the Socialist Party's Rand School of Social Science, which was in charge of conducting correspondence courses with adults around the country interested in taking courses in the social sciences. He remained in this position until 1921, working after that date as a teacher on site at the Rand School, conducting classes in English, History, and various topics related to Socialism. Berenberg remained an employee of the Rand School continuously until his firing early in 1936, an action resulting from Berenberg's factional affiliation in the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> internal Socialist Party politics of the day.|$|E
25|$|The Graphic Novel Gilmore By the Sea by Ed Cameron {{describes}} 1980s Nye Beach as a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> neighborhood. But by {{the twenty-first}} century, Nye Beach {{was on its}} way to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar Archway Place with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of Cozy Corner Confectionery (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.|$|E
25|$|Football {{was adopted}} {{by a number of}} public schools as a way of {{encouraging}} competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making {{it difficult for them to}} adopt <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> running games.|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich, readers know by this time, {{had a great}} {{appetite}} for conversation: he talked well, listened well; one of his chief enjoyments was, to give and receive from his fellow-creatures in that way. I hope, and indeed have evidence, that he required good sense as the staple; but in the form, he allowed great latitude. He by no means affected solemnity, rather the reverse; goes much upon the bantering vein; far too much, according to the complaining parties. Took pleasure (cruel mortal!) in stirring up his company by the whip, and even by the whip applied to RAWS; for we find he had [...] "established," [...] like the Dublin Hackney-Coachman, [...] "raws for himself;" [...] and habitually plied his implement there, when desirous {{to get into the}} gallop.

25|$|Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: {{published}} in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality {{work of art}} by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity – these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding {{of the mind and}} will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a man at a distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E
25|$|Gudas was {{thrust into}} a top-4 role on defense for the season, with Eric Brewer being {{moved to a}} more {{manageable}} 3rd pair role. Gudas continued to play his physical game that he had become known for in his first full NHL season. His <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> in-your-face game also landed Gudas in trouble at a few points during the season. The biggest incident involved Panthers forward Scottie Upshall squirting Gudas {{with a bottle of}} water from after he had fallen in front of the Panthers bench. Gudas would retaliate by smashing his stick on the Panthers in frustration. He would be ejected from the game for his actions, though the Lightning would still go onto to win the game despite being down a defensemen {{for the remainder of the}} game. Gudas also received a match penalty against the Dallas Stars on 5 March 2014. Though it was announced by Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman that there would not be any additional discipline from the league. Gudas finished his first full NHL season by playing three games in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 4 sweep by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E

25|$|The {{nearby town}} of Coulson {{appeared}} a far more likely site. Coulson was a <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnston was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person {{to be buried in}} Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been situated on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce that steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana & Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood {{on the banks of the}} Yellowstone River only a couple of miles from the heart of present-day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Scouting was {{for boys}} aged between 11 and 18. However, many girls and younger boys {{wanted to join}} in.

The solution for younger boys was the creation of the younger Wolf Cubs Section, which was trialed from 1914 and openly launched in 1916. Later, many of those who had grown out of Scouts still {{wanted to be a part}} of Scouting resulting in another section, the Rover Scouts, for those over 18 being created in 1918.|$|E

500|$|Rutherford's policy {{legacy is}} mixed. L. G. Thomas concludes {{that he was}} a weak leader, unable to {{dominate}} the ambitions of his lieutenants and with very little skill at debate. Despite this, he recognizes the Rutherford government's legacy of province building. Douglas Babcock suggests that Rutherford, while himself honourable, left himself at the mercy of unscrupulous men who ultimately ruined his political career. Bennett, Rutherford's rival and later Prime Minister, concurred with this assessment, calling Rutherford [...] "a gentleman of the old school... not equipped by experience or temperament for the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of western politics". There is general agreement that Rutherford's greatest legacy, and the one in which he took the most pride, lies in his contributions to Alberta's education. As Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome concluded her chapter on Rutherford in a book about Alberta's first twelve premiers, [...] "Rutherford's educational contribution remains his ultimate legacy to Albertans." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 30, 2006, {{before a}} crowd of about 100 people on the Naval Base San Diego waterfront, Hunter {{announced}} {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee to begin raising campaign funds and organizing supporters for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. He reasoned, [...] "his {{is going to be a}} long road, it's a challenging road, there's going to be some <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble,</b> but I think it's the right thing to do for our country." [...] He did not seek advice from party leaders before making the decision. The New York Times described the move as a [...] "surprise."

500|$|For the new pilot, Fox made {{it clear}} that they would not air the episodes in the {{widescreen}} format. Whedon and company felt they had to [...] "serve two masters" [...] by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release, but keeping objects in frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan full frame. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of [...] "found footage", with deliberately misframed or out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: [...] "...don't be arch, don't be sweeping—be found, be <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> and docu and you-are-there". Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera. This style was not used, however, when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the Firefly universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, David Boyd, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.|$|E

500|$|Female spotted hyenas have a {{clitoris}} 90percent as {{long and}} the same diameter as a male penis (171 millimeters long and 22 millimeters in diameter), and this pseudo-penis's formation seems largely androgen-independent because it appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. The spotted hyenas have a highly erectile clitoris, complete with a false scrotum; author John C. Wingfield stated that [...] "the resemblance to male genitalia is so close that sex can be determined with confidence only by palpation of the scrotum". The pseudo-penis can also be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. The female possesses no external vagina, as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. In the females, this scrotum consists of soft adipose tissue. Like male spotted hyenas {{with regard to their}} penises, the female spotted hyenas have small penile spines on the head of their clitorises, which scholar Catherine Blackledge said makes [...] "the clitoris tip feel like soft sandpaper". She added that the clitoris [...] "extends away from the body in a sleek and slender arc, measuring, on average, over 17 cm from root to tip. Just like a penis, [...] is fully erectile, raising its head in hyena greeting ceremonies, social displays, games of <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> or when sniffing out peers".|$|E
500|$|Clark began {{planning}} {{work for}} {{responses to the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A Washington Post story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador. Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was [...] "like cavorting with Hermann Göring." [...] Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his [...] "first experience in the <b>rough</b> <b>and</b> <b>tumble</b> of high visibility... and a painful few days."
