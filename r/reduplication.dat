5|$|Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes, Wagiman coverbs and {{nominals}} often undergo <b>reduplication,</b> whereby a part, or {{often the}} entirety of the root, is repeated. <b>Reduplication</b> can convey a multitude of meanings. When coverbs are reduplicated, the resulting derived coverb may involve added meaning components such as iterativity, duration or habituality.|$|E
5|$|When {{nominals}} {{are derived}} by <b>reduplication,</b> the added meaning is usually one of plurality. However, since both a dual and a plural nominal suffix exist, -giwu and -guju respectively, nominal <b>reduplication</b> is rare.|$|E
5|$|The suffix is {{sometimes}} missing, {{which has been}} interpreted as a zero suffix. Words with zero suffix are termed root verbs and root nouns. Beyond this basic structure, there is the nasal infix, a present tense marker, and <b>reduplication,</b> a sort of prefix {{with a number of}} grammatical and derivational functions.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is aimed at}} {{an explanation of the}} motivation for the com-position of Afrikaans grammatical and onomatopoeic <b>reduplications</b> within a cognitive grammar framework. It is illustrated that we can adequately de-scribe the formation of <b>reduplications</b> in terms of four valence factors, viz. correspondence, profile determinacy, autonomy/dependency asymmetry, and constituency. By claiming that <b>reduplications</b> in Afrikaans are motivated largely by metonymies like MORE OF FORM FOR MORE OF CONTENT, WHOLE THING FOR A PART OF THE THING, TWO PROCESSES FOR AN INDEFINITE NUMBER OF PROCESSES, and PRODUCT FOR PRODUCER, an indication of the relation of metonymy to grammar is given, thereby offering a psychologi-cally plausible and natural description and explanation of the motivation for Afrikaans <b>reduplications...</b>|$|R

5|$|Modern Mongolian is an agglutinative, almost {{exclusively}} suffixing language, {{the only exception}} being <b>reduplication.</b> Most of the suffixes consist of a single morpheme. There are many derivational morphemes. For example, the word bajguullagynh consists of the root baj- 'to be', an epenthetic -g-, the causative -uul- (hence 'to found'), the derivative suffix -laga that forms nouns created by the action (like -ation in 'organisation') and the complex suffix –ynh denoting something that belongs to the modified word (-yn would be genitive).|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for <b>reduplication.</b> There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic. While Pozdniakov {{has not been able to}} assign any phonetic values with any certainty, statistical results do place constraints on which values are possible.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use <b>reduplication</b> of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{acoustic}} properties of {{two types of}} reduplicative compound (full and tone sandhi <b>reduplications)</b> were examined to show acoustic evidence of assymetrical prominence relations (van der Hulst, 2005), {{in support of a}} hypothesis that Vietnamese <b>reduplications</b> are phonetically right headed and that tone sandhi is a reduction phenomenon occurring on prosodically weak positions (Shih, 2005). The results show phonetic evidence of prosodic constituency {{at the level of the}} bisyllabic word in Vietnamese. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Exact <b>reduplications</b> (baby-talk-like): bye-bye, choo-choo, night-night, no-no, pee-pee, poo-poo. In South African English, 'now-now' means 'immediately' (whereas an {{ordinary}} 'now' can also mean 'somewhat later').|$|R
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical <b>reduplication</b> of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
25|$|Hiligaynon, {{like other}} Philippine languages, employs <b>reduplication,</b> the {{repetition}} of a root or stem of a word or part of a word for grammatical or semantic purposes. <b>Reduplication</b> in Hiligaynon tends {{to be limited to}} roots instead of affixes, as the only inflectional or derivational morpheme that seems to reduplicate is -pa-. Root <b>reduplication</b> suggests 'non-perfectiveness' or 'non-telicity'. Used with nouns, <b>reduplication</b> of roots indicate particulars which are not fully actualized members of their class. Note the following examples.|$|E
25|$|After lowering, the A-not-A {{operator}} triggers <b>reduplication</b> on {{the target}} node. The <b>reduplication</b> domain can be the first syllable of the targeted element, the targeted element itself, and the maximal projection that contains the targeted element. <b>Reduplication</b> is linear and the A-not-A operator cannot skip the adjacent constituent to copy the next constituent.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other Bantu languages, which favor polysyllablic word stems, Nzadi {{consists}} {{primarily of}} monosyllabic stems. Bisyllabic stems are also present, {{but they are}} primarily borrowings or <b>reduplications.</b>|$|R

40|$|Translating Indonesian <b>reduplications</b> into English {{is not an}} easy matter due to the {{difference}} in morphological form, syntactic function and semantic meaning of <b>reduplications</b> in both languages. For example, the phrase ‘jauh-jauh hari’ cannot be translated into ‘far-far day’. This translation is not acceptable since it follows exactly the form of the original text, or only focusing on the morphological form, while the other two factors are disregarded. Thus, in assessing the acceptability of the translation, those three factors should be considered. However, the acceptability of the translation can also be checked by comparing the translations with the corpus. This article analyzes the translations of 3 Indonesian <b>reduplications</b> by 50 university students and compares their translations with similar expressions found in COCA and BNC to find out the degree of acceptability of the translations. The results show which translations are acceptable and which are not based on the frequency of usage.  </p...|$|R
25|$|<b>Reduplication</b> is also {{visible in}} the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a {{syllable}} consisting of the root's initial consonant followed by i. A nasal stop appears after the <b>reduplication</b> in some verbs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reduplication</b> is {{commonly}} used to express intensity {{as well as several}} verbal aspects (see below). It is also used to derive signs such as 'every two weeks' from 'two weeks', and is used for verbal number (see below), where the <b>reduplication</b> is iconic for the repetitive meaning of the sign.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to affixation, Igbo exhibits both partial and full <b>reduplication</b> to form gerunds from verbs. The partial form copies {{on the initial}} consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with o-. For example, -go 'buy' partially reduplicates to form ògigo 'buying,' and -bu 'carry' fully reduplicates to form òbubu 'carrying. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit <b>reduplication,</b> but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, <b>reduplication</b> in their case is not synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.|$|E

25|$|<b>Reduplication</b> {{of verbal}} roots {{suggests}} a process lacking a focus or decisive goal. The following examples describe events which have no apparent end, {{in the sense}} of lacking purpose or completion. A lack of seriousness may also be implied.

40|$|The {{abilities}} of the chorion, the allantois, the chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) and the yolk sac of the chick embryo to induce limb <b>reduplications</b> when grafted to the anterior margin of the embryonic chick limb were investigated.
