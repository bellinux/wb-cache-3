25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European <b>river</b> <b>lamprey,</b> three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. Vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|E
25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis). The endangered species include grayling (Thymallus thymallus), burbot (Lota lota) and bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus) and the non-native species are represented by the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{environmental}} factors on migratory activity of adult <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> entering the Kalajoki and Perhonjoki, rivers in Finland, for spawning was studied using correlation and regression analyses. Telemetric tracking of 60 individuals was utilized {{to study the}} migratory patterns and holding habitat requirements of adult <b>river</b> <b>lampreys.</b> The increases in the river discharge, wind forcing towards the river mouth and speed and magnitude of river water cooling had positive effects on the numbers of <b>lampreys</b> entering the <b>rivers</b> whereas {{the increase in the}} illumination intensity of the moon had a negative effect on their migration activity. Radio-tagged lampreys typically passed slow-flowing river sections as well as steep riffles during one night, and were holding in runs, glides and the lowermost section of riffles. Substratum dominated by large boulders (> 256 mm) was preferred during winter holding behaviour. The migratory activity of lampreys released in low (16 °C) river water temperatures was low. Lampreys tended to halt next to illuminated bridges, and we suggest that this behaviour markedly shortened migration distances. The passage efficiency through a natural-like fish ramp in the low-head barrier was 100 %. The results can be utilized in mitigation actions like river restoration, transplanting of adults, and improving passage and water flow regulation...|$|R

50|$|Adult <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> measure from 25 to 40 cm for the sea-going {{forms and}} up to 28 cm for the lake forms. The very {{elongate}} body is a uniform dark grey above, lightening to yellowish off-white on the sides and pure white below. Like all lampreys these fish lack paired fins and possess a circular sucking disc instead of jaws. They have a single nostril and seven small breathing holes on either side behind the eye. The teeth are sharp and these fish can be told from the rather smaller brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri) {{by the fact that}} the two dorsal fins are more widely separated.|$|R

40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of 30 production lots of charcoal broiled <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> was studied at three lampreys processing plants (A, B and C). Samples were taken directly after charcoal broiling and stored at 22 °C and at 3 °C. Lampreys were examined {{on the day}} of manufacturing and those kept at 22 ºC every second day for 6 days. Samples kept at 3 ºC were examined every fourth day up to 24 days. On the production day the mean aerobic plate counts (APC) in broiled lampreys were 2. 29 log CFU/g, 1. 88 log and ND (1. 67 log) in plant A, B and C, respectively. At 22 C the mean APCs of samples from plant A, B and C increased markedly within 4 days, and after 6 days were 8. 56 log, 5. 04 log and 6. 23 log CFU/g, respectively. The chilling and storing at 3 C remarkably improved the self-life of the product. The numbers of bacteria in charcoal broiled <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> from plant A were higher than those from plant B and C. No significant increase in APCs was observed during storage at 3 C for 24 days; the mean APC did not exceed the number 2. 80 log CFU/g in samples from any plant. Staphylococcus aureus was observed in two samples. No lactic acid bacteria, thermotolerant coliforms, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens or Listeria monocytogenes were detected.

A circadian rhythm was also observed in the heart rate during periods of inactivity, and this was correlated with an increase in ventilatory frequency or amplitude. A similar rhythm was not present in the sexually mature animals. Moreover, heart and ventilatory frequencies tended to increase during the spawning run. A whole number ratio between heart rate and ventilatory frequency was seen in only 11 of 425 recordings...|$|R

50|$|The town of Newmarket was {{incorporated}} in 1737, and was initially a shipping center, {{based on the}} <b>Lamprey</b> <b>River,</b> {{a tributary of the}} Piscataqua River. In the early 19th century, the power of the <b>Lamprey</b> <b>River</b> was harnessed by textile manufacturing businesses, which fueled the community's growth into the early 20th century. That industry then declined, leaving a distinctive architectural legacy in New Hampshire's Seacoast Region. The most notable aspects of the town's buildings is the use of stone, in contrast to other mill towns of southern New England, which predominantly used brick. The use of stone was not limited to the mills themselves: the historic district also has examples of stone houses, churches, and schools.|$|R
50|$|The Towy is a {{national}} draw for big sea trout (local name sewin), the seagoing form of the brown trout, Salmo trutta. These fish enter the river each {{spring and early summer}} to breed in the tributaries. The river is thought to produce more double-figure (10lb plus) sea trout than any other in Britain. Anglers and estuary netsmen have taken these fish to over 20 lb (9 kg) in weight. In summer and autumn there is also a substantial run of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In May the Towy has a run of the rare and protected twaite shad (Alosa fallax) and allis shad (Alosa alosa). The Towy also contains brown trout, eels, pike, and a variety of small fish species, and is home to brook <b>lampreys,</b> <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> and sea lampreys.The Towy has the distinction of having accidentally produced by far the biggest fish ever taken on rod and line in fresh water in Britain. This was a sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) weighing 388 lb and nine feet two inches (2.75m) in length which was caught in the river near Nantgaredig by Alec Allen on July 28, 1932.|$|R
