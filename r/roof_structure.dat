5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|The Home Farm {{buildings}} {{were built in}} the 1880s, split over two levels. To the south is a two-storey covered yard with a timber <b>roof</b> <b>structure,</b> used for the rearing of farm animals. On the upper level is the main yard, where to the east and west are two wings, one side of which housed the former piggery. The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E
40|$|Few <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> remain unscathed {{from the}} 12 th and early 13 th centuries. The {{relatively}} {{large amount of}} well-preserved early <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> in churches in Sweden {{is used as a}} point of departure to structurally define medieval Romanesque <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> and to make comparisons within North-Western Europe. Investigations of actual <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> along with study of written sources provide the basis for the study. The structures are defined and compared according to load-carrying system, included parts, centre distances, slope of roof, connection with wall, joints, outer roofing and decorations. We found many structural similarities and the structures seemingly belong to the same building historical context while also showing regional differences. The early medieval <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> of North-Western Europe can generally and concisely be described as common rafter roofs with tie beams, without longitudinal bracing systems and having strut beams and collar beams in different combinations to support the rafters...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} cruck {{hall was}} replaced by the present Great Hall in 1512, after Sir Alexander Radclyffe was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. The hall is typical of others built at that time in the northwest of England, although {{it is one of the}} largest, and is unusual for the period in having no wall fireplace. The hall has an elaborate <b>roof</b> <b>structure,</b> as in the similar Rufford Old Hall. There is a slightly later small room above the large oriel bay, which may be an early addition as at Samlesbury Hall.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} by Laing Construction {{at a cost of}} £112 million and was {{designed}} and engineered by ArupSport, whose design incorporated a cable-stayed <b>roof</b> <b>structure,</b> suspended by twelve exterior masts and attached cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design, and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design.|$|E
5|$|One {{civilian}} {{was reported}} {{killed by the}} aircraft strafing of the Tuškanac area of Gornji Grad. None of the three leaders was injured, but four people were wounded in the attack. The facade of the Banski dvori and nearly all its rooms were damaged, {{and a part of}} its <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> was destroyed. The first estimates of the damage inflicted on the building and its contents ranged between 2 and 3million US dollars. Apart from the Banski dvori, other buildings in the area sustained damage. Those included the Croatian Parliament building, the Old City Hall, St. Mark's Church, the Museum of History, the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments as well as residences and offices in the vicinity, including the residence of Swiss consul Werner Mauner.|$|E

5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above the van and asked to jump onto the van below. The crew removed the <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> on the van, and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{project was}} {{overseen by the}} Dean of the Cathedral, Monsignor Thomas McDonald.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the assessment}} of seismic vulnerability in timber <b>roof</b> <b>structures</b> has been applied to different cases of historical construction, with the main purpose of verifying its effectiveness and devising possible improvements. <b>Roof</b> <b>structures</b> were from a monumental building, two rural buildings with different destination that had undergone some rehabilitation interventions and a country church in a fairly degraded state. Some simplifications and some additions to the data collecting step of the procedure have been suggested by this work.

25|$|Javanese roof form is {{developed}} even further for {{the architecture of}} sacred places such as mosque. Javanese mosques developed the joglo roof form into an immense multi-tiered <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> supported by immense pillars and topped with a pyramidal roof form (reserved only for sacred spaces and never for houses). This multi-tiered pyramidal roof form — also known as tajug roof, is often topped with an architectural decorative element known as mustaka.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the centre}} posts were omitted {{to form a}} triple-aisled longhouse (dreischiffigen Langhaus, often a dreischiffigen Wohnstallhaus) that {{could be found in}} almost all of {{northwest}} Europe in the Early Middle Ages. Its <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> rested as before on posts set into the ground and was therefore not very durable or weight-bearing. As a result, these houses already had rafters, but no loft to store the harvest. The outer walls were only made of wattle and daub (Flechtwerk).|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{condition}} of the concrete <b>roof</b> <b>structure</b> on the main building brought forward major changes to the museum in 1990. To maintain a presence at York, the former York goods depot across Leeman Road, already in use as a museum store (the Peter Allen Building), was configured to display trains as if in a passenger station, and this together with the adjacent South Yard was marketed as The Great Railway Show. A further selection of exhibits formed the National Railway Museum on Tour on display for a season in the former Swindon Works.|$|E
