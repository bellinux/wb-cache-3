50|$|A quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> is an {{apparatus}} that converts circular motion (rotating motion following a circular path) into reciprocating motion (repetitive back-and-forth linear motion) in presses and shaping machines, which are utilized to shape stocks of metal into flat surfaces, throughout mechanical engineering. The quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is the foundation}} behind the energy of these machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{circulating}} balls travel {{inside the}} thread {{form of the}} screw and nut, and balls are recirculated through various types of <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> If the ball nut {{did not have a}} <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> the balls would fall out {{of the end of the}} ball nut when they reached the end of the nut. For this reason several different recirculation methods have been developed.|$|R

5000|$|The quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{was modeled}} after the crank and slider (arm), and this is present in its {{appearance}} and function; however, the crank is usually hand powered and the arm has the same rate throughout an entire revolution, whereas {{the arm of a}} quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>returns</b> at a faster rate. The [...] "quick return" [...] allows for the arm to function with less energy during the cut than the initial cycle of the disc.|$|R
50|$|For {{maintenance}} {{the weapon}} is field stripped {{into the following}} components: the receiver and barrel, bolt carrier, bolt, <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> gas tube, receiver cover and magazine.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{similarities}} between quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> {{there are many}} different possibilities for the outline of all forces, speeds, lengths, motions, functions, and vectors in a mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Recording <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> such as digital {{telemetry}} from satellites or aircraft, ejection {{systems for}} recorded media, or physical {{return of a}} sensor carrier with the recordings aboard.|$|R
50|$|During the early-nineteenth century, cutting methods {{involved}} {{hand tools}} and cranks, which were often lengthy in procedure. Joseph Whitworth changed this by creating the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the mid-1800s. Using kinematics, he {{determined that the}} force and geometry of the rotating joint would affect the force and motion of the connected arm. From an engineering standpoint, the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> impacted the technology of the Industrial Revolution by minimizing the duration of a full revolution, thus {{reducing the amount of}} time needed for a cut or press.|$|R
50|$|For regular field {{maintenance}} and cleaning, the firearm is disassembled {{into the following}} components: the receiver and barrel group, bolt carrier, bolt, <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> gas tube, receiver dust cover and magazine.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the kinematic analysis of a quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> there is a dynamic analysis present. At certain lengths and attachments, {{the arm of the}} mechanism can be evaluated and then adjusted to certain preferences. For example, the differences in the forces acting upon the system at an instant can be represented by D'Alembert's principle. Depending on the structural design of the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the law of cosines can be used to determine the angles and displacements of the arm. The ratio between the working stroke (engine) and the return stroke can be simplified through the manipulation of these concepts.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the RPK-74 has a {{modified}} <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{compared to the}} AK-74, which uses {{a new type of}} metal spring guide rod and recoil spring. The rear sight assembly, forward handguard and receiver dust cover were all retained from the RPK.|$|R
50|$|The {{processor}} {{does not}} have standard subroutine CALL address and RET instructions, though they can be simulated. The 16-register design makes possible some interesting subroutine call and <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> though they are better suited to small programs than general purpose coding.|$|R
25|$|The weapon can be {{stripped}} and re-assembled without tools through {{a system of}} cross-pins {{similar to that used}} on earlier HK designs. For cleaning purposes, the G36 dismantles into the following groups: receiver housing, <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> bolt carrier group and trigger group.|$|R
30|$|Saddle-node homoclinic bifurcation. The {{following}} proposition states some {{properties of}} system (33) for ε = 0. As mentioned before, {{we focus on}} the interaction of local dynamics with the global <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> (31). In particular, we want to understand the dynamics of the centre separatrix of p_a.|$|R
50|$|Breaking the {{mechanism}} up into separate vectors and components {{allows us to}} create a kinematic analysis that can solve for the maximum velocity, acceleration, and force {{the mechanism}} is capable of in three-dimensional space. Most of the equations involved in the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> setup originate from Hamilton's principle.|$|R
30|$|System (33) {{describes}} the {{flow in the}} interior of the sphere as shown in, e.g., Fig.  9, and it can be analysed by means of classic bifurcation analysis. Together with the information obtained from the global <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> we are able to describe all observed local and global bifurcations in (A,C) parameter space.|$|R
50|$|The NEGEV {{uses the}} 5.56×45mm NATO {{cartridge}} and is optimized for the SS109 bullet. Field maintenance involves stripping the weapon down to six main groups: the barrel, stock, bolt carrier, bolt, bipod and <b>return</b> <b>mechanism.</b> All parts, including the quick-change barrels, are fully interchangeable. While the NEGEV NG-7 uses the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.|$|R
40|$|An impact micro-positioning actuator. In {{one aspect}} of the invention, a {{threaded}} shaft is threadably received in a nut and the nut is impacted by an impacting device, causing the nut first to rotate relative to the shaft by slipping as a result of shaft inertia and subsequently to stick to the shaft {{as a result of the}} frictional force therebetween. The nut is returned to its initial position by a return force provided by a <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> after impact. The micro-positioning actuator is further improved by controlling at least one and preferably all of the following: the friction, the impact provided by the impacting device, the return force provided by the <b>return</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and the inertia of the shaft. In another aspect of the invention, a threaded shaft is threadably received in a nut and the shaft is impacted by an impacting device, causing the shaft to rotate relative to the nut...|$|R

25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.|$|R

40|$|Consider {{a setting}} in which firms {{randomly}} discover new ideas that affect their products or services and implement favorable ones. At {{the same time that}} firms are adapting their offerings, consumers are searching among firms for the best match. It is shown that implicit in these dual dynamics is an increasing <b>returns</b> <b>mechanism</b> which can result in one firm dominating the market in the long run.

50|$|The rifle {{consists}} of two main assemblies: the barreled receiver group and the frame, coupled together {{by means of an}} axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard.|$|R
3000|$|The {{emergence}} of an SNPO branch from the resonant saddle homoclinic is standard (see [24]), and based on three features: (i) the ratio of eigenvalues is perturbed regularly upon variation of a parameter (C), (ii) the separatrix connection breaks regularly upon variation of another parameter (A), and (iii) the divergence integral along the homoclinic loop is nonzero. Properties (i) and (ii) follow directly from the singular limit analysis in Proposition  3. Property (iii) follows from the slow–fast nature of the global return mechanism: the divergence integral computation {{is dominated by the}} passages along the slow branches S_a^±, which are both attracting and yield a contribution of the order -K/ε, for some K> 0, while the fast parts and the parts near the folds yield an O(1) contribution. While this argument does not prove that the SNPO branch is uniformly defined up to the limit, the proof of such a result is based on combining the local Dulac map of the saddle with a <b>return</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Since all properties are uniform and since the global <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> is sufficiently smooth up to and including the singular limit, the method for showing SNPO branches is valid uniformly in ε. □ [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Its name {{refers to}} the fact that its {{performance}} requires a typewriter, which is used on stage: keystrokes, the typewriter bell, and the carriage <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> provide a major component of the piece, although Anderson demonstrated that a musical gourd could be used instead of a carriage return. The typewriter is modified so that only two keys work; although many listeners have suspected that stenographers are enlisted to [...] "play" [...] the typewriter, Anderson reported that only professional drummers have sufficient wrist flexibility.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{reflect the}} {{coordination}} {{in the supply}} chain of perishable products with free competition, a single manufacturer and two retailers supply chain model facing the stochastic demand in relation with different prices and the <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> is established. The analysis shows that the profit of total supply chain without competition is obviously fewer than that with competition, and through the special linear model the paper employs the result, also gives the optimal price and order quantity in the coordination of the supply chain...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} explores how {{market competition}} influences a firm’s optimal organizational structure. For this purpose, a computational model of competing multiunit firms is developed in which unit managers and corporate staff continually search for better practices, while consumers search among units {{to find a}} better match. Organizational structure impacts both the practices at the unit level and the extent of knowledge transfer. An increasing <b>returns</b> <b>mechanism</b> is identified, which results in the relative performance of the centralized form being greater when competition is more intense.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an explicit}} <b>return</b> smoothing <b>mechanism</b> which {{has recently been}} introduced {{as part of a}} new type of pension savings contract that has been offered by Danish life insurers. We establish the payoff function implied by the <b>return</b> smoothing <b>mechanism</b> and show that its probabilistic properties are accurately approximated by a suitably adapted lognormal distribution. The quality of the lognormal approximation is explored via a range of simulation based numerical experiments, and we point to several other potential practical applications of the paper’s theoretical results. 1...|$|R
40|$|The ATRIAS agile {{humanoid}} robot, {{along with}} a number of other spring-mass walking machines, currently have two instabilities: one resulting from inertial forces on the torso which cause the robot to spin like a top, and another resulting from stiff ground collisions which cause chattering of the point-contact toes. This thesis presents a solution to these two problems {{in a manner consistent with}} the exacting design philosophy of springmass walking machines. A passive, compliant, line-contact foot is proposed with only 120 grams of added mass and a fully-adjustable <b>return</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

Also the analytical method {{which can be used}} to define the various position of crank and respective position of slider in quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} multibond graph {{approach}} for rigid multibody systems {{to model the}} dynamics of general spatial mechanisms. The commonly used quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> which comprises of revolute as well as prismatic joints has been chosen as a representative example to demonstrate the application of this technique and its resulting advantages. In this work, the links of the quick <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> are modeled as rigid bodies. The rigid links are then coupled at the joints based {{on the nature of}} constraint. This alternative method of formulation of system dynamics, using Bond Graphs, offers a rich set of features that include pictorial representation of the dynamics of translation and rotation for each link of the mechanism in the inertial frame, representation and handling of constraints at the joints, depiction of causality, obtaining dynamic reaction forces and moments at various locations in the mechanism and so on. Yet another advantage of this approach is that the coding for simulation can be carried out directly from the Bond Graph in an algorithmic manner, without deriving system equations. In this work, the program code for simulation is written in MATLAB. The vector and tensor operations are conveniently represented in MATLAB, resulting in a compact and optimized code. The simulation results are plotted and discussed in detail. Comment: Document prepared for National Conference on Industrial Problems on Machines and Mechanisms (2010), 8 pages, 19 Figure...|$|R

The flaps are actuated by a plurality of actuating mechanisms driven by shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators to vary fan exist nozzle area. The SMA actuator has a deformed shape in its martensitic state and a parent shape in its austenitic state. The SMA actuator is heated to transform from martensitic state to austenitic state generating a force output to actuate the flaps. The variable area nozzle also includes a plurality of <b>return</b> <b>mechanisms</b> deforming the SMA actuator when the SMA actuator is in its martensitic state...|$|R

The age-associated progression of this effect is modulated by the decay period of the model’s contrast representation, where the high-level behavior of either scanning broadly or locally is modulated by a single decay parameter...|$|R

We {{focus on the}} {{existence}} and properties of a folded singularity called FSN II that allows the emergence of MMOs {{in the presence of}} a suitable global <b>return</b> <b>mechanism.</b> As FSN II corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation for a desingularized reduced system, we prove that, under certain non-degeneracy conditions, such a transcritical bifurcation exists. We then apply this result to the case of two coupled systems of FitzHugh-Nagumo type. This leads to a non trivial condition on the coupling that enables the existenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of <b>return</b> <b>mechanism</b> in systems based on visual attention allows {{to generate a}} sequence of gaze directions (saccades) from saliency data. In this work we propose such a mechanism that seamlessly integrates with the Bayesian Strategy to attention. Taking into account a memory of attended locations, the requirement for consistency constitutes the drive for the generation of saccades. The general probabilistic model of active saliency is introduced, which is applicable to systems based on saliency maps {{as well as to}} landmark based systems. The model is further refined and validated {{in the context of an}} active visual search task. ...|$|R
