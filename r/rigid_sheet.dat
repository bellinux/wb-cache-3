40|$|Strong blast waves, such {{as those}} {{associated}} with gun fire or rocket exhausts, can cause serious physiological and/or structural damage. It is necessary, therefore, to develop ways in which to minimise this damage whilst still allowing the system that produces the blast waves to function normally. In an effort to develop such a system this study has examined, both theoretically and experimentally, the interaction that occurs when a shock wave is passed along a free unconstrained liquid tube before emerging into the surrounding atmosphere. In the theoretical analysis the problem was confined to the two-dimensional case and involved dividing the liquid sheet up into infinitesimal sections that were then regarded as small piston-cylinder systems, which were driven by the high pressure shocked gas behind the shock wave. The results from these one-dimensional systems were then used as input into a two-dimensional solution of the wave equation which predicted the gross changes {{in the remainder of}} the space. The experimental investigation involved laboratory experiments that examined, visually and with pressure transducers, the result of the shock/liquid interactions in two-dimensional and axi-symmetric cases, both between and external to the liquid sheets. The experimental investigation also included field trials that examined the pressure profiles of blast waves that were produced when a shock wave, which resulted from the ignition of a rocket motor, was passed along a liquid tube. From this work {{it was found that the}} high pressure gas, behind the shock wave, caused the liquid sheets to move perpendicularly from the line of travel of the shock wave which in turn caused expansion waves and compression waves to propagate out from the face of the water sheets, into the shocked gas and the surrounding atmosphere, respectively. These compression waves were then found to interact with the weak blast (produced when the shock, which had been weakened by the expansion waves, emerged into the atmosphere) in such a way that they produced a weaker blast field than would have been the case had the shock wave emerged directly into the atmosphere; the maximum observed reduction in the strength of the blast wave was 16. 4 dB. Experiments were also performed that examined the effect of using rigid sheets in place of liquid sheets. From these experiments it was found that the differences between the liquid and <b>rigid</b> <b>sheet</b> cases was a function of the size of the inertial barrier (i. e. the mass of the water sheet) that the water presented to the shocked gas. Consequently, it was noted that, in terms of attenuating the blast wave, the rigid sheets proved to be inferior to the thicker water sheets and superior to the thinner water sheets. However, when the spectra of the pressure disturbances were examined it was found that, with regard to the attenuation of the 2 - 4 kHz region of the spectra, all the liquid sheet results showed an improvement in relation to the <b>rigid</b> <b>sheet</b> results...|$|E

40|$|Uses of {{flexible}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) are restricted by plasticizer migration affecting material properties. Moreover, {{the use of}} phthalate-based plasticizers is being questioned worldwide because of their potential toxicity to humans and environment. Chemical modification of PVC structure {{is one of the}} most effective tools for reduction of plasticizer diffusion. In this work, a flexible dry blend based on cross-linked PVC was obtained using a difunctional amine, namely isophoron diamine (IPDA) as the cross-linking agent. The gel fraction was evaluated from insoluble portions obtained by means of solvent extraction; the efficiency of cross-linking in reducing the plasticizer leaching was evaluated by migration tests. Effects of addition of IPDA on PVC thermal stability were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The cross-linking reaction turned out to be responsible for accelerating thermal degradation.

40|$|We present {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} observations of domain wall motion in thin freestanding KNbO 3 crystals under applied electric fields. Since there is no substrate, there is no elastic clamping of 90 ◦ domains. We observe that curved and tilted 90 ◦ domain walls are the most mobile, whereas untilted 90 ◦ domain walls are resistant to field-induced motion. We explain this result in terms of two factors. First, the switching pressure on a domain wall (P 2 −P 1) ·E {{is determined by the}} relative electrostatic energies of the neighboring polarizations P 1 and P 2. Consequently, some 90 ◦ domain walls are immobile under certain field directions, leading to domain interlocking. Second, domain walls experiencing a high switching pressure move by a ripple mechanism, and do not move as <b>rigid</b> <b>sheets.</b> The tilted wall region in such a ripple has a polarization charge, and an associated depolarization field, which reduces the local switching barrier. An accumulation of polarization charge can result in a tilted or curved wall, as occurs at the mobile tips of 90 ◦ domain needles. Any increase in density of immobile wall configurations with cycle time represents an inherent contribution to fatigue. Uniaxial ferroelectrics, with polarizations parallel to the field, should not experience such domain interlocking. 1 I...|$|R
