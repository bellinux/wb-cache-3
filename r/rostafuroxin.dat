5000|$|Despite {{widespread}} analytical confirmation, some {{questioned whether}} or not this endogenous substance is ouabain. The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous ouabain detected other compounds or failed to detect ouabain at all. Additionally, it was suggested [...] that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of ouabain, could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous ouabain was the lack of effect of <b>rostafuroxin</b> (a first generation ouabain receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients. However, in a follow on analysis, where hypertensive patients were {{selected on the basis of}} their genotype, <b>rostafuroxin</b> lowered blood pressure significantly in the target group with a quantitative effect comparable to that of an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist. Further, there is mounting evidence from clinical studies that elevated circulating levels of endogenous ouabain, as measured by immunoassay, are associated with adverse outcomes in a variety of chronic cardiovascular and renal diseases. It may be noted also that work from experimental animal studies indicates that many of the adverse actions of EO likely involve angiotensinergic pathways in the central nervous system. [...] Accumulating evidence suggests also that EO is not simply a bystander entity (biomarker) but rather that elevated circulating levels of EO (with the exception of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia [...] ) appear to be a direct contributor to the adverse outcomes among the various patient populations mentioned above. This conclusion contrasts with the positive impression given in the medical uses of ouabain noted below. However, there may be a relatively straightforward explanation. With the exception of the CHF study, the most obvious difference is the absence of overt preexisting myocardial infarction or coronary insufficiency in the patients recruited in most all of the above noted clinical studies and its invariable presence in most of the patient populations mentioned below.|$|E
40|$|Background The Ouabain and Adducin for Specific Intervention on Sodium in Hypertension (OASIS-HT) Trial was a phase- 2 dose-finding {{study of}} <b>rostafuroxin,</b> a digitoxygenin derivative, which {{selectively}} antagonizes {{the effects of}} endogenous ouabain (EO) on Na +,K + -ATPase and mutated adducin. <b>Rostafuroxin</b> lowered blood pressure (BP) in some animal models and in humans. Methods OASIS-HT consisted of 5 concurrently running double-blind cross-over studies. After 4 weeks without treatment, 435 patients with uncomplicated systolic hypertension (140 - 169 mm Hg) were randomized to <b>rostafuroxin</b> (0. 05, 0. 15, 0. 5, 1. 5 or 5. 0 mg/d) or matching placebo, each treatment period lasting 5 weeks. The primary endpoint was the reduction in systolic office BP. Among the secondary endpoints were diastolic office BP, 24 -h ambulatory BP, plasma EO concentration and renin activity, 24 -h urinary sodium and aldosterone excretion, and safety. ANOVA considered treatment sequence (fixed effect), subjects nested within sequence (random), period (fixed), and treatment (fixed). Results Among 410 analyzable patients (40. 5 % women; mean age, 48. 4 years), {{the differences in the}} primary endpoint (<b>rostafuroxin</b> minus placebo) ranged from - 0. 18 mm Hg (P = 0. 90) on 0. 15 mg/d <b>rostafuroxin</b> to 2. 72 mm Hg (P = 0. 04) on 0. 05 mg/d. In the 5 dosage arms combined, the treatment effects averaged 1. 30 mm Hg (P = 0. 03) for systolic office BP; 0. 70 mm Hg (P = 0. 08) for diastolic office BP; 0. 36 mm Hg (P = 0. 49) for 24 -h systolic BP; and 0. 05 mm Hg (P = 0. 88) for 24 -h diastolic BP. In the 2 treatment groups combined, systolic (- 1. 36 mm Hg) and diastolic (- 0. 97 mm Hg) office BPs decreased from week 5 to 10 (P for period effect ≤ 0. 028), but carry-over effects were not significant (P ≥ 0. 11). All other endpoints were not different on <b>rostafuroxin</b> and placebo. Minor side-effects occurred with similarly low frequency on <b>rostafuroxin</b> and placebo.

40|$|Twenty {{years of}} genetic studies have not contributed to {{improvement}} in the clinical management of primary arterial hypertension. Genetic heterogeneity, epistatic-environmental-biological interactions, and the pathophysiological complexity of hypertension have hampered the clinical application of genetic findings. In the companion article, we furnished data from rodents and human cells demonstrating two hypertension-triggering mechanisms-variants of adducin and elevated concentrations of endogenous ouabain (within a particular range) -and their selective inhibition by the drug <b>rostafuroxin.</b> Here, we have investigated the relationship between variants of genes encoding enzymes for ouabain synthesis [LSS (lanosterol synthase) and HSD 3 B 1 (hydroxy-δ- 5 -steroid dehydrogenase, 3 β- and steroid δ-isomerase 1) ], ouabain transport {MDR 1 /ABCB 1 [ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1]}, and adducin activity [ADD 1 (adducin 1) and ADD 3], and the responses to antihypertensive medications. We determined {{the presence of these}} variants in newly recruited, never-treated patients. The genetic profile defined by these variants predicted the antihypertensive effect of <b>rostafuroxin</b> (a mean placebo-corrected systolic blood pressure fall of 14 millimeters of mercury) but not that of losartan or hydrochlorothiazide. The magnitude of the <b>rostafuroxin</b> antihypertensive effect was twice that of antihypertensive drugs recently tested in phase 2 clinical trials. One-quarter of patients with primary hypertension display these variants of adducin or concentrations of endogenous ouabain and would be expected to respond to therapy with <b>rostafuroxin.</b> Because the mechanisms that are inhibited by <b>rostafuroxin</b> also underlie hypertension-related organ damage, this drug may also reduce the cardiovascular risk in these patients beyond that expected by the reduction in systolic blood pressure alone. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Warm renal {{ischemia}} performed during partial nephrectomy {{has been}} found to be associated with kidney disease. Since endogenous ouabain (EO) is a neuro-endocrine hormone involved in renal damage, we evaluated the role of EO in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We measured plasma and renal EO variations and markers of glomerular and tubular damage (nephrin, KIM- 1, Kidney-Injury-Molecule- 1, α 1 Na-K ATPase) and the protective effect of the ouabain inhibitor, <b>rostafuroxin.</b> We studied five groups of rats: (1) normal; (2) infused for eight weeks with ouabain (30 µg/kg/day, OHR) or (3) saline; (4) ouabain; or (5) saline-infused rats orally treated with 100 µg/kg/day <b>rostafuroxin</b> for four weeks. In group 1, 2 – 3 h after IRI, EO increased in ischemic kidneys while decreased in plasma. Nephrin progressively decreased and KIM- 1 mRNA increased starting from 24 h. Ouabain infusion (group 2) increased blood pressure (from 111. 7 to 153. 4 mmHg) and ouabain levels in plasma and kidneys. In OHR ischemic kidneys at 120 h from IRI, nephrin, and KIM- 1 changes were greater than those detected in the controls infused with saline (group 3). All these changes were blunted by <b>rostafuroxin</b> treatment (groups 4 and 5).

40|$|Adducin is a heterodimeric {{cytoskeleton}} protein {{consisting of}} an alpha-subunit and either a beta- or gamma-subunit. In rats and humans, mutation of the alpha-adducin subunit {{leads to the}} stimulation of the sodium (Na(+)), potassium (K(+)) -adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -ase activity in renal tubular cells, increased renal Na(+) reabsorption, and, subsequently, hypertension. Ouabain is a hormone that is released by the hypothalamus and, possibly, the adrenal glands. In renal tubular cells it modulates Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity and regulates natriuresis. Plasma ouabain levels increase {{with the number of}} copies of the mutated alpha-adducin allele. <b>Rostafuroxin</b> is a digitoxygenin derivative that selectively displaces ouabain from the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase receptor and lowers blood pressure in rats and humans. In this short editorial review, we summarize the recent experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that contributed {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to hypertension associated with the alpha-adducin Gly 460 Trp polymorphism and its interaction with ouabain. We propose that a pharmacogenomic approach, as applied in an ongoing Phase II dosage study of <b>rostafuroxin,</b> will be a critical step in moving the adducin hypothesis from experimental and observational studies to clinical application. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} {{approach to the}} therapy of essential hypertension (EH) and the related complications has been pursued by our group {{with the aim of}} defining specific genetic-molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in sub-sets of patients. This approach is anticipated to have a major effect on the clinical practice, diagnostics and development of new drugs able to selectively target such mechanisms. The final achievement is the definition of biomarkers for identifying patients who more likely should benefit for a given therapy both in terms of efficacy and reduction of the adverse reactions. Among many, two mechanisms have been defined and addressed: 1) polymorphisms in the gene coding for the cytoskeletal protein, adducin; 2) increased levels of the salt and blood pressure-regulating hormone, endogenous ouabain (EO). Both alterations lead to hypertension, organ hypertrophy, negative vascular remodeling and increased cardiovascular risk by affecting the renal Na+ handling, through the up-regulation of the Na+–K+ pump and the activation of the Src-dependent signal transduction pathway. A novel antihypertensive agent, <b>rostafuroxin</b> (PST 2238), has been selected and developed for its ability to correct the renal Na+–K+ pump abnormalities sustained by the mutant adducin and EO-dependent mechanisms. It is endowed with high potency and efficacy in reducing blood pressure (BP) and preventing organ hypertrophy in animal models representative of both adducin and EO mechanisms. At molecular level, in the kidney, <b>rostafuroxin</b> normalizes the enhanced activity of the Na+–K+ pump induced by mutant adducin and antagonizes the EO triggering of the Src-EGFr-dependent signaling pathway leading to renal Na+–K+ pump and ERK phosphorylation and activation. In the vasculature, it normalizes the increased myogenic tone caused by ouabain. A very high safety ratio and the absence of interaction with other mechanisms involved in BP regulation, together with evidence of high tolerability and efficacy in hypertensive patients indicate <b>rostafuroxin</b> as the first example of a new class of antihypertensive agents designed to antagonize adducin and EO-hypertensive mechanisms. A recently concluded Phase II clinical trial (OASIS) has provided the proof of concept that such a compound is effective in the subset of patients where these two mechanisms are at work...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} and observations in humans strongly support an interactive role of mutated alpha-adducin, sodium (Na(+)) /potassium (K(+)) -adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and endogenous ouabain in Na(+) homeostasis and {{the pathogenesis of}} hypertension. The Ouabain and Adducin for Specific Intervention on Sodium in HyperTension (OASIS-HT) trial is an early Phase II dose-finding study, which will be conducted across 39 European centers. Following a run-in period of 4 weeks without treatment, eligible patients will be randomized to one of five oral doses of <b>rostafuroxin</b> consisting of 0. 05, 0. 15, 0. 5, 1. 5, or 5. 0 mg/day. Each dose will be compared to a placebo in a double-blind crossover experiment with balanced randomization. Treatment will be initiated with the active drug and continued with placebo or vice versa. Each double-blind period will last 5 weeks. The primary end point is the reduction in systolic blood pressure defined as the average of three clinic readings with the patient in the sitting position. Secondary end points include the reduction in diastolic blood pressure on clinic measurement, the decrease in the 24 -h blood pressure, and the incidence of end points related to safety. Secondary objectives are to investigate the dependence of the blood pressure-lowering activity on the plasma concentration of endogenous ouabain and the genetic variation of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of this hormone, and the adducin cytoskeleton proteins. Eligible patients will have Grade I or II systolic hypertension without associated conditions {{and no more than}} two additional risk factors. In conclusion, OASIS-HT is a combination of five concurrent crossover studies, one for each dose of <b>rostafuroxin</b> to be studied. To our knowledge, OASIS-HT is the first Phase II dose-finding study in which a genetic hypothesis is driving primary and secondary end points. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} is a debilitating psychopathology with unknown etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests the possible involvement of Na+,K+-ATPase dysfunction in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Here {{we show that}} Myshkin mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the neuron-specific Na+,K+-ATPase α 3 subunit display a behavioral profile remarkably similar to bipolar patients in the manic state. Myshkin mice show increased Ca 2 + signaling in cultured cortical neurons and phospho-activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt in the hippocampus. The mood-stabilizing drugs lithium and valproic acid, specific ERK inhibitor SL 327, <b>rostafuroxin,</b> and transgenic expression of a functional Na+,K+-ATPase α 3 protein rescue the mania-like phenotype of Myshkin mice. These findings establish Myshkin mice as a unique model of mania, reveal an important role for Na+,K+-ATPase α 3 in the control of mania-like behavior, and identify Na+,K+-ATPase α 3, its physiological regulators and downstream signal transduction pathways as putative targets {{for the design of}} new antimanic therapies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{usefulness}} of the results so far published on genetics of primary hypertension for establishing the clinical impact of candidate gene polymorphisms is weakened by the scanty information regarding: a) the functional effect of the gene variants of interest in humans; b) the regulatory genetic network (RGN) where the gene is operating with all the interacting environmental–biological factors and the respective hierarchical organization; c) the consistency between {{the natural history of}} the established pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hypertension and the new molecular mechanism detected with genetics; d) the limitations regarding the translation of animal data to human due to the differences among species of the genetic molecular mechanisms underlying similar organ function changes in the different species. Of course, not all these information are available for adducin polymorphisms. In this review, being aware of their importance, the evaluation of the clinical impact of adducin has been focused on data obtained together with the interacting genetic-environmental or biological factors. Adducin polymorphisms and endogenous ouabain (EO) were detected by a top-down approach in rodents after having demonstrated, at cellular and kidney level, that an increase in tubular Na reabsorption could underlies the transition from normotension to hypertension both in rodents and humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that adducin polymorphisms and EO may operate within the triggering RGN that initiates the increase in blood pressure in both species. The distinction between triggering RGN and the secondary RGN is important both to limit the level of genetic complexity arising from secondary changes, and to detect the molecular target to develop tailored therapeutic approach. The pharmacogenomic approach, both in rodents or humans, with newly discovered and never treated hypertension, may be useful to strengthen the “causation” of genetic mechanism. Mutant adducin increases tubular reabsorption: diuretics, because of their effect on overall tubular reabsorption, or <b>rostafuroxin,</b> because of its selective inhibition of the adducin and ouabain effects, may be used for this purpose. Indeed the pharmacogenomic approach with both drugs have provided data consistent with the role of adducin and EO. Taken together, all these findings indicate a clear impact of adducin polymorphism and EO in a subset of patients when the appropriate environmental, biological or genetic context is taken into account. The size of this impact is variable and affected by the context...|$|E
