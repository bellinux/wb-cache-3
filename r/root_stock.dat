In 1984 the then Labour Government paid growers to pull up vines to address a glut that was damaging the industry.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the effect of serial bud grafting and etiolation on rooting stem cuttings. Auxiliary buds taken from two clones of mature teak trees and were grafted on <b>root</b> <b>stocks</b> of 2 -year-old seedlings in 1998 and again serially grafted on 2 -year-old <b>root</b> <b>stocks</b> in 1999. The grafts were maintained under complete darkness to induce etiolation. The etiolated shoot emerging from the grafted buds were made into mono-nodal, leafy cuttings, which were cultured under mist for rooting. Serial grafting and etiolation did not affect rooting, but treatment with IBA in combination with serial grafting and etiolation promoted root formation on the cut-tings. All the control cuttings taken from lateral shoots after first or second grafting failed to root whereas, IBA-treated cut-tings rooted very poorly after first grafting. However, rooting response in IBA-treated cuttings improved significantly after second grafting. Thus, serial grafting as well as etiolation caused only partial rejuvenation of mature clones. The two clones differed in their response to serial grafting and etiola-tion for induction of juvenility. Clone FG 1 exhibited stronger rejuvenation, as indicated by more profuse rooting of the cut-tings after second serial grafting. Clone FG 11 exhibited com-paratively weaker rejuvenation, which was indicated by less profuse rooting of the cuttings under similar conditions...|$|R
40|$|Fine {{roots are}} a major pathway of C input into soils. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{quantify}} fine <b>root</b> <b>stocks,</b> production and turnover in natural forest and land use systems converted from forests in Ethiopia. The study was conducted in a remnant Afromontane forest, eucalyptus plantation and grass and cropland in NW Ethiopia. Fine root dynamics were investigated using three different methods: sequential coring, in-growth cores and in-growth nets. Soil cores for sequential analyses were taken in quarterly intervals, while in-growth cores and nets were harvested corresponding to 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, 8 - and 12 -month interval. Fine <b>root</b> <b>stocks</b> averaged 564, 425, 56 and 46 g·m− 2 in the forest, eucalyptus, grazing land and cropland ecosystems, respectively. The values decreased exponentially with increasing soil depth. In forest and eucalyptus, fine root biomass and necromass were highest in the dry season. Estimates of fine root production differed according to the method used. Fine root production based on in-growth coring averaged 468, 293, 70 and 52 g m− 2 ·year− 1. In general, land use conversion from forest to open lands reduced fine root production by 85 – 91 %. The turnover rate of fine roots was 1. 5 for forest and 2. 1 for eucalyptus plantation...|$|R
