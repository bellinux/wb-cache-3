From 1940, the livery colours were changed again, for example, from December 1941 the iron <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> covered <b>wagons</b> were painted grey-black (RA 7021) and no longer in green-grey, and, from 1942, most <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> only bore the letters [...] "DR", {{the name of the}} class district, a wagon number and a category letter.|$|R

5000|$|F-units were {{sometimes}} known as [...] "covered wagons", {{due to the}} similarity in appearance <b>of</b> the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> an F-unit to the canvas <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> a Conestoga <b>wagon,</b> an animal-drawn wagon used in the westward expansion of the United States during the late 18th and 19th centuries.

50|$|The first vans were weighed 12 LT, {{and were}} {{intended}} to have a mansard-style roof. However, this was altered to the constant-radius design before construction began.

Unlike the door-gate assembly offered in 1969 and 1970, the clamshell gate design required raising {{the rear window}} up into the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon,</b> while the gate slid downward and under the cargo floor. GM offered an optional electric motor assist for the gate on its lower-priced models after consumer complaints about {{the weight of the}} gate and difficulty many had in manually lifting the gate into locking position.Midway through the 1971 model year, all full-sized station wagons, including Brookwoods, received the previously optional Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission as standard equipment. Despite the series' economy roots and entry-level positioning, virtually all previous Brookwoods have been built and sold with an automatic transmission.|$|R

Because of the high speed and sharp angle, however, only the locomotive and one wagon managed to enter line 2; {{all but two of}} the other cars derailed. It seems that at least one <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> collided with some fuel tanks, triggering an explosion and a huge fire. The train burned like a torch in less than two hours. Yvonne Blondel was rescued by two soldiers of the French military mission, which pulled her out of the train wreck exactly when her clothes were ablaze. Other passengers died in fire or were crushed by the impact of the derailment. Those traveling on the <b>roofs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> were either thrown under the train cars and crushed, or were thrown into the snow. The same French survivor describes with details the scenes of the tragedy, including the emergence of looters, who robbed the travelers. On the spot arrived teams of rescuers - soldiers of the ammunition depot near the train station, railway workers, two companies of Romanian soldiers and two companies of Russian soldiers. The survivors were transported to Ia»ôi station, where they were given first aid.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{scarcely}} eight {{when it was}} believed that he could have reasonably laid claim to the above title. But he never did. He was a small boy, intensely freckled to the roots of his tawny hair, with even a suspicion of it in his almond-shaped but somewhat full eyes, which were the greenish hue of a ripe gooseberry. All this was very unlike his parents, from whom he diverged in resemblance in that fashion so often seen in the Southwest of America, as if the youth of the boundless West had struck a new note of independence and originality, overriding all conservative and established rules of heredity. Something of this was also shown in a singular and remarkable reticence and firmness of purpose, quite unlike his family or schoolfellows. His mother was the wife of a teamster, who had apparently once [...] "dumped" [...] his family, consisting of a boy and two girls, on the roadside at Burnt Spring, with the canvas <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> his <b>wagon</b> to cover them, while he proceeded to deliver other freight, not so exclusively his own, at other stations along the road, returning to them on distant and separate occasions with slight additions to their stock, habitation, and furniture. In this way the canvas roof was finally shingled and the hut enlarged, and, under the quickening of a smiling California sky and the forcing of a teeming California soil, the chance-sown seed took root and became known as Medliker's Ranch, or [...] "Medliker's," [...] with its bursting garden patch and its three sheds or [...] "lean-to's." ...|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, in Salisbury, Judge Vincent {{dispatched}} another patrol of 13 men {{to assist}} Dan Judson at Mazoe mine. They left at 10.30 pm {{under the command}} of Captain Nesbbitt. Their departure was noticed by Africans who sent their traditional fire messages at hilltops that warned others of approaching danger. Captain Nesbitt's party endured gun attack from the Hwata people and suffered injury of only one man and his horse. They arrived at the mine safely at dawn on 20 June 1896. The party of 30 men and 3 women departed from Mazoe for Salisburyat midday on 20 June 1896 with a <b>wagon</b> <b>of</b> 6 horses and 12 men on foot. The Hwata people commenced attack {{from both sides of the}} road after just half a mile but with no injury. The gun attack intensified when the party reached Chomukoreka near Vesuvius Mine. Every tree or rock appeared to hide a Hwata man and they were invisible because of the tall grass. At this spot, Troopers McGeer and Jacobs were shot dead, together with the horses belonging to Captain Nesbitt and Trooper Edmonds. Pascoe decided to sit on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> to look out for the enemy, and survived, except for a bullet that went through his hat. Bullets continued to hail on the sides <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> which was protected by metal sheets. There were about 50 Hwata men in pursuit with a wide variety of guns which included Lee-Metfords, Martini Henry's, and muzzle loaders into which they crammed nails and stones. The grass swarmed with black people, and Trooper Van Staden died after his head was blown off and Ogilvie and Burton were wounded. Another bullet ripped through the face of Burton and fell into the wagon to be tendered by the women. Hendrikz who had split from the main party, received a bullet which passed through both cheeks, taking with it a piece of his tongue and jawbone. When the men reached the Tatagura river, they failed to quench their raging thirst as the firing never let up. When the party reached open land, just before Gwebi river the Hwata people pulled back after they received information that reinforcements with a Maxim gun (nganunu) were to be sent from Salisbury. This plan had however not been followed through and Nesbitt's party was able to proceed to Salisbury. The Hwata people celebrated their success in driving white British people from their lands. Captain Randolph Crosby Nesbitt received the Victorian Cross from the Queen of Great Britain.|$|R

In such a way, an efficient mechanism <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> distribution is vital to the railroads, because it provides important operational profits and of costs.
