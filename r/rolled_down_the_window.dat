5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her.

2500|$|Shipman {{said that}} after arriving, {{she was aware of}} someone {{following}} her to an airport satellite parking area. When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. In a handwritten request for a restraining order against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months. Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being [...] "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship". Citing evidence of elaborate planning, disguises and weapons, police recommended she be held without bail.|$|E

Everywhere the same voice, its odd Eastern accent, which in anyone else would have irritated Midwesterners. You could follow without missing a single word as you strolled by. You felt joined to these unknown drivers, men and women smoking their cigarettes in silence, not so much considering the President's words as affirming the rightness of his tone and taking assurance from it." ...|$|R
2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Method Man was {{captured}} in New York City for marijuana allegations. His SUV was pulled over near the Battery Tunnel toll booths for having an expired inspection sticker. An unidentified source said, [...] "It was {{like something out of}} Cheech & Chong. He <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and <b>the</b> smoke would choke a horse." [...] The arresting officer noticed two blunts and a plastic bag containing marijuana in plain view. Upon further inspection more marijuana was found under the driver's seat. Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to young kids about the dangers of drugs.|$|R
5000|$|According to Lean Alejandro, it was {{the season}} of {{instability}} in a fragile democracy. He once described it as [...] "much more confused and confusing (period), where everything is falling apart, and everything is touch and go." [...] It was indeed true because on that 19th day of September in 1987, the life of this charismatic leader and martyr, was cut short in a brutal manner. He just came from a press conference at the National Press Club, where he announced plans for a nationwide strike against the military's role in government. As {{he was on his}} way to the Bayan office in Rosal Street, Cubao a van cut the vehicle that Lean was in, partially <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> by the driver's seat and shot him.

When Griffith attempted to exit the vehicle in a Chick-fil-A parking lot, Kincannon allegedly grabbed Griffith's arm and accelerated, to which Griffith <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in hopes a bystander would hear and intervene. She then proceeded to make calls to her mother, and attempted to make an open-line 9-1-1 call. The report further stated Kincannon [...] "threatened he would drive the car into a concrete barrier if the cops became involved" [...] and [...] "threatened to kill himself if Ashely left." [...] Griffith told authorities their relationship has [...] "a history of unreported domestic violence," [...] including threats of suicide and threats of physical harm to Griffith and her family.|$|E

5000|$|She {{received}} one Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for the 1943 film So Proudly We Hail!, {{but did not}} win. Her most successful film was Kitty (1945), in which she played the title role. In The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946), she starred opposite Burgess Meredith, to whom she was married at the time. Cecil B. DeMille cast her in three blockbusters: North West Mounted Police (1940), Reap the Wild Wind (1942), and Unconquered (1947). During the Hollywood Blacklist, when she and blacklisted husband Meredith were mobbed by a baying crowd screaming [...] "Communists!"

5000|$|Using air {{conditioning}} requires {{the generation of}} up to [...] of extra power to maintain a given speed. A/C systems cycle on and off, or vary their output, {{as required by the}} occupants so they rarely run at full power continuously. <b>Rolling</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> is often seen as the leading way to prevent this loss of energy. This technique, however, causes increased drag in the form of air resistance and the cost savings is less than is generally anticipated. Using the passenger heating system slows the rise to operating temperature for the engine. Either the choke in a carburetor-equipped car (1970's or earlier) or the fuel injection computer in modern vehicles will add more fuel to the fuel-air mixture until normal operating temperature is reached, decreasing fuel efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Back in Alexandria, Carl (Chandler Riggs) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) {{refuse to}} go with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to {{scavenge}} provisions for the Saviors.

He says he will try to convince Gregory to let them stay. Sasha says he should be the leader, instead of Gregory and offers to trade her talents in exchange for permission for Maggie to stay at the Hilltop. Jesus takes Abraham's gift from Rosita {{out of his pocket and}} gives it to Sasha. Jesus apologizes for Gregory again to Maggie once she comes in. On an empty road, Enid is riding a bike and stops when she sees blood. A walker surprises her, but suddenly a car hits it.

She <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and looked up. Almost immediately, the Hills heard a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds which they said seemed to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrated and a tingling sensation passed through the Hills' bodies. The Hills said that {{at this point in time}} they experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled. A second series of beeping or buzzing sounds returned the couple to full consciousness. They found that they had traveled nearly 35 mile km south, but had only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recalled making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road.|$|E

5000|$|Two U.S. Homeland Security Investigations special agents, Jaime Zapata and Víctor Ávila, were {{traveling}} from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City on an assignment for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As they {{drove through the}} northern state of San Luis Potosí, the agents noticed two SUVs following them down Highway 57, a four-lane, federal highway from Mexico City to Monterrey. The two vehicles that came up behind them were at {{a high rate of}} speed, and were described as driving [...] "aggressively," [...] according to agent Ávila. One vehicle passed the agents’ Suburban, while other gunmen started to fire at their vehicle, and eventually rammed them off the road. As one of the agents <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to inform them that they were U.S. diplomats, the agent recalls how one of the gunmen got off his vehicle, with an assault rifle in his hand, forced the door of the agents’ car open and shot point blank at them. When Zapata shifted the vehicle into park, its doors automatically unlocked. The Zeta gunmen pulled open the driver's side door and tried to drag Zapata out, but he fought them off, managing to re-lock the doors. The agents, however, managed to crack the windows to talk with the assailants and identify themselves. The agents hoped to reason with the gunmen—as many as 15 of them—who surrounded the vehicle. According to congressman McCaul, the agents said [...] "We're Americans, we're diplomats", and the response from the drug cartels was bullets.|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought that Clarkson did a good impression of Pat Benatar in [...] "Since U Been Gone".

The staff of Slant Magazine later ranked [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at number thirteen in their list of Best Singles of the Aughts, writing that the song proves Clarkson's powerful ability as a vocalist as well as her versatility as an artist.|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake <b>rolls</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|R

5000|$|A {{recollection}} of the 1986 campaigns in southwestern Minnesota merits comment on a bizarre incident that took place the evening before election day. Wrapping up the campaign on November 3, Boll, Jim Vickerman and several campaign workers hung literature for DFL candidates on {{the doors of the}} residents of the Okabena Towers, a high rise housing complex for seniors in Worthington. After finishing the top floors of the building, one of the campaign workers walked back through one of the lower floors and noticed that all the DFL literature was missing from the doors and, in their place, were brochures for Senator Doran Isackson, Vickerman's opponent. The worker found Boll, Vickerman and the manager of the building and advised them. They walked back through the upper floors and came upon Isackson removing the DFL literature from the doors, putting it in a folder and replacing it with his own. Boll approached and confronted Isackson, who then ran <b>down</b> one of <b>the</b> side stairwells of the building, with Boll and others in pursuit. When he reached the main floor, Isackson exited the building, ran toward and got into his vehicle. Boll ran to the driver’s side of the vehicle and asked Isackson to <b>roll</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> so he could speak with him. Isackson locked the doors, started the vehicle and rapidly drove it in reverse <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street. In the meantime, the building manager contacted the local police. Isackson was stopped for speeding {{on the way out of}} town, but the officer, unaware of the call in to the police at that point, warned and released him. An officer came to the Okabena Towers, took statements from Boll, Vickerman, the campaign workers and the building manager. Isackson was subsequently contacted by the police at his home in Storden and advised that the matter would be turned over to the local prosecutor. In the meantime, Vickerman requested that the matter be kept quiet until after the election so as not to be a factor in the outcome. News of the occurrence soon broke in the media and drew attention throughout the state. Isackson was subsequently charged with theft, but the prosecutor agreed to dismiss the charges provided he would write an apology letter to area residents, to be printed in newspapers throughout the district. [...] Once printed, Isackson’s letter proved to be a rambling diatribe that expressed his sense of frustration and feeling of being overwhelmed by the intensity of the campaign that Boll, Vickerman and other Democrats had waged against him, stating that, no matter where he turned, all he heard or read about was how bad his voting record was, and how he had failed the district as a senator. [...] This sentiment was echoed, albeit less openly, by other defeated Republicans in the region.|$|R
5000|$|The 1941 Mercury Eight got all-new {{styling and}} some {{engineering}} improvements. The Mercury now shared its bodyshell with Ford, probably to lower Mercury production costs. Mercury's wheelbase was expanded by 2.0 in to 118.0 in. There were many chassis refinements, including improved spring lengths, rates, and deflections, plus changes in shackling, shocks, and an improved stabilizer bar, {{but the old}} fashioned transverse springs were still used. The new body featured door bottoms that flared out over the running boards, allowing for wider seats and interiors. The car had 2.0 in more headroom, two-piece front fenders (three-piece at first), and more glass area. The front pillars were made slimmer and the windshield was widened, deepened, and angled more steeply. Parking lights were separate and set atop the fenders for greater visibility. Headlight bezels were redesigned. In all closed Mercurys <b>the</b> rear-quarter <b>windows</b> opened out. Front vent wings were now crank-operated, and in closed cars the ventilation wing support bars <b>rolled</b> <b>down</b> with <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> 4-door convertible, offered in 1940, was gone, but a station wagon was added. The woodie wagon's body behind the engine cowl was identical to Ford's, and produced at the company's Iron Mountain plant in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
