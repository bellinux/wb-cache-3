2500|$|C1s {{are similar}} in {{construction}} to whitewater kayaks. However, they are paddled in a low, kneeling position. [...] They employ {{the use of a}} one-blade paddle, usually a little shorter than used in a more traditional canoe. They will have a spraycover, essentially the same type used in kayaking. Like kayaks, C1s can be <b>righted</b> <b>after</b> <b>capsizing</b> with an Eskimo Roll.|$|R
50|$|The Buzz can be {{an exhilarating}} boat to sail and is {{claimed to be a}} safe {{starting}} point for asymmetric skiff sailing. The boat also has good performance, making it suitable for racing by more experienced crews. The Buzz has proven itself to be easy to <b>right</b> <b>after</b> <b>capsizing,</b> and it is straightforward to re-board the boat from the water, partly due to its low centre of buoyancy and self draining cockpit with its open transom. The open transom also means that the boat drains quickly on righting doing away with the need for self bailers.|$|R
50|$|A {{version with}} a self {{draining}} cockpit, the Mark II SD, {{was introduced in}} 1986. This was especially suitable for boats kept on moorings. However, the buoyancy sealed in the floor increases the inverting tendency and, when <b>righted</b> <b>after</b> a <b>capsize,</b> the trapped water causes instability. To help overcome this drain tubes through the aft tank were later introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Canoes {{are often}} made of fiberglass, kevlar, plastic or a {{combination}} of the three for strength and durability. They may have a spraycover, resembling a kayak, or be [...] "open," [...] resembling the typical canoe. This type of canoe is usually referred to simply as an [...] "open boat." [...] Whitewater canoes are paddled in a low kneeling position, with a one-bladed paddle. Open whitewater canoes often have large airbags and in some cases foam, usually 2lb density ethyl foam, firmly attached to the sides, to displace water in the boat when swamped by big waves and holes and to allow water to be spilled from the boat while still in the river by floating it up on its side using the foam and bags. Like kayaks, whitewater canoes can be <b>righted</b> <b>after</b> <b>capsizing</b> with an Eskimo Roll; however this requires more skill in a canoe.|$|R

"Quite {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} old experienced paddler, on 30 July 1927, I succeeded as the first European sportsman to <b>right</b> himself again <b>after</b> <b>capsizing</b> in a kayak.

50|$|The RS Tera is {{suitable}} for introducing newcomers to the sport of sailing, but {{is also a good}} boat to race. The boat is highly robust, and it is built with a self draining cockpit and is easy to <b>right</b> <b>after</b> a <b>capsize,</b> in addition to which it has a floating daggerboard. The boat is fairly small and light, meaning it is possible to transport on a roof rack, and that it is manageable on the water by younger children. The mast comes in two pieces, and the boom is padded.|$|R
50|$|The {{aluminum}} beams are {{plugged into}} the hulls, and the assembly is held together by a tightly laced trampoline. The trampoline consists of two sheets of fabric. Each sheet has a round rubber edge that is threaded into an aluminum rail connected to the hull. The trampoline is laced in the middle, similar to a corset.For safety the front beam contains a line to assist in <b>righting</b> the boat <b>after</b> <b>capsizing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The other {{goal that}} the F16 class was {{engineered}} towards was {{the ease of}} handling the boat by any singlehanded or doublehanded crew. By far most sport catamarans are designed for use in only one mode, either as doublehanders or as singlehanders, which makes flexible use of these boats cumbersome {{and in some cases}} even risky, as quite a few boats require the combined effort of two crew to <b>right</b> it <b>after</b> a <b>capsize.</b> This design goal forced the F16 setup towards a generally smaller and lighter setup so that an average-sized solo sailor can both handle the boat well while sailing and when taking it {{out of the water and}} onto a trailer. By increasing further the lightweight character of the design and incorporating several technological advances, the boat could again be made to perform well when sailed by two average-sized adults. In this respect the F16 class had found its own unique character and has set itself apart from its mentor the F18 class.|$|R

40|$|Within the Marine Industry {{there has}} been a growing trend in the {{production}} of modern cruiser / racer designs which have been designed with high performance in mind. The performance however has been achieved in part {{at the expense of the}} cruising orientated luxuries of the vessel. It is felt that this type of vessel is being marketed towards an individual who relishes the thought of close, fast racing but would also require the capability to take the family coastal cruising and undertaking longer passages. Because of this the seaworthiness and comfort of the vessel are important aspects. The aim of the project was to design a vessel of approximately 50 feet in length which would be a fast and competitive racer but also a relatively easy and safe to handle, family cruiser. To achieve this an investigation into the use of modern honeycomb panels within the interior and the use of a lightweight carbon mast was carried out. The aim was to increase the overall performance and stability of the vessel by reducing the weight and lowering the centre of gravity but at the same time not losing the luxurious feel of a high quality family cruiser. This was achieved by producing two vessels based on the same hull but with varying weights and position centre of gravity. A computer generated stability program (Hydromax) was then used to study the changes in stability of the vessel. It was found that the range of stability rose by 18 % for the lighter weight vessel and its ability to <b>right</b> itself <b>after</b> <b>capsize</b> has increased by 11 %. The performance gains were judged using a Velocity Production Program or V. P. P. and showed a potential speed increase resulting in an 18 second advantage on the original vessel over 1 nautical mile. The potential of repositioning the weight at the keel and increasing the overall sail area was also investigated...|$|R
