5000|$|At {{the end of}} driver's cab I a <b>running</b> <b>axle</b> bogie was mounted, {{while the}} other side got a single <b>running</b> <b>axle.</b> The four driving axles are fixed, but the two in the middle can move {{sideways}} for better running characteristics in curves.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{locomotive}} was derived from Be 4/6 12302, particularly the first batch, numbers 12303 to 12312. Traction was provided by two electric motors, one mounted in each bogie. The motors drove two drive axles. Each bogie also had an unpowered <b>running</b> <b>axle.</b> Wheels had between 2 and 70 mm play with the bogie frame.|$|E
40|$|Axle boxes (Fig. 1) {{support the}} weight of the car while {{rotating}} the axles. On occasion, problems such as foreign substances in the axle box cause abnormal heating, and may be a cause of critical accidents such as derailment. We currently check abnormal heating of the axle box by visual inspection using thermo-labels (Fig. 2) attached {{to the end of the}} axle that change color when temperature rises. But, with the current method, we can check such heating only after the train enters locations such as the vehicle maintenance depot. We thus studied the possibility of more frequent temperature checking system for the axle box heating while the train is running to reduce the risk of critical accidents. We thus started developing a system which detects the <b>running</b> <b>axle</b> box heating from the wayside precisely by using temperature sensors. This system monitors temperature of the axle boxes of passing trains, immediately informing the vehicle maintenance depot and the dispatcher’s office of any abnormal heating detected...|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{consists of}} four driving and three <b>running</b> <b>axles.</b> Each of the driving axles has its own motor. The power {{is sent to the}} axles using the Buchli drive. This gives them the characteristic asymmetrical look, because on the drive side the wheels are completely covered, while they are freely visible on the apparatus side.|$|R

5000|$|Volkswagenwerk Braunschweig is {{a factory}} site for Volkswagen {{automobile}} parts in Braunschweig (Gifhorner Str.), Germany. Production started on 1938-02-23 (before Volkswagenwerk Wolfsburg) for manufacturing steering components of „KdF-Wagen" [...] (VW Käfer) and tools for Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke in Dessau. Until today, only components for vehicles of VW Group (Audi, Škoda, SEAT und Bugatti) are produced, such as <b>running</b> gears, <b>axles,</b> shock absorbers, brake parts and all pedals.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new generation}} Gage Restraint Measurement System (GRMS) recently developed by ENSCO, Inc. and Plasser American Corporation for delivery to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Research and Development. The original GRMS technology {{was developed in the}} early 1980 ’s as a performance-based method to evaluate ties and fasteners. The technology has been adopted by many railroads, and commercial versions of the GRMS are being utilized daily throughout the U. S. A shortcoming of the current commercial system is that the unique split-axle system can derail when operating through switches and other track hardware. Since the split-axle is a main <b>running</b> <b>axle,</b> a derailment can have significant consequences. The new GRMS is designed as a fifth axle that is deployed from the frame of a track geometry vehicle instead of using one of the vehicle’s running axles. This results in a faster, more flexible, and safer GRMS design. This paper discusses the details of the new design and its advantages...|$|E
50|$|The Australian Marinas {{were built}} from CKD kits sent from Cowley in England, but used {{high levels of}} local content, {{including}} different <b>running</b> gear, <b>axle,</b> interiors, seals, seats, uprated dampers and mounts, uprated wheels and a higher grade of fit and finish. The Marina Six used a separate front sub-frame to support {{the weight of the}} Big Red engine and different front torsion bars as well as a pair of rear radius arms in an attempt to improve handling. Base model featured a 3-speed manual gearbox —sourced locally from Borg-Warner—to meet local content requirements. The Borg-Warner automatic was, however, the variation most popular in the local market.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{four-wheel-drive}} tractors {{with equal}} sized wheels by fitting a driven front <b>axle</b> <b>running</b> from output from a sandwich plate between the gearbox and rear axle casings. Because {{of the size}} of the axle this meant the whole tractor was raised considerably from standard height. However the traction gains were considerable (as with County and Roadless tractors) and Muir-Hills have been and are used for heavy draught applications.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel and axle motion (e.g. screwdrivers, doorknobs): A {{wheel is}} {{essentially}} a lever with one arm {{the distance between the}} axle and the outer point of the wheel, and the other the radius of the axle. Typically this is a fairly large difference, leading to a proportionately large mechanical advantage. This allows even simple wheels with wooden <b>axles</b> <b>running</b> in wooden blocks to still turn freely, because their friction is overwhelmed by the rotational force of the wheel multiplied by the mechanical advantage.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the stack are three pairs of brick and {{concrete}} stands being the foundations of the mill train, which carried the rollers and engines. At present, several fig trees have taken root and are growing over these foundations. There are remnants of the rollers and other machinery on one pair of foundations. To {{the west of}} the foundations once ran the carrier, which transported the cane from where it was unloaded into the rollers. It was a continuous belt of timber slats housed in steel chains <b>running</b> between <b>axles,</b> and remnants of these chains and axles remain. Beside the foundations is a copper tray, also reputedly from a nearby mill. To the east of the stack is the remains of a boiler. It was one of two which provided steam for the larger 50 hp engine which powered the mill. It was located beside the stack originally.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1998, Adtranz {{received}} a follow-on order for 400 more locomotives for medium-weight freight trains, the DBAG Class 185. [...] The double voltage Class 185 {{was meant for}} international operation, and was also dubbed Europalok. The basic concept of the <b>running</b> gear, the <b>axle</b> hung motors, the ester cooled inverters and transformer was maintained from the Class 145. In addition to the electronics for double voltage operation, modifications included the provision for {{the installation of the}} full variety of train protection systems in use in Europe, and the lowering of the roof by 105mm to fit the vehicle in the international UIC 505-1 loading gauge.|$|R
40|$|While a {{wheelset}} is centring {{itself in}} the gauge clearance due to the coupling of the wheel rotation and the wheel profiles, this effect is missing at independently rotating wheels. Therefore, a railway running gear with independently rotating wheels needs an additional system to ensure a good dynamic behaviour. This {{can be done by}} a mechatronic system that detects the lateral position of each wheel pair and controls the wheel rotation speed. The single <b>axle</b> <b>running</b> gears of the DLR Next Generation Train (NGT) are planned with independently rotating wheels. The necessary research issues for a realisation of the mechatronic track guidance for the NGT, a first running gear design and a MBS simulation study of the running gear are presented...|$|R
50|$|Traction engines {{began as}} {{agricultural}} vehicles and ignored springing or suspension on their main wheels. As light steam tractors developed from 1896 for road haulage though, locomotives with solid rubber tyres and suspension became favoured. The driving wheels of a traction engine are {{carried on a}} single <b>axle,</b> <b>running</b> closely behind the rear plate of the boiler firebox and carried in bearings fitted to the hornplates {{on either side of}} the boiler. Where springs were used, the cannon box bearing was favoured for maintaining the bearing alignment, with a further advantage of enclosing the axle away from the coal and ash from the firebox. Designs such as the Tasker Little Giant used another compensated suspension, where the tube was suspended from a single transverse leaf spring.|$|R
5000|$|A great curiosity in {{both the}} old Ratgar Basilica and the later Baroque church and cathedral was the {{so-called}} [...] "Golden Wheel" [...] (das Goldene Rad), a medieval musical apparatus, which was made in 1415 during {{the rule of the}} Abbot Johann I von Merlau and for over 370 years delighted the faithful with its evocation of the [...] "music of the spheres". It was {{in the form of a}} great star, consisting of 14 rays about 2.5 metres long mounted on a round metal plate; from the rays hung 350 bells. It was set and kept in motion by two ropes or cables <b>running</b> round an <b>axle,</b> by which the star could be kept turning and the bells ringing. It was lavishly decorated with glittering golden Gothic floral finials and vesica-shaped decorations.|$|R
50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts <b>running</b> to each <b>axle.</b> The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|R
50|$|The Klien-Lindner axle uses a double, or hollow, axle, one {{inside the}} other. It has a hollow axle (Hohlachse) on the outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a Cardan joint to a fixed driving <b>axle</b> <b>running</b> through it. The Cardan joint comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on the fixed axle and a hollow one on the outer hollow axle, each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way the hollow axle can be turned by the fixed axle. In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the hollow axle can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the fixed axle and the internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Cub was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} {{with a wooden}} framed, fabric covered, constant chord wing which was swept at 10° to move the centre of gravity aft and keep the nose short. The fuselage was a rounded plywood monocoque, with a built-in central pylon carrying an integral 2 ft (610 mm) span wing centre section. The outer wings attached to this centre section, braced with lift struts of the less-common X form from the lower fuselage longerons. The wing pylon raised the wing to bring it level with the pilot's eyes. Visibility from the single seat open cockpit was further aided by a small trailing edge cut-out. The tail surfaces had steel tube frames, canvas covered. The fin carried a generous, rounded rudder, with its lower edge above the extreme fuselage. The horizontal stabilizer was mounted at mid-fuselage with the elevators separated. The Canadian Cub had a conventional undercarriage with split axle main gear. The wheels were mounted on V-struts to the lower fuselage, with <b>axles</b> <b>running</b> inwards and upwards to the central fuselage bottom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{a railway}} track {{seems to have been}} in connection with mining in Germany in the 12th century. Mine passageways were usually wet and muddy, and moving barrows of ore along them was extremely difficult. Improvements were made by laying timber planks so that wheeled containers could be dragged along by manpower. By the 16th century, the difficulty of keeping the wagon running straight had been solved by having a pin going into a gap between the planks. Georg Agricola describes box-shaped carts, called [...] "dogs", about half as large again as a wheelbarrow, fitted with a blunt vertical pin and wooden rollers <b>running</b> on iron <b>axles.</b> An Elizabethan era example of this has been discovered at Silvergill in Cumbria, England, and they were probably also in use in the nearby Mines Royal of Grasmere, Newlands and Caldbeck. Where space permitted round-section wooden tracks to take trucks with flanged wheels were installed: a painting from 1544 by the Flemish artist Lucas Gassel shows a coppermine with rails of this type emerging from an adit.|$|R

50|$|The Prosser Twin Cylinder {{freight car}} was {{intended}} to revolutionize the transport of grain by carrying it in two enormous iron cylinders about 8½ feet long and 6½ feet in diameter, each revolving on an <b>axle</b> <b>running</b> through its center, {{at the ends of}} which were the journal boxes. Effectively, the car would possess no superstructure, and instead the cargo would be carried inside the car's axles themselves. Steel tires, flanged and fitted to the gauge of track, were put around the cylinders, which served as the wheels of the car. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company developed a system of air brakes specifically for this type of freight car.The prototype car underwent trials on the CB&Q Railroad, making six round trips of 200 miles each, carrying the grain magnificently and supposedly turning it {{out at the end of}} each trip one grade better than when it was first loaded. Railroad personnel were satisfied with it, since there was said to be no trouble in passing curves, frogs and switches. In addition, the car required less lubrication than conventional cars, and experienced significantly less rolling resistance due to a lower dead weight and a lower center of gravity. Due to the extremely large large wheel diameter, track wear was reduced. Due to its all-iron construction, the car was even supposedly fireproof. Despite all these advantages, the Prosser Twin Cylinder design was eventually deemed too radical, and was never replicated.|$|R
50|$|This is the 'classic' Mamod {{model and}} has been in {{production}} with minor updates and modifications for nearly 50 years. It is a model of a typical traction engine with a full-length canopy. The engine itself is an oscillating-cylinder unit, the same as the SR1/a which is based on the old MM2 unit. The boiler is longer than that on the SR1 although it is the same volume internally. The front part is an empty void into which, in the earlier versions, the exhaust steam was fed through the choke (it controlled the exiting steam not the inlet steam). The TE1a differs from the TE1 in having a reversing lever to control the speed and direction of the model, initially used on the MEC1 of 1965 and subsequently applied to the TE in 1967, whereas the TE1 was unidirectional only with an exhaust 'choke' to control the speed. The TE1 was claimed to cover a third of a mile in ten minutes on a single filling. Power is delivered to the back axle by means of a drive band running from a small pulley on the flywheel to the rim of one of the back wheels. This can be removed to allow the engine to run stationary or to drive a lineshaft and tools. The front axle of the model is mounted on a central pivot with a simple copper stub spring which provides a crude form of suspension. It is also steerable, by means of a shaft <b>running</b> from the <b>axle</b> up inside the chimney (later models post 67). Early models did not use the later control rod for steering but used a rod mounted directly into a hole in the early model square axle box. Both designs could be screwed down to lock the wheels in a fixed position. A control rod can be attached to the top of this shaft with a wooden handle on top to allow the operator to steer the model as it moves. The TE1/A has a green boiler (this green has varied over the years from apple green to a dark brunswick green, similar to GWR locomotives), red spoked wheels and flywheel, a white/cream coloured canopy and a black firebox/smokebox/chimney. It is also available in a distinctive alternative paint scheme, with a polished brass boiler and maroon wheels. Other limited edition models have been produced in the last decade using blue or black paint work as well of variations of the colours mentioned already.|$|R
