2500|$|Gulf gravimeter: One of {{the last}} and most {{accurate}} pendulum gravimeters was the apparatus developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development Co. [...] It used two pendulums made of fused quartz, each [...] in length with a period of 0.89 second, swinging on pyrex knife edge pivots, 180° out of phase. They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror {{at the top of}} the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision crystal oscillator calibrated against the WWV <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal.</b> This instrument was accurate to within (0.3–0.5)×10−7 (30–50 microgals or 3–5nm/s2). It was used into the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|All {{chronometers}} {{and watches}} should be checked regularly with a <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal.</b> [...] Times and frequencies of radio time signals {{are listed in}} publications such as Radio Navigational Aids.|$|E
5000|$|WWVH is the callsign of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's shortwave <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> {{station in}} Kekaha, {{on the island}} of Kauai in the state of Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|With the {{commencement}} of <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> (in Britain from 1924), time balls gradually became obsolete and many were demolished in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|Radio-controlled clocks are quartz clocks {{which are}} {{periodically}} synchronized with the UTC atomic clock <b>time</b> scale via <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> broadcast by dedicated {{stations around the}} world. They are distinct from clock radios.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} {{interested}} in timekeeping via radio signals and in 1913 Synchronome started to manufacture the Horophone, a device for capturing <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> He also suggested to the BBC that they should transmit a <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> and in 1924 the Greenwich pips were first broadcast.|$|R
50|$|The telegraphic {{distribution}} of time signals was made obsolete {{by the use}} of AM, FM, shortwave radio, Internet Network Time Protocol servers as well as atomic clocks in satellite navigation systems. Since 1905 time signals have been transmitted by radio. There are dedicated <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations around the world.|$|E
5000|$|The {{format of}} the service {{is similar to that}} of <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> services. At set {{intervals}} (e.g. ten seconds) a voice announces (for example) [...] "At the third stroke, the time will be twelve forty-six and ten seconds...", with three beeps following. Some countries have sponsored time announcements and include the sponsor's name in the message.|$|E
5000|$|Many shortwave <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> {{services}} provide {{speaking clock}} services, such as WWV (voiced by John Doyle) and WWVH (voiced by Jane Barbe), {{operated by the}} National Institute of Standards and Technology from the United States of America. To avoid disruption with devices that rely on the accurate timings and placement of the service tones from the radio, the voice recording is [...] "notched" [...] clear {{of some of the}} tones.|$|E
50|$|Hinks {{published}} two textbooks on cartography and surveying, Map Projections (1912) and Maps and Survey (1913). After the war, he {{was involved}} in the development of <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> and in geodesy in general, two interests that are very much linked with astronomy.|$|R
5000|$|During the Second World War, the {{equatorial}} mount and transit circle were lost. After the war, a pendulum clock was installed and regulated by <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> from other timekeeping centres. Timing accuracy gradually improved {{from the daily}} engineering tolerance of {{a few seconds to}} one-fifth of a second.|$|R
5000|$|Quartz crystal marine {{chronometers}} {{have replaced}} spring-driven chronometers aboard many ships {{because of their}} greater accuracy. [...] They are maintained on GMT directly from <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> [...] This eliminates chronometer error and watch error corrections. [...] Should the second hand be in error by a readable amount, it can be reset electrically.|$|R
50|$|Vestigal {{sideband}} transmits {{the carrier}} and one complete side-band, but filters out the redundant side-band. It is {{a compromise between}} AM and SSB, allowing simple receivers to be used but requiring almost as much transmitter power as AM. One advantage is that only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used. It {{can be heard in}} the transmission of certain <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations. Vestigial sideband is used for over the air Television Broadcasts both analog and digital.|$|E
50|$|Because digital clocks can be {{very small}} and {{inexpensive}} devices that enhance the popularity of product designs, they are often incorporated into all kinds of devices such as cars, radios, televisions, microwave ovens, standard ovens, computers and cell phones. Sometimes their usefulness is disputed: a common complaint is that when time has to be set to Daylight Saving Time, many household clocks have to be readjusted. The incorporation of automatic synchronisation by a <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> is reducing this problem (see Radio clock).|$|E
50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> watches are {{a type of}} {{electronic}} quartz watch which synchronizes (time transfers) its time with an external time source such as in atomic clocks, time signals from GPS navigation satellites, the German DCF77 signal in Europe, WWVB in the US, and others. Movements of this type may — among others — synchronize {{the time of day}} and the date, the leap-year status, and the state of daylight saving time (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> allowed {{accurate}} and rapid distribution of <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> beyond {{the range of}} the telegraph or visual signals. This was of particular value in surveying remote areas, where <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> allowed accurate determination of longitude. In the summer of 1914, a survey party at Quinze Dam in the Ottawa River watershed attempted to receive <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted from Kingston; however, signals were not resolvable and the <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> from Arlington, Virginia was used instead.|$|R
25|$|Navigational {{satellites}} are satellites {{which use}} <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted to enable mobile receivers {{on the ground}} to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of his death, time balls were in use on every {{inhabited}} continent. Although rendered obsolete on the introduction of <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> operational examples survive atop the Royal Observatories at Greenwich and Cape Town, at Sydney Observatory, at Lyttelton in New Zealand, on Nelson's Monument on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, and at Deal.|$|R
50|$|Since 2009, Citizen has {{developed}} Eco-Drive Concept Models as technology demonstration and marketing tools. These Eco-Drive Concept Models are generally shown at exhibitions and produced in limited editions.The Concept Model 2011 was the Eco-Drive SATELLITE WAVE {{that has a}} movement that can receive time synchronization signals from GPS satellites. This makes radio-controlled timing possible in remote areas that are not serviced by land based <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations.In 2012 Citizen announced the Eco-Drive RING Concept Model. This watch features a ring-shaped solar cell surrounding the watch case sidewall.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} problem, many devices {{designed}} {{to operate on}} household electricity incorporate a battery backup to maintain the time during power outages and during times of disconnection from the power supply. More recently, some devices incorporate a method for automatically setting the time, such as using a broadcast <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> from an atomic clock, getting the time from an existing satellite television or computer connection, or by being set at the factory and then maintaining the time from then on with a quartz movement powered by an internal rechargeable battery.Commercial digital clocks are typically more reliable than consumer clocks. Multi-decade backup batteries {{can be used to}} maintain time during power loss.|$|E
5000|$|Gulf gravimeter: One of {{the last}} and most {{accurate}} pendulum gravimeters was the apparatus developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development Co. [...] It used two pendulums made of fused quartz, each 10.7 in in length with a period of 0.89 second, swinging on pyrex knife edge pivots, 180° out of phase. They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror {{at the top of}} the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision crystal oscillator calibrated against the WWV <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal.</b> This instrument was accurate to within (0.3-0.5)×10−7 (30-50 microgals or 3-5 nm/s2). It was used into the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Junghans {{offered the}} first {{radio-controlled}} wristwatch, the MEGA 1. In this type, the watch's quartz oscillator {{is set to}} the correct time daily by coded <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> broadcast by government-operated time stations such as JJY, MSF, RBU, DCF77, and WWVB, received by a radio receiver in the watch. This allows the watch {{to have the same}} long-term accuracy as the atomic clocks which control the <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> Recent models are capable of receiving synchronization <b>signals</b> from various <b>time</b> stations worldwide.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Bathys Hawaii {{introduced}} their Cesium 133 Atomic Watch {{the first}} watch to keep time with an internal atomic clock. Unlike the radio watches described above, which achieve atomic clock accuracy with quartz clock circuits which are corrected by <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> received from government atomic clocks, this watch contains a tiny cesium atomic clock on a chip. It {{is reported to}} keep time to an accuracy of one second in 1000 years.|$|R
50|$|With {{knowledge}} of the camera’s latitude/longitude position and its elevation above sea level, both obtainable from USGS (U. S. Geological Survey) 7½-minute quadrangle maps (before the days of Global Positioning System devices), comparison of the track with the star background could define the satellite’s successive positions. To correlate those positions with times, breaks in the lines were created by interrupting the exposures at times known by their relationship with <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> broadcast by the U. S. National Bureau of Standards.|$|R
50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> {{stations}} {{broadcast the}} time in both audible and machine readable time code form {{that can be used}} as references for radio clocks and radio-controlled watches.The audio portions of the shortwave WWV and WWVH broadcasts can also be heard by telephone. The time announcements are normally delayed by less than 30 ms when using land lines from within the continental United States, and the stability (delay variation) is generally < 1 ms. When mobile phones are used, the delays are often more than 100 ms due to the multiple access methods used to share cell channels. In rare instances when the telephone connection is made by satellite, the time is delayed by 250 to 500 ms.To hear these broadcasts, dial (303) 499-7111 for WWV (Colorado), and (808) 335-4363 for WWVH (Hawaii). Callers are disconnected after 2 minutes. These are not toll-free numbers; callers outside the local calling area are charged for the call at regular long-distance rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{considerably}} more popular method was (and still is) {{to use an}} accurate timepiece to directly measure the time of a sextant sight. The need for accurate navigation {{led to the development}} of progressively more accurate chronometers in the 18th century. (See John Harrison) Today, time is measured with a chronometer, a quartz watch, a shortwave <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> broadcast from an atomic clock, or the time displayed on a GPS. A quartz wristwatch normally keeps time within a half-second per day. If it is worn constantly, keeping it near body heat, its rate of drift can be measured with the radio, and by compensating for this drift, a navigator can keep time to better than a second per month. Traditionally, a navigator checked his chronometer from his sextant, at a geographic marker surveyed by a professional astronomer. This is now a rare skill, and most harbour masters cannot locate their harbour's marker.|$|E
50|$|A {{time signal}} is a visible, audible, mechanical, or {{electronic}} signal {{used as a}} reference to determine the time of day. Church bells or voices announcing hours of prayer gave way to automatically operated s on public clocks; however, audible signals (even signal guns) have limited range. Busy ports used a visual signal, the dropping of a ball, to allow mariners to check the chronometers used for navigation. The advent of electrical telegraphs allowed widespread and precise distribution of time signals from central observatories. Railways {{were among the first}} customers for time signals, which allowed synchronization of their operations over wide geographic areas. Special purpose <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations transmit a signal that allows automatic synchronization of clocks, and commercial broadcasters still include time signals in their programming. Today, GPS navigation radio signals are used to precisely distribute time signals over much of the world. There are many commercially available radio controlled clocks available to accurately indicate the local time, both for business and residential use. Computers often set their time from an internet atomic clock source. Where this is not available, a locally connected GPS receiver can precisely set the time using a software application. There are several such applications available to download from the internet.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} Greenwich meridians were located via an astronomic {{observation}} {{from the surface}} of the Earth, oriented via a plumb line along the direction of gravity at the surface. This astronomic Greenwich meridian was disseminated around the world, first via the lunar distance method, then by chronometers carried on ships, then via telegraph lines carried by submarine communications cables, then via <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> One remote longitude ultimately based on the Greenwich meridian using these methods was that of the North American Datum 1927 or NAD27, an ellipsoid whose surface best matches mean sea level under the United States.|$|R
5000|$|As with TAI, UTC is {{only known}} {{with the highest}} {{precision}} in retrospect. Users who require an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates an approximation using techniques such as GPS or <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> Such approximations are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory. The time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations; later corrections may be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating laboratories. (See the article on International Atomic Time for details.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1920 and 1921 Curlewis was {{involved}} with the Government Astronomer of South Australia, Dodwell, in determinations to fix positions for marking of the West Australian border {{on the ground with}} the South Australian border at Deakin, Western Australia. In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV Bambra to Wyndham, where they were guided by M.P. Durack to a point on Rosewood station near Argyle Downs close to the 129th meridian east longitude (129° east). They used the relatively new technology of the day, wireless <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> and other methods to fix a position for the Northern Territory border with Western Australia.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 {{he led a}} team of Finnish {{scientists}} to Brazil to measure the distance between South America and Africa. (T.J. Kukkamäki {{was the leader of}} the team sent to, then, Gold Coast, Africa.) They succeed with measurements using a method based on observing from points in Brazil and Africa. They used the solar eclipse happening that year, which was visible in both Africa and South America. Using long focus film cameras and the most accurate available <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> for the solar eclipse measurements, they were able to calculate the distance between Africa and South America to a higher accuracy than ever before: 141 m.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, many information-based <b>radio</b> {{stations}} broadcast <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> {{at the top}} of {{the hour}} and a speaking clock service is also available. However, the former VNG dedicated <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> service has been discontinued.|$|R
50|$|Ships {{and boats}} {{commonly}} use electronic aids to navigation, mostly the Global Navigation Satellite Systems. However celestial navigation, which requires {{the use of}} a precise chronometer, is still a requirement for certain international mariner certifications such as Officer in Charge of Navigational Watch, and Master and Chief Mate deck officers, and supplements offshore yachtmasters on long-distance private cruising yachts. Modern marine chronometers can be based on quartz clocks that are corrected periodically by GPS <b>signals</b> or <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> (see <b>radio</b> clock). These quartz chronometers are not always the most accurate quartz clocks when no signal is received, and their signals can be lost or blocked. However, there are quartz movements, even in wrist watches such as the Omega Marine Chronometer, that are accurate to within 5 or 20 seconds per year.At least one quartz chronometer made for advanced navigation utilizes multiple quartz crystals which are corrected by a computer using an average value, in addition to GPS <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> corrections.|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a {{slave clock}} is a clock that depends for its accuracy on another clock, a master clock. Many modern clocks are synchronized, either through the Internet or by <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic clocks in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision clocks can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. Slave clock synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the slave clock signal to a signal received from the master clock. To adjust for the transit <b>time</b> of the <b>signal</b> from the master clock to the slave clock, the phase of the slave clock may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from the master clock so that both clocks are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both clocks, at the output of the clocks, occur simultaneously.|$|R

They used wireless <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> and other methods to fix a position for the Northern Territory border with Western Australia. These early determinations led to the 1968 agreement for the formation of Surveyor Generals Corner and a fact that not many will know, that the WA border is not as straight as you may think. In fact at the 26th parallel south latitude (26° south) latitude there is an approximately 127 metre [...] "sideways" [...] section of the WA/NT border, which runs east-west.|$|R
50|$|A radio {{clock is}} a clock that {{automatically}} synchronizes itself {{by means of}} government <b>radio</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> received by a radio receiver. Many retailers market radio clocks inaccurately as atomic clocks; although the radio signals they receive originate from atomic clocks, they are not atomic clocks themselves. Normal low cost consumer grade receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> and use narrow band receivers (with 10 Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite loopstick antennas and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine {{the beginning of a}} second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality quartz clocks for timekeeping between daily synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.Instrument grade time receivers provide higher accuracy. Such devices incur a transit delay of approximately 1 ms for every 300 kilometres (186 mi) of distance from the radio transmitter. Many governments operate transmitters for time-keeping purposes.|$|R
