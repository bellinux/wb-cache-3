5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to <b>recombine.</b> Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to <b>recombine</b> with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (exciton). Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they <b>recombine</b> through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E

5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to <b>recombine</b> into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to <b>recombine</b> into bound states—atoms—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.|$|E

The river divides south east of the city, one branch flowing though the city, the other around {{the position of the}} former walls. The two branches rejoin or are linked several times, but finally <b>recombine</b> around the town of Fordwich, {{on the edge of the}} marshland north east of the city. The Stour is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used. Punts and rowed river boats are available for hire in Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|Since 1778, this taxon {{has been}} <b>recombined</b> {{numerous}} times into different genera and subgenera. Nearly {{a century after}} Born's description, in 1877, the Swedish naturalist Otto Andreas Lowson Mörch proposed a new combination and transferred this taxon to the genus Cassis and subgenus Semicassis. In 1944, the American malacologist William James Clench <b>recombined</b> the species as Phalium (Semicassis) granulatum, and five years later the Brazilian naturalist Frederico Lange de Morretes <b>recombined</b> it as Semicassis granulatum. American malacologist Clifton S. Weaver reallocated it in the subgenus Tylocassis in 1962, though American malacologist R. Tucker Abbott <b>recombined</b> it as Phalium (Tylocassis) granulatum six years later. American malacologist Andrew C. Miller <b>recombined</b> it as Phalium granulatum in 1983, and German malacologist Kurt Kreipl <b>recombined</b> it as Semicassis (Semicassis) granulata in 1997.

5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to <b>recombine,</b> the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to <b>recombine</b> and assault him.|$|E
5|$|The game then jumps {{five years}} forward. Nier {{and the others}} are trying to find the parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After {{defeating}} five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated their souls from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to <b>recombine</b> the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.|$|E

5|$|The {{north coast}} is gently {{shelving}} with low cliffs and {{long stretches of}} sandy beach, some sections of which, especially in the northwest, are muddy. The principal coastal feature is Bridgwater Bay, and the only important harbour is at the mouths of the Parrett. The main rivers in Somerset rise in the hills and flow northwards and westwards into the Bristol Channel; these are the Axe, Brue, Parrett and its tributaries, and Exe. The source of the River Axe is at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills. It flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. It splits into two parts which subsequently <b>recombine,</b> and flows across the moors, through Lower Weare and {{to the south of}} Loxton. It passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down and reaches the sea at Weston Bay; it forms the northern boundary of the county.|$|E
5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and <b>recombine</b> donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E
5|$|Within an ionic crystal, {{there will}} usually be some point defects, but to {{maintain}} electroneutrality, these defects come in pairs. Frenkel defects {{consist of a}} cation vacancy paired with a cation interstitial and can be generated anywhere in {{the bulk of the}} crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a low coordination number and cations that are much smaller than the anions. Schottky defects consist of one vacancy of each type, and are generated at the surfaces of a crystal, occurring most commonly in compounds with a high coordination number and when the anions and cations are of similar size. If the cations have multiple possible oxidation states, then it is possible for cation vacancies to compensate for electron deficiencies on cation sites with higher oxidation numbers, resulting in a non-stoichiometric compound. Another non-stoichiometric possibility is the formation of an F-center, a free electron occupying an anion vacancy. When the compound has three or more ionic components, even more defect types are possible. All of these point defects can be generated via thermal vibrations and have an equilibrium concentration. Because they are energetically costly, but entropically beneficial, they occur in greater concentration at higher temperatures. Once generated, these pairs of defects can diffuse mostly independently of one another, by hopping between lattice sites. This defect mobility is the source of most transport phenomena within an ionic crystal, including diffusion and solid state ionic conductivity. When vacancies collide with interstitials (Frenkel), they can <b>recombine</b> and annihilate one another. Similarly vacancies are removed when they reach the surface of the crystal (Schottky). Defects in the crystal structure generally expand the lattice parameters, reducing the overall density of the crystal. Defects also result in ions in distinctly different local environments, which causes them to experience a different crystal-field symmetry, {{especially in the case of}} different cations exchanging lattice sites. This results in a different splitting of d-electron orbitals, so that the optical absorption (and hence colour) can change with defect concentration.|$|E

DNA from β-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) isolates (DNABLNAR) and from β-lactamase-positive, amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant (BLPACR) (DNABLPACR) isolates was extracted and added to a 107 -CFU/ml suspension of one BL+ strain (CDN MIC, 0. 007 μg/ml; AMC MIC, 1 μg/ml) or one BL− strain (CDN MIC, 0. 015 μg/ml; AMC MIC, 0. 5 μg/ml) in Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM). The mixture was incubated for 3 h and was then inoculated into a two-compartment computerized device simulating free concentrations of CDN (400 mg twice a day [b. i. d. ]) or AMC (875 and 125 mg {{three times a day}} [t. i. d. ]) in serum over 24 h. Controls were antibiotic-free simulations. Colony counts were performed; the total population and the <b>recombined</b> population were differentiated; and postsimulation MICs were determined. At time zero, the <b>recombined</b> population was 0. 00095 % of the total population. In controls, the BL− and BL+ total populations and the BL− <b>recombined</b> population increased (from ≈ 3 log 10 to 4. 5 to 5 log 10), while the BL+ <b>recombined</b> population was maintained in simulations with DNABLPACR and was decreased by ≈ 2 log 10 with DNABLNAR. CDN was bactericidal (percentage of the dosing interval for which experimental antibiotic concentrations exceeded the MIC [ft>MIC], > 88 %), and no <b>recombined</b> populations were detected from 4 h on. AMC was bactericidal against BL− strains (ft>MIC, 74. 0 %) in DNABLNAR and DNABLPACR simulations, with a small final <b>recombined</b> population (MIC, 4 μg/ml; ft>MIC, 30. 7 %) in DNABLPACR simulations. When AMC was used against the BL+ strain (in DNABLNAR or DNABLPACR simulations), the bacterial load was reduced ≈ 2 log 10 (ft>MIC, 44. 3 %), but 6. 3 % and 32 % of the total population corresponded to a <b>recombined</b> population (MIC, 16 μg/ml; ft>MIC, 0 %) in DNABLNAR and DNABLPACR simulations, respectively.
