5|$|Balmer was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11June 1942. On 25June he took five of No.100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts {{that were already}} stationed there. That night he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the Huon Gulf near Lae. Despite finding his bomb <b>release</b> <b>gear</b> faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs {{in the face of}} increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to Milne Bay to again take part in the New Guinea campaign. On 7September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of P-40 Kittyhawks from Nos.75 and 76 Squadrons, Bristol Beaufighters from No.30 Squadron, Hudsons from No.6 Squadron, and his own No.100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It {{was the first time the}} Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.|$|E

The {{submarine}} missed its rendezvous with the landing ship, having been strafed by an Allied aircraft shortly before. Problems with the <b>release</b> <b>gear</b> for the assault craft, meant that some of the commando parties were late getting ashore and another landed at the wrong beach.|$|E

This could only be done with air superiority, as the Z-9 was unarmoured. The airframe and equipment was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 version. Only the bomb bay was altered to accommodate 16 bomb-dispenser systems. The maximum weight of the Z-9 was [...] The design did not reach serial production.|$|E

50|$|At 08:30, two {{lifeboats}} {{from the}} boat station assigned to Third Officer Francis Laws were lowered, without his knowledge, {{through the use of}} the automatic <b>release</b> <b>gear.</b> Those two lifeboats dropped some 6 ft and hit the water violently. The two lifeboats soon drifted back into the still-turning propellers, which were beginning to rise out of the water due to the water flooding into the front of the ship. As they reached the turning blades, both lifeboats, together with their occupants, were torn to pieces. Word of the carnage arrived on the bridge, and Captain Bartlett, seeing that water was entering more rapidly as Britannic was moving and that there was a risk of more victims, gave the order to stop the engines. The propellers stopped turning the moment a third lifeboat was about to be reduced to splinters. RAMC occupants of this boat pushed against the blades and got away from them safely.|$|E
50|$|In most braces, {{immediately}} {{behind the}} chuck is a three position <b>gear</b> <b>release</b> which allows ratcheting of the handle when in tight spots. Turning the <b>gear</b> <b>release</b> {{from the center}} position allows ratcheting the brace in the direction needed. Turning the <b>gear</b> <b>release</b> fully clockwise lets it remove wood in a clockwise direction with the ratchet action going counter-clockwise. Placing the <b>gear</b> <b>release</b> fully counter-clockwise then allows turning the brace and bit in a counter-clockwise direction, usually to remove the drill bit from the hole. The center position of the <b>gear</b> <b>release</b> prohibits the ratcheting effect.|$|R
50|$|For all {{lifeboats}} using {{a roller}} gravity davit and Rottmer <b>releasing</b> <b>gear,</b> {{this is the}} procedure:1. Make sure the Davit tracks are clear of debris2. Remove the lifeboat cover if applicable 3. Put in the lifeboat plugs4. At this time the Rottmer <b>releasing</b> <b>gear</b> is checked to be secure.5. Attach the sea painter to {{the bow of the}} ship.6. Remove the gripes from the lifeboat. 7. Make sure the gripes preventing bar is free from the track.8. Have the assigned brake man life the braking bar and lower the lifeboat to the embarkation deck. 9. Now that the Tricing pendants have pulled the lifeboat in close, attach the Frapping lines to the wire falls by passing them to a worker who is on the lifeboat. 10. Load the lifeboat. Load {{one person at a time}} and seat them so their weight is distributed between the two sides.11. Have the brake man raise the lifeboat slightly so the workers can release the Tricing pendants.12. Brake man lifts bar and lowers the vessel into the water.13. Operate the Rottmer <b>releasing</b> <b>gear</b> and <b>release</b> the davit on the crest of a wave.14. If ship is sinking, pull toggle pin to release the sea painter from the ship.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Epic Games {{acquired}} Utah based Chair Entertainment and <b>released</b> <b>Gears</b> of War 2, {{which sold}} over three million copies {{within the first}} month of its release. Summer 2009 saw the launch of Chair Entertainment's Shadow Complex, an adventure game inspired by the Metroid series.|$|R
50|$|After {{testing was}} {{satisfied}} the two variants, the N-1 and N-2, which had two sub-variants, were fitted with FuG 202. The N-1 variants were given two sub-variants which were {{to follow the}} design of the E-2/E-4 and the J-1/J-2 with emphasis on range and endurance. Extra fuel tanks were added to the empty bomb bay. For operations over water the heavy night fighters were fitted with lifeboats and radio transmitters. The FuG X with TZG 10 and FuG 16. IFF equipment was the FuG 25s. The N also had the FuG 101 radio altimeter, blind flying equipment FuB1 2 and PeilG V. AI search radar was the FuG 202. The no longer needed bomb <b>release</b> <b>gear</b> remained, bringing the aircraft up to 15000 kg on take-off, so it was barely able to reach 7400 m. Fuel consumption lightened the load, and the Dornier could reach a maximum operational ceiling of 8400 m. The speed of the N was a maximum of 500 km/h at 6000 m. The N-2 was much improved, as it was much lighter and refined.|$|E
50|$|The N-2 was {{originally}} {{not to have}} the Schräge Musik armament configuration or a brake parachute, but it was then decided to fit the armament set for tactical reasons. A semi-rigid brake parachute was also installed for unspecified reasons. The N-2 prototype was a converted E-1, serial 0174, code PE+AW. Communications were improved on the FuG 16 ZY and FuG 214. The B and C cupolas were removed and the positions fared over with Plexiglas and wood. The MG FF guns were replaced by MG 151/20 cannon. The MG 17s in the nose were to be abandoned with more powerful armament, but this was never carried out. To kill the excess weight that had plagued earlier types, the bomb bay, its doors, and the bomb <b>release</b> <b>gear</b> were removed, and changes were made to the control panels. The gaps were replaced by lighter wood parts which reduced weight, allowing heavier armour protection for the crew. The N variant was the most heavily armoured Dornier variant.The improvements enabled a top speed of 525 km/h (an increase of 25 km/h) and a reduction from 15000 kg to 12500 kg, which increased ceiling height to 9500 m.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1942, Balmer assumed {{command of}} the first RAAF unit to operate Australian-built Bristol Beauforts, No. 100 Squadron. It was formed at Richmond using the number of a Royal Air Force {{squadron}} that had been decimated in the Malayan Campaign. In tribute to its original incarnation, Balmer adopted the RAF unit's crest, which featured a skull-and-crossbones emblem and the motto Sarang Tebuan Jangan Dijolok (Malay for [...] "Do not stir up a hornet's nest"). No. 100 Squadron transferred to Mareeba in Far North Queensland on 22 May, after Balmer decided that a proposed base at Cairns was unsuitable owing to periodic flooding. While his crews at Mareeba gained experience on maritime patrols, he travelled to Port Moresby, New Guinea, on 26 May to test the Beaufort in operational conditions; as he came in to land he was fired upon by US anti-aircraft batteries, whose gunners had [...] "never seen a Goddamn aircraft like that before", but escaped damage. Balmer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the King's Birthday Honours on 11 June 1942. On 25 June he took five of No. 100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts that were already stationed there.

50|$|In 2006 Microsoft {{chose not}} to <b>release</b> <b>Gears</b> of War on the German market. Since the game was {{imported}} to the German market nonetheless (without any age limit), the BPjM became involved and put the game on the index list. The same applied to the second instalment. Afterwards the rating procedure was revised, and imported games without a USK rating are automatically considered 18+ regardless of content. The third game did get classified with a USK 18 rating.|$|R
5000|$|The Do 217 usually {{carried a}} crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio {{operator}} and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centered in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180deg to starboard, placing the yoke {{in front of the}} bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K with stepless windscreen, the center pivot was mounted on a rocking control arm or pedestal, rather than a sliding piston, since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung {{from the edge of the}} fueslage wall and from the glazing frames above the yoke, respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb <b>release</b> <b>gear</b> or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer's window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( [...] in) of armour and another 5mm ( [...] in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.The Funkgerät or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic pilot panel was located next the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.|$|E
