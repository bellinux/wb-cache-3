5|$|In December 1933, Sale Urban District {{submitted}} {{a petition to}} the Privy Council {{in an attempt to}} gain a charter of incorporation. At the time, Sale UD had the largest population and highest <b>rateable</b> value of any urban district in the country. The petition was successful and on 21 September 1935 Sale UD was granted borough status, and became the Municipal Borough of Sale. Following the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the Municipal Borough of Sale was abolished. Sale became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The town's education, town planning, waste collection, health, social care and other services are administered by Trafford Council.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>rateable</b> occupation and the hereditament {{can be a}} complex one – taking <b>rateable</b> occupation of part of a hereditament creates a new hereditament out of the larger one, for example. In practice, determination of <b>rateable</b> occupation and hereditament is often interlinked.|$|E
25|$|In Wales, small {{business}} rates relief was not introduced until 2007. It replaced rural property relief, but included similar provisions, with 50% relief for most properties with a <b>rateable</b> value below £2,000, and 25% relief for <b>rateable</b> values between £2,000 and £5,000. Post offices with <b>rateable</b> values {{of up to}} £9,000 are eligible for 100% relief; while those over £9,000 and up to £12,000 receive 50%. It also authorises local authorities to set up local schemes of relief for properties up to a limit of £12,000 <b>rateable</b> value.|$|E
50|$|A project {{approved}} in 1973 brought {{the construction of}} 184 units of garden apartments on a site covering 12.4 acre, providing additional <b>rateables</b> and offering permanent housing for an estimated 400 people, that would contrast with the temporary original structures built in the 1940s that had long passed their expected lifespan.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first major}} job that faced the {{development}} committee was finding and selecting a suitable {{site for a}} 700 unit housing project in northern New Jersey. The United States Housing Authority provided two site selection experts, and the New Jersey State Planning Commission provided assistance throughout the site selecting process. The final location had to be relatively inexpensive to purchase, be located near major utility networks for water, gas, electric and sewer connections, and be in a financially stable host community with underutilized public facilities and services. Major urban areas in northern New Jersey were eliminated early {{because there were no}} plots of land large enough for the project. The marshy rural areas near the shipyards were also found to be unacceptable early on. Quickly the committee began focusing its attention on the surrounding suburban communities, which were very popular among its work constituency. [...] Suburban communities, however, lacked financial stability, because they lacked the industrial <b>rateables</b> necessary to keep residential property taxes low. [...] The people of these prospective host communities were also frightened that the new project would be a direct liability rather than an asset for their towns.|$|R
25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether {{residential}} or commercial, {{was given a}} <b>rateable</b> value which estimated the annual rent it would bring in. In the budgeting process the council would work out the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total <b>rateable</b> value within its boundaries to produce {{the proportion of the}} <b>rateable</b> value that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 most {{domestic}} {{customers were}} categorized {{in the lowest}} category of <b>rateable</b> property value and were unmetered. Outside Georgetown these customers were charged a flat rate of 8,899 Guyanese dollar (US$ 47) per year, equivalent to US$ 3.90 per month. In Georgetown they were charged a flat rate of 11,799 Guyanese dollar (US$ 62), equivalent to US$ 5.18 per month. Domestic customers in high <b>rateable</b> properties paid about 80% more.|$|E
25|$|For each {{property}} in the rating list for their area, the local authority calculates and issues a bill, which it is responsible for collecting, with powers to pursue payment. The <b>rateable</b> value is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate, referred to in legislation as the non-domestic rating multiplier, to arrive at an annual bill. For example, a <b>rateable</b> value of £10,000 and a multiplier of 40p would produce an annual bill of £4000. The bill usually requires payment in instalments over the financial year.|$|E
25|$|Sewer tariffs for {{domestic}} unmetered customers are set at 4,999 Guyanese dollars per year (US$ 26), or 42% {{of the water}} bill or a low <b>rateable</b> domestic customer in Georgetown.|$|E
25|$|Assessing a <b>rateable</b> value {{requires}} a valuation {{that follows the}} above process, but the matters to be considered are constrained by legislation. So the physical properties are considered not at the present day, but at the Material Day, and are constrained by the valuation assumptions. The economic conditions are considered at the Antecedent Valuation Date. The valuation {{is based on a}} hypothetical lease laid down in the valuation assumptions. The Secretary of State may make regulations for certain classes of property that give a statutory formulae for the <b>rateable</b> value, instead of the rental value. These classes include large ports and public utilities.|$|E
25|$|To give {{relief to}} {{properties}} considered vital to rural communities, {{a combination of}} compulsory and discretionary reliefs exist in England. The Welsh scheme was incorporated into small business rates relief from 1 April 2007. Properties of a given <b>rateable</b> value (£7000 in England from 2005) can receive the relief {{if they are in}} a rural settlement (defined as a population of 3000 or less, within designated rural areas), and are the only general store or post office, or a food store. The only public house or petrol station (with <b>rateable</b> values of up £10500, as of 2005) may also receive the relief, which is a mandatory 50%.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary {{relief of}} up to 100% is {{available}} for the previous properties, and for any others up to a current limit of £12000 <b>rateable</b> value, provided they are judged to be of benefit to the local community.|$|E
25|$|The Water Industry Act 1999 {{banned the}} {{disconnection}} {{of water and}} sewerage services for non-payment by domestic customers. It also allows the continuation of water charges based on <b>rateable</b> property value, as opposed to volumetric rates based on metering.|$|E
25|$|A rating list is {{required}} to identify each relevant non-domestic property in the area, and assign a <b>rateable</b> value, based on a rental valuation of the property. Some types of property, such as public utilities, are valued using a statutory formula instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rateable</b> {{value is}} an {{estimate}} of the annual rent that would be paid for the property at a fixed date two years prior {{to the beginning of the}} list (known as the antecedent valuation date), incorporating certain assumptions laid down in the legislation.|$|E
25|$|This {{itself does}} not {{directly}} provide a definition, but depends on the case law already established by prior forms of rating; no statutory definition of the hereditament exists. In case law, {{the concept of the}} hereditament is inextricably linked to that of <b>rateable</b> occupation.|$|E
25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall increase in liability across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose <b>rateable</b> value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise in liability. Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in <b>rateable</b> value would have a significant change in liability. To smooth these jumps in liability, schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. Transitional relief applies only to changes in liability between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a <b>rateable</b> value had risen by 20%, the rise in liability would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|E
25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a <b>rateable</b> value based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of <b>rateable</b> values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E
25|$|The {{tariff system}} used by GWI is highly complex, {{consisting}} of 27 different water tariffs and 4 sewer tariffs in 2007. Water tariffs are differentiated between metered and un-metered customers; domestic, commercial, institutional and industrial customers; whether customers are former customers of GUYWA (outside the capital) or GS & WC (in Georgetown); and the <b>rateable</b> value of {{properties in the}} case of domestic customers.|$|E
25|$|As of 1 April 2008, empty {{relief was}} altered, {{removing}} the previous total relief for industrial properties, and removing the 50% relief for other properties. The three-month period of total relief for non-industrial properties was retained, and a six-month period instituted for industrial properties. In the Pre Budget Report 2008, the Chancellor increased the <b>rateable</b> value for full relief to £15,000 {{for the period}} 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010.|$|E
25|$|Metered tariffs for {{domestic}} {{customers in the}} lowest category of <b>rateable</b> property value are set at 61 Guyanese dollar per cubic meter (US$ 0.32/m³) outside Georgetown and 63 Guyanese dollar per cubic meter (US$ 0.33/m³) in Georgetown. At a consumption of 20cubic meter per month (133liter/capita/day {{for a family of}} five) that tariff would be equivalent to an increase of the water bill of 64% for customers outside Georgetown and 28% for customers in Georgetown compared to the currently prevailing flat rate for unmetered customers.|$|E
25|$|What is {{commonly}} known as an appeal is more correctly known as a proposal to alter the rating list. Proposals can be made on a number of grounds, including challenging the basic <b>rateable</b> value, an alteration to the property, or proposing a reduction from a specific date due to a particular event (such as changes to a street affecting traffic). When an appeal is made, it will first be discussed with the Valuation Office Agency, who will attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached, and the proposal is not withdrawn, it will be heard by an independent valuation tribunal.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher began {{preparations}} for a Community Charge {{to replace the}} council rates. Instead of one payment per household based on <b>rateable</b> value of the property, the poll tax was to be paid by all people who were 18 or over. While the Labour Party conference, {{in the autumn of}} 1988, had rejected a campaign of non-payment, Militant argued for a strategy of non-payment and supporting Anti-Poll Tax Unions, beginning in Scotland. Grant had opposed this option, arguing that Militant's MPs should pay the poll tax, partly for the group's self-protection, but was overruled.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1828 the Stalybridge Police and Market Act {{received}} Royal Assent, establishing Stalybridge as {{an independent}} town with a board of 21 Commissioners. Every male {{over the age of}} 21 who was the occupier of a <b>rateable</b> property under the act was entitled to vote at the election of the Commissioners. On 30 December 1831 the town hall and market were officially opened. In 1833 the Commissioners set up the Stalybridge Police Force, {{the first of its kind}} in the country. By this year the population of the town had reached 14,216 with 2.357 inhabited houses.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{may also}} be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities. Reliefs are {{administered}} by the local authority {{and they do not}} affect the <b>rateable</b> value of a property. While some are mandatory, others are at the discretion of the local authority, who also have to bear, in whole or in part, the costs of some reliefs. In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority. A relief on non-agricultural business on agricultural land or former agricultural buildings has been removed with effect from 14 August 2006.|$|E
25|$|Little {{remains of}} early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the {{surrounding}} villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower <b>rateable</b> value than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times {{there were a number}} of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was Henry's Principal Secretary of State Ralph Sadleir, a resident of Bryck Place, Homerton.|$|E
25|$|Each rating list {{runs for}} five years, and may change within that time. The value {{from the very}} start of the list can be altered, or events within the life of the list (such as an extension) can be {{reflected}} by changes within the list, leading to different values at different times. For example, a property is entered in a rating list at 1 April 2005 with a <b>rateable</b> value of £10,000, and a year later the property is extended causing an increase to £12,000 from 1 April 2006; the original entry of £10,000 remains unchanged for the first year. A successful proposal could alter this original value of £10,000 to £9000 from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, but the second entry from 1 April 2006 would remain unchanged at £12,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, {{they did not have}} to prove that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the <b>rateable</b> values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct what needed to be done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E

500|$|Historically, Sale was a {{township}} in {{the ancient}} parish of Ashton upon Mersey in the hundred of Bucklow and county of Cheshire. Throughout the Middle Ages it was governed by the Lord of the Manor. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Sale was joined with the Altrincham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. The unit {{changed its name to}} Bucklow Poor Law Union in 1895. Sale adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in November 1866, and Sale Local Board was formed to govern the township at the beginning of 1867. Members were elected to the local board by the town's ratepayers. A household had one vote for every £10 (£ as of [...] ) of <b>rateable</b> value. Under the Local Government Act 1888 Sale became an urban district of the administrative county of Cheshire. The local board was replaced by Sale Urban District Council in 1894. The parish of Ashton upon Mersey became an urban district in 1895. In 1930, the Ashton upon Mersey UD was merged into Sale UD under a county review order.|$|E
2500|$|... one {{property}} {{plus additional}} properties, {{none of which}} may have a <b>rateable</b> value of more than £2,200, and the total <b>rateable</b> value of all properties is £15,000 (£21,500 in London).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rateable</b> {{occupation}} is {{occupying a}} hereditament {{so as to}} be liable to pay a rate. In the case of LCC v Wilkins (VO) , the court brought together various prior cases to establish four essentials for <b>rateable</b> occupation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Tariff {{structure}} and cross subsidies. Metered connections are charged at a volumetric rate, while unmetered connections are charged at a flat rate {{based on the}} <b>rateable</b> value of the property. The <b>rateable</b> value system {{was intended as a}} cross subsidy from wealthier to poorer households. However, since <b>rateable</b> values are often outdated, the subsidy is poorly targeted. Since more and more highly rated households opt for metering, flat rates for the remaining unmetered customers are being increased to compensate for the lost revenue. As a result, the already imperfect cross-subsidy system is unwinding. An Independent Report on Charging for Household Water and Sewerage Services published in 2009 by Anna Walker recommended a package of help to ensure that [...] "the transition to metering is not to cause real problems of affordability to those on low incomes".|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{properties}} {{which would}} otherwise be <b>rateable</b> are in fact exempt from rating (that is, are not entered in any rating list). These properties are specified by the Local Government Finance Act 1988, and include the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{fund the}} relief in England, a {{supplement}} {{is added to}} the Uniform Business Rate multiplier. However, this supplement is only applied to properties with <b>rateable</b> values of £15,000 or higher (£21,500 in London), so properties between £12,000 and £18,000 receive neither the relief, or the supplement ...|$|E
2500|$|For 2016/17 the {{multiplier}} is 49.7 pence and {{the small}} business rate multiplier is 48.4 pence.The multiplier for 2017/18 is 47.9 pence, which means that this tax has increased in real terms by 37.6% {{since its inception in}} 1990.
