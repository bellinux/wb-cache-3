40|$|Nondestructive {{testing methods}} {{used for the}} testing of rail in tracks {{worldwide}} can be limited by discontinuity location or orientation within the <b>rail.</b> <b>Vertical</b> split head and rail base cracks are among those types of discontinuities {{that are difficult to}} detect, which in some cases may result in a reail failure in service. A noncontact and remote hybrid ultrasonic technique has been developed by combining laser generation with air coupled detection of ultrasonic signals in rails. The test apparatus mounts on a railroad pushcart and tests are performed in motion with all components kept above the running surface of the rail track. Tracks have been tested for vertical split head and rail base cracks with high success in detection...|$|E
40|$|A plane {{half-track}} {{model and}} a periodic track-substructure model are established. The spectral element method and spectral {{transfer matrix method}} are developed and applied to investigate the track decay rate (TDR) and transmission rate (TR) of the vertical rail vibrations, which can reflect the transmission characteristics in the longitudinal and downward directions, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of different track parameters on TDR and TR are investigated. The {{results show that the}} antiresonance frequency of the rail and the out-of-phase resonance frequency of the rail and sleeper form the boundary frequencies of the high-attenuation zone for longwise vibration transmission, where the vibration absorption of the sleeper is significant. The downward transmissibility of vertical rail vibrations is greatest around the antiresonance frequency of the <b>rail.</b> <b>Vertical</b> rail vibrations are primarily transmitted in the downward direction at low frequencies, while they are mainly transmitted along the rail at high frequencies. Stiffer rail pads can make more vibrations transmitted downwards to the sleeper above the antiresonance frequency of the rail, while the changes of other track parameters have different effects on the transmission characteristics. Additionally, a field measurement is performed for verification, and the simulations are well consistent with measurements...|$|E

40|$|A {{portable}} device for assessing rail bending and torsion {{as well as}} the relative wheel-rail position was designed and tested. The main requirement for this device is that its first eigenfrequency should be well above the first bending eigenfrequency of the rail in order not to dynamically amplify rail bending motions. Thus, a minimum target frequency of 100 Hz is set. Another requirement is to design a device that could be easily mounted on different track sections in order to assess also the influence of vehicle type and speed. Thus, a {{portable device}} based on laser sensors was produced that does not require any operations on the rails (contactless sensors) and allows to place the sensors at a reasonable distance from both the rail and the passing by wheel. Tests were performed on a dedicated test track in Czech Republic both at low speed (20 km/h on a 150 m radius curve) and at medium speed (90 km/h on a 600 m radius curve) with two axle and four axle wagons. Installation was extremely easy and acquired signals were post-elaborated to assess <b>rail</b> <b>vertical</b> and lateral bending as well as torsion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{tests on}} a transition section between ballasted and ballastless {{tracks in the}} Liupanshui-Zhanyi railway in China. The originally unsettled transition zone is exposed to sudden car shaking {{and a series of}} track transition problems during train passage. As an example, the influences of polyurethane polymer and a combination of polyurethane and assistant rails to increase track stiffness distribution and track transition decay rates on the dynamic vehicle and track behaviour were investigated. The measured results indicate using only polyurethane and using both polyurethane and assistant rails not only effectively makes the track stiffness change more even but also increases the track decay rate at the target frequencies. These positive effects further reduce the wheel-rail interaction forces and vehicle and <b>rail</b> <b>vertical</b> acceleration, which decreases more when combining polyurethane and assistant rails than when using only polyurethane because the former outperforms the latter for smoothing the track stiffness distribution and increasing the track decay rate. Based on abating wheel-rail impact during the transition from ballasted to ballastless track and improving traffic operation and passenger comfort, combining polyurethane and assistant rails had the greatest effect and may be an effective remedy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{model for}} dynamic {{analysis}} of the vehicle–track–subgrade coupling system was developed by utilizing the finite-element method. Based on the model, new types of vehicle and track elements are presented and their associated stiffness matrix, mass matrix, and damping matrix are formulated. Computational software is coded with Matlab. As an application exam-ple, influences of four kinds of transition patterns – abrupt change, step-by-step change, linear change, as well as cosine change for track stiffness distributions in track transitions – on dynamic behaviour of the vehicle and the track are investigated. The computational {{results show that the}} transition pattern of the track stiffness has primary influence on the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle and the track, and smoothing of the track stiffness distribution can significantly reduce the wheel–rail interaction forces and the <b>rail</b> <b>vertical</b> accelerations. From abating wheel– rail impact and improving traffic operation’s point of view, the cosine change has the most effect, the linear change is somewhat effective and the abrupt change is the least effective for the four kinds of transition patterns of the track stiffness. However, the transition patterns of the track stiffness have essentially no influence on the vehicle vertical accelerations, due to the excel-lent behaviour of vibration isolation resulting from the primary and the secondary suspension systems of the vehicle...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have shown}} great {{potential}} in agriculture and {{are increasingly being}} developed for agricultural use. There {{are still a lot}} of experiments that need to be done to improve their performance and explore new uses, but experiments using UAVs are limited by many conditions like weather and location and the time it takes to prepare for a flight. To promote UAV remote sensing, a near ground remote sensing platform was developed. This platform consists of three major parts: (1) mechanical structures like a horizontal <b>rail,</b> <b>vertical</b> cylinder, and three axes gimbal; (2) power supply and control parts; (3) onboard application components. This platform covers five degrees of freedom (DOFs) : horizontal, vertical, pitch, roll, yaw. A stm 32 ARM single chip was used as the controller of the whole platform and another stm 32 MCU was used to stabilize the gimbal. The gimbal stabilizer communicates with the main controller via a CAN bus. A multispectral camera was mounted on the gimbal. Software written in C++ language was developed as the graphical user interface. Operating parameters were set via this software and the working status was displayed in this software. To test how well the system works, a laser distance meter was used to measure the slide rail’s repeat accuracy. A 3 -axis vibration analyzer was used to test the system stability. Test results show that the horizontal repeat accuracy was less than 2 mm; vertical repeat accuracy was less than 1 mm; vibration was less than 2 g and remained at an acceptable level. This system has high accuracy and stability and can therefore be used for various near ground remote sensing studies...|$|E

30|$|According to a model {{proposed}} by Remington and Witting [46], {{the generation of}} bridge-borne noise {{can be divided into}} three steps: first, as the train passes, the wheel–rail interaction causes the rail and wheel to vibrate; second, the vibratory energy is then transmitted to the bridge structure through the rail fastening, causing various structural components of the bridge to vibrate; and third, the vibrating bridge components, rails, and wheels then radiate sound. This model used the combined wheel–rail roughness as the external excitation. Once the total power input of the bridge was calculated, the distribution of power throughout the bridge structure was determined using simple SEA. Finally, the total sound power radiated by the bridge was calculated using the radiation efficiency of each component. Because this model only accounted for the <b>rail’s</b> <b>vertical</b> bending and traveling wave, no wave transmission in the rail was modeled at frequencies below the decoupling one, which is not reasonable. Remington and Witting then compared the noise radiated by an open-deck viaduct with and without rail fastenings; the measured noise levels were compared with the ones computed by the above model. According to the theoretical calculation, the noise level would be reduced by 2  dB(A) after installing elastic rail fastenings; the actual reduction was 4  dB(A), indicating that the computed results were reasonable. The theoretical model was used further to investigate the effectiveness of several noise reduction measures, and elastic rail fastenings were shown to be the most effective (maximum noise reduction: 10  dB(A)).|$|R
