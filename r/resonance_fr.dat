Furthermore, the many-body Coulomb exchange effects markedly modify the spectral profiles, so that either lobe of the doublet is considerably narrowed with accompanying reversal of the asymmetry pattern.

External control of the intruder coupling is enabled {{by means of an}} applied magnetic field, in the presence of which we demonstrate the predicted distortions of the FR.

Starting from the 3 D description and using the variational approximation (VA), we derive 1 D and 2 D systems of equations, under the corresponding confining potentials. This method produces a pair of nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations coupled to algebraic equations for the transverse widths of the confined state. The equations incorporate interactions between atoms of the same species and between the species, assuming that the latter can be manipulated by means of the Feshbach <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR).</b> As an application, we explore spatial density correlations in the ground state (GS) between the species, concluding that they strongly depend on the sign and strength of the inter-species interaction.

30|$|Indeed, {{not only}} vdW {{interlayer}} interaction, {{but also its}} combination with anharmonic interactions that occur in complex molecules or layers, can give rise to new features in dynamics of crystal lattice and observed in infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy (RS).

Such effect is known as Fermi-Davydov (FD) resonance in molecular type crystals. It was shown in the cited works that frequencies of crystal vibrations and their intensities depend on treatment of the vdW inter-molecular interaction and intra-molecular anharmonicity. More complicated situation of displaying FD resonance with participation of lattice phonons was studied in crystals with hydrogen bond in which anharmonic constants can be greater than in the case of lattice phonons [14]. Therefore, we suppose that features observed in recently published Raman spectra [4, 5] can be explained in the framework of approach developed in following works [11 – 13]. However, the problem connected with the influence of weak interlayer interactions on strong intralayer interaction looks more complex in this case, because each layer is a two-dimensional crystal.|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{transport}} of electrons through graphene magnetic barriers is studied theoretically in {{presence of an}} external time harmonic scalar potential. The transmission coefficients are calculated {{in the framework of}} the non-perturbative Floquet theory using transfer matrix method. The time dependent scalar potential is found to suppress the usual Fabry-Perot oscillations occurring in the transmission through a constant vector potential barrier (corresponding to two oppositely directed delta-function magnetic barriers). Two types of asymmetric Fano <b>resonances</b> (<b>FR)</b> are noted and are discussed for the narrow barrier structure. One of them arises due to the oscillatory mode while the other due to the evanescent mode of the electron wave inside the barrier. In contrast, the oscillating field favors the transmission for rectangular magnetic barrier structure and also exhibits the FR due to the presence of bound state inside the barrier. The characteristic Fano line shape can be tuned by varying the amplitude of the oscillating potential. The detection of such FR offers an efficient tool for the identification of the quasi-bound and evanescent extended states inside the barrier not reported in the literature so far, for the case of graphene magnetic barrier structures.

40|$|Nanostructures enhance {{nonlinear}} response, such as surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), by localizing {{the incident}} field into hot spots. Fano <b>resonances</b> (<b>FRs)</b> in both plasmon bands, the excited {{one and the}} one Stokes shifted frequency overlaps, increase the field at the hot spots even more. This is shown to lead further enhancement of the Raman signal. However, hot spot enhancement is limited with the break-down of the molecule and the tunnelling regime. Here we show that Raman signal can be enhanced silently, without modifying the fields (by linear FRs) at the hot spots. Using a very basic model, we show that enhancement emerges due to the path interference effects in the nonlinear response. Our simulations with the exact solutions of 3 D Maxwell equations show that hot spot fields are not enhanced and confirm the predictions of our simple model. A factor of 3 orders of magnitude multiplies the enhancement due to the localization. Thus, presented method can enhance SERS ~ 4000 times more in materials already operating in the break-down or tunneling regime. In difference to intensity enhancement with linear FRs, here, SERS can be enhanced by coupling to a same quality material via utilizing the path interferences in the nonlinear response.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{information contained}} in a correlation function obtained by the Fourier transform of an electronic spectrum {{can be used to}} study strong intermode couplings, such as the Duschinsky effect (DE) and the Fermi <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR).</b> Both of them complicate the calculation of the correlation function by destroying its factorisability. In some particular cases, the DE can greatly simplify the form of the correlation function by concealing one of its inherent frequencies. The DE never leads to a beat or to a systematic decrease of the correlation function. A simple classical approximation for the correlation function which takes into account the Lissajous motion of the center of the wave packet, but does not allow for its deformation or spreading is found to be useful in a harmonic model. The FR leads to a beat in the correlation function which results from a periodic energy transfer from the active to the inactive mode. A practical method is given to extract the perturbed and unperturbed energies as well as the coupling matrix element of a FR from a low-resolution spectrum by Fourier transformation of just that part of the spectrum which corresponds to the quasidegenerate interacting states.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of an electronic Floquet {{state in a}} semiconductor Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) driven by an intense monochromatic terahertz (THz) wave is examined based on the R-matrix Floquet theory, in which an excess density of states (DOS) corresponding to the lifetime is calculated. It is revealed that the dynamic localization (DL) characteristic of this system is unstable against Fano <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR)</b> -like interminiband decay mechanism caused by THz-mediated ac-Zener tunneling (ZT); in this study, this is termed as dynamic FR (DFR). The DFR {{is considered to be}} a new FR mechanism characterized by both tunable ac-ZT coupling and coexistence with shape resonance. The result obtained here is in sharp contrast with the conventional understanding without the introduction of DFR, in which the DL is very stable such that its lifetime is comparable to or greater than that of the associated WSL. It is found that the DFR mechanism generally becomes more dominant with an increase in the strength of the bias field. Further, we discuss the observation that the spectral pattern of the excess DOS is more involved for a single-photon resonant transition, namely, Ω=ω, than that for a two-photon resonant transition, namely, Ω= 2 ω, where Ω and ω represent a Bloch frequency and a THz frequency, respectively.

40|$|We {{consider}} a quantum wire, containing two Majorana bound states (MBS) at its ends that are coupled to a current lead {{on one side}} and to a quantum dot (QD) on the other side. Using the method of full counting statistics we calculate the conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy model, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability {{as a function of the}} various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR)</b> line shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy level when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the bias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a function of the QD level energy as long as tunneling to the more distant MBS is negligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height as well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry. These two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the coupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We complement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave superconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features of the effective low-energy model are robust towards a more complete Hamiltonian and also persist at finite temperature.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) {{resonance}} on the optical absorption spectra of strongly biased superlattices are theoretically investigated. Exciton Fano <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR)</b> states in this system are calculated based on the multichannel scattering theory. When the bias of a static electric field (F) is applied such that a WSL subband state is energetically aligned with its adjacent ones, resulting in an anticrossing with strong repulsion due to Zener resonance, we obtain the following findings. (i) The onset of exciton absorption noticeably shifts toward the lower energy side, accompanying the oscillation {{of the magnitude of}} the absorption tail with the change in F. However, for the anticrossing, this effect is limited to a small localized region of F. In fact, a slight change in F away from the anticrossing leads to a peculiar suppression of the redshift of the absorption tail edge. (ii) The absorption intensities and the positions of the FR states vary in an irregular manner due to the Zener breakdown as F traverses the anticrossing region. For instances in a certain WSL state, the oscillator strength is reduced by a large extent only in the anticrossing region, followed by recovery of the intensity out of this region. Moreover, the changes in Fano’s q values with respect to F are also discussed. As described in (i) and (ii), these two effects on the exciton spectra are due to the delocalization of WSL wave functions across several periods that accompany the strong anticrossing...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{generation}} {{dynamics of}} coherent phonons in both polar and nonpolar semiconductors, such as GaAs and Si, {{based on a}} polaronic-quasiparticle (PQ) model. In this model, the PQ operator is composed of two kinds of operators: one is a quasiboson operator, defined as a linear combination {{of a set of}} pairs of electron operators, and the other is a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon operator. In particular, the problem of transient and nonlinear Fano <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR)</b> is tackled, where the vestige of this quantum interference effect was observed exclusively in lightly n-doped Si immediately after carriers were excited by an ultrashort pulse laser [M. Hase et al., Nature (London) 426, 51 (2003) ], although not observed yet in GaAs. The PQ model enables us to show straightforwardly that the phonon energy state is embedded in continuum states formed by a set of adiabatic eigenstates of the quasiboson; this energy configuration is a necessary condition of the manifestation of the transient FR in the present optically nonlinear system. Numerical calculations are done for photoemission spectra relevant to the retarded longitudinal dielectric function of transient photoexcited states and for power spectra relevant to the LO-phonon displacement function of time. The photoemission spectra show that in undoped Si, an asymmetric spectral profile characteristic of FR comes into existence immediately after the instantaneous carrier excitation to fade out gradually, whereas in undoped GaAs, no asymmetry in spectra appears in the whole temporal region. The similar results are also obtained in the power spectra. These results are in harmony with the reported experimental results. It is found that the obtained difference in spectral profile between undoped Si and GaAs is attributed to a phase factor of an effective interaction between the LO phonon and the quasiboson.

40|$|Biological {{electron}} transfer (ET) reactions are typically {{described in the}} framework of coherent two-state electron tunneling or multi-step hopping. Yet, these ET reactions may involve multiple redox cofactors in van der Waals contact {{with each other and with}} vibronic broadenings on the same scale as the energy gaps among the species. In this regime, fluctuations of the molecule and its medium can produce transient energy level matching among multiple electronic states. This transient degeneracy, or flickering electronic resonance among states, is found to support coherent (ballistic) charge transfer. Importantly, ET rates arising from a flickering <b>resonance</b> (<b>FR)</b> mechanism will decay exponentially with distance because the probability of energy matching multiple states is multiplicative. The distance dependence of FR transport thus mimics the exponential decay that is usually associated with electron tunneling, although FR transport involves real carrier population on the bridge and is not a tunneling phenomenon. Likely candidates for FR transport are macromolecules with ET groups in van der Waals contact: DNA, bacterial nanowires, multi-heme proteins, strongly coupled porphyrin arrays, and proteins with closely packed redox-active residues. The theory developed here is used to analyze DNA charge-transfer kinetics, and we find that charge transfer distances up to 3 - 4 bases may be accounted for with this mechanism. Thus, the observed rapid (exponential) distance dependence of DNA ET rates over distances of ≲ 10 Å does not necessarily prove a tunneling mechanism. Molecular structures that direct charge transport in two or three dimensions could help to enable the development of molecule-based electrical switches and gates. As a step toward this goal, we use theory, modeling and simulation to explore DNA three-way junctions (TWJs). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum calculations, indicate that DNA TWJs undergo dynamic interconversion among “well stacked” conformations on the time scale of nanoseconds, a feature that makes the junctions very different from linear DNA duplexes. The studies further indicate that this conformational gating would control charge flow through these TWJs, distinguishing them from conventional (larger size scale) gated devices. Simulations also find that structures with polyethylene glycol (PEG) linking groups (“extenders”) lock conformations that favor CT for 25 ns or more. The simulations explain the kinetics observed experimentally in TWJs and rationalize their transport properties compared to double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, we redesigned DNA TWJs that have equally coupled output pathways for charge. The TWJ was also designed to switch between the two conductive states in responsive to an applied electric field. Computationally aided drug discovery confronts the problem to balance performance and computation cost. Earlier study reveals that a less-expensive docking approach is not reliable to estimate the protein-ligand affinity in exploring drug candidates targeting CARM 1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1). However, more accurate binding free energy calculation based on molecular dynamics sampling is not affordable in a high throughput screening. A truncated MD method was developed and can be used to estimate the binding free energy with similar accuracy with the full-system MD methods, while reducing the computation cost ten fold. Thus, this truncated MD method is feasible in a high throughput screening towards drug discovery. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Monolithic {{hexagonal}} BaCo 1, 3 Ti 1, 3 Fe 9, 4 O 19 ferrite multilayers sintered at 900 °C {{exhibit a}} fine-grained microstructure with permeability of μ′ = 16 and a <b>resonance</b> frequency <b>fr</b> ≥ 1 GHz. Co-firing of hetero-laminates of ferrite with CT 700 glass–ceramic LTCC tapes and with polycrystalline zinc titanate (ZT) LTCC tapes was studied. Co-firing at 900 °C of ferrite/CT 700 leads to multilayers with cracks caused by substantial thermal expansion mismatch. Co-fired ferrite/ZT multilayer laminates exhibit a permeability of μ′ = 16 {{and do not}} show any defects. Hexagonal ferrite multilayer inductor elements were integrated into ZT-based multilayer LTCC modules and co-fired at 900 °C with Ag metallization...|$|R
