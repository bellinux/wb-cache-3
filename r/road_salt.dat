The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with <b>road</b> <b>salt</b> (which accelerated the corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E

5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved <b>road</b> <b>salt</b> in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E

40|$|Of several {{impacts of}} <b>road</b> <b>salting</b> on {{roadside}} soils, the potential {{disruption of the}} nitrogen cycle has been largely ignored. Therefore the fates of low-level ammonium-N and nitrate-N inputs to roadside soils impacted by salting {{over an extended period}} (decades) in the field have been studied. The use of <b>road</b> <b>salts</b> disrupts the proportional contributions of nitrate-N and ammonium-N to the mineral inorganic fraction of roadside soils. It is highly probable that the degree of salt exposure of the soil, in the longer term, controls the rates of key microbial N transformation processes, primarily by increasing soil pH. Additional influxes of ammonium-N to salt-impacted soils are rapidly nitrified therefore and, thereafter, increased leaching of nitrate-N to the local waterways occurs, which has particular relevance to the Water Framework Directive. The results reported are important when assessing the fate of inputs of ammonia to soils from atmospheric pollution. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of <b>road</b> <b>salt</b> in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off.

The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|E
25|$|In highway de-icing, salt {{has been}} {{associated}} with corrosion of bridge decks, motor vehicles, reinforcement bar and wire, and unprotected steel structures used in road construction. Surface runoff, vehicle spraying, and windblown actions also affect soil, roadside vegetation, and local surface water and groundwater supplies. Although evidence of environmental loading of salt has been found during peak usage, the spring rains and thaws usually dilute the concentrations of sodium in the area where salt was applied.

25|$|The lack of {{popularity}} {{and the low}} numbers of Torinos in existence today is likely due to the Torino's durability issues that caused low survivability.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of certain {{water and sediment}} quality indicators of a vegetated detention pond system located at Waterlooville, Hampshire, UK. The period of study was 2 years (March 2011 -March 2013) with sampling carried out once a month. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab™. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the changes in quality of various constituents with time and possible linear associations between them. Pond sediments and pond water quality were monitored for a range of variables at each monthly visit. Results indicate that the system demonstrates low levels of pollution while not having a direct impact on the oxygen balance of the receiving water-body. Oxygen demanding substances along with suspended matter and certain metals/elements were found to accumulate in the system with time. Significant linear associations were observed for <b>road</b> <b>salts</b> (containing Na, Cl, Mg) and certain pollutants, suggesting that <b>road</b> <b>salts</b> have a major impact on SuDS water/sediment quality. Sorption characteristics of specific metals were also evaluated by means of adsorption isotherm equations. Three widely used sorption isotherms were employed in this study.

40|$|Contamination of soils {{with three}} metals {{due to the}} highway and railway {{transport}} was studied. Copper was selected as a suitable indicator for both kinds of transportation. Sodium served to assess the level of contamination resulting from the <b>road</b> <b>salting</b> in winter. Mercury was determined in samples taken close to the railway {{in order to test}} its release from impregnated wooden ties. All analyses were determined using the methods of the trace element analysis; values are expressed as dry matter. The highest concentrations of copper, sodium and total mercury in soil samples were 52. 7 mg/kg, 770 mg/kg and 0. 181 mg/kg respectively. The highest copper content was observed in soils taken close to the railroad and the highway. Elevated sodium levels originated from winter <b>road</b> <b>salting</b> – the highest winter value was 770 mg/kg as compared with maximal summer value of 416 mg/kg. The concentration of total mercury in soils depended on the type of railway ties used – the highest values for location with wooden and concrete ties were 0. 181 mg/kg and 0. 145 mg/kg, respectively. Wooden railroad ties are considered as a potential source of mercury because of impregnation with antifungal mercury compounds...|$|R
