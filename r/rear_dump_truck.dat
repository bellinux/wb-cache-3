5000|$|Komatsu and Dresser Industries {{established}} Komatsu Dresser to make mining {{tractors and}} related equipment in 1988. [...] This 50-50 ownership lasted from September 1988 to August 1994, when Komatsu bought out Dressers share. Komatsus mining products were consolidated {{under the name}} Komatsu Mining Systems in 1997. To prevent brand-name confusion during these corporate changes, the name [...] "Haulpak" [...] {{was used for the}} product line Komatsu began with Dresser. The name [...] "Haulpak" [...] dates back to 1957 when LeTourneau-Westinghouse introduced a range of rear dump trucks known as [...] "Haulpaks". LeTourneau-Westinghouse equipment later became known simply as WABCO equipment in 1967. The name Haulpak was an industry term that eventually became applied to any type of <b>rear</b> <b>dump</b> <b>truck.</b> A detailed history of the development of the Haulpak can be found in Wabco Australia.|$|E
40|$|During 1999, {{there were}} six {{fatalities}} in surface mines involving haulage equipment colliding with a smaller vehicle or person, or backing {{over the edge of}} a dump point. All of these fatalities {{can be attributed to the}} extensive blind areas around large haulage equipment. Researchers at NIOSH are investigating various technologies that can be used to monitor these blind areas and provide information on nearby obstacles to an operator. So far, the following technologies: Electromagnetic Signal Detection, Radar, and Video Cameras, have been tested on <b>dump</b> <b>trucks</b> used in surface mining. The selection of these systems was based on their ability to handle the tough environmental conditions found in mining operations and how well they detected obstacles out to 40 or 50 feet beyond the <b>rear</b> of large <b>dump</b> <b>trucks.</b> Some of the manufacturers of available collision warning camera systems are listed.

The {{force on}} <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> body is telatively complicated, and {{different}} unloading working conditions will have {{effects on the}} body structure of <b>dump</b> <b>truck.</b> This paper made a modal analysis and feature buckling analysis of the body structure of <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> under the unloading situation, and also made a nonlinear analysis under the certain circumstances. Through the ANSYS analysis, the body vibration frequency and buckling modal shape was calculated and figured out, and the design of <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> body was optimized {{in order to make}} sure that the stiffness and stability meet the needs...|$|R

50|$|Moxy {{built the}} first {{prototype}} <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> in 1970. The first model was a heavy duty <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> drawn by a powerful tractor with rear wheels driven by hydraulic motors. The next version, an articulated <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> driven by a Scania diesel engine, D20, was also finished in 1970. The first prototypes were built in Molde, but then the company moved to Varhol by Elnesvågen in Fræna municipality, where a new factory was built. About the same time Moxy acquired Gjøvik based company Øveraasen Motorfabrikk & Mekaniske Verksted, which provided Moxy with useful engineering technology.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhile vehicle {{detection}} on highways {{has been}} reported before, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, intelligent monitoring system that aims at detecting hydraulic excavators and <b>dump</b> <b>trucks</b> on state-owned land has not been explored thoroughly yet. In this paper, we present an automatic, video-based algorithm for detecting hydraulic excavators and <b>dump</b> <b>trucks.</b> Derived from lessons learned from video processing, we proposed methods for foreground detection based on an improved frame difference algorithm, and then detected hydraulic excavators and <b>dump</b> <b>trucks</b> in the respective region of interest. From our analysis, we proposed methods based on inverse valley feature of mechanical arm and spatial-temporal reasoning for hydraulic excavator detection. In addition, we explored <b>dump</b> <b>truck</b> detection strategies that combine structured component projection with the spatial relationship. Experiments on real-monitoring sites demonstrated the promising performance of our system...|$|R
