September 9, 1966, is considered the official date of formation VVVAUSH (at the time - LVVAUSH). The Chelyabinsk Red Banner Military Aviation Institute of Navigators sent to Lugansk a number of officers who formed the school's backbone.

While the complement of basic symbol shapes used in mathematical and technical publishing is open-ended, it grows rather slowly. However, extension of the symbol set by modification and adaptation of existing symbols {{is a much more}} rapidly growing and productive area. That is the area being addressed here. The concept of mathematical variant tags was introduced in L 2 / 98 - 406, initially for the designation of different math alphabets. That use has now been bypassed, but additional uses proposed in L 2 / 99 - 049 are still amenable to this technique. A mathematical variant tag would act rather a like nonspacing combining mark, designating the desired modification of the symbol represented by the base code point. There are several obvious categories of modifications in current use in the mathematical literature. Size variants Only one size variant is proposed. Its purpose is to transform a binary relation into an n-ary operator, which is indicated visually by an increase in size and/or weight (as well as a change in location in a math expression). The requirement can be documented from existing mathematical literature.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, IAM {{policies are}} responsible for the design and compliant operation of IAM systems. Yet by far not every IAM policy is technically implemented. The IT of today’s companies is forced to adapt business changes and support the business in an optimal manner. Thus, directly customizing the IAM system according to every business change is hardly executed in practice because of the resulting efforts. Due to these reasons, we do not aim to exhaustively mine all possible IAM polices which are currently in place and technically enforce them as it would impose rigid restrictions to the system and potentially {{have a negative impact on}} business processes. However, we propose a mechanism which allows the system to learn current IAM policies and create recommendations regarding system operation. Consider the example of an international help desk who is in charge of processing orders regarding the IAM system (e.g. the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>assignment</b> of an entitlement or access to a specific application) with all requests requiring manual review.

40|$|Abstract—Nurse rerostering {{problems}} arise when {{at least one}} nurse is absent from his/her assigned tasks in the predetermined schedule. The scheduler should modify the task assignments in the schedule to fill up the vacancy {{and to make a}} new schedule which satisfies all important constraints such as required numbers and skill levels of nurses at every-day-shifts, the limit of workload and prohibited shift patterns for individual nurses and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> task <b>assignments</b> from nurses with as few modifications as possible. This paper proposes a heuristic method for solving nurse rerostering problems with an absence of nurses for several consecutive days. The method first separates the consecutive days of absences into a set of single-day absences and then solves each of the nurse rerostering problems with one-day absence one by one by using a recursive search technique and a tree search algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can generate new feasible schedules with a small modification of task assignments efficiently...|$|R

Optimal job scheduling enables more efficient utilization of resources, which in turn leads to more customers satisfaction. Solution procedures to the problem of job scheduling in cloud computing environment have mainly focused on optimizing one quality criterion.

Considering the virtual machine capabilities and having secured an appropriate method <b>for</b> <b>request</b> <b>assignments,</b> this solution procedure not only reduces the amount of memory needed, but minimizes the maximum job's makespan.

40|$|In the {{interference}} scheduling problem, one {{is given a}} set of n communication requests described by sourcedestination pairs of nodes from a metric space. The nodes correspond to devices in a wireless network. Each pair must be assigned a power level and a color such that the pairs in each color class can communicate simultaneously at the specified power levels. The feasibility of simultaneous communication within a color class is {{defined in terms of}} the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) that compares the strength of a signal at a receiver to the sum of the strengths of other signals. The objective is to minimize the number of colors as this corresponds to the time needed to schedule all requests.

40|$|International audienceThe {{potential}} {{availability of}} storage space at cellular and femtocell base-stations (BSs) raises the following question: How should one optimize performance through both load balancing and content replication when requests {{can be sent}} to several such BSs?

Cru- cially our request assignment scheme is based on a server price signal that jointly reflects content and bandwidth avail- ability.

40|$|The Frequency Assignment Problem (FAP) {{in radio}} {{networks}} {{is the problem}} of assigning frequencies to transmitters exploiting frequency reuse while keeping signal interference to acceptable levels. The FAP is usually modelled by variations of the graph coloring problem. The Radiocoloring (RC) of a graph G(V, E) is an assignment function Φ : V N such that |Φ(u) - Φ(v) | ≥ 2, when u, v are neighbors in G, and |Φ(u) - Φ(v) | ≥ 1 when the distance of u, v in G is two. The range of frequencies used is called span. Here, we consider the optimization version of the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) of finding a radiocoloring assignment of minimum span, called min span RCP. In this paper, we deal with a variation of RCP: that of satisfying frequency assignment requests with some periodic behavior. In this case, the interference graph is an (infinite) periodic graph. Infinite periodic graphs model finite networks that accept periodic (in time, e. g. daily) <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> frequency <b>assignment.</b> Alternatively, they may model very large networks produced by the repetition of a small graph. A periodic graph G is defined by an infinite two-way sequence of repetitions of the same finite graph G_i(V_i, E_i). The edge set of G is derived by connecting the vertices of each iteration G_i to some of the vertices of the next iteration G_i+ 1, the same for all G_i. The model of periodic graphs considered here {{is similar to that of}} periodic graphs in Orlin [13], Marathe et al [10]. We focus on planar periodic graphs, because in many cases real networks are planar and also because of their independent mathematical interest. We give two basic results: - We prove that the min span RCP is PSPACE-complete for periodic planar graphs. - We provide an O(n(Δ(G_i) + σ)) time algorithm, (where |V_i| = n, Δ(G_i) is the maximum degree of the graph G_i and σ is the number of edges connecting each G_i to G_i+ 1), which obtains a radiocoloring of a periodic planar graph G that approximates the minimum span within a ratio which tends to 2 as Δ(G_i) + σ tends to infinity...|$|R
