5|$|According to {{contemporaneous}} chronicler Robert of Torigni, on {{the death}} of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou in 1151 his second son, who was also called Geoffrey, inherited four castles. Robert did not specify which these were, but historian W. L. Warren speculated that Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau numbered amongst these castles {{as they were in the}} territory which may have been traditionally the inheritance of the second oldest son. Geoffrey <b>rebelled</b> <b>against</b> his older brother, Henry, in 1152. Henry negotiated with the castellans of the castles of Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau to surrender before laying siege to Château de Montsoreau. Following the loss of Montsoreau, Geoffrey surrendered to his brother. By 1156 Chinon, Loudun, and Mirebeau were back under Geoffrey's control. That year he readied them for war as he <b>rebelled</b> <b>against</b> Henry a second time. In the intervening years, his brother had been crowned King HenryII of England at the end of a long-running civil war. Henry besieged and captured Geoffrey's castles in the summer of 1156 and kept them under his control, giving Geoffrey an annuity of £1,500 in compensation. The presence of a treasury and one of HenryII's main arsenals marked Chinon as a particularly important castle in the 12thcentury. It was a primary residence of HenryII who was responsible for construction of almost all of the massive castle.|$|E
