5|$|NVC {{has also}} been {{reported}} as effective in reducing domestic violence. Male participants who graduated from an NVC-based batterer intervention program in California had zero percent <b>recidivism</b> within 5 years, according to the relevant District Attorneys' offices. The news report contrasted this with a <b>recidivism</b> rate of 40 percent within 5 years {{as reported by the}} Domestic Abuse Intervention Project for graduates of their batterer intervention program based on the Duluth Model, said to previously offer the lowest known domestic violence <b>recidivism</b> rate.|$|E
5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce <b>recidivism</b> from 37% to 21%, and the training was estimated as having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose <b>recidivism</b> is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in January 1999, he {{immediately}} replaced two top officials, and {{one-third of the}} remaining staff were replaced or left voluntarily. Press reports criticized the move as overly political and aggressive, particularly as it affected ongoing trials. In his first year, he founded the Norfolk Anti-Crime Council, a 35-member forum for judicial officers, police, and other local parties to discuss and co-ordinate anti-crime strategies. He established a pilot program for a drug court under Quincy District Court, which would provide an alternative sentencing pathway for nonviolent drug offenders, {{in an effort to}} reduce court backlogs and lower <b>recidivism</b> rates. He also expanded his office's juvenile crime unit. In late 2000 he laid the groundwork for the Norfolk Country Children's Advocacy Center, based on similar programs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, and it was fully established the following year. Keating's office also began an anti-bullying program in spring 2001. In 2002, his office was the first in Massachusetts to win a murder conviction in a case that lacked a victim's body.|$|E
25|$|The study {{concluded}} that the prisoners who graduated from the program had a <b>recidivism</b> rate of 8 percent. The study's control group had a <b>recidivism</b> rate of 20%. The overall State of Texas <b>recidivism</b> rate was 30%. According to the study, as a whole the group who participated in IFI had a higher likelihood of being rearrested than the control group, with 36% arrested within two years, while 35% of the control group was arrested within two years. 24% {{of all of the}} IFI participants were reimprisoned, while 20% of the control group was reimprisoned. The study did not track the employment statuses of members of the control group.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 study survey, {{showed that}} among nearly 275,000 prisoners {{released}} in 1994, 67.5% were rearrested within 3years, and 51.8% {{were back in}} prison. However, the study {{found no evidence that}} spending more time in prison raises the <b>recidivism</b> rate, and found that those serving the longest time, 61months or more, had a slightly lower re-arrest rate (54.2%) than every other category of prisoners. This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between <b>recidivism</b> and age upon release.|$|E

25|$|To {{prevent the}} <b>recidivism</b> of {{individuals}} with mental illness, a variety of programs are in place {{that are based on}} criminal justice or mental health intervention models. Programs modeled after criminal justice strategies include diversion programs, mental health courts, specialty mental health probation or parole, and jail aftercare/prison re-entry. Programs modeled after mental health interventions include forensic assertive community treatment and forensic intensive case management. It has been argued that the wide diversity of these program interventions points to a lack of clarity on which specific program components are most effective in reducing <b>recidivism</b> rates among individuals with mental illness.|$|E
25|$|To {{reform the}} justice system that help reduce <b>recidivism</b> and {{addresses}} {{the root causes of}} crime, Feuer created the Community Justice Initiative—an array of innovative, neighborhood-based programs addressing quality of life crimes, truancy, prostitution, the needs of homeless veterans and more.|$|E
25|$|The Last Mile {{started in}} 2011 under Chris Redlitz (entrepreneur and venture capital) initiative. The program aims to give {{resources}} and mentorship to inmates {{to help them}} {{find their way into}} tech startup entrepreneurship and reduce the rate of <b>recidivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In late April, the Florida Legislature {{voted to}} close the state's five {{juvenile}} boot camps. The camps were replaced by a less-militaristic program called STAR, which prohibited physical intervention against juvenile inmates. The STAR program had been almost 80 percent effective in test runs around the state at preventing <b>recidivism</b> among inmates.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to overcrowding, juvenile prisons are questioned for their overall effectiveness in rehabilitating youth. Many critics note high juvenile <b>recidivism</b> rates, {{and the fact}} that the most of the youths that are incarcerated are those from lower socio-economic classes (who often suffer from broken families, lack of educational/job opportunities, and violence in their communities).|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, {{with some studies}} reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by <b>recidivism</b> rates, though {{it is noted that}} one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal <b>recidivism</b> after treatment, a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today. However, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has of yet in a 2013 review examined if the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for cognitive behavioral therapy is mixed. A 2012 Cochrane Review of randomized trials found that CBT {{had no effect}} on risk of reoffending for contact sex offenders. Meta-analyses in 2002 and 2005, which included both randomized and non-randomized studies, concluded that CBT reduced <b>recidivism.</b> There is debate over whether non-randomized studies should be considered informative. More research is needed.|$|E
25|$|During 2014, Goldman Sachs {{sponsored}} a $250 million Social Impact Fund. Returns on the fund, {{launched by the}} Urban Investment Group, {{are linked to the}} success of a variety of projects with high social value, including affordable housing projects, pre-school education, and an educational project for prisoners designed to reduce <b>recidivism.</b> Between 2001 and 2014, over $3 billion of Goldman Sachs capital has been utilized for impact investing.|$|E
25|$|Researchers like Timothy Leary felt psychedelics could {{alter the}} {{fundamental}} personality structure or subjective value-system of an individual, to beneficial effect. His experiments with prison inmates were {{an attempt to}} reduce <b>recidivism</b> through a few short, intense sessions of psilocybin administered weeks apart with biweekly group therapy sessions in between. Psychedelic therapy was used {{in a number of}} other specific patient populations, including alcoholics, children with autism, and persons with terminal illness.|$|E
25|$|WriteAPrisoner.com is {{an online}} Florida-based {{business}} whose stated {{goal is to}} reduce <b>recidivism</b> {{through a variety of}} methods that include positive correspondence with pen-pals on the outside, educational opportunities, job placement avenues, resource guides, scholarships for children impacted by crime, and advocacy. The site began primarily as a place to post pen-pal profiles and requests for legal assistance for inmates and has evolved to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges in the life of an inmate.|$|E
25|$|A 1967 study where a judge {{randomly}} assigned (ordered) offenders to either clinical treatment, AA treatment, or to a no treatment (control) group. After one year 68% {{in the clinic}} group were rearrested, 69% in the AA group were rearrested, and 56% were rearrested in the group receiving no treatment. No {{statistically significant differences between}} the three groups were discovered in <b>recidivism</b> rate, in the number of subsequent rearrests or in time elapsed prior to rearrest. Like the Brandsma study, the results are inaccurate since the studies did not stop people not assigned to AA treatment from going to AA meetings.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison provides {{college education}} to incarcerated {{people to help}} reduce <b>recidivism</b> and poverty and strengthen families and communities. In 1998, {{as part of the}} get-tough-on-crime campaign, state and federal funding for college programs inside prison was stopped. Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitiation of incarcerated people, inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college-degree granting program. Under Anne Reissner, Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison was founded to restore college education at Sing Sing through private funding.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower <b>recidivism.</b> The effectiveness of treatment for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{surgical}} castration {{was used to}} lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive. It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non-randomized studies have reported that {{surgical castration}} reduces <b>recidivism</b> in contact sex offenders. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical castration and the Council of Europe works to bring the practice {{to an end in}} Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts.|$|E
25|$|Security {{infrastructure}} {{in the camp}} was not as developed as many of its more eastern counterparts. However, inhabitants who were poorly dressed, lacking money and were without knowledge of local dialects were quickly located {{and returned to the}} camp. Reclaimed prisoners were subsequently held for a time as punishment in an îlot called de los represaliados (of those suffering reprisals). In case of <b>recidivism,</b> they were sent to another camp. But an internee who could count on outside help could successfully escape, whether to Spain or a shelter on a flat in France. There were 755 who managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|Many {{associations}} with other personality traits are similar, although {{in one study}} the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with openness to experience in women. It {{has been suggested that}} psychopathy in men manifest more as an antisocial pattern while in women it manifests more as a histrionic pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and <b>recidivism</b> in women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, a Youth Offending Team (YOT) is a multi-agency {{team that}} is coordinated by a local authority, which is overseen by the Youth Justice Board. It deals with young offenders, sets up {{community}} services and reparation plans, and attempts to prevent youth <b>recidivism</b> and incarceration. YOTs were set up following the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act {{with the intention of}} reducing the risk of young people offending and re-offending, and to provide counsel and rehabilitation to those who do offend. Youth Offending Teams engage {{in a wide variety of}} work with young offenders (those under 18) in order to achieve their aims. YOTs supervise young people who have been ordered by the court to serve sentences in the community or in the secure estate. Sometimes, teams organise meetings between offenders and victims to encourage apologies and reparation.|$|E
25|$|A {{perpetrator}} {{found guilty}} {{by the court}} is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain {{the origins of the}} abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of <b>recidivism,</b> or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.|$|E
25|$|PFM {{paid the}} University of Pennsylvania's Center for Research on Religion and Urban Civil Society {{to conduct a}} study on the {{effectiveness}} of the IFI program in the Carol Vance Unit in Fort Bend County, Texas. The study considered the IFI participants and a control group. 177 prisoners participated in the IFI program, and 75 of those prisoners graduated. In order to graduate, a prisoner was required to continue participating in the program after his release, including complying with the employment requirement. The 102 prisoners who did not graduate either received early parole and did not finish, left the program, or were expelled from the program. The members of the IFI group who had their <b>recidivism</b> rates tracked were released from prison before September 1, 2000. PFM intended for the study to have a favorable result so that the study would assist PFM's efforts to receive federal funding.|$|E
25|$|Structured {{cognitive}} behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based {{process with}} core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities {{in the fields}} of behavioral health and psychology: most notably, Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage diabetes and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of criminal psychology in the effort to reduce <b>recidivism.</b>|$|E
500|$|Horses {{also provide}} {{psychological}} benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. [...] "Equine-assisted" [...] or [...] "equine-facilitated" [...] therapy {{is a form}} of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes. There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce <b>recidivism</b> when they leave.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Brunner {{was elected}} to an unexpired term on the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. [...] She was reelected in 2002. The Court of Common Pleas judges tested, {{approved}} and created a separate drug court to reduce addiction-related <b>recidivism.</b> Judges recommend repeat offenders who {{have been charged with}} non-violent felonies stemming from their drug or alcohol addictions for the program, which targets those repeatedly charged with theft, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks, prostitution or drug possession, which are all addiction related crimes. Brunner started the court in April 2004 after several years of research.|$|E
500|$|The Code of Virginia is the {{statutory}} law, {{and consists of}} the codified legislation of the General Assembly. The Virginia State Police is the largest law enforcement agency in Virginia.

500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into <b>recidivism.</b> Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E
500|$|About {{two months}} after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was {{announced}} that second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had given two positive tests for continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA, an erythropoietin derivative) on 20 and 28 May, before the Cinque Terre time trial and the Mount Vesuvius stage in the race's final week. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), cycling's governing body. It was announced on 8 August that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his results from the race. [...] fired him on 13 August. Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy against him by the labs handling the tests. A period of legal maneuvering between Di Luca and the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal (TNA) to suspend Di Luca for three years– while two years is a customary ban for a doping positive, CONI prosecutors sought a third year for <b>recidivism,</b> stemming from Di Luca's previous doping incident two years earlier. He was given a two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In October 2010, Di Luca was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the record. On 10 January 2011, he signed with [...] and indicated that he would return to the Giro in 2011 to support Katusha team leader Joaquim Rodríguez.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Recidivism</b> {{rates for}} sex {{offenders}} {{are lower than}} for the general criminal population. Estimated rates among child sex offenders vary. [...] One study found that 42% of offenders re-offended (either a sex crime, violent crime, or both) after they were released. Risk for re-offense was highest in the first 6 years after release, but continued to be significant even 10–31 years later, with 23% offending during this time. [...] A study done in California in 1965 found an 18.2% <b>recidivism</b> rate for offenders targeting the opposite sex and a 34.5% <b>recidivism</b> rate for same-sex offenders after 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{evidence}} suggests that increasing the severity of a punishment does not have much deterrent effect on crime, while increasing the certainty of punishment does. Clearly, enhancing the severity of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe they will be apprehended for their actions. A study by Canadian criminologist Paul Gendreau brought together the results of 50 different studies of the deterrent effect of imprisonment involving over 300,000 offenders. The report said: [...] "None of the analyses found imprisonment reduced <b>recidivism.</b> The <b>recidivism</b> rate for offenders who were imprisoned as opposed to given a community sanction was similar. In addition, longer sentences were not associated with reduced <b>recidivism.</b> In fact the opposite was found. Longer sentences were associated with a 3% increase in <b>recidivism.</b> This finding suggests some support for the (opposing) theory that prison may serve as a ‘school for crime’ for some offenders".|$|E
2500|$|Mental illness rarely {{stands alone}} when {{analyzing}} {{the risk factors}} associated with incarceration and <b>recidivism</b> rates. The American Psychological Association recommends a holistic approach to reducing <b>recidivism</b> rates among offenders by providing [...] "cognitive– behavioral treatment focused on criminal cognition" [...] or [...] " [...] services that target variable risk factors for high-risk offenders" [...] due to the numerous intersecting risk factors experienced by mentally ill and non-mentally ill offenders alike.|$|E
