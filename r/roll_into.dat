5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with {{few or no}} other characters to interact with. The series has been a 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> tight places and plant bombs.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{with the}} Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), {{many of the}} {{restrictions}} of what type of funds could be <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> an IRA and what type of plans IRA funds could be <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> were significantly relaxed. Additional legislation since 2001 has further relaxed restrictions. Essentially, most retirement plans can be <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> an IRA after meeting certain criteria, and most retirement plans can accept funds from an IRA. An example of an exception is a non-governmental 457 plan which cannot be <b>rolled</b> <b>into</b> anything but another non-governmental 457 plan.|$|R
5|$|The band's {{incorporation}} {{of rock and}} <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> their sound was an inspiration for groups such as Restless Heart, Shenandoah, Exile, Diamond Rio, Lonestar, Ricochet, and the Mavericks. According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of Country Music: The Encyclopedia, the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands {{that would not have}} received recognition {{had it not been for}} Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers. Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets. Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who {{is equipped with a}} Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E

Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and {{turn into a}} morph ball, which can <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement {{is not limited to}} a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, players {{must find}} and collect items that improve Samus's arsenal and suit, {{including}} weapons, armor upgrades for Samus's Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress {{herself into a}} ball in order to <b>roll</b> <b>into</b> narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple points, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that allows her to climb magnetic rails.|$|E
