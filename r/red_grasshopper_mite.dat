50|$|On a large scale, {{bifenthrin}} {{is often}} used against red imported fire ants. It is also effective against aphids, worms, ants, gnats, moths, beetles, earwigs, <b>grasshoppers,</b> <b>mites,</b> midges, spiders, ticks, yellow jackets, maggots, thrips, caterpillars, flies, fleas, and termites. It is mostly used in orchards, nurseries, and homes. In the agricultural sector, it is used in great amounts on certain crops, such as corn. About 70% of all hops and raspberries cultured in the United States are treated with bifenthrin.|$|R

Corn is starting to tassel across Iowa, and moisture stress is a growing concern. Fortunately, crop breeding has provided us with varieties with improved drought tolerance; however, that only works to a point.

50|$|Salamanders are {{opportunistic}} predators. They {{are generally}} not restricted to specific foods, but feed on almost any organism of a reasonable size. Large species such as the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) eat crabs, fish, small mammals, amphibians, and aquatic insects. In a study of smaller dusky salamanders (Desmognathus) in the Appalachian Mountains, their diet includes earthworms, flies, beetles, beetle larvae, leafhoppers, springtails, moths, spiders, <b>grasshoppers,</b> and <b>mites.</b> Cannibalism sometimes takes place, especially when resources are short or time is limited. Tiger salamander tadpoles in ephemeral pools sometimes resort to eating each other, and are seemingly able to target unrelated individuals. Adult blackbelly salamanders (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) prey on adults and young of other species of salamanders, while their larvae sometimes cannibalise smaller larvae.|$|R
40|$|After being a {{dominant}} decorated ware {{in the northern}} Southwest for centuries, Cibola White Ware ceased to be produced in the Grasshopper region of Arizona within a single generation, sometime between A. D. 1300 [...] 1325. The demise of Cibola White Ware {{and the increase in}} locally-produced Roosevelt and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>red</b> wares coincided with the transition to full dependence on agriculture in this region. This study draws on feminist theory, theories of technological change, and an extremely robust archaeological record to construct an explanatory model of this ceramic transition by exploring one critical feature of the context in which it occurred: the labor of Grasshopper women. The model proposes that Roosevelt and <b>Grasshopper</b> <b>red</b> ware pottery were less labor-intensive than Cibola White Ware pottery to produce and that their adoption was related to women's scheduling constraints associated with the rapid transition to agriculture...|$|R
50|$|The isabelline {{wheatear}} {{is an active}} and restless bird, moving across the ground with long hops, flitting {{into the air and}} perching on eminences or small bushes. Its posture is rather upright and it is constantly bobbing about and flaring, raising and lowering its tail. It sometimes flutters into the air to catch insect prey but mostly forages along the ground, probing the soil with its beak. Its diet includes ants, <b>grasshoppers,</b> moths, flies, <b>mites,</b> spiders and insect larvae, and it sometimes eats seeds as well.|$|R

Weeds should not be allowed to grow. Rotation of crops is of assistance in controlling cotton pests. Poisons seldom are needed, except in poisoned baits in the spring and against <b>red</b> spiders, <b>grasshoppers,</b> and 'worms' when they threaten the crop. Thorough fall plowing, winter cover crops, early spring preparation, and repeated cultivation during the season are important measures of insect control.

50|$|Veresina occidentalis {{can be used}} in {{the home}} garden for insect control. Verbesina occidentalis attracts the soldier beetle. The soldier beetle is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that the soldier beetle is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. The soldier beetle is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. The soldier beetle will also drink the nectar from the plant. When the soldier beetle drinks the nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of the soldier beetle will prey on other insects. The adult soldier beetles will eat the aphids, caterpillars, <b>grasshopper</b> eggs and <b>mites.</b> The larva of the soldier beetle hatches in the spring. The larva soldier beetles prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. The soldier beetle lays its eggs in the late summer.|$|R
40|$|Pax genes encode {{transcription}} {{factors that}} are highly evolutionarily conserved and are vital for animal development. Vertebrate Pax group III genes Pax 3 and Pax 7 are required for proper development of muscular and central nervous systems. In their roles in muscular systems, Pax 3 and Pax 7 specify myoblasts (muscle progenitor cells). Pax 3 is predominantly involved in embryonic myogenesis and specifies embryonic myoblasts. In contrast, Pax 7 specifies adult myoblasts (muscle satellite cells), and has been demonstrated to be vital for adult muscle regeneration. Recent evidence also implicates a role for Pax 7 in the conversion of certain stem cells to the myogenic lineage. The Australian freshwater crayfish Cherax destructor (yabby) possesses a phenomenal capability for almost limitless adult muscle regeneration. Interestingly, C. destructor undergoes two distinct types of adult muscle regeneration, and these appear {{to be driven by}} two distinct types of muscle progenitor/stem cell. C. destructor has a highly regulated system for normal muscle growth, which is strictly regulated around the periodic shedding of the growth-restricting exoskeleton. The muscle regeneration that occurs in this normal growth is driven predominantly by endogenous muscle satellite cells. C. destructor also possesses the fascinating ability to regenerate entire limbs, including all of the muscle contained within them. This process appears to utilise circulating haematopoietic stem cells as the dominant muscle progenitor cell (myoblast). The role for Pax 7 in adult muscle regeneration in vertebrates indicates that Pax group III genes may be appropriate candidates to study in muscle regeneration in C. destructor. Pax group III genes have been isolated in fruit fly, <b>grasshopper,</b> <b>mite</b> and jellyfish, and have not been demonstrated to be expressed during embryonic or adult myogenesis in any of these animals. Prior to this research, Pax genes had not been isolated from Crustacea. I have designed nested partially-degenerate primers to complement conserved regions of known arthropod Pax group III gene sequences, and used PCR and RT-PCR of C. destructor genomic DNA and embryonic RNA, respectively. Sequencing of reaction products confirmed the presence of a Pax group III gene in Crustacea. In this research I have isolated a single Pax group III gene from C. destructor which I have designated Cdpax 3 / 7. Cdpax 3 / 7 is unequivocally a Pax group III gene, and appears to be the only Pax group III gene present in C. destructor. Cdpax 3 / 7 contains two DNA binding domains characteristic of Pax group III proteins, the paired domain and the homeodomain. Cdpax 3 / 7 also contains an octapeptide motif characteristic of the majority of Pax group III proteins. Interestingly, Cdpax 317 is expressed as two alternate transcripts. One alternate transcript lacks a 93 nucleotide section corresponding to approximately one third of the paired domain, indicating that it may have altered DNA binding, and therefore function. RT-PCR expression assays indicate that Cdpax 3 / 7 is expressed embryonically (in whole C. destructor embryos), in normal non-regenerating adult muscle, in adult muscle undergoing normal regeneration, as well as in limb regeneration (both before and after myogenic differentiation). The gross expression pattern of Cdpax 3 / 7 in adult muscle regeneration is characteristic of the expression patterns of vertebrate Pax 7 in the analogous vertebrate process...|$|R
40|$|Mevinphos (Phosdrin) is a {{restricted}} organophosphate insecticide. Mevinphos {{is used to}} control aphids, <b>mites,</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> cutworms, leafhoppers caterpillars, and many other insects on {{a broad range of}} field, forage, vegetable, and fruit crops. Eleven products containing mevinphos are registered in California. Mevinphos can be applied by aerial spraying, but the majority of mevinphos used in California is applied to vegetables by boom spraying. Mevinphos can produce significant human toxicity by the inhalation, dermal, and oral routes of exposure. Mevinphos entered the risk assessment process because of its high acute toxicity. This document addresses the risk of both dietary and occupational exposure to mevinphos. RISK ASSESSMENT The risk assessment process consists of four aspects: hazard identification, dose response assessment, exposure evaluation, and risk characterization. Hazard identification entails review and evaluation of the toxicological properties of each pesticide. The dose-response assessment then considers the toxicological properties and estimates the amount which could potentially cause an adverse effect. The amount which will not result in an observable or measurable non-oncogenic effect is called the No-Observed-Effect Level, NOEL. In general, it i...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in ecology {{is to understand}} intraspecific variation in life histories. Variation in resource availability can lead to differences in reproductive allocation and life histories. Grasshoppers are a good organism {{for the study of}} variation in life histories, since they exhibit life history plasticity in response to biotic and environmental factors. An optimality model for grasshoppers was developed that predicts optimal total allocation to reproduction and optimal effort-per-offspring as functions of resource availability and mortality. Relative allocation to reproduction is predicted to increase with resource availability, while relative allocation to survival declines. A resource-based trade-off between egg size and number does not exist, as optimal egg size is predicted to be independent of resource intake. I examined if changes in reproductive allocation and survival of Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricus) under a range of resource availabilities fit the predictions of the model. The patterns of reproductive allocation and survival in the field were in qualitative agreement with the predictions. I examined the importance of density, resources, and parasitism on the life history patterns of grasshoppers. I conducted an experiment to examine if differences in reproductive allocation of M. sanguinipes are primarily explained by exploitative competition. Per capita resource availability explained a significant amount of the variation in reproduction, as expected with exploitative competition. M. sanguinpes grasshoppers appeared to trade off resource allocation to reproduction for that of allocation to survival, because per capita resource availability did not affect survival. Careful examinations of changes in life history characteristics in response to parasitism are lacking, despite the fact that parasites often influence resource availability for the host. I investigated the effects of a <b>grasshopper</b> ectoparasitic <b>mite</b> on <b>grasshopper</b> reproduction and survival. Mites had small effects on grasshopper survival. As predicted, both species had reduced initial and total reproduction, and completed development of a lower percentage of ovarioles initiated when parasitized. These experiments act to expand our knowledge of life history theory and further our understanding of grasshopper life history variation and population fluctuations...|$|R
30|$|Hunting is an {{integral}} activity of the Adi tribe. During the 1950 s, ownership over forest lands was decided through a lead hunting system, with an experienced designated hunter who set ecological boundaries with stone markers, and allotted a specific pocket to a particular hunter. Now, this tradition has changed with community-defined ecological boundary of a clan where they hunt wild games. Adi people identify more than 25 aquatic and terrestrial animal species used in local food systems. These include mongoose, squirrels, rats, monkeys, ringtails, <b>grasshoppers,</b> <b>red</b> ants, snails, shrimp, crabs, prawns, porcupines, pigs, male buffalo, mithun, forest cats, fish, snakes and various other reptiles. Hunting of larger forest animals is done by men, while insects, shrimps and prawns are generally collected by women. Wild animals are consumed in different forms along with various plant-based foods. Until 1980 s, these animals and aquatic resources were hunted and caught using manual tools and practices applying local plant materials. Harvesting was done carefully for maintaining forest biodiversity. Nowadays, however, younger generation uses air-guns and pistols to hunt wild game threatening the wildlife.|$|R
