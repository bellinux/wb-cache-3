50|$|Bergama is {{the site}} of ancient Pergamon, a major tourist {{attraction}} place. A project was worked out in 2005 to connect the site Asclepium down in the valley with the 3 km far Acropolis {{on the top of a}} steep hill north of Bergama by an aerial lift line. After rejection of this project by the <b>responsible</b> <b>official</b> <b>body</b> due to concerns over the conservation of the historical place, an alternate project for a much shorter route between Acropolis and its foothill north of the town found acceptance in 2006. Access to Acropolis on the narrow road by bus takes considerable time for the tourists, and any widening of the existing road is not permitted due to the archaeological status of the site.|$|E
