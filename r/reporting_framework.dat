40|$|The {{paper is}} a {{critical}} revision of the sufficiency of sustainability <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> to represent sustainability performance. The paper sustains that while frameworks facilitate recording, classifying, and summarizing sustainability data (i. e. economic, social and environmental), they are insufficient to represent organizational sustainability performance. Using Systems Theory and systems proprieties the thesis illustrates how sustainability <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> fail to sufficiently represent sustainability performance as an organizational management tool.

40|$|Even when clean audit {{reports are}} issued for not-for-profit {{organizations}} (NFPOs), misuse of donor resources may continue for years without detection by financial statement users. Previous research has established creative accounting, haphazard reporting, and fraud among NFPOs. As a result, aid {{has been reduced}} and some projects have been suspended. With Uganda as the study area, the key research question was the following: What {{is the impact of}} financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> on the quality of financial reports in Uganda, controlling for class of external auditors? The purpose of this quantitative, causal-comparative study was to establish whether <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> used by NFPOs in Uganda affect the quality of financial reports. Survey data through a researcher-developed instrument were collected from a purposefully selected sample of 74 NFPOs. Data included financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> as the independent variable, quality of financial reports as the dependent variable, and class of external auditors as a covariate. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Dhanani and Connolly 2 ̆ 7 s accountability theory was adopted as the central theory. Findings indicated that there were no significant associations between financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> and quality of financial reports. The highest quality score was 25. 2...|$|R

40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have identified the}} pivotal role of intellectual capital in the valuation of firms and the determination of their future earnings. Innovation in voluntary disclosure of intellectual capital lead by European firms, such as Celemi and Skandia, has generated a plethora of new <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> such as the Balanced Scorecard. However, {{there has been little}} support by the accounting profession to recognise the value of intellectual capital or adopt a common disclosure framework. There has also been very little progress by firms in extending their voluntary <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks,</b> beyond just rhetoric, and attempting to quantify their intellectual capital. This paper will critically evaluate the challenges faced by firms in disclosing the elements and value of their intellectual capital to the market. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{the need of}} {{harmonization}} of the financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> has become more acute, mostly because the capital markets are not restricted anymore by country borders and capital movement has outlined the phenomenon of globalization and internationalism. A significant step in harmonizing the financial reporting {{was done in the}} process of normalization through different sets of rules and principles, recognized and applied in many states are the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The process of international recognition of these standards continues along with conceptual development which is based on epistemological research on specific markets, industries, economies open to international capital flows. In this context it becomes of interest to identify and understand generally accepted and applied accounting elements which carry forward the accounting harmonization process along with factors and circumstances that create diversity in nationally applied financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of accrual accounting principles for government reporting {{in recent years}} has been complicated by the presence of two alternative financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks,</b> the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) framework and the Australian professional accounting standard rules. This paper presents the findings from a study of the 2004 - 05 and 2005 - 06 annual budgets prepared by the Australian Commonwealth government and the governments of the six Australian States and the two Australian Territories. The study examined the basis for the budget balance numbers (government surplus or deficit) headlined in the budgets of each of the nine governments over the two year period. Findings indicate the adoption of varying measurement bases and a resultant lack of inter-governmental and inter temporal comparability. A number of departures from the measurements prescribed in the <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> were also observed. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} years an {{increasing}} number of companies issued Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or Sustainability Reports to complement their traditional financial reporting. Companies use various sustainability reporting standards or develop their own <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> starting from the existing ones. This variation of practices pointed out by empirical research raises questions about the quality and comparability of sustainability reporting, its role in the sustainable development, and also about the suitability of accepting the plurality of <b>reporting</b> <b>frameworks</b> or the need for convergence. This study aims to investigate the issues of plurality and convergence in sustainability reporting standards, by mobilizing the discourses on regulation and the case of a group of companies in the IT industry in order to shed some light on the current challenges in this area. We frame a discussion on the opportunities and pitfalls of convergence in sustainability reporting regulations and contribute {{to a better understanding of}} this issue by academics, preparers, users and standard setter...|$|R

50|$|The SRS {{provides}} a new <b>reporting</b> <b>framework</b> for stakeholders {{in the social}} sector. In particular, it helps to document and communicate the results chain of individual projects. Moreover, several fundamental reporting elements such as organisational structure and finances are systematically captured in the SRS report, which creates a comprehensive picture of the organisation. Another objective of SRS is to promote an impact-orientation of social organisations. This should help focus the competition for donations and funding on a program's impact. Hence, focusing on the effectiveness and impact of program's will become a major issue.The efforts for reporting organisations and recipients of information can be kept minimal by: First, having a clearly defined <b>reporting</b> <b>framework</b> used by a multitude of organisations, donors, investors, and other stakeholders.
