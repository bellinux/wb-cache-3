50|$|At Epsom in June, Shirley Heights {{started at}} odds of 8/1 {{in a field}} of twenty-five runners for the Derby, with Inkerman, ridden by Lester Piggott being made 4/1 {{favourite}} in what was considered a substandard renewal of the race. The 25/1 outsider Hawaiian Sound, ridden by the American Willie Shoemaker took the lead soon after the start, and led the field into the straight as Shirley Heights appeared to be struggling with the downhill section course. A furlong from the finish, Hawaiian Sound looked the likely winner but Shirley Heights was making rapid progress in fourth. In the final strides, Starkey drove Shirley Heights through along the inside rail and won a photo-finish by a head from Hawaiian Sound with the 40/1 shot <b>Remainder</b> <b>Man</b> in third.|$|E

50|$|An {{heirloom}} in {{the strict}} sense {{was made by}} family custom, not by settlement. A settled chattel could be sold {{under the direction of the}} court, and the money arising under such sale is capital money. The court would only sanction such a sale if it could be shown that it was to the benefit of all parties concerned and if the article proposed to be sold was of unique or historical character.

Miller would hold a twenty-five percent interest in the magazine with Mitchell the <b>remainder.</b> Both <b>men</b> would retain their holdings until their deaths. https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog/miscellaneousre11yorkgoog_djvu.txt The success of Life magazine allowed Miller to indulge his passion for horse racing.|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{community}} of Krasnosielc {{ceased to exist}} in early September 1939. Following the German invasion of Poland, SS units of Panzer Division Kempf forced the Jews into the synagogue and massacred them there. A day later, the <b>remainder</b> (mostly <b>men)</b> were machine-gunned at the same location. The anti-Jewish massacre became widely publicized in Berlin as {{the first of its}} kind on Polish soil. The perpetrators received sentences of a few years, and their superiors were replaced.|$|R
50|$|The bridges are twin truss arch bridges with a steel through-arch in the middle. Both {{crossings}} have a 93 ft navigation clearance, {{which was}} designed to allow tall lake freighters and tanker ships to pass beneath it. A toll is collected from all northbound traffic at a six-lane toll plaza on the Tonawanda side of the bridge. Lanes one and six are reserved for E-ZPass customers; the <b>remainder</b> are <b>manned</b> booths.

60|$|Next night {{a couple}} of hundred swordsmen crept up to a ravine, within fifty yards of the camp, and {{suddenly}} fell upon the West Surrey regiment. They were met by such a hail of bullets that most of them dropped, and of the <b>remainder</b> not a <b>man</b> reached Hallal.|$|R
50|$|The squadron's {{resources}} were divided on 1 July 1977, a part being retained by the 11th, the <b>remainder</b> used to <b>man</b> the new 340th Air Refueling Group, Heavy, and the 340th Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.

60|$|So slight {{had been}} the fire that only {{two members of the}} company were {{detailed}} to do the overhauling--that, is to thoroughly go through the building from top to bottom to make certain no spark had been left which might be fanned into a flame--and the <b>remainder</b> of the <b>men</b> were ordered back to the house.|$|R
60|$|As {{they spoke}} a boat laden with {{provisions}} came alongside, and all hands were at once engaged transferring her load to the cutter.

Then he made his maiden speech.|$|R
50|$|A {{portion of}} Drew's {{regiment}} deserted in late 1861. Following the Battle of Old Fort Wayne in October 1862, {{most of the}} <b>remainder</b> of Drew's <b>men,</b> including Maj. Thomas Pegg, deserted to the Union army. What remained of his troops was combined with Watie's regiment and reorganized as the First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Rifles with Watie in command.|$|R
50|$|Things did {{not look}} good for the Date clan. Three of his {{valuable}} forts were taken, {{and one of his}} chief retainers, Moniwa Yoshinao was killed in battle. The allies pressed on towards the Seto River. Date tried to force them back but failed. Date gathered his remaining forces for a last stand. But the next morning no doubt to the Date's amazement the main army picked up and marched away. These were Satake Yoshishige's men. In his absence the Satomi clan had attacked his lands in Hitachi Province. The allies thought they could not take down Motomiya with the <b>remainder</b> of <b>men</b> they had left, so they too retreated.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{leaves the}} {{mountain}} and seals {{the door with the}} Key and Crown inside, telling the <b>remainder</b> of Drazen's <b>men</b> that the power of Lord Alcaman was just a myth.

50|$|Fitzgerald {{decided to}} set up convict hiring depots in areas where men had {{the best chance of}} finding employment. Country depots were planned for York, Toodyay and Bunbury and {{approximately}} 40 men would be sent to each district. Ticket-of-leave men would then be hired out by local settlers to do whatever work was required by them. The <b>remainder</b> of the <b>men</b> were stationed in the Perth and Fremantle areas.|$|R
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army. The <b>remainder</b> of Robb's <b>men</b> sneak up on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|R
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange that {{in such a}} state of affairs the captain should be willing to keep the sea with his ship. But the truth was, that by lying in harbour, he ran the risk of losing the <b>remainder</b> of his <b>men</b> by desertion; and as it was, he still feared that, in some outlandish bay or other, he might one day find his anchor down, and no crew to weigh it.|$|R

5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the <b>remainder</b> of his <b>men</b> to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|R
25|$|The Boer leaders soon {{agreed on}} a plan. Half of Beyers' men would stay behind to keep Broadwood from marching to the rescue. The <b>remainder,</b> about 1500 <b>men,</b> were split into three attacking groups. Beyers would lead his {{commando}} against 300 British pickets on the mountaintop. Beyers detached Commandant Badenhorst to attack the camp from the west. De la Rey would capture several kopjes in the Moot to the south. If all went well, Clements' brigade would be trapped and destroyed.|$|R

60|$|After {{remaining}} {{some time}} at the village, until they supposed the Blackfeet to have left the neighborhood, they set off with some of Mr. Cerre's men for the cantonment at Salmon River, where they arrived without accident. They informed Captain Bonneville, however, that not far from his quarters they had found a wallet of fresh meat and a cord, which they supposed had been left by some prowling Blackfeet. A few days afterward Mr. Cerre, with the <b>remainder</b> of his <b>men,</b> likewise arrived at the cantonment.|$|R
50|$|In 1848 the British Governor of the Cape, Sir Harry Smith, {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} declaring British sovereignty {{over all the}} lands {{to the north and}} to the south of the Vaal river. Commandant-General Andries Pretorius led the commandos against the British forces later that year, at the battle of Boomplaats, near Smithfield. The Boer commandos were defeated and General Pretorius and the <b>remainder</b> of his <b>men</b> fled north across the Vaal river. The Volksraad from Winburg was transferred to Potchefstroom and the South African Republic was established as the name of the new country.|$|R
50|$|After a two-hour-long {{artillery}} barrage, Qing forces {{abandoned the}} walls of Niuzhuang with almost no resistance, fleeing into town. However, with further retreat cutoff, the Qing forces resorted to urban warfare, contesting the city street-by-street in what was often hand-by-hand combat. However, by nightfall the fighting had ceased {{with a large number}} of Qing soldiers breaking through Japanese lines and fleeing into the countryside, and with the <b>remainder</b> (approximately 600 <b>men)</b> surrendering. As with previous campaigns, a large quantity of supplies and weapons were captured by the Japanese.|$|R
5000|$|When two men die under mysterious {{circumstances}} {{and a third}} disappears after appealing to Wolfe for protection, suspicion falls on Paul Chapin, a controversial author and friend of the three men who was severely injured many years ago at their hands {{as a result of}} a hazing prank.

50|$|Fort Foster was {{originally}} built in December 1836 {{under the direction}} of Lt. Col. William S. Foster on the site of Fort Alabama.

50|$|The {{truck was}} {{bogged down in}} an area of marshy ground near the Gorno-Uralsk railway line, during which all the bodies were {{unloaded}} onto carts and taken to the disposal site. The sun was up by the time the carts came within sight of the disused mine, which was a large clearing at a place called the Four Brothers. Yurovsky's men first gobbled on hardboiled eggs supplied by the local nuns (food that was meant for the imperial family), while the <b>remainder</b> of Ermakov's <b>men</b> were ordered back to the city as Yurovsky did not trust them and was displeased with their drunkenness.|$|R
25|$|Reports {{began to}} reach Nader of Koprulu Pasha's {{departure}} from Kars {{with the intent}} of engaging the Persian army.

Having invested his troops round Tiflis and Yerevan also Nader took the <b>remainder</b> of his <b>men</b> and marched west. An Ottoman army of perhaps 130,000 men (according to Astarabadi, Nader's court historian) under Koprulu Pasha was decimated by Nader's advance guard of only 15,000 or so men.|$|R
2500|$|The strong Castalla {{position}} {{consisted of}} a castle-topped ridge that overlooked a deep stream bed. A spur projecting forward from the ridge tended to split any attack on the position. Further, a flooded stream protected {{the right of the}} Anglo-Allied line. Murray put Whittingham's Spanish division in a fortified position on the left flank. Adam's brigade held the left-center and Mackenzie's division held the right-center. The British commander posted Clinton's division on the right flank. Part of General Roche's division was placed in front of Clinton, supporting a cavalry screen. The <b>remainder</b> of Roche's <b>men</b> {{and the rest of the}} cavalry were positioned behind Castalla castle in reserve.|$|R
