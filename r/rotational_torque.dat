50|$|Buoyancy, Gravity, and Rotational Torques: Buoyancy forces {{counteract}} gravity {{forces and}} create <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> (metacentric effects). These torques {{can be used}} to increase load on connective tissue.|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, τ _L is {{insufficient}} to reach the leader point (the goal eventually) in most cases. This is because the sideward speed is absolutely dependent on the forward speed, i.e., the bipedal gait is a nonholonomic system similar to wheeled robots. To overcome this limitation of the sideward speed, an additional <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> τ _S is required.|$|R
30|$|The leader point {{receives}} the reaction force -f_S, which rotates it. Note {{that the point}} of load of -f_S {{is regarded as the}} rear of the leader point -t_R/ 2, namely the <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> of the leader point is the same as τ _S by canceling the sign. This reaction would result in that the robot moves only straight since the attitude error between the robot and the leader point becomes equal to 0 and the sideward error also becomes equal to 0.|$|R
50|$|A {{major concern}} during salvage is {{preventing}} <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> {{from becoming a}} transverse force moving the ship sideways. , lost like the Oklahoma in the Pearl Harbor attack, {{was meant to be}} recovered by a similar rotation after the Oklahoma. As the Utah was rotated, however, its hull did not catch on the harbor bottom, and the vessel slid towards Ford Island. The Utah recovery effort was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{multiple}} uses, slewing drives {{come in a}} variety of model sizes, performance ranges and mounting characteristics. The drives are well suited for applications that require both load holding and <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> from the same gear box. They can also be made with dual axes of rotation, (turning axes at the same time) or with dual drives on the same axis, (two worm threads driving the same ring gear in one axis).|$|E
50|$|In September 2013, Dillon Aero {{released}} the DGP2300 gun pod for the M134D-H. It contains 3,000 rounds, enough ammunition {{to fire the}} minigun for a full minute. The system is entirely self-contained, {{so it can be}} mounted on any aircraft that can handle the weight, <b>rotational</b> <b>torque,</b> and recoil force (190 lb) of the gun. The pod has its own battery which can be wired into the aircraft's electrical system to maintain a charge.|$|E
30|$|The {{attractive}} forces, f_L (precisely f̂_L, {{which was}} replaced into f_L for simplicity) and f_G, and the <b>rotational</b> <b>torques,</b> τ _L, τ _G, and τ _S, {{are given in}} above sections. Besides, the force to avoid the obstacles, f_O (and τ _O), and the force {{to escape from the}} stationary points, f_E, are designed in Appendices A, B, and C. Accordingly, the reference gait speed, v^ref = (v_x^ref, v_y^ref, v_w^ref)^, and the leader point’s position, p^L = (p_x^L, p_y^L, p_w^L)^, are updated under the influence of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear train also provides stability due to an even distribution of mass and increased <b>rotational</b> stiffness. <b>Torque</b> applied radially onto the gears of a {{planetary gear}} train is transferred radially by the gear, without lateral pressure on the gear teeth.|$|R

50|$|Blade {{pitch control}} is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. While {{operating}}, a wind turbine's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the blades stops the rotor during emergency shutdowns, or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> {{in the event of}} wind gusts.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{innovation}} {{is that of}} coaxial electric helicopters. The system's simple direction control and freedom from torque induced yaw have, in recent years, made it a good candidate on small models for beginner and/or indoor use. Models of this type, {{as in the case}} of a full-scale helicopter, eliminate <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> and can have extremely quick control response, both of which are very pronounced in a CCPM model. Most cheaper models do not have a swashplate, but instead use a third rotor on the tail to provide pitch control. These helicopters have no roll control and have limited mobility.|$|E
50|$|The motion {{transmitted}} by the stem {{may be a}} linear force, a <b>rotational</b> <b>torque,</b> {{or some combination of}} these (Angle valve using torque reactor pin and Hub Assembly). The valve and stem can be threaded such that the stem can be screwed into or out of the valve by turning it in one direction or the other, thus moving the disc back or forth inside the body. Packing is often used between the stem and the bonnet to maintain a seal. Some valves have no external control and do not need a stem as in most check valves.|$|E
40|$|Chiral magnets like MnSi form lattices of skyrmions, i. e. {{magnetic}} whirls, which react sensitively {{to small}} electric currents j above a critical current density jc. The interplay of these currents with tiny gradients {{of either the}} magnetic field or the temperature can induce a rotation of the magnetic pattern for j>jc. Either a rotation by a finite angle of up to 15 degree or [...] for larger gradients [...] a continuous rotation with a finite angular velocity is induced.

40|$|Summary The double-saloon-door {{seafloor}} spreading {{model was}} developed in the Western Mediterranean. During subduction rollback, opposite <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> are driven by the pull of a sinking slab with a curved hingeline. This propels simultaneous opposite rotations of terranes in a backarc environment. The process also occurred in the Pannonian, Aegean, Caribbean and Japan Sea basins. Unlike previous models, this novel theory, when applied to Gondwana breakup, explains arc-orthogonal rifting and seafloor spreading, clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of the Falkland Islands Block and the Ellsworth Whitmore Terrane, the separation of these terranes in a northwest southeast direction, and their eventual accretion to South America and East Antarctica respectively. As in other cases, the Gondwana terranes comprise parts of a pre-existing retroarc fold / thrust belt (the Permo-Triassic Gondwanide Orogeny). Extension and microplate rotations in the backarc are accommodated by rollback and simultaneous crustal shortening at the adjacent subduction zone / accretionary wedge...|$|R
50|$|Due to the offset {{between the}} cartridge's axis (which is {{approximately}} tangential to the disc) and the tonearm's pivot, the force applied (through friction) by the rotating disc to the cartridge tends {{to draw the}} tonearm {{toward the center of}} the record and distort the balance of the sound and of the wear suffered by the stylus and the vinyl groove. To prevent this, an appropriately-sized opposing force (a <b>rotational</b> <b>torque)</b> is applied at the tonearm. This is accomplished in various ways by dedicated mechanisms, depending on the tonearm's manufacturer, and ranging from a small counterweight adjustable by a knob, to adjustable spring or magnetic mechanisms, usually calibrated in grams of force.|$|E
50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's bleed air system. From there, the air flows via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's starter motor. The starter motor converts {{the energy of the}} moving air to <b>rotational</b> <b>torque.</b> The starter motor is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|E
50|$|Less commonly, {{there can}} be a failure in the {{presumption}} that a door breechlock ring cannot turn when the door is under pressure. The geometry of the camming ramps results in a precise <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> tending to open the door when pressure acts against the inside of the door. This force also creates a friction which resists this rotation. If the coefficient of friction on the ramps is low enough, then the lock ring can move on its own. It can even buckle the hydraulic actuators used to turn the ring. The interlock devices on autoclave doors are intended to prevent improper sequences, not to mechanically restrain the door against movement. Thus, the interest of safety is best served when the control system incorporates multiple devices providing not only redundancy but a variety of methods, the failure of any one of which cannot defeat the entire safety system.|$|E
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{achieving}} a desired interaction performance for our compliant humanoid robot (COMAN), {{in this paper we}} propose a semi-autonomous control framework and evaluate it experimentally in a valve turning setup. The control structure consists of various modules and interfaces to identify the valve, locate the robot in front of it and perform the manipulation. The manipulation module implements four motion primitives (Reach, Grasp, Rotate and Disengage) and realizes the corresponding desired impedance profile for each phase to accomplish the task. In this direction, to establish a stable and compliant contact between the valve and the robot hands, while being able to generate the sufficient <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> depending on the valve's friction, Rotate incorporates a novel dual-arm impedance control technique to plan and realize a task-appropriate impedance profile. Results of the implementation of the proposed control framework are firstly evaluated in simulation studies using Gazebo. Subsequent experimental results highlight the efficiency of the proposed impedance planning and control in generation of the required interaction forces to accomplish the task...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a novel active device for robot-assisted {{rehabilitation}} that accommodates transitional movements of the knee joint {{as well as its}} rotation, enabling a perfect match between human joint axes and the device axes. Automatically adjusting its joint axes, the proposed device is not only capable of guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extends the usable range of motion for the knee joint. Moreover, the adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the exoskeleton, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting it for adjustments. The proposed system is different from the similar works in literature in that it supports both passive translational movements of the knee joint and independent active control of these degrees of freedom. In particular, we introduce implementation details of a prototype that features compact design and combines the power of three actuators to achieve high <b>rotational</b> <b>torques,</b> detail the model based impedance controller utilized to adjust interaction forces and present the experimental characterization of the exoskeleton...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} ulnar {{collateral}} ligament (UCL) reconstructive (i. e. “Tommy John”) surgeries performed on youth baseball pitchers {{have more than}} doubled since 2000 [1]. Routinely pitching while fatigued is considered a leading factor associated with UCL injuries; adolescent pitchers who had elbow or shoulder surgery were 36 {{times more likely to have}} routinely pitched with arm fatigue [1]. MLB/USA Baseball Pitch Smart guidelines limit 9 - 10 yr. old pitchers to a maximum 75 pitches per game, a figure based on long-term studies related to injury prevention [2]. Several studies have shown that pitching kinematics (e. g. elbow flexion/extension and pronation/supination, scapulothoracic internal-external rotation) may change as adult pitchers reach muscular fatigue [3], and such kinematic changes could result in higher elbow and shoulder <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> that may increase injury risk [4]. Several biomechanical studies have been done on ~ 12 yr. old youth pitchers [5, 6] but none have been reported at the 9 - 10 yr. old level.

Unfortunately, styluses available in the market today are all passive instruments that are primarily used for writing and pointing. In this paper, we describe a novel stylus capable of displaying certain vibrotactile and inertial haptic effects to the user. Our stylus is equipped with two vibration actuators at the ends, which are {{used to create a}} tactile sensation of up and down movement along the stylus. The stylus is also embedded with a DC motor, which is used {{to create a sense of}} bidirectional <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> about the long axis of the pen. Through two psychophysical experiments, we show that, when driven with carefully selected timing and actuation patterns, our haptic stylus can convey movement and <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> information to the user.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Football turf is {{increasingly}} used in European soccer competition. Little is known on the <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> that players experience on these fields. High rotational torques between the shoe outsole and the sports surface has been correlated with torsional injuries {{of the lower}} limb and knee. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of six parameters that could influence the <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> between the shoe outsole and the latest generation football turf. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A testing apparatus was constructed to measure the peak torque generated during a controlled rotation of the foot. Six parameters that could potentially influence the frictional forces, were considered: (1) the sports surface, (2) the shoe outsole cleat design, (3) the weather conditions, (4) the weight, (5) {{the presence of an}} impact and (6) the direction of rotation. RESULTS: The football turf without infill showed significantly lower frictional torques than natural grass whereas a football turf with sand/rubber infill had significantly higher torques. Blades were associated with significantly higher torques than studs on natural grass and on one football turf with sand/rubber infill. Dry weather was associated with higher torques only for the football turf without infill. The torque increased linearly and significantly with an increasing vertical load. The <b>rotational</b> <b>torque</b> increased significantly following an impact. Torques on external rotational movements were significantly higher with blades. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in rotational torques are found and could be seen as potential risk factors for torsional injuries of the lower limb.

40|$|Turbo-pumps have weak points, {{such as the}} pumping {{operation}} is unstable on the positive slope of the head curve and/or the cavitation occurs at the low suction head. To improve simultaneously both weak points, the first author invented the unique pumping unit composed of the tandem impellers and the peculiar motor with the double rotational armatures. The front and the rear impellers are driven by the inner and the outer armatures of the motor, respectively. Both impeller speeds are automatically and smartly adjusted {{in response to the}} pumping discharge, while the <b>rotational</b> <b>torques</b> between both impellers/armatures are counter-balanced. Such speeds contribute to suppress successfully not only the unstable operation at the low discharge but also the cavitation at the high discharge, as verified with the axial flow type pumping unit in the previous paper. Continuously, this paper investigates experimentally the effects of the tandem impeller profiles on the pump performances and the rotational speeds against the discharge, using the impellers whose loads are low and/or high at the normal discharge. The worthy remarks are that (a) the unstable operation is suppressed as expected and the shut off power is scarcely large in the smart control, (b) the blade profile contributes to determine the discharge giving the maximum/minimum rotational speed where the reverse flow may incipiently appears at the front impeller inlet, (c) the tandem impeller profiles scarcely affect the rotational speeds, while the loads of the front and the rear impellers ar...|$|R
