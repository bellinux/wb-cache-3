The investigation works show that the ecological risk over the territory mainly depends on major indicators – relief, ravine intensity, the hydrographical network’s density, the tillage and forestation degree, lands stabilizing the environment, the land’s degree of development, the ecological dangerous objects placement, the anthropogenic impact’s level. The ecological situation will also be directly influenced by animal and human wastage t/km 2, which are formed and stocked on several areas. The detailed analysis for the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moldova’s</b> localities indicates a big variability of the indexes which will determine the ecological situation and the anthropogenic impact’s level over some areas. The improvement of the territory’s stability can be achieved by decreasing the arable land and the tree plantations - viticulture quota, by increasing the areas with hay, grass land, sylvan areas, lakes and plashes, and by decreasing the anthropogenic impact and by applying anti erosion measures on slopes...|$|R
