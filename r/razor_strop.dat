It was {{captured}} by the French privateer L'Alliance captained by Dupuy on 15 April 1799. The ship was condemned in Basseterre, Guadeloupe with a total loss of cargo which consisted of flour, copper, stills, lard, soap, candles, onions, cheese, oil, <b>razor</b> <b>strops,</b> and bags. A court case claimed the brig had a commission from the President to capture French armed vessels. The ship was insured for $7,000 and John Caldwalader Jr, and Frank S.

5000|$|A <b>razor</b> <b>strop</b> (or razor strap) is a {{flexible}} strip of leather, canvas, denim fabric, balsa wood, or other soft material, used to straighten and polish {{the blade of}} a straight razor, a knife, or a woodworking tool like a chisel. In many cases stropping re-aligns parts of the blade edge that have been bent out of alignment. In other cases, especially when abrasive polishing compound is used, stropping may remove {{a small amount of}} metal. Stropping can also burnish (i.e. push metal around on) the blade.|$|E

The velvety cut surface of the fruiting body was traditionally used as a strop for finishing the finest of edges on razors. It is also said to have medicinal properties.|$|E

Cordovan is an equine leather made from the fibrous flat muscle (or shell) beneath the hide on the rump of the horse. [...] The leather derives its name from the city of Cordoba, Spain, where it was first practiced by the Visigoths in the seventh century, and later also by the Moors. It is a difficult and expensive leather to make, and in the late 19th and early 20th century was mostly used for <b>razor</b> <b>strops</b> to sharpen <b>razors</b> in barber shops. More recently it has been increasingly used for shoes, wallets, and watch straps due to its aesthetic qualities and exceptional durability. Shell cordovan has a unique non-creasing characteristic.|$|R

Gary had a troubled {{relationship with his}} father, whom his youngest brother Mikal described as a [...] "cruel and unreasonable man." [...] Frank Gilmore, Sr. was strict and quick to anger, and would often whip his sons Frank, Jr., Gary and Gaylen with a <b>razor</b> <b>strop,</b> whip or a belt for little or no reason. Less often, he would beat his wife. He mellowed somewhat with age: Mikal reported that Frank whipped him only once, and never did it again after Mikal told him, [...] "I hate you." [...] In addition, Frank and Bessie would argue loudly and verbally abuse each other. Frank would anger Bessie by calling her crazy, and defame Brigham Young, the second president and prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as [...] "Bring 'em Young." [...] Bessie would retaliate by calling him a [...] "Cat-licker" [...] Catholic and threatening to kill him some night. This abuse continued for years, and caused considerable turmoil within the Gilmore family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{family moved}} to South Central Los Angeles in 1930, the city where Charles Bukowski's father and {{grandfather}} had previously worked and lived. Young Charles spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet [...] "Heini", meaning German, in his early youth. In the 1930s the poet's father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical Ham on Rye Charles Bukowski says that, with his mother's acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense. During his youth, Bukowski was shy and socially withdrawn, a condition exacerbated during his teen years by an extreme case of acne. Neighborhood children ridiculed his German accent and the clothing his parents made him wear. In Bukowski: Born Into This, a 2003 film, Bukowski states that his father beat him with a <b>razor</b> <b>strop</b> {{three times a week}} from the ages of six to eleven years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain. The depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.|$|E

60|$|I had {{accompanied}} Mr. Horne to the Rhine; {{and we had}} reached Brussels on our return, just {{at the close of}} that revolution which ended in affording a throne to the son-in-law of George the Fourth. At that moment General Chasse's name and fame were in every man's mouth, and, like other curious admirers of the brave, Mr. Horne determined to devote two days {{to the scene of the}} late events at Antwerp. Antwerp, moreover, possesses perhaps the finest spire, and certainly one of the three or four finest pictures, in the world. Of General Chasse, of the cathedral, and of the Rubens, I had heard much, and was therefore well pleased that such should be his resolution. This accomplished we were to return to Brussels; and thence, via Ghent, Ostend, and Dover, I to complete my legal studies in London, and Mr. Horne to enjoy once more the peaceful retirement of Ollerton rectory. As we were to be absent from Brussels but one night we were enabled to indulge in the gratification of travelling without our luggage. A small sac-de-nuit was prepared; brushes, combs, <b>razors,</b> <b>strops,</b> a change of linen, &c. &c., were carefully put up; but our heavy baggage, our coats, waistcoats, and other wearing apparel were unnecessary. It was delightful to feel oneself so light-handed. The reverend gentleman, with my humble self by his side, left the portal of the Hotel de Belle Vue at 7 a.m., in good humour with all the world. There were no railroads in those days; but a cabriolet, big enough to hold six persons, with rope traces and corresponding appendages, deposited us at the Golden Fleece in something less than six hours. The inward man was duly fortified, and we started for the castle.|$|R

They consisted, according to faithful detailed report, of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton socks; two shirts, five collars, five handkerchiefs; a pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps; high tan laced boots; three suits of cheap cotton underclothes; his Sunday suit, which was dead black in color, and unimaginative in cut; four ties; a fagged toothbrush, a comb and hairbrush, a <b>razor,</b> a <b>strop,</b> shaving soap in a mug; a not very clean towel; and nothing else whatever.|$|R

Atop these would be fastened a slicker or poncho, to be easily accessible in case the weather turned, and quite possibly a winter jacket. On the pommel would hang a canteen and the stake rope and picket peg for the saddle horse, while those of the pack animal would probably ride in a saddlebag.|$|R

The distal end of elliptical skin is not cut off but remains attached to the body like a pedicled flap. The surgeon pulls the end of the skin and puts his finger on the skin surface during the defatting procedure. This looks similar to a barber sharpening a <b>razor</b> using a <b>strop</b> belt.

5000|$|To sharpen or {{finish the}} blade using a {{suspended}} <b>strop,</b> the <b>razor</b> is pushed toward the suspension ring while both {{the back and}} the cutting edge lie flat on the strop and {{with the back of}} the blade. No pressure should be applied on the cutting edge. A strop may be two sided with leather on one side and cloth on the other side. The cloth is used for blade alignment and sharpening. The leather is for finishing.The stropping process involves sliding the razor blade flat on the strop; upon reaching the end of the cloth or leather near the suspension ring, the blade is turned about its back (clockwise for a right-handed barber; counter-clockwise for a left-handed one) until the cutting edge touches the strop. It is then pulled toward the rectangular handle of the strop with back and cutting edge flat on the strop as before. The blade is moved in a slightly diagonal direction so to give every point of the edge a chance to touch the strop, without applying too much pressure. This process aligns the cutting edge properly with the back of the blade, avoiding [...] "bumps" [...] on the cutting edge. Rotating the blade on the strop about the cutting edge can damage it because such use will impact the micro-alignment of the edge. Depending on use and condition, the blade can be sharpened occasionally by using a <b>razor</b> hone. <b>Strops</b> prepared with pastes containing fine grit are also used for honing but are not recommended for the inexperienced user, as they can easily rake off the edge if they apply the wrong amount or exert too much pressure.Some strops have a linen or canvas back embedded with a fine abrasive used to maintain a sharp edge before final polishing with the leather side. A face's worth of thick hair may require multiple stroppings for one shave, but a blade is usually honed only {{two or three times a}} year. Occasional regrinding by a professional may be required to restore a badly worn or damaged edge.|$|R
6000|$|The {{idea that}} shaving is a duty--ceremonial, {{as among the}} Egyptian priests, or social merely, as among ourselves--is older than the {{invention}} of steel or even of bronze razors. Nothing is more remarkable in savage life than {{the resolution of the}} braves who shave with a shell or with a broken piece of glass, left by European mariners. A warrior will throw himself upon the ground, and while one friend sits on his head, and another holds his arms and prevents him from struggling, a third will scrape his chin with the shell or the broken bottle-glass till he rises, bleeding, but beardless. Macaulay, it seems, must have shaved almost as badly with the razor of modern life. When he went to a barber, and, after an easy shave, asked what he owed, the fellow replied, [...] "Just what you generally give the man who shaves you, sir." [...] "I generally give him two cuts on each cheek," [...] said the historian of England. Shaving requires a combination of qualities which rarely meet in one amateur. You should have plenty of razors, unlike a Prussian ambassador of the stingy Frederick. This ambassador, according to Voltaire, cut his throat with the only razor he possessed. The chin of that diplomatist must have been unworthy alike of the Court to which he was accredited, and of that from which he came. The exquisite shaver who would face the world with a smooth chin requires many <b>razors,</b> many <b>strops,</b> many brushes, odd soaps, a light steady hand, and, perhaps, a certain gaiety of temper which prevents edged weapons from offering unholy temptations. Possibly the shaver is born, not made, like the poet; it is sure that many men are born with an inability to shave. Hence comes the need for the kindly race of barbers, a race dear to literature. Their shops were the earliest clubs, their conversation was all the ancient world knew in the way of society journals. Horace, George Eliot, Beaumarchais, Cervantes, and Scott have appreciated the barber, and celebrated his characteristics. If the wearing of the beard ever became universal, the world, and especially the Spanish and Italian world, would sadly miss the barber and the barber's shop. The energy of the British character, our zeal for individual enterprise, makes us a self-shaving race; the Latin peoples are economical, but they do not grudge paying for an easy shave. Americans in this matter are more Continental than English in their taste. Was it not in Marseilles that his friends induced Mark Twain to be shaved by a barber worthy of the bottle-glass or sea-shell stage of his profession? They pretended that his performances were equal to those of the barber on board the ship that brought them from America.|$|R
