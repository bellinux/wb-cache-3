30|$|A Fourier transform-based {{method is}} {{developed}} in [15] {{by the current}} author. With this method one can efficiently calculate track vibrations excited by a harmonic load of high frequency and moving at high speed. In the method, the rail can be described using either a multiple-beam model as done in [16, 17] or a two-and-half dimensional (2.5 D) finite element model [18], and the supports may have arbitrary degrees of freedom, either translational or rotational. The response of the track is expressed as Fourier transform from the wavenumber (in the track direction) domain to the spatial domain. It is shown in [15] that the quasi-static approach mentioned above is not capable of dealing with vibrations of the track around the pinned–pinned frequency (around 1, 000  Hz for a modern ballasted track). Eigen-value equations for determining propagation constants of the track as a periodic structure is established straightforwardly from equations presented in [15], as explored in [19]. Based on [15] and assuming <b>railhead</b> <b>roughness</b> to be periodic in the track direction and the period {{is equal to the}} length of one or more sleeper bays, the so-called Fourier-series approach is developed in [20]. According to the approach, wheel/rail forces generated from <b>railhead</b> <b>roughness</b> {{as well as from the}} parametric excitation of the moving wheels can be calculated by solving a set of linear algebraic equations.|$|E
