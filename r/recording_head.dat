Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical magnetic tape sound recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders. Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the Brush Development Company and its licensee, Ampex; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing corporation (now known as 3M).|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1920s, {{engineers}} at Western Electric, as well as independent inventors such as Orlando Marsh, developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone, amplifying it with vacuum tubes, then using the amplified signal to drive an electromechanical <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Western Electric's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response, creating a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording. Distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured. Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device. Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs during the Spring of 1925. The first classical recording was of Chopin impromptus and Schubert's Litanei by Alfred Cortot for Victor.|$|E

5000|$|While 3490E data {{cartridges}} are {{the same}} dimensions as 3480 cartridges, the tape media is the same only longer. 3490E tape is optimized for 36-track <b>recording</b> <b>heads,</b> instead of 18-track <b>recording</b> <b>heads.</b> Nevertheless, some 3480 tape drives can record on 3490E media.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic - Magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>heads</b> use the {{principles}} of electromagnetism to coerce a paramagnetic recording medium, such as iron oxides, to orient in a readable manner such as magnetic tape. <b>Record</b> <b>heads</b> are constructed of laminated permalloy, ferrite, or sendust. As of 2006 this {{is by far the}} most dominant type of head in use.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926 Joseph P. Maxwell and Henry C. Harrison from Bell Telephone Laboratories {{disclosed}} that the recording {{pattern of the}} Western Electric [...] "rubber line" [...] magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic. This meant that as frequency increased in the treble, recording amplitude decreased. Conversely, in the bass as frequency decreased, recording amplitude increased. Therefore, {{it was necessary to}} attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250Hz, the bass turnover point, in the amplified microphone signal fed to the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Otherwise, bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove. When played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region, a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary. G. H. Miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records, the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form.|$|E
50|$|The {{recorder}} has {{a double}} <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> {{similar to a}} two-track recorder. Each of the two cores of the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> records both the audio signal, and the pilot tone. The audio signal to be recorded is applied identically to both cores of the <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> and the pilot tone sine wave is applied in a push-pull arrangement (180 degrees out-of-phase).|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} recording was demonstrated in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, magnetic tape recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves past a <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head (which may be the same as the <b>recording</b> <b>head)</b> can then pick up the changes in the magnetic field from the tape and convert them into an electrical signal.|$|E

50|$|A <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> is the {{physical}} interface between a recording apparatus and a moving recording medium. Recording heads are generally classified according to {{the physical}} principle {{that allows them to}} impress their data upon their medium. A <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> is often mechanically paired with a playback head, which, though proximal to, is often discrete from the record head.|$|E
5000|$|Coding was {{accomplished}} via mechanical lift arms and latching bails {{added to the}} typewriter's existing mechanical linkages in place for print-action. When a key was depressed, up to 8 affiliated lift arms were [...] "caught" [...] on latching bails which in turn connected 8 coding switches to the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> A commutator, powered by the internal drive motor, would momentarily complete the power circuit through the coding switches to the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> before advancing the tape to the next recording position. When not encoding, a resistor balance network kept the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> in an erase mode unless a rewind operation was commanded. This ensured a clearly defined magnetic space between bit patterns. Additional circuits prevented opening of the tape loading door once a tape was loaded.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Super 8 film {{release was}} a silent system only, but in 1973 a {{sound on film}} version was released. The film with sound had a magnetic soundtrack and came in larger cartridges than the original cartridge {{in order to accommodate}} the sound <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> in the film path. Sound film requires a longer film path (for smoothing the film movement before it reaches the <b>recording</b> <b>head),</b> and a second aperture for the <b>recording</b> <b>head.</b> Sound cameras were compatible with silent cartridges, but not vice versa. Sound film was typically filmed at a speed of 18 or 24 frames per second. Kodak discontinued the production of Super 8 sound film in 1997 citing environmental regulations as the reason. The adhesive used to bond the magnetic track to the film was environmentally hazardous.|$|E

50|$|The wire {{is pulled}} rapidly across a <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> which magnetizes each point along the wire in {{accordance}} with the intensity and polarity of the electrical audio signal being supplied to the <b>recording</b> <b>head</b> at that instant. By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone.

50|$|A <b>record</b> <b>head,</b> on {{the other}} hand, has a gap {{typically}} six times larger {{than that of the}} replay head, this gives a larger flux to magnetise the tape. The ideal gap size in a cassette deck are; wide <b>record</b> <b>head</b> gap and narrow playback head. The larger gap does not affect frequency response because the 'image' is largely made by the trailing edge of the gap. A combined record/replay head has a compromise size gap typically three times that of a replay only head.|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of feeding}} both the bias signal and the audio signal {{into the same}} <b>recording</b> <b>head,</b> a few brands of audio tape recorder, notably Tandberg, Akai and its US cousin Roberts, used a {{separate}} bias head {{on the opposite side}} of the tape from the recording head; this system was termed cross-field.|$|E

For proper results, cross-field {{recording}} needed high quality tapes, to ensure the oxide layer was thick enough to allow the bias signal to imprint on the deeper levels of the oxide without reaching the front surface.|$|R
