5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local <b>record</b> <b>stores,</b> they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E

Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created the cassette artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego <b>record</b> <b>stores</b> and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E

The tape {{went on to}} sell over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas, enabling the band to self-produce their debut LP Ferociously Stoned the following year. Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves, the album garnered favorable comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Before it was even officially released, Ferociously Stoned became a regional best-seller, setting a record for advance sales in Eugene's <b>record</b> <b>stores</b> and then remaining {{for over a year}} on The Rockets Northwest Top Twenty list, helping expand the Daddies' touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Yankovic {{desired to}} release the song on a record label, {{although}} no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various <b>record</b> <b>stores,</b> selling them through consignment deals. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic {{for the sole purpose}} of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of the Another One Rides the Bus EP were made, today it is considered a very rare record to locate.|$|E

Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, though of course only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green.
