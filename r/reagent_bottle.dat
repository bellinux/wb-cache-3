SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The majority of clinical specimens sent to the mycobacteriology laboratory for cultural confirmation of suspected mycobacterial infection (e. g., sputum, bronchial or tracheal lavage) are contaminated by rapidly growing normal flora. To maximize the mycobacterial yield, contaminated specimens require treatment with a digestion and decontamination procedure.

JHE RESULTS of blood glucose determinations and, {{to a lesser}} extent, of blood urea nitrogen determinations by an automatic analysis de-vice * have been observed to be significantly {{lower than those of}} the commonly used routine methods (1, 2). A cause of these discrepan-cies was the gradually increasing sedimentation of cells in blood samples during an hour of processing, with resultant pick-up of blood suspensions progressively richer in cells and with lower glucose and urea nitrogen concentrations.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of DMP is chlorine dioxide (CD) which is a potent oxidant and biocide. These properties have proved invaluable for various applications. The main goals of this study were: {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of DMP for disinfecting Mycobateria tuberculosis (TB) contaminated medical instruments, devices, floors and surfaces; to investigate the stability of DMP; and to explore possibilities for medical application of DMP. Evaluation of disinfectant activity of DMP on TB was performed using the spectrophotometric method, a modification of the European suspension test, EN 14348. M. bovis BCG was employed as surrogate in this test. Results were as follows: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) = 12. 5 ppm; the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 15. 4 ppm; the Mycobactericidal Effect (ME) = 8. 8 log reduction; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) x minimum exposure time (CT) = 12. 5 ppm. s. The long term stability study of DMP was performed by monitoring the rate of degradation of DMP stored in the fridge (2 - 8 °C), in the oven (40 °C), and under ambient conditions (15 - 30 °C). Analytical methods of assessing DMP concentration was by Iodometric titration method. The shelf life of DMP stored in a transparent bottle at room temperature was 9. 8 weeks, as opposed to 52. 7 weeks when stored in an amber colored <b>reagent</b> <b>bottle</b> at the same temperature. Both oven samples had an expiry date of about 20 weeks and the fridge samples about 70 weeks. Foam formulations for a vaginal douche (VGD), mouth rinse (MRF), and foot/sit bubble bath (F/SBB) ], were developed in the laboratory. DMP and the formulated concentrate were designed to be mixed just prior to administration. During foam evaluation studies, a mechanical overhead stirrer was used to generate foam. Foamability was assessed by quantifying the amount of foam generated. The stability of foams were assessed by: 1) determining the rate of foam decay and the rate of foam drainage observed concurrently from foam loaded in a measuring cylinder; and 2) determining the life span of single bubbles of each foam system i. e. the bubble breaking time (BBT). The density of each foam system was also determined. Potentiometric acid base titration was used to select suitable adjuster alkali, and to show the benefits of employing a buffer. Concentrate development was initiated by a simple mixture of all the ingredients followed by stirring and observing the deviations from desired quality attributes of the product. The subsequent five processes were improvements designed to circumvent the shortcomings of the initial procedure to arrive at the optimized method E. Prototype formulations were employed to optimize excipient quantities to eventually arrive at an optimized master formula. In foam evaluation, it was found that sodium lauryl sulphate/ammonium lauryl sulphate/cocoamidopropyl betaine/cetostearyl alcohol (SLS/ALS/CAPB/CSA) foam system was the most appropriate to use in the formulation. NaOH was selected as the adjuster solution and KHP as the buffer. The dosage formula (DF) of the VGD and F/SBB was determined to be MDF = 5 ml of 50 ppm DMP + 5 ml concentrate + 40 ml water = 50 ml and that of MRF as MDF = 19 ml diluted concentrate + 1 ml of 50 ppm DMP. In conclusion, DMP was found to be a highly effective disinfectant against Mycobacteria. DMP has reasonable shelf life if stored appropriately.

Local biotechnology companies specializing in Next Generation Sequencing, such as Illumina, Inc., are considered one of the leaders at the fore front of NGS DNA Sequencing. The success of Illumina???s DNA sequencing platform can be attributed to its proprietary sequencing properties known as TruSeq v 3 chemistry through sequencing by synthesis (SBS) technologies. Recently, post experimental observations have indicated several reagents have more than adequate volumes needed to conduct the advertised 209 cycle sequencing experiments. Based on our current observations in reagent utilization, this reagent overfill may represent lost profit margin, increased overhead and environmental impact.

The oxidation stability indices of the biodiesel and blends were determined by measuring Rancimat induction periods for 8  weeks at intervals of 2  weeks. Although the Rancimat induction period for freshly prepared biodiesel of 4  h was higher than the commonly used American standard (ASTM D 6751) limit of 3  h, it was lower than the European standard (EN 14214) of 6  h. The induction periods of B 50 and lower blends were, however, equal to or greater than 6  h. The Rancimat induction periods for biodiesel with 100  ppm antioxidants were 5.6, 6.8 and 7.8  h for Butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), Propyl gallate (PRG) and Pyrogallol (PYG), respectively, while the Rancimat induction periods for biodiesel with 1000  ppm antioxidants were 6.8, 8.2 and 10  h for BHA, PRG and PYG, respectively. The oxidation stability index for neat biodiesel decreased by 45  % while that for biodiesel with 1000  ppm antioxidants depreciated by 16, 12.2 and 20.59  % for PYG, PRG and BHA, respectively, during the 8 -week storage period. A more rapid decline in oxidation stability was observed in the biodiesel and blends without antioxidants than those with antioxidants. The results from this study showed that the use of appropriate concentrations of suitable antioxidants can greatly improve the oxidation stability of biodiesel and blends which can therefore be stored over longer periods of time before use without undergoing extensive and deleterious oxidative deterioration.|$|R

METHODS AND MATERIALS Water was obtained at various tidal con-ditions during the summer and fall of 1958, from one location at Latimer Reef, which is about 6 {{miles off the coast of}} Noank, Con-neticut, and east of East Point, Fisher’s Island, New York. Top samples were col-lected in sterile 500 ml wide-mouth <b>reagent</b> <b>bottles.</b> Samples were iced until examina-tion at the laboratory, within 2 hours. Preliminary studies with samples from Fisher’s Island Sound showed that counts could be obtained using decimal dilutions of 10 -l to lo-“.

40|$|Lignocellulose {{degradation}} by Streptomyces viridosporus {{results in}} the oxidative depolymerization of lignin {{and the production of}} a water-soluble lignin polymer, acid-precipitable polymeric lignin (APPL). The effects of the culture pH on lignin and cellulose metabolism and APPL production by S. viridosporus are reported. Dry, ground, hot-water-extracted corn (Zea mays) lignocellulose was autoclaved in 1 -liter <b>reagent</b> <b>bottles</b> (5 g per bottle) and inoculated with 50 -ml volumes of S. viridosporus cells suspended in buffers of specific pH (pH 6. 0 to 9. 2 at 0. 4 pH unit intervals). Four replicates of inoculated cultures and of uninoculated controls at each pH were incubated as solid-state fermentations at 37 °C. After 6 weeks of incubation the percent loss of lignocellulose, lignin, and carbohydrate and the amount of APPL produced were determined for each replicate. Optimal lignocellulose degradation, as shown by substrate weight loss, was observed in the pH range of 8. 4 to 8. 8. Only minor differences were seen in the Klason lignin, carbohydrate, protein, and ash contents of the APPLS produced by cultures at each pH. The effects of pH on the degradation of a spruce (Picea pungens) [14 C-lignin]lignocellulose and a Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) [14 C-glucan]-lignocellulose were also determined at pH values between 6. 5 and 9. 5 (0. 5 pH unit intervals). The incubations were carried out for 3 weeks at 37 °C with bubbler-tube cultures. The percentage of initial 14 C recovered as 14 CO 2, 14 C-labeled water-soluble products, and [14 C]APPL was then determined. The mineralization of lignin and cellulose to CO 2 was optimal at pHs 6. 5 and 7. 0, respectively. However, the optimum for lignin and cellulose solubilization was pH 8. 5, which correlated with the pH 8. 5 optimum for APPL production. Overall, the data show that, whereas lignin mineralization is optimal at neutral to slightly acidic pHs, lignocellulose degradation with lignin solubilization and APPL production is promoted by alkaline pHs. These findings indicate that lignin-solubilizing actinomycetes may {{play an important role in}} the metabolism of lignin in neutral to alkaline soils in which ligninolytic fungi are not highly competitive...|$|R
40|$|In blood analyzers, {{in-vitro}} diagnostic systems, {{and many other}} chemical analysis applications, fluids must be moved from one vessel to another to aspirate samples from cuvettes or <b>reagents</b> from <b>bottles.</b> These lab-based systems will frequently handle {{a large number of}} samples, so minimizing processing time is essential. To enhance efficiency, the probes used for aspiration must be moved at high speed, making it necessary to accurately determine the location of the probe in relation {{to the surface of the}} fluid being drawn. This article demonstrates a novel use of a capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) to perform this function with a high level of confidence. CDC Technology At a basic level, Σ-Δ ADCs make use of a simple charge-balancing circuit, with a known reference voltage and an unknown input voltage applied across fixed on-chip input capacitors. Charge balancing determines the unknown input voltage. Σ-Δ-based CDCs differ in that the unknown value is the input capacitor. A known excitation voltage is applied to the input, and charge balancing detects changes in the unknown capacitor, as shown in Figure 1. The CDC retains the resolution and linearity of the ADC...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In {{the past}} several years there has been a growing {{interest}} in the development of radiopharmaceuticals labeled with metallic radionuclides (Anderson et al. 1999). Of particular interest is the positron emitter Cu- 64 (t½ = 12. 7 h) for molecular imaging of small molecules as well as peptides and antibodies (Smith 2004). This has led us to the recent implementation of a solid target production facility using commercially available target irradiation station and chemistry modules. Routine production of Cu- 64 was achieved with an average production yield of 0. 32 mCi/μAh, however purification of Cu- 64 has proven to be problematic; with several metallic contaminants compromising subsequent radiolabeling. We report in this work, the step by step procedure which led us to the successful production of low metal contaminant 64 Cu with high specific activity and high labeling efficiency. Material and Methods Detailed implementation of our solid target was reported earlier (Poniger et al. 2012). A Nirta Solid Target from IBA was coupled to our 18 / 9 cyclotron using a 2 -meter external beam line. A pneumatic solid target transfer system (STTS) designed by TEMA was use to deliver the irradiated target disks to a dedicated hotcell. Modules from IBA (Pinctada metal) were used for electroplating 64 Ni onto a Ag disk and for acid dissolution and purification of the irradiated target. Typical irradiation parameters were 14. 9 MeV at 35 μA for 5 – 6 hours with 64 Ni plating’s ranging from 10 – 60 μm thickness at 6 – 12 mm. Radionuclidic purities were evaluated by gamma spectroscopy and traces of metallic impurities were determined by ICP-MS or ICP-AES. Labeling efficiency was evaluated by measuring the amount of 64 Cu uptake per 20 μg of scFv-cage. Results and Conclusion Initial 64 Cu purifications following the manufacturers recommended method resulted in high levels of Cu, Fe and Zn metal contaminants (see TABLE 1, ID 1). Note that little Ag contamination is observed nevertheless the 64 Ni is plated directly on a Ag disk. After several productions, visual inspection of the module quickly revealed that the heater block used for heating the back of the Ag target disk was heavily corroded. Replacing the copper heater block with a PEEK heater block drastically reduced the levels of Cu and Fe contaminants. Unfortunately unusually high levels of Zn were still observed regardless of the stringent conditions and ultrapure reagents used during the processing (see TABLE 1, ID 5). In our quest for answers, ICP-MS analysis of the 64 Ni plating solution as well as critical stock reagents such as Milli-Q water (18 MΩ cm− 1) and 30 % HCl TraceSelect Ultra (Sigma) was performed (see TABLE 1, ID 2, 3, 4). The results were surprising, with high level of Zn found not only in the 64 Ni plating solution, but as well in the HCl TraceSelect Ultra. It was hypothesized that the Pinctada’s glass bottles (Kay, 2004) used to store the reagents, especially concentrated acidic solutions were the source of Zn contamination and all glass bottles were replaced by LDPE or PFA types. Our hypothesis was confirmed by subsequent ICP-MS analysis of fresh samples of HCl TraceSelect Ultra and the 64 Ni plating solution prepared/stored in plastic containers (see TABLE 1, ID 6, 7). We also confirmed by ICP-MS analysis that no contamination occurred when performing a non-radioactive dissolution/purification sequence on the Pinctada module using a blank PTFE target disk in conjunction with the change to plastic <b>reagent</b> storage <b>bottles</b> (see TABLE 1, ID 8). Initially the purification protocol was modified as described by Ometakova et al., 2012 to help reduce the co-elution of Zn contaminants with the 64 Cu from the AG 1 -X 8 resin. This change resulted in a significant amount of 64 Cu eluting from the resin during the resin washing steps, so that protocol was abandoned and the protocol as described by Thieme et al., 2012 was adopted. By modifying the AG 1 -X 8 resin washing protocol to this new method and eluting the 64 Cu from with 0. 1 M HCl rather than Milli-Q water (see TABLE 1, ID 9), we were able to further reduce metal contaminants, especially Zn. During the course of these experiments, the true specific activity of 64 Cu increased from as low as 12 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 2, TABLE 1, ID 1) to 649 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 7, TABLE 1, ID 5) and finally to 4412 mCi/μmol of Cu (n = 3, TABLE 1, ID 9). In the same time, the effective specific activity increased from 0. 03 ± 0. 02 mCi per 20 μg of scFv-cage, to 3. 7 ± 0. 3 mCi per 20 g of scFv-cage with 64 Cu. In conclusion, a significant reduction in Cu, Fe and Zn contaminants was achieved when processing 64 Cu using the Pinctada module: i) after replacement of the Cu heater block; ii) after elimination of glass reagent storage containers from the Pinctada module and procedures during preparation of the 64 Ni plating solution and iii) after implementation of a new purification protocol (Thieme et al. 2012). Introduction of a 6 M HCl wash-up cycle of the module prior to the dissolution procedure was also effective. However in recent 64 Cu productions slightly elevated Ag levels have been observed and are under investigation (see TABLE 1, ID 9) ...|$|R
