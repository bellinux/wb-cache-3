500|$|An {{argument}} {{broke out}} {{near the end}} of the post-production between Campbell and the producers. Campbell argued that he and Raimi had always closely been involved with their own film's editing, describing the behavior of the producers as [...] "nickel-and-dime-bullshit". One of the producers replied by calling Campbell an [...] "asshole", commenting that the crew had gone severely over budget. The difficulty during production left a negative impression on Campbell, who insisted that he wanted to never work with big-budget producers again, insisting that the conduct was [...] "soulless" [...] and [...] "just a business." [...] Raimi commented negatively about the process too, musing that [...] "it was <b>really</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was such a horrible, horrible, horrible, depressing scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Heffer, {{writing in}} the Daily Mail, said that Peel [...] "does not write with {{sufficient}} detachment" [...] or rigorously enough, but that the book will be {{of great interest to}} those who want to know [...] "what is <b>really</b> <b>wrong</b> with the British Establishment"—Heffer {{made it clear that he}} felt Chenevix-Trench should never have been Headmaster of Eton in the first place, and that other people's appointments in the [...] "British Establishment" [...] were equally flawed. Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books, reprinted in the Guardian, in which he described the book as [...] "a wretched hagiography, full of clichés and bad jokes", and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix-Trench as [...] "a heroic figure".|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] I guess you can say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing <b>really</b> <b>wrong</b> with good, clean violence." ...|$|E

60|$|This {{extraordinary}} proceeding {{forced the}} suspicion {{on me that}} something had <b>really</b> gone <b>wrong.</b> I kept my doubts to myself; but I was prepared, from that moment, to see the disappearance of John Jago followed by very grave results.|$|R

"No," [...] said Ormsgill {{with an air}} of deep reflection, [...] "I almost {{think that}} to save a fellow {{creature}} who is badly worn out an effort he is scarcely fit to make isn't <b>really</b> very <b>wrong.</b> Still, the men were certainly very dirty--I suppose that is the point?" ...|$|R
500|$|HiFi Choice said in 1984 {{that the}} Planar 3 sounded [...] "nicely musical in a {{balanced}} and coherent manner. Presentation of detail was considered well above average"; in 1992 it {{asserted that the}} Rega Planar 3 has been [...] "a long time leader" [...] under £250. Michael Fremer wrote in December 1996 that [...] "while the 2 did nothing <b>really</b> <b>wrong,</b> the 3 offered somewhat deeper and tighter bass, better dynamics {{at both ends of}} the scale, a better sensation of 'quiet', and smoother overall performance". Considered on its own terms, the Rega 3 was [...] "quiet, dynamic, free of obvious tracking distortion or other supposed analog problems, extremely well-balanced top to bottom, offers very deep and reasonably tight bass". In comparison with the $9000 TNT Mk.3/Immedia RPM, recordings sounded [...] "more like a recording and less like real life on the Rega 3".|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green {{said that she}} was pleased with the {{continuity}} seen in [...] "Rajiin" [...] but felt that the female sexuality seen in this episode was the [...] "most gratuitous... I can remember on Trek". She thought that the Rajiin character was a cliché, calling her a [...] "trained slut who comes on to everyone around her". Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as [...] "". However, he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books, saying that [...] "There's nothing <b>really</b> <b>wrong</b> with that. Nothing great about it either." [...] He gave it a score of 2.5/4.|$|E
2500|$|We {{used to be}} a very chi-chi name to drop in '79, {{but then}} the Fab Five hype started and {{something}} went wrong. Something went <b>really</b> <b>wrong.</b> That wasn't what I wanted. [...] Not that I didn't like being screamed at. At one point I really did." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Fiji Sun {{quoted the}} Prime Minister (6 March) {{as saying that}} Bainimarama's {{decision}} {{to withdraw from the}} talks was [...] "unfortunate." [...] Progress had been made {{during the course of the}} discussions, he claimed. What <b>really</b> went <b>wrong</b> was that he expected me and my Government to follow orders.

60|$|Yes, yes! I {{know that}} {{compassion}} {{for him was}} utterly inconsistent with the motive which had taken me to his house--utterly inconsistent with the doubt, still present to my mind, whether Mr. Playmore had <b>really</b> <b>wronged</b> him in believing that his was the guilt which had compassed the first Mrs. Eustace's death. I felt this: I knew him to be cruel; I believed him to be false. And yet I pitied him! Is there a common fund of wickedness in us all? Is the suppression or the development of that wickedness a mere question of training and temptation? And is there something in our deeper sympathies which mutely acknowledges this when we feel for the wicked; when we crowd to a criminal trial; when we shake hands at parting (if we happen to be present officially) with the vilest monster that ever swung on a gallows? It is {{not for me to}} decide. I can only say that I pitied Miserrimus Dexter--and that he found it out.|$|R
2500|$|Some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of the game. The reviewer for Computer Gaming World said that [...] "There's nothing <b>really</b> <b>wrong</b> with Outlaws. There just isn't much right with it." [...] The reviewer noted that the game had excellent music and art, but felt that the game had nothing new or innovative to offer players. Edge magazine's reviewer stated that [...] "not for the first time, shown that it's not infallible." [...] Charlie Brooker of PC Zone (UK) had {{to take time to}} warm up to the game. [...] "when you start playing Outlaws, it feels downright cruddy." [...] Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed, and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} A+E refers to Accident and Emergency rooms, while its cover {{art is a}} picture of a scraped knee. Coxon himself took the picture. Most of the songs on it feature synths and drum machine beats. The single [...] "What'll It Take" [...] is an upbeat song that {{features}} two vocal hooks: [...] "What'll it take to make you people dance?" [...] and [...] "I don't know what's <b>really</b> <b>wrong</b> with me". A music video was released for it. [...] "Seven Naked Valleys" [...] is a post-punk track featuring saxophone that ends with [...] "piercing synth frequency". Opening track [...] "Advice" [...] and [...] "Running for Your Life" [...] have [...] "buzzsaw-guitar" [...] and sardonic lyrics on culture. The former's lyrics are about a bad experience Coxon had at a house party in Brentwood, Essex. At the party, he and some other friends danced to a Smiths record that they used to replace another tape which was playing. As a result, they got beaten up and {{spent the rest of the}} night walking around Brentwood thinking of how they would get home. The latter's lyrics are about the [...] "violence of a suburban night out." [...] "Bah Singer" [...] has indecipherable distorted lyrics, and the following track, [...] "Knife in the Cast", is a ballad driven by bass guitar. [...] The final track, [...] "Ooh, Yeh Yeh", is a grunge-pop song that has been described as a [...] "cowboy lullaby".|$|E

50|$|These {{continuous}} brakes can {{be simple}} or automatic, the essential difference being what happens should the train break in two. With simple brakes, pressure {{is needed to}} apply the brakes, and all braking power is lost if the continuous hose is broken for any reason. Simple non-automatic brakes are thus useless when things <b>really</b> go <b>wrong,</b> as is shown with the Armagh rail disaster.|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are!" [...] {{the senior}} partner cried triumphantly. [...] "Of course these men can see {{at a glance}} how things stand, and if things had <b>really</b> been <b>wrong</b> they would have called {{attention}} to it.

50|$|So {{what has}} <b>really</b> gone <b>wrong?</b> The people {{are no longer}} {{interested}} in being told the Eha-Amufu road project is either captured in the budget or not. Their patience is running out. It could not be blamed on {{the stars of the}} rural peasants who inhabit the town. One will wonder if any official of the Federal Ministry of Works had ever gone through that road and why has the Minister of Works not taken proactive action at least to ameliorate the sufferings of the people.|$|R

Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the English general's head? The second riddle is, what had become of the Brazilian general's heart? President Olivier might be called a visionary or a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to the point of knight errantry. Almost every other prisoner he had ever captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits. Men who had <b>really</b> <b>wronged</b> him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness. Why the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life; and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him? Well, there you have it.

This paper {{evaluates the}} {{evidence}} from the decade preceding {{the outbreak of the}} fiscal crisis in Greece shedding some light on specific factors behind deviations from fiscal plans. It explains that Greece only partly fits international evidence on the economic, political and institutional determinants of fiscal forecast errors. The weak domestic institutional budget framework emerges as the main reason for weak fiscal performance, while inconsistencies in the forecasts of international organisations place the effectiveness of their monitoring under question. In this light, the paper puts forward some ideas for improving the domestic institutional framework for conducting fiscal policy in Greece and briefly evaluates some relevant recent government initiatives...|$|R
