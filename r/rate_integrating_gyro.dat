New cross feeds result that are not pres-ent in the current control laws, derived by classical compensation, which exploit the array drive motor's reaction torque on the satellite body to enhance body pointing {{at the expense of}} array error.

40|$|The one- and two-gyro {{system designs}} of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) {{attitude}} control system (ACS) are examined. The inertial reference assembly that provides the primary attitude reference for IUE consists of six rate sensors which are single-axis <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros.</b> The gyros operate in a pulse rebalanced mode that produces an output pulse for 0. 01 arcsec of motion about the input axis. The functions of the fine error sensor, fine sun sensor (FSS), the IUE reaction wheels, the onboard computer, and the hold/slew algorithm are described. The use of the hold/slew algorithm to compute the control voltage for the ACS based on the Kalman filter is studied. A two-gyro system was incorporated into IUE following gyro failure. The procedures for establishing attitude control with the two-gyro design based on the FSS is analyzed.

40|$|With the {{cancellation}} of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Mission 4 (SM 4), the HST Project will face numerous challenges to keep the Telescope operating during {{the remainder of the}} decade. As part of the SM 4, the HST Project had planned to install various upgrades to the Telescope including the installation of new batteries and new <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros.</b> Without these upgrades, reliability analysis indicates that the spacecraft will lose the capability to conduct science operations later this decade. The HST team will be severely challenged to maximize the Telescope's remaining operational lifetime, while still trying to maximize - its science output and quality. Two of the biggest areas of concern are the age and condition of the batteries and gyros. Together they offer the largest potential extension in Telescope lifetime and present the biggest challenges to the HST team. The six Ni-H batteries on HST are the original batteries from launch. With fourteen years of operational life, these batteries have collectively lasted longer than any other comparable mission. Yet as with all batteries, their capacity has been declining. Engineers are examining various methods to prolong the life of these mission critical batteries, and retard the rate of degradation. This paper will focus on these and other efforts to prolong the life of the HST, thus enabling it to remain a world-class observatory for as long as possible...|$|R
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{hardware}} complement includes six gas bearing, pulse rebalanced <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros,</b> any {{three of}} which are sufficient to conduct the science mission. After the loss of three gyros between April 1997 and April 1999 due to a known corrosion mechanism, NASA decided to split the third HST servicing mission into SM 3 A, accelerated to October 1999, and SM 3 B, scheduled for November 2001. SM 3 A was developed as a quick turnaround 'Launch on Need' mission to replace all six gyros. Loss of a fourth gyro in November 1999 caused HST to enter Zero Gyro Sunpoint (ZGSP) safemode, which uses sun sensors and magnetometers for attitude determination and momentum bias to maintain attitude stability during orbit night. Several instances of large attitude excursions during orbit night were observed, but ZGSP performance was adequate to provide power-positive sun pointing and to support low gain antenna communications. Body rates in ZGSP were estimated to exceed the nominal 0. 1 deg/sec rendezvous limit, so rendezvous operations were restructured to utilize coarse, limited life, Retrieval Mode Gyros (RMGs) under Hardware Sunpoint (HWSP) safemode. Contingency procedures were developed to conduct the rendezvous in ZGSP {{in the event of}} RMGA or HWSP computer failure. Space Shuttle Mission STS- 103 launched on December 19, 1999 after a series of weather and Shuttle-related delays.

40|$|A Hemispherical Resonator Gyro (HRG) is the Coriolis Vibratory Gyro (CVG) that {{measures}} rotation angle or angular velocity using Coriolis force acting the vibrating mass. A HRG {{can be used}} as a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> or <b>integrating</b> <b>gyro</b> without structural modification by simply changing the control scheme. In this paper, differential control algorithms are designed for a 2 -piece HRG. To design a precision controller, the electromechanical modelling and signal processing must be pre-performed accurately. Therefore, the equations of motion for the HRG resonator with switched harmonic excitations are derived with the Duhamel Integral method. Electromechanical modeling of the resonator, electric module and charge amplifier is performed by considering the mode shape of a thin hemispherical shell. Further, signal processing and control algorithms are designed. The multi-flexing scheme of sensing, driving cycles and x, y-axis switching cycles is appropriate for high precision and low maneuverability systems. The differential control scheme is easily capable of rejecting the common mode errors of x, y-axis signals and changing the <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> mode on basis of these studies. In the rate gyro mode the controller is composed of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), amplitude, quadrature and rate control loop. All controllers are designed on basis of a digital PI controller. The signal processing and control algorithms are verified through Matlab/Simulink simulations. Finally, a FPGA and DSP board with these algorithms is verified through experiments...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{attitude}} estimation approach {{relying on a}} particle filter is proposed for an autonomous attitude sensor which <b>integrates</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> with a star sensor. Thanks to the complementary characteristics of modern inertial and star sensors, with the former being able of performing measurements at high data rates with precision decreasing over time, and the latter being able of high-precision measurements at lower updating frequency, the integrated sensor can provide complete operational autonomy during all the mission phases. Particle filters are Sequential Monte Carlo methods relying on a point-mass representation of probability density distributions, which allows generalizing traditional Kalman filtering approaches. Specifically, for inherently non-linear estimation problems, the particle filter allows overcoming the well-known limitations of the Kalman Filtering approaches, leading also to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions. The adopted filter formulation incorporates standard gyro-based model, for attitude propagation, and star sensor measurement model, for measurement update. The attitude parameterization is given in terms of Euler’s angles. The filter algorithm is implemented into a numerical model of the spacecraft orbital and attitude dynamics. Filter performance is numerically tested considering different dynamics conditions, and initial estimation errors. Simulation results show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed filtering scheme in comparison with a standard Kalman Filter approach. They also indicate that the particle filter is more robust under realistic initial attitude-error conditions...|$|R

The steady-state and transient behavior of the system, as determined by the analysis, by the analog study, and by the experimental platform agreed quite well. The results of this study show that systems using <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros</b> for precise satellite attitude control can be designed to have a reasonably rapid and well-damped transient response, as well as very small steady-state errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the gyros act as rate sensors, as well as torque sources, so that no rate stabilization networks are required, and when no error sensor is available, the vehicle is still rate stabilized.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{previously}} developed, novel one-dimensional attitude estimation device is expanded {{through the development}} and implementation of an innovative method for estimation of two-dimensional attitude making use of a unique low-cost, dual arc accelerometer array measuring longitudinal and transverse rotational rates in real-time. The device and method proposed is an expansion of {{a previously}} developed method for one-dimensional attitude determination and rate gyro bias estimation utilizing a one-dimensional accelerometer array. This new revolutionary device utilizes a dual arc accelerometer array and an algorithm for accurate and reliable two-dimensional attitude determination and rate gyro bias estimation in real-time. The method determines the local gravitational field vector from which attitude information can be resolved. Upon determining the location of the local gravitational field vector relative to two consecutive accelerometer sensors, the orientation of the device may then be estimated and the attitude determined. However, this measurement is discrete in nature; therefore, <b>integrated</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> measurements are used to determine attitude information resulting in a continuous signal. However, attitude estimates and measurements produced by instantaneous rate sensors and gyroscope integration tend to drift over time due to drift and bias inherent to the rate gyro sensor. The integration of the acquired instantaneous rate signals amplify measurement errors leading to an undependable and imprecise estimate of the vehicles true attitude and orientation. A method for compensation of these errors is proposed in this work resulting in a highly accurate and continuous attitude estimate. For this thesis, simulations of the proposed method and device will be conducted with the inclusion of characteristic, real-world sensor noise and bias estimates produced from corrupted and biased sensors to analyze and assess the feasibility and validity of the proposed method and system configuration for two-dimensional attitude determination. The end goal of this work is to produce a precise and reliable longitudinal and transverse attitude estimation array capable of measuring rate senor and gyro bias online so as to produce highly accurate and reliable pitch and roll angle tracking in real-time while under subjection to simulated flight conditions and scenarios. While this thesis is an expansion of a previously developed device and method, it is a departure from past works in that a new, two-dimensional accelerometer array arc is utilized and additional rotational dimensions are being included in the simulated analysis...|$|R

40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} undergoing {{design for a}} controlled re-entry to Earth. During simulation of the re-entry plan, there was evidence of errors in the attitude determination algorithms during thruster modes. These errors affected the bum efficiency, and thus planning, during re-entry. During thruster modes, the spacecraft attitude is controlled off of <b>integrated</b> <b>Gyro</b> Error Angles that were designed to closely follow the nominal spacecraft pointing frame (Tip Frame). These angles, however, were not exactly mapped to the Tip Frame from the Body Frame. Additionally, in the initial formulation of the thruster mode attitude determination algorithms, several assumptions and approximations were made to conserve processor speed. These errors became noticeable and significant when simulating bums of much longer duration (- 10 times) than had been produced in flight. A solution is proposed that uses attitude determination information from a propagated extended Kalman filter that already exists in the TRMM thruster modes. This attitude information is then used to rotate the Gyro Error Angles into the Tip Frame. An error analysis is presented that compares the two formulations.

Majority {{of the focus}} is directed towards development of a surface tension and pressure driven micro-glassblowing paradigm, which is envisioned {{to serve as an}} enabling mechanism for wafer-scale fabrication of 3 -D micro-wineglass gyroscopes. New 2 -D silicon Micro <b>Rate</b> <b>Integrating</b> Gyroscope (MRIG) architectures are also explored {{to bridge the gap between}} conventional micro-machining techniques and micro-glassblowing processes, and to serve as a test platform for various MRIG control strategies. Closed loop Whole Angle operation of these 2 -D silicon MRIG architectures is presented to identify some of the control challenges associated with MRIG control, such as energy pumping and suppression of errors caused by structural imperfections. The main contribution of the thesis is the development of a high temperature (1700 °C) micro-glassblowing process for fabrication of highly symmetric and low internal dissipation 3 -D fused silica wineglass resonators. Owing to the "self-healing'" properties of surface tension and pressure driven micro-glassblowing paradigm, and the low internal loss fused silica material, quality factors above 1 million and frequency splits less than 1 Hz have been demonstrated. In addition to a multi-purpose test-bed for micro-wineglass characterization, in-situ electrode structures with sub 10 micron capacitive gaps are reported for electrostatic transduction. In order to streamline the realization of MRIG control strategies, two new Si-MEMS MRIG architectures were also developed as a part of this thesis: Toroidal Ring Gyroscope (TRG) and Dual Foucault Pendulum (DFP) Gyroscope. Toroidal Ring Gyroscope consists of an outer anchor, concentric ring suspension system, and inner electrode assembly.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} design of control algorithms and calibration methods forMicroscale <b>Rate</b> <b>Integrating</b> Gyroscopes (MRIGs). As its name implies, a MRIG operatesin <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> mode and can directly measure the rotation angle of the base where itis mounted. However, the MRIG mechanical system does not spontaneously operate in arate integrating mode, but requires an active controller. Such a controller enables the MRIG to oscillate in a specific pattern that {{is related to the}} input rotation angle in a measurable way. Conventional micro-machined gyroscopes (i. e. MEMS gyroscopes) operate in rate mode (as apposed to <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> mode). That is, the gyroscope directly measures the rotation rate of the base. The measured rotation rate is then numerically integrated over time to obtain the input rotation angle. The main drawback of this measuring mechanism is that, by <b>integrating,</b> the <b>rate</b> measurement error will propagate over time, causing the angle measurement to drift from the real input angle. MRIG, by its operating principle, can directly measure the input rotation angle; hence it suffers from no such error propagation. A well-known control scheme for <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> gyroscopes was proposed by Lynch in 1995 [51]. This control scheme has demonstrated its efficacy on precisely fabricated <b>rate</b> <b>integrating</b> gyroscopes such as Hemispherical Resonance Gyroscopes (HRGs). However, for MRIGs fabricated by micro-fabrication technology, fabrication imperfections significantly degrade the gyro performance. In addition, the Lynch-proposed-scheme is essentially nonlinear. As a consequence, the controller performance is hard to predict and analyze prior to real tests. In this dissertation, a novel demodulation method is developed to transform the original nonlinear control problem into a linear time invariant controller design problem. This technique is based on the averaging method proposed by Lynch [50] but enables the use of well studied linear system theory for MRIG controller design and analysis. The resulting controller design for MRIGs is much more tractable and the performance is rather predictable. This fundamental improvement also opens up new opportunities for implementing and analyzing control systems based on linear control theory. Two schemes are proposed in this dissertation to compensate for the parameter mismatches caused by fabrication imperfections. The first one is based on electrostatic spring softening and tuning. The basic operation principle is first introduced. Then a full derivation of this method on a real MRIG configuration is conducted. Experimental results confirm that this compensation scheme can significantly attenuate the parameter mismatch. The other compensation scheme considered in this dissertation is an adaptive compensation scheme consisting of three feedforward controllers. Each of them runs on top of the corresponding feedback control loop and estimates and compensates parameter mismatches in real time. We also present a stability and convergence analysis that shows such adaptive controllers converge to the correct values and perfectly cancel the parameter mismatch. A simulation study performed on a MRIG model also confirms the efficacy of the compensation scheme. Then a self-calibration process is proposed to automatically calibrate the gyroscope. This self-calibration method requires no human involvement or auxiliary device, hence enables the gyroscope to calibrate itself whenever necessary, even in use...|$|R

The time dependence of the reaction <b>rates</b> <b>integrated</b> over spatial coordinates is also considered. Evaluations are made {{with the help of}} the microscopic transport model UrQMD. The relation of the boundaries of different zones {{of reactions}} and the hypersurfaces of sharp chemical and kinetic freeze-outs is discussed. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
