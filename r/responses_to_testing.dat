40|$|This paper models {{the effect}} of a HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} on saving behavior and studies the welfare effects of testing for HIV. The model specifies a utility function that includes both regular consumption, and medical expenditures. Medical expenditures generate more utility if individuals are HIV infected, but they are only able to purchase the optimal medical consumption after being tested HIV positive. The paper describes different effects on aggregate savings according to different stages of the epidemic. We show that the HIV epidemic decreases savings if especially young individuals are (perceived to be) affected by the virus, but may increase savings if individuals perceive a sizable probability of getting infected later in life. By the same token, the welfare effects of testing young individuals differs greatly from the welfare effects of testing older individuals, the reason being that the savings <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> differ according to whether old or young individuals are tested. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{past several}} years have been marked by a general trend towards {{increased}} high-stakes testing for students and schools and test-based school accountability systems. There are many potential school <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> programs. This paper investigates the potential that schools respond by gaming the system through reshaping the test pool. Using student-level panel data from six large counties in Florida, we study whether {{the introduction of the}} Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test in 1996 led schools to reclassify students as disabled and therefore ineligible to contribute to the school's aggregate test scores. Employing student-level fixed effect models and a series of secular trends as controls, we find that schools tend to reclassify low income and previously low performing students as disabled at significantly higher rates following the introduction of the testing regime. Moreover, these behaviors are concentrated among the low income schools most likely to be on the margin of failing the state's accountability system. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Rapid {{diagnostic}} tests for malaria seem cost effective in standard analyses, but these {{do not take}} account of clinicians' <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> results. This study tested the impact of clinicians' <b>response</b> <b>to</b> rapid diagnostic <b>test</b> or microscopy results on {{the costs and benefits}} of testing at different levels of malaria transmission and in different age groups. DESIGN: Cost-benefit analysis using a decision tree model and clinical data on the effectiveness of {{diagnostic tests}} for malaria, their costs, and clinicians' <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> results. SETTING: Tanzania. METHODS: Data were obtained from a clinical trial of 2425 patients carried out in three settings of varying transmission. RESULTS: At moderate and low levels of malaria transmission, rapid diagnostic tests were more cost beneficial than microscopy, and both more so than presumptive treatment, but only where response was consistent with test results. At the levels of prescription of antimalarial drugs to patients with negative tests that have been found in observational studies and trials, neither <b>test</b> methodis likely <b>to</b> be cost beneficial, incurring costs 10 - 250 % higher, depending on transmission rate, than would have been the case with fully consistent <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> all <b>test</b> results. Microscopy becomes more cost beneficial than rapid diagnostic tests when its sensitivity under operational conditions approaches that of rapid diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS: Improving diagnostic methods, including rapid diagnostic tests, can reduce costs and enhance the benefits of effective antimalarial drugs, but only if the consistency of <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> results is also improved. Investing in methods <b>to</b> improve rational <b>response</b> <b>to</b> <b>tests</b> is essential.

40|$|Psychophysical {{studies have}} shown that numerosity is a sensory {{attribute}} susceptible to adaptation. Neuroimaging studies have reported that, at least for relatively low numbers, numerosity can be accurately discriminated in the intra-parietal sulcus. Here we developed a novel rapid adaptation paradigm where adapting and test stimuli are separated by pauses sufficient to dissociate their BOLD activity. We used multivariate pattern recognition to classify brain activity evoked by non-symbolic numbers over a wide range (20 – 80), both before and after psychophysical adaptation to the highest numerosity. Adaptation caused underestimation of all lower numerosities, and decreased slightly the average BOLD responses in V 1 and IPS. Using support vector machine, we showed that the BOLD response of IPS, but not in V 1, classified numerosity well, both when tested before and after adaptation. However, there was no transfer from training pre-adaptation <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> post-adaptation, and vice versa, indicating that adaptation changes the neuronal representation of the numerosity. Interestingly, decoding was more accurate after adaptation, and the amount of improvement correlated with the amount of perceptual underestimation of numerosity across subjects. These results suggest that numerosity adaptation acts directly on IPS, rather than indirectly via other low-level stimulus parameters analysis, and that adaptation improves the capacity to discriminate numerosity...|$|E

The theoretical framework of vocabulary acquisition and word frequency in vocabulary testing are discussed, and several previous studies that use VocabProfile to assess second language vocabulary are analyzed. These serve as the theoretical and methodological basis for conducting the current study, which adopts two schema in VocabProfile to first profile the word frequency in the speakers 2 ̆ 7 monologue responses, and then look into the offlist words that are not captured by the first step. There are three major findings indicated by the results. First, the proportion of words that belong to Academic Word List is higher in the response of learners of higher proficiency. Second, breakdown of the offlist words shows that more proficient learners also demonstrate usage of less frequent words. Third, there is a task effect in the VocabProfile output, which is demonstrated by the consistently different VocabProfile patterns between task types within each proficiency group. The findings indicate that word frequency is an effective yet not comprehensive measure, and that multiple measures are a must to test learners 2 ̆ 7 productive vocabulary and communicative performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{validity}} of gains on high-stakes tests have compared trends in scores on a high-stakes test to trends on a lower-stakes test, such as NAEP. However, generalizability of gains is likely to be incomplete even when gains are meaningful because of differences in the inferences the two tests are designed to support. Therefore, this simple approach is useful only when the disparity in trends on the two tests is very large. A more sensitive but difficult approach requires identifying the specific aspects of performance that increase by varying amounts and comparing these to the specific inferences users base on the score increases. A key to this approach may be identifying the aspects of performance that teachers focus on in their attempts to raise scores. This report presents the results of a pilot study evaluating several types of survey questions designed to elicit from teachers detailed information on their instructional <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing.</b> The types of responses explored are those that previous CRESST work (Koretz, McCaffrey, & Hamilton, 2001) suggested are important for validating score gains.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the impact of New Jersey's standards and assessment policies, this study examined how leaders in six school districts responded to the state's standards and the fourth grade Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, specifically in the area of mathematics. Building on earlier work exploring district <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing,</b> this study investigated the relationship between district pedagogy around testing and the will and capacity in particular districts, including physical capital (resources), human capital, and social capital. Data from interviews with 19 district administrators indicated that districts had varying capacity for reform. Districts ' responses to standards and testing were heavily influenced by their capacity to support more general reform efforts. In the one district where responses were most consistent with the expectations of state reform advocates, a combination of factors were involved. For example, the human capacity and will were very high, along with growing pressure from parents about test scores, and that all together meant they pursued change that was more systemic and deeper. However, the primary catalyst was teachers ' and administrators ' own beliefs and understandings of the reform ideas, which was lacking in other districts. (Contains 18 references.)

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} evaluates psychometric and teacher-constructed {{tests on the}} bases of separate, but interrelated {{evidence}} obtained from: (a) A factor analysis of teachers' opinions about psychometric vs professional testing and test construction procedures. (b) Teachers' judgments of test item properties against students' actual performance on the test items. (c) Empirical evidence obtained from students' performance on tests and ratings of the students on the tests as a whole. The results {{are discussed in the}} light of current controversies. A problem encountered in comparing psychometric and professional tests was a lack of a third independent criterion for comparison. An attempt has been made to overcome the problem by combining the 3 sets of evidence. In Part I, the nature of measurement purposes, types, and their interpretations are introduced and discussed {{in the light of the}} current opposing views of subjective judgmental and empirical evidential approaches to tests and measurements. Part II concerns an investigation into teachers' attitudes toward psychometric vs professional techniques of assessment of student performances. The purpose was to obtain teachers' attitudes towards types of measurement techniques, to extract from teachers' <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>testing</b> and test construction procedures, their criteria for evaluating test qualities; and to isolate correlates of teachers' positive attitudes towards tests. One hundred and thirty six teachers took part. Part III investigates teachers' ability to judge the suitability of items for inclusion into a test. The purpose was ii (a) to determine the degree of relationship between teachers' ratings of test item properties and empirical values obtained for the same item properties. The objective criterion against which the adequacy of teachers' judgments of the item properties were evaluated was an actual performance of students on the items. The degree of relationship between teacher ratings and students' actual performance was taken to indicate the competence of teachers to judge test item properties. (b) to determine the underlying methods used in judging by examining the relative importance given to different item properties. The degree of relationship between each property and the overall rating was taken to indicate the relative importance of each property to the judgment of the overall item quality. Twenty two teachers and 451 pupils took part in the section. Part IV investigates the relative worth of psychometric and professional tests as judged by the students themselves. The purpose was to ascertain the amount of improvement as judged by students which arises from statistical refinements of a test. Two psychometric and two professional tests were evaluated on evidence obtained from students' performances and ratings on the tests. Ratings were based on values of validity, fairness and relevance. Seventy six students took part. The results reveal (1) the criteria teachers use in judging tests for use with their students (2) the factors which influence these judgments (3) teachers' inability to judge psychometric properties (4) a conflict between the properties teachers and psychometricians value 111 (5) a lack of any distinct preference by the consumers (pupils) for either method of examination.

Such approach allows the robots <b>to</b> perform <b>tests</b> on its users and to form high-order beliefs according <b>to</b> the users’ <b>responses.</b> This study carried out primary research on designing a pressure sensor array model attached to the robot’s finger tips to collect the user’s <b>responses</b> <b>to</b> <b>test</b> action in the ARL system. A mathematical model and the reference value threshold which decides the pressure distribution were proposed through a benchmark scenario experiment.
