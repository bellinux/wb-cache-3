40|$|The {{intrageneric}} {{structure of}} the genus Micromonospora was determined by analyzing the 16 s <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> of the type strains of {{all but one of}} the 15 validly described species and four subspecies and 19 other Micromonospora strains, most of which represented invalidly described species. One of the 19 other Micromono-spora strains grouped outside a phylogenetically tight genus Micromonospora, which appeared to be closely related to other genera belonging to the family Micromonosporaceae. The level of sequence similarity for the 16 s <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> of most of the type strains was 98 %. Values in the same range were also found when the sequences of the type strains and most of the other Micromonospora strains were compared. Whether the invalidly described species actually represent taxa that are worthy of species status should be investigated by performing DNA reassociation studies and thoroughly comparing physiological and chemotaxonomic proper-ties.

5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} {{chromatin}} structure at which DNase I recognizes conformational differences between inert and activated genes has been investigated. Bulk and <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNA's</b> of Tetrahymena pyriformis were differentially labeled in vivo with [14 C]- and [3 H]-thymidine, respectively, utilizing a defined starvation-refeeding protocol. The 3 H-labeled ribosomal genes {{were shown to}} be preferentially digested by DNase I in isolated nuclei. Staphylococcal nuclease digested the ribosomal genes more slowly than bulk DNA, probably owing to the higher GC content of rDNA. DNase I and staphylococcal nuclease digestions of purified nucleosomes and of nucleosome core particles isolated from dual-labeled, starved-refed nuclei were indistinguishable from those of intact nuclei. We conclude from these studies that DNase I recognizes an alteration in the internal nucleosome core structure of activated ribosomal genes...|$|R

40|$|Although Borrelia theileri, {{the agent}} of bovine borreliosis, was {{described}} {{at the turn of}} the century (in 1903), its relationship with borreliae causing Lyme disease or relapsing fever remains undescribed. We tested the previously published hypothesis that spirochetes infecting Lone Star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) may comprise B. theileri by analyzing the 16 S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> (rDNAs) and flagellin genes of these spirochetes. B. theileri, the Amblyomma agent, and B. miyamotoi formed a natural group or clade distinct from but most closely related to that of the relapsing fever spirochetes. B. theileri and the Amblyomma agent were 97 and 98 % similar at the nucleotide level within the analyzed portions of the 16 S rDNA and the flagellin gene respectively, suggesting a recent divergence. The agent of bovine borreliosis might be explored as a surrogate antigen for the as-yet-uncultivatable Amblyomma agent in studies designed to explore the etiology of a Lyme disease-like infection associated with Lone Star ticks.

40|$|We {{undertook}} comparative sequence {{analyses to}} assess synteny between the cucumber and melon genomes. A fosmid library of cucumber was synthesized and end sequencing of random fosmids produced over 680 kilobases, of which 25 % {{was similar to}} <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNAs,</b> 23 % to satellite sequences, 22 % to coding regions in other plants, 4 % to transposable elements, 12 % to mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences, and 13 % showed no hits to the databases.

Cucumber fosmids were selected and sequenced that carried eukaryotic initiation factors eIF 4 E and eIF(iso) 4 E, genes associated with recessively inherited resistances to potyviruses in plants. Indels near eIF 4 E and eIF(iso) 4 E mapped independently of zym, a recessive locus conditioning resistance to Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, establishing that these candidate genes are not zym. Cucumber sequences were compared with melon BACs carrying eIF 4 E and eIF(iso) 4 E and extensive sequence conservation and synteny were revealed between cucumber and melon.

40|$|Abstract — Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) on flow-sorted plant chromosomes is described. The protocol involves flow cytometric sorting of metaphase chromosomes, then fixing {{them with}} 4 % paraformaldehyde solution, and re-sorting these chromosomes directly onto a spot on poly-lysine coated slides after stained. FISH mapping ex-periments were performed on the sorted chromosomes from oat and barley using 45 S and 5 S <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> as probes. The chromosome morphology was very well preserved and there were nearly no chromosomes lost after pro-cedures of hybridization and fluorescent staining. Sorted chromosomes are advantageous over metaphase chromo-somes as targets for FISH mapping studies because {{a large number of}} target chromosomes with better chromosome morphology on a small area on the slide are easy to gain by flow-sorting, background is very clear and hybridization sensitivity is enhanced. The successful and reliable location of rDNA genes in these two plant genomes, combining with the data published before in maize proves that flow-sorted chromosomes are fine materials for gene physical mapping in plants.

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner shark (C. brevipinna), blacktip shark (C. limbatus), graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip shark (C. leiodon), on the basis of morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on <b>ribosomal</b> <b>DNA,</b> suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
