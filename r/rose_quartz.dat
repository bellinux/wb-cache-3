25|$|<b>Rose</b> <b>quartz</b> {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some <b>rose</b> <b>quartz</b> contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E
25|$|Pure quartz, {{traditionally}} called {{rock crystal}} or clear quartz, is colorless and transparent or translucent, and {{has often been}} used for hardstone carvings, such as the Lothair Crystal.

50|$|Online {{reviewer}} Mark Oshiro, however, took {{exception to}} {{many aspects of}} the story - that Bismuth was not permitted the character growth given to characters like Peridot and Lapis Lazuli; that Bismuth was coded as black based on her hair and voice actor, and then associated with tropes attributed to aggressive black women; and that the episode lacks criticism of <b>Rose</b> <b>Quartz's</b> original decision to confine Bismuth away without informing her friends and comrades.|$|R
50|$|In Empire City, {{the trio}} book a stay at Le Hotel, where the staff {{join them in}} a song about the hotel's opulence and the fun they are having there, together. Greg asks Pearl to dance with him, but she refuses, {{abruptly}} ending the song to the staff's disappointment. Greg explains that his relationship with Pearl has always been this way. Later that night, while Steven and Greg are asleep, Pearl sings about her feelings regarding <b>Rose</b> <b>Quartz's</b> and Greg's love, expressing her regrets and her inability to move on since Rose ultimately chose Greg and created Steven. Steven and Greg awaken during the song, and after Pearl realizes this, Greg laments that their relationship is beyond repair.|$|R

[...] In the same review, he praised the episode's unexpected revelation of <b>Rose</b> <b>Quartz's</b> resurrection abilities and the show's unpredictability, stating that [...] "for the first time in a while, there’s no way to know what’s going to happen on Steven Universe — and it’s thrilling." ...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a rare type of pink quartz (also {{frequently}} called crystalline <b>rose</b> <b>quartz)</b> with color that {{is thought to be}} caused by trace amounts of phosphate or aluminium. The color in crystals is apparently photosensitive and subject to fading. The first crystals were found in a pegmatite found near Rumford, Maine, USA and in Minas Gerais, Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The Tiara {{immediately}} {{brings them}} to the World of Sleeping Beauty. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help. Sylphy laughs at Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable to be a real princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing in herself and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a <b>rose</b> <b>quartz</b> and joins with the Tiara.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as <b>rose</b> <b>quartz,</b> smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
40|$|The Pyrenean Axial Zone is {{characterized}} by thick series of metasedimentary and orthogneissic materials derived from pre-Variscan rocks. These sequences were intruded by large bodies of Variscan granitoids, some exposed after the Alpine orogeny. In the Eastern Pyrenees, a number of quartz veins of kilometric length and metric to decametric width, are present. Although these veins are mostly hosted by Variscan and pre-Variscan rocks, in the utheastern limit of the Roc de Frausa Massif, large fault related quartz bodies rossc utting Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, have also been recognized Liesa, 1988). The <b>Roses</b> giant <b>quartz</b> vein constitutes a remarkable example of the seregional scale quartz veins. It {{is located at the}} south ernportion of the Cap de Creus Massif, extending for 2700 mand reaching widths up to 25 m. Apparently, the vein continues towards the NW depicting a much longer structure...|$|R
2500|$|Quartz: Quartz {{refers to}} a family of {{crystalline}} gemstones of various colours and sizes. [...] Among the well-known types of quartz are <b>rose</b> <b>quartz</b> (which has a delicate pink colour), and smoky quartz (which comes {{in a variety of}} shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as Amethyst and Citrine, are also part of the quartz family. Rutilated quartz is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.|$|E
2500|$|Stone monuments include tombstones, grave markers or as mausoleums. After being gangsawed {{into big}} deep (up to [...] wide and over 6 inches deep) slabs, smaller saws or {{guillotines}} (they break the granite {{and make the}} rough edges commonly seen on monuments) shape the monuments. The fronts and backs are usually polished. The individual monuments are then carved, shaped, and further defined by hand tools and sandblasting equipment. At this time, the stone for monuments is most commonly granite, sometimes marble (as in military cemeteries), and rarely others. Granite and quartz both demonstrate good durability, especially because rain is naturally acidic. [...] (This is a natural consequence of the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere, which generates a weak solution of carbonic acid in rainfall; further acidification of rainfall arises from oxides of sulphur and nitrogen due to anthropogenic emissions). [...] Long-term durability of quartz monuments can be observed at the Harpers Ferry cemetery, where an old <b>rose</b> <b>quartz</b> tombstone stands. [...] (Limestone and sandstone were commonly chosen for monuments in the nineteenth century, but they are no widely longer used because of the rapid erosion rates due to dissolution of acid-vulnerable carbonates by acidic rainfall.) [...] The most common monument colors for granite are gray, black, and mahogany; for marble, white is most popular. Today, {{the majority of the}} stone used in North America in this application is imported from countries such as India and China. This has depressed traditional North American monument centers such as Georgia and Quebec.|$|E

She was an outdoor girl now, in low-collared blouse and white linen skirt. He rejoiced in her modulating laugh; the contrast of blue eyes and dark brows under her Panama hat; her full dark hair, with a lock sun-drenched; her bare throat, boyishly brown, femininely smooth; the sweet, clean, fine-textured girl flesh of the hollow of one shoulder faintly to be seen in the shadow of her broad, drooping collar; one hand, with a curious ring of <b>rose</b> <b>quartz</b> and steel points, excitedly pounding a tattoo of greeting with the whip-handle; her spirited irreverences regarding the people they passed; chatter which showed the world transformed as through ruby glass--a Ruth radiant, understanding, his comrade. She was all that he had believed during her absence and doubted while he was coming to her. But he had no time to repent of his doubt, now, so busily was he exulting to himself, slipping a hand under her arm: [...] "Love her? I--should--say--I--do!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Diasterism, {{such as that}} seen in <b>rose</b> <b>quartz,</b> is {{the result}} of light {{transmitted}} through the stone. In order to see this effect, the stone must be illuminated from behind. <b>Rose</b> <b>quartz</b> also exhibits epiasterism.|$|E
