5000|$|When Walden met Alan Harper, the two almost {{instantly}} formed a friendship.

When Walden discovers that his imaginary childhood gorilla friend, [...] "Magilla", was real, and {{was part of an}} experiment being conducted by his mother, he becomes very upset, as he thought of Magilla as a brother.

5000|$|It {{was finally}} {{determined}} that the engine being mounted in the rear caused too many unfavourable handling characteristics in an offroad vehicle, and the LMA002 was built with an entirely new chassis, moving the engine (now the V12 out of the Lamborghini Countach) to the front. After much testing and altering of the prototype, it was finally given a serial number {{and became the first}} LM002. The production model was unveiled at the Brussels Auto Show in 1986. It was dubbed the [...] "Rambo-Lambo". [...] Civilian models were outfitted with a full luxury package, including full leather trim, tinted power windows, air conditioning, and a premium stereo mounted in a <b>roof</b> <b>console.</b> In order to meet the vehicle's tire needs, Lamborghini commissioned Pirelli to create the Pirelli Scorpion tires with custom, run-flat tread designs. These were made specifically for the LM and were offered in two different tread designs, one for mixed use and the other for sand use only. These tires could be run virtually flat without risk and could handle the desert heat, the loading, and the speeds of the LM. The LM002 was fitted with a 290-litre fuel tank.|$|E
