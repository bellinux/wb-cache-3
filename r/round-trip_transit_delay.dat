It is not clear if the assumptions made {{in the design of}} control schemes still hold, particularly when we consider end-to-end behavior of paths in the network, today. This paper describes a simple experiment designed to capture end-to-end behavior of the Internet. The measurements indicate that the IP level service provided in the network yields high losses, duplicates and reorderings of packets. In addition, the <b>round-trip</b> <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> varies significantly. These measurements indicate that the network may have several problems which still need to be analysed in order to improve the efficiency of protocols and control mechanisms that it uses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the path-determination problem in Internet core routers that distribute flows across alternate paths {{leading to the}} same destination. We assume that {{the remainder of the}} network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> beyond this router are different for the two paths, so a good routing policy can reduce the end-to-end delay by favoring the faster path. Thus, we propose and solve the optimal path-determination problem for a router, which minimizes the average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for a flow by dynamically assigning each packet to one of the available output ports based on their respective instantaneous queue lengths and on the average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for the associated path. We assume that all outgoing link speeds at the router are equal, but we generalize the model to allow each output port to serve a link group (such as an optical fiber using WDM) that consists of multiple physical channels running in parallel. By formulating path-selection as a Markov Decision Problem, we show that the optimal algorithm is a threshold-type policy that we call  ¢¡¤£¦¥¨ §...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{propagation}} process, phase and/or frequency shifts observed in received signals the practical obtainable accuracy {{is lower than}} originally realized with the atomic clocks at the place of transmission. As with any time signal radio transmitter the precise establishment of time {{is affected by the}} distance to the transmitter, as the time signal propagates to a time signal receiver at the speed of light. For a DCF77 receiver located 1000 km away from the DCF77 transmitter, due to <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> the receiver will be set more than 3 milliseconds late. Such a small deviation will seldom be of interest and if desired instrument grade time receivers can be corrected for <b>transit</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Ultra-wideband {{wireless}} (UWB) {{may provide}} the physical layer for high capacity personal area networks in the future. Certain characteristics of the wireless links possible using this technology give rise to properties not seen with other wireless technologies. Two such properties are long synchronization times for link establishment {{and the ability to}} change individual link capacities by choosing PN codes of different lengths. This paper formulates a novel routing problem in UWB; in particular we investigate the impact of UWB physical layer characteristics on average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> for a UWB network with a ring topology. The paper derives an expression of average network <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> {{as a function of the}} capacity between each pair of nodes in the network. Each node is assumed to have one input and one output link resulting in a ring network topology, which guarantees access to every node. An aggregate network capacity bound for all links is assumed.

40|$|The {{application}} of matched filtering {{to the problem}} of very low frequency (VLF) radio signals ducted between magnetically conjugate points on the Earth by ionospheric plasma structures has been examined theoretically and implemented in recent field experiments. With accurate knowledge of the source VLF emissions, the subionospheric component of the received waveform can be effectively removed and the characteristics of the remaining ducted signal accurately estimated. Although the technique has been shown not to produce strictly consistent estimates of the subionospheric and ducted signal amplitudes, it is able to efficiently recover the <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> and amplitudes of ducted man-made whistler-mode emissions for reasonable values of the relevant signal to noise ratios. This is substantiated by the use of matched filtering to analyze data collected by radio receivers placed at the conjugate ends of a magnetic field line, thereby recovering the amplitudes and <b>transit</b> <b>delays</b> of ducted signals with time-resolution as small as 30 seconds. An arbitrary degree of accuracy can be obtained in these measurements through the use of bit stream extraction and comparison...|$|R

In particular, widespread <b>delayed</b> <b>transit</b> featured female sex, a highly depressed mood state, increased age, frequent control of anger, and more severe gastric stasis, while the features distinguishing normal transit were male sex and high levels of hypochondriasis.  CONCLUSION—These data suggest the existence of a distinct psychophysiological subgroup, defined by the presence of <b>delayed</b> <b>transit,</b> in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders.    Keywords: delayed gut transit; psychophysiology; sex; moo...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed: {{arterial}} spin labeling (PASL) {{at multiple}} inflow times (multi-TIs) is advantageous for the measurement of brain perfusion in patients with long arterial transit tittles (ATTs) as in steno-occlusive disease, because bolus-arrival-time can be measured and blood flow measurements can be corrected accordingly. Owing to its increased signal-to-noise ratio, a combination with a three-dimensional gradient and spin echo (GRASE) readout allows acquiring {{a sufficient number of}} multi-Tls within a clinically feasible acquisition time of 5 minutes. We compared this technique with the clinical standard dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging magnetic resonance imaging in patients with unilateral stenosis > 70 % of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery (MCA) at 3 Tesla. We performed qualitative (assessment by three expert raters) and quantitative (region of interest (ROI) /volume of interest (VOI) based) comparisons. In 43 patients, multi-TI PASL-GRASE showed perfusion alterations with moderate accuracy in the qualitative analysis. Quantitatively, moderate correlation coefficients were found for the MCA territory (ROI based: r= 0. 52, VOI based: r= 0. 48). In the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory, a readout related right-sided susceptibility artifact impaired correlation (ROI based: r= 0. 29, VOI based: r= 0. 34). Arterial <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> artifacts were found only in 12 % of patients. In conclusion, multi-TI PASL-GRASE can correct for arterial <b>transit</b> <b>delay</b> in patients with long ATTs.
