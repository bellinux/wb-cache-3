"Not yet," [...] said Tressilian firmly; {{and shaking}} off his {{momentary}} irresolution, he descended {{into the narrow}} staircase, to which the entrance led, and was followed by Dickie Sludge, who made fast the trap-door behind him, and thus excluded every glimmer of daylight. The descent, however, {{was only a few}} steps, and led to a level passage of a few yards' length, {{at the end of which}} appeared the reflection of a lurid and red light. Arrived at this point, with his drawn sword in his hand, Tressilian found that a turn to the left admitted him and Hobgoblin, who followed closely, into a small, square vault, containing a smith's forge, glowing with charcoal, the vapour of which filled the apartment with an oppressive smell, which would have been altogether suffocating, but that by some concealed vent the smithy communicated with the upper air. The light afforded by the <b>red</b> <b>fuel,</b> and by a lamp suspended in an iron chain, served to show that, besides an anvil, bellows, tongs, hammers, a quantity of ready-made horse-shoes, and other articles proper to the profession of a farrier, there were also stoves, alembics, crucibles, retorts, and other instruments of alchemy. The grotesque figure of the smith, and the ugly but whimsical features of the boy, seen by the gloomy and imperfect light of the charcoal fire and the dying lamp, accorded very well with all this mystical apparatus, and in that age of superstition would have made some impression on the courage of most men.|$|E

5000|$|Allen Fryer told Sandra Cheskey {{that he was}} {{a police}} officer while they drove around, that he was [...] "the boss", and that the other two would do as he {{instructed}} them. After a short time, James and David Fryer met them on the road in the pickup. Allen and Sandy got into the truck, and the group drove to a farm. At this point, James Fryer raped Sandra Cheskey. Early the next morning, Allen filled the vehicle's tank with gasoline from a large <b>red</b> <b>fuel</b> tank then drove Cheskey home, still under the pretense of being a police officer, saying that Sandra was [...] "too young to get busted".|$|E
5000|$|On November 29, 1973, Sandra Cheskey was {{accompanied}} by Craig Vinson (Lyon County, Iowa, Sheriff) as they drove around the countryside looking for the farm house where Sandy was held captive and raped. Near Hartford, South Dakota, she recognized the farmhouse by the large <b>red</b> <b>fuel</b> tank that {{stood next to the}} garage. The farm was owned by Allen Fryer's employer, a local farmer. By a strange twist of fate, Allen Fryer then drove by in the same blue pickup that was used the night of the murders. Sandy told Sheriff Vinson [...] "That's him. That's the boss." [...] Law enforcement quickly pulled the truck over and arrested Allen Fryer. David and James Fryer were also arrested shortly thereafter.|$|E

In this thesis the catalytic active layers (specifically Pt, PtCo, PtNi, PtRu) for Direct methanol fuell cell (DMFC) are studied. We have evaluated PtCo as the best cathode catalysts. We have significantly reduced the amount of platinum as well as the power loss at higher concentrations of methanol. The sputtered PtCo catalyst is comparable power density in comparison with commercial Pt catalyst while the specific power per gram of platinum is several times higher. The speci- fic power of our anode catalyst layers is comparable to reference catalysts. Our findings are useful for future improvements of the anode catalyst layer for DMFC...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Direct <b>red</b> Solid Oxide <b>Fuel</b> Cell (SOFC) Turbine hybrid {{plants have}} the {{potential}} to dramatically increase power plant efficiency, decrease emissions, and provide fast response to transient loads. The US Department of Energy's (DOE) Hybrid Performance Project is an experimental hybrid SOFC plant, built at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). One of the most significant challenges in the development and commercialization of this plant is control. Traditional control techniques are inadequate for this plant due to poor system models, high nonlinearities, and extreme coupling between state variables. Learning-based control techniques do not require explicit system models, and are well suited for controlling nonlinear and highly coupled systems. In this work, we use neuro-evolutionary control algorithms to develop a set-point controller for fuel cell flow rate in this plant, and demonstrate a controller that can accurately track a desired turbine speed profile within 50 RPM, even in the presence of 10...|$|R

5000|$|Red Lanterns use <b>red</b> power rings, <b>fueled</b> by {{the rage}} of their users and those around them. Like other power rings, the ring covers the user in a {{protective}} aura which shields them from harm and enables flight, and can create [...] "Hard Light" [...] constructs. The power ring fires blasts of rage energy. The user's blood {{is replaced by a}} form of corrosive, rage-energized blood. The user can regurgitate this blood. The blood has the effect of bursting into flames of rage; the flames are so potent that they will burn even in space. The blood can melt through the constructs of other ring wielders, penetrate their personal force fields (sometimes burning them to death in the process), and corrupt their rings, depleting their energy at an accelerated rate. The Red Rings' blood {{is one of the few}} known substances that can destroy a Black Lantern's corpse faster than even they can regenerate. Since the Red Ring completely takes over the circulatory processes of the wearer, removing the heart of a Red Lantern only temporarily incapacitates them.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on <b>red</b> hot carbon-based <b>fuel,</b> by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|R
40|$|Dissimilatory metal {{reducing}} {{bacteria can}} exchange electrons extracellularly and hold great promise {{for their use}} in simultaneous wastewater treatment and electricity production. This study investigated the role of riboflavin, an electron carrier, in the decolourisation of Congo <b>red</b> in microbial <b>fuel</b> cells (MFCs) using Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 as a model organism. The contribution of the membrane-bound protein MtrC to the decolourisation process was also investigated. Within the range of riboflavin concentrations tested, 20 µM {{was found to be}} the best with > 95 % of the dye (initial concentration 200 mg/L) decolourised in MFCs within 50 h compared to 90 % in the case where no riboflavin was added. The corresponding maximum power density was 45 mW/m 2. There {{was no significant difference in}} the overall decolourisation efficiencies of Shewanela oneidensis MR- 1 ΔMtrC mutants compared to the wild type. However, in terms of power production the mutant produced more power (Pmax 76 mW/m 2) compared to the wild type (Pmax 46 mW/m 2) which was attributed to higher levels of riboflavin secreted in solution. Decolourisation efficiencies in non-MFC systems (anaerobic bottles) were similar to those under MFC systems indicating that electricity generation in MFCs does not impair dye decolourisation efficiencies. The results suggest that riboflavin enhances both decolourisation of dyes and simultaneous electricity production in MFCs...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{landings}} {{and effort}} {{data from the}} Barcelona trawl fleet (NW Mediterranean) were selected to analyse and standardize the landings per unit effort (LPUE) of the red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) using generalized additive models. The dataset covers a span of 15 years (1994 - 2008) and consists of {{a broad spectrum of}} predictors: fleet-dependent (e. g. number of trips performed by vessels and their technical characteristics, such as the gross registered tonnage), temporal (inter- and intra-annual variability), environmental (North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO] index) and economic (<b>red</b> shrimp and <b>fuel</b> prices) variables. All predictors individually have an impact on LPUE, though some of them lose their predictive power when considered jointly. That is the case of the NAO index. Our results show that six variables from the whole set can be incorporated into a global model with a total explained deviance (ED) of 43 %. We found that the most important variables were effort-related predictors (trips, tonnage, and groups) with a total ED of 20. 58 %, followed by temporal variables, with an ED of 13. 12 %, and finally the red shrimp price as an economic predictor with an ED of 9. 30 %. Taken individually, the main contributing variable was the inter-annual variability (ED= 12. 40 %). This high ED value suggests that many factors correlated with inter-annual variability, such as environmental factors (the NAO in specific years) and fuel price, could in turn affect LPUE variability. The standardized LPUE index with the effort variability removed was found to be similar to the fishery-independent abundance index derived from the MEDITS programme...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about how foliar {{moisture}} and chemistry change after a mountain pine beetle attack and even less is known about how these intrinsic foliar characteristics alter foliage ignitability. Here, we examine the fuel characteristics and ignition potential of Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) foliage during the early stages of a mountain pine beetle attack. Foliar samples were taken periodically from multiple trees identified as green (healthy, unattacked), recently attacked, or <b>red</b> (dead). The <b>fuel</b> moisture con- tent, chemical composition, and time to ignition of needles from each attack category were quantified. Foliar moisture contents varied by an order of magnitude between the attack categories and were lowest for red needles (� 12 % on average), highest for green needles (� 109 % on average), and most variable for needles of recently attacked trees. Dry matter proportions of fiber in the needles of attacked and red trees were nearly twice that of green needles. Starch and sugar levels were much lower in the needles of attacked and red trees than green trees. Crude fat contents also differed between the attack categories. Time to ignition was strongly related to time since beetle attack. Ignition times varied from as little as 11 s for red needles to 41 s for green needles. A combined model of foliar moisture content, fiber, and crude fat explained 92 % of the variation in the foliar time to ignition. Results show that decreased mois- ture contents and changes in foliar chemistry increase the foliar flammability of mountain pine beetle- attacked trees. This suggests that less heat would be required to ignite the foliage of attacked trees and thus crown fire potential may be higher in attacked stands as long as foliage is retained on the tree.

40|$|The {{flexible}} phenotypes {{of birds}} and mammals often appear to represent adjustments to alleviate some energetic bottleneck or another. By increasing {{the size of the}} organs involved in digestion and assimilation of nutrients (gut and liver), an individual bird can increase its ability to process nutrients, for example to quickly store fuel for onward flight. Similarly, an increase in the exercise organs (pectoral muscles and heart) enables a bird to increase its metabolic power for sustained flight or for thermoregulation. Reflecting the stationary cost of organ maintenance, changes in the size of any part of the "metabolic machinery" will be reflected in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) unless changes in metabolic intensity also occur. Energetic bottlenecks appear to be set by the marginal value of organ size increases relative to particular peak requirements (including safety factors). These points are elaborated using the studies on long-distance migrating shorebirds, especially red knots Calidris canutus. Red knots encounter energy expenditure levels similar to experimentally determined ceiling levels of ca. 5 times BMR in other birds and mammals, both during the breeding season on High Arctic tundra (probably mainly a function of costs of thermoregulation) and during winter in temperate coastal wetlands (a function of the high costs of processing mollusks, prey poor in nutrients but rich in shell material and salt water). During migration, red knots phenotypically alternate between a "fueling [life-cycle] stage" and a "flight stage. " <b>Fueling</b> <b>red</b> knots in tropical areas may encounter heat load problems whilst still on the ground, but high flight altitudes during migratory flights seem to take care of overheating and unacceptably high rates of evaporative water loss. The allocation principles for the flexible phenotypes of red knots and other birds, the costs of their organ flexibility {{and the ways in which}} they "organize" all the fast phenotypic changes, are yet to be discovered...|$|R
