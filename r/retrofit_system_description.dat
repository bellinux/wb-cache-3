40|$|The {{increased}} {{threat against}} government and public {{facilities in the}} United States and abroad has highlighted {{the need to provide}} an economic and efficient method to retrofit existing conventional structures. Hollow, unreinforced, concrete masonry unit (CMU) infill walls, commonly used in reinforced concrete or steel framed structures, are particularly vulnerable to blast loads. Facilities that incorporate CMU walls must either be hardened or retrofitted for explosive events. Conventional retrofit techniques that focus on increasing the overall strength of the structure by adding steel or concrete are difficult to implement, time consuming, expensive, and in some cases, increase the debris hazard. The current research presents an alternative <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> for CMU walls that involves the application of an elastomeric material applied to the interior surface of the wall to prevent secondary debris in the form of CMU fragments from entering the structure when it is exposed to blast loads. The experimental program used to evaluate the alternative <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> was divided into three phases. In Phase one, resistance functions for seven different <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> were developed in 24 subscale static experiments. In Phase two, the structural response of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> subjected to blast loads was evaluated in 25 subscale experiments. The final phase of the experimental program consisted of 18 full-scale high-explosive (HE) experiments used to validate the structural response observed in the subscale dynamic experiments. Data generated from the experimental program were used to develop a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model to predict the mid-span deflection of the retrofitted CMU walls subjected to blast loads. The subscale resistance functions from Phase one were scaled and used in the SDOF model. The full-scale experimental results and the predicted results from the model were compared and the <b>retrofit</b> <b>systems</b> were ranked according to the qualitative and quantitative results obtained from the experimental and analytical research...|$|R

40|$|According {{to recent}} {{technology}} road maps, system cost reductions {{and development of}} standardised plug-and-function systems {{are some of the}} most important goals for solar heating technology development. Retrofitting hot water boilers in single-family houses when installing solar collectors has the potential to significantly reduce both material and installation costs. Previous studies have investigated such retrofitting, using theoretical simulations and laboratory tests, but no actual installations were made and tested in practice. This article describes the installation, measured performance and cost effectiveness of a retrofitting solution that converts existing domestic hot water heaters to a solar domestic hot water system. The measured performance is characterised by the monthly and annual solar fractions. The cost effectiveness is evaluated by a life-cycle cost analysis, comparing the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> to a conventional solar domestic hot water system and the case without any solar heating system. Measurements showed that approximately 50 % of the 5000 kWh/year of domestic hot water consumption was saved by the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> in south Sweden. Such savings are in agreement with previous estimations and are comparable to the energy savings when using a conventional solar domestic hot water system. The life-cycle cost analysis showed that, according to the assumptions and given climate, the return on investment of the <b>retrofitted</b> <b>system</b> is approximately 17 years, while a conventional system does not reach profitability during its lifetime of 25 years...|$|R
40|$|Past {{high speed}} wind events have exposed the {{vulnerability}} of the roof systems of existing light-framed wood structures to the uplift forces resulting from high speed winds, contributing greatly to economic and human loss. This research focuses on developing a <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> to increase the uplift capacity of these structures using numerical and experimental techniques. The proposed system provides the uplift forces an alternate load path to the ground, reducing the demand placed on the weak, nailed connections within the structure. A three-dimensional finite-element model of a roof system of full-scale wood structure has been developed. The model is compared to the results of a full-scale experiment in both the linear and nonlinear ranges, proving the ability of the model to predict the deflected shape of the structure. The numerical results identify the importance of considering the nonlinear plastic damage that occurs to the roof-to-wall connection under realistic wind loading. The validated numerical model is then extended to include the proposed retrofit idea. A rigorous analysis of the behaviour of the structure after application is then carried out. The model predicts that application of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> can increase the critical mean hourly wind velocity from 38 m/s to 50 m/s. An experiment has been conducted, proving the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> is effective at increasing the uplift capacity of light-framed wood structures.

40|$|Prior to 1985, it {{was common}} {{practice}} to avoid welding the connection plates to the tension flange of the girders of steel bridges. However, extensive fatigue cracking has developed in the unstiffened web gaps because of out-of-plane distortion. A new retrofit option was investigated that uses a room-temperature-cured two-part epoxy (3 M Adhesive DP 460 -NS) to join a small length of ??-inch thick steel angle to the tension flange and the connection plate. A field test on two skewed bridges showed that the adhesive-angle <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> decreased the out-of-plane strain range by 40 to 50 % when the original strain range was more than 50 microstrains.

40|$|Abstract only availableBlast {{retrofits}} on {{the market}} today are either barriers that shield the blast effects, or wall retrofits that absorb the blast effects. Good engineering practice to better optimize these designs is to find the balance between each component as it affects the system. In this study, the focus will be on sheet steel for blast retrofits. Sheet steel is used on the interior side of an exterior wall to absorb the blast effects, debris and momentum of the wall, {{in order to protect the}} occupants. Many components make up this blast <b>retrofit</b> <b>system.</b> Each component of the system must be evaluated to achieve the desired failure mode. For example, the base plates must not be too stiff or the sheets will shear from them. Conversely, if the base plates are too weak, the sheets will pull out around their anchorage. Once again, a balance of the components must be determined to achieve the desired performance from the system. This work will find that balance and determine the limits of the application. The research result will allow design engineers to select the optimum combination of wall-to-concrete floor anchorage, wall parameters, and <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> parameters.

40|$|AbstractDespite growing {{interest}} in advanced marine power systems, knowledge gaps existed as it was uncertain which configuration would be more environmentally friendly. Using a conventional system as a reference, the comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) study aimed to compare and verify the environmental benefits of advanced marine power <b>systems</b> i. e. <b>retrofit</b> and new-build <b>systems</b> which incorporated emerging technologies. To estimate the environmental impact attributable to each system, a bottom-up integrated system approach was applied, i. e. LCA models were developed for individual components using GaBi, optimised operational profiles and input data standardised from various sources. The LCA models were assessed using CML 2001, ILCD and Eco-Indicator 99 methodologies. The estimates for the advanced systems were compared {{to those of the}} reference system. The inventory analysis results showed that both <b>retrofit</b> and new-build <b>systems</b> consumed less fuels (8. 28 % and 29. 7 % respectively) and released less emissions (5. 2 – 16. 6 % and 29. 7 – 55. 5 % respectively) during operation whilst more resources were consumed during manufacture, dismantling and the end of life. For 14 impact categories relevant to global warming, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical ozone creation and PM/respiratory inorganic health issues, reduction in LCIA results was achieved by retrofit (2. 7 – 6. 6 %) and new-build systems (35. 7 – 50. 7 %). The LCIA results of the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> increased in ecotoxicity (1 – 8 %), resource depletion (1 – 2 %) and fossil fuel depletion (17. 7 – 161. 9 %). Larger magnitude of increase was shown by the new-build system in ecotoxicity (90 – 93. 9 %) and fossil fuel depletion (391. 3 %) as a result of handling additional scrap. Relative contribution of significant components towards environmental impact remained profound for the <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> (i. e. more than 84 % for all impact categories) and became more prominent for the new-build system (approximately 99 % for 18 impacts). For <b>retrofit</b> and new-build <b>systems</b> respectively, changes in fuel consumption quantity by ± 10 % and ± 20 % varied (i) ecotoxicity and land use by no means, (ii) fossil fuel depletion by 0. 95 – 1. 50 and 4. 81 – 5. 01 times assessed by CML 2001 (or 0. 95 – 1. 50 and 5. 12 – 5. 32 times assessed by Eco-Indicator 99); and (iii) the remaining impact categories by 0. 65 – 1. 37 and 0. 34 – 0. 92 times. The new-build system showed the greatest mitigation potential in 18 impact categories. The <b>retrofit</b> <b>system</b> was more environmentally friendly than the reference system.
