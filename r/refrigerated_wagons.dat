5000|$|The First World War {{provided}} {{a change of}} emphasis for Bénard's research. Hewas placed {{in charge of a}} study of the question of transporting frozen meatin <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons</b> (1914-1916), and subsequently joined the CommissionSupérieure des Inventions de Guerre in Paris, and the Physics Section of theDirection des Inventions (both appointments between 1917-1919). He later became the Chief of the Physics Section. His conclusions from the frozen meat project were adopted, and around a million tons of frozen meat were transported in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> during a four-year period, to various French army fronts. [...] Bénard was assisted in this work by an ENS student, Pierre-Michel Duffieux, who later (during World War II) founded the field of Fourier optics.|$|E
50|$|Most food is {{transported by}} road {{nowadays}} {{due to the}} shorter journey times. The stock of refrigerated vans owned by railway companies has therefore shrunk considerably. Most refrigerated vans in Europe today are operated by Interfrigo. These wagons are easy to tell apart externally: white vans are normal <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> blue ones with white stripes along the side are machine-cooled refrigerator vans.|$|E

50|$|A {{refrigerated}} van (also called a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagon)</b> is a {{railway goods wagon}} with cooling equipment. Today they are designated by the International Union of Railways (UIC) as Class I.|$|R
2500|$|Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte {{complained about}} the lack of respect shown to the {{personal}} belongings of the dead which were reportedly being looted. He initially announced his disgust about the handling of the bodies that were reportedly being [...] "dragged around" [...] and [...] "thrown", but later stated they had been handled with more care than originally thought. On 20 July, Ukrainian emergency workers, observed by armed separatists, began loading the remains of the passengers of MH17 into <b>refrigerated</b> railway <b>wagons</b> for transport and identification.|$|R
50|$|A large {{selection}} of freight wagons has been purchased, donated or leased. The railway has found use {{for many of}} the railway wagons that it has acquired and displays them on demonstration runs and for photographers' specials. The set includes a full rake of ballast wagons and plough van, which have been used during large-scale works such as the Waiuku Extension and major track renewal. Other items include replica workman's hut, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> cement wagons and bulk oil tanks.|$|E
50|$|The return service {{departed}} Cunnamulla at 09:00 {{arriving in}} Brisbane at lunchtime the next day. Even {{with the line}} speed from Cunnamulla being 30 km/h, the train was still preferred by many {{due to the lack}} of quality roads at the time. By 1957 freight wagons were also attached to the train, including louvred steel QRX and QLX-T wagons, and MPR <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons.</b> Up to 16 vehicles could make up the train. Passenger services beyond Charleville to Cunnamulla and Quilpie were withdrawn in 1994.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Meishin Expressway between Nagoya and Kobe in 1965 and the Tomei Expressway between Tokyo and Nagoya in 1968, JNR faced {{increasing}} competition for freight transport from road hauliers. JNR therefore developed the [...] "10000 series" [...] freight wagons (KoKi 10000 and KoKiFu 10000 container flat wagons, ReSa 10000 and ReMuFu 10000 <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> and WaKi 10000 bogie vans) capable of operating at 100 km/h. Express freight services formed of these wagons were introduced on the Tokaido Main Line and Sanyo Main Line from October 1966 using Class EF65-500 electric locomotives built in 1965. These locomotives were designed to be used in pairs hauling 1,000-tonne freight trains, but as pairs of locomotives drew excessive current from the overhead wires, 1,000-tonne freight trains had to be split into 600-tonne and 400-tonne sections when operating on the Sanyo Main Line. This led to the need for a new locomotive design that would be capable of hauling 1,000-tonne trains singly.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{nationalisation}} {{the railway}} had carried 434,052 passengers and 45,969 tons of freight. However {{the volume of}} passengers and cargo carried decreased one year later, mainly due to the increasing road traffic. In spite of this, the Argentine state made significant investments for the FCCRCS, acquiring railcars (even a <b>refrigerating</b> coach), 13 <b>wagons</b> for livestock, apart of remodeling stations and building houses for the employees. By 1949 the line had run 430,828 kilometers.|$|R
5000|$|Compared with machine-cooled vans, ice-cooled wagons {{have the}} {{disadvantage}} of uneven temperature control, because the cooling effect is only achieved by air circulation. On the other hand, machine-cooled wagons are expensive to maintain and operate, but can be set to the desired temperature and maintained at that temperature throughout the entire journey. They are also better suited to transporting goods at deep-freeze temperatures of around , whereas evaporators and ice-cooling are more suited to maintaining temperatures of around [...] Banana [...] with gas evaporators have an optimum internal temperature of [...] In addition to proper refrigerated vans, there are covered wagons with thermal insulation and, in some cases, even those are equipped with <b>refrigerating</b> sets. These <b>wagons</b> can only operate at temperatures between , where a constant internal temperature is desired.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{most of the}} A82 {{is single}} carriageway, and the local {{geography}} means a detour can be a significant distance, there {{is a history of}} strong protest about closing the road. In August 2011, John Grieve, owner of Lochleven Shellfish Company, attempted to challenge Transport Scotland's plans to close the A82 overnight five days a week, for a period of up to three weeks, around the village of Onich, between Glencoe and Fort William. The Scottish Herald reported that, if the road closed, a journey from Oban to Fort William, normally 44 miles km, would require diverting via Loch Tay and Ballinluig, a journey of 166 miles km. Stewart MacLean from the A82 Partnership said, [...] "The proposal to close the road is ludicrous because there is no reasonable detour ... There are commercial vehicles running all the time. The delivery vehicles, the fish farm lorries, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>wagons,</b> they all need to get through." [...] In April 2013, Transport Scotland announced further plans to close the A82 at Onich for resurfacing, but they postponed the work due to an adverse reaction from local business owners.|$|E
