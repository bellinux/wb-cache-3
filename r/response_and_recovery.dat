500|$|Concerns {{regarding}} Fitzgeralds keel-welding problem surfaced {{during the}} time the USCG started increasing her load line. This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel's critical reserve buoyancy. Prior to the load-line increases {{she was said to}} be a [...] "good riding ship" [...] but afterwards Fitzgerald became a sluggish ship with slower <b>response</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> times. Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a [...] "wiggling thing" [...] that scared him. Fitzgeralds bow hooked to {{one side or the other}} in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.|$|E
500|$|The species' {{low rate}} of {{reproduction}} and long period of immaturity render it vulnerable to rapid change in the environment as <b>response</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> are slow. Their habit of forming flocks predisposes them to outbreaks of disease and localised adverse weather events. A probable {{outbreak of a disease}} led to the deaths of up to 23 breeding female cockatoos at Koobabbie in September–October 2009, a hailstorm killed 68 individuals around Perth on 22 March 2010, and 145 perished in a heatwave around Hopetoun when temperatures reached [...] on 6 January 2010. Temperature and weather extremes in southwest Australia are predicted to worsen with climate change. Carnaby's black cockatoos have been brought to veterinary hospitals with traumatic injuries. Motor vehicles are a hazard, as much vegetation useful to Carnaby's black cockatoos lies on road verges. The cockatoos fly into open space when leaving the vegetation, which is often over a road and in the path of oncoming traffic.|$|E

30|$|We have {{fabricated}} electrospun polycrystalline ZnO nanowires directly placed onto interdigitated electrodes to form gas sensors for {{the detection}} of ethanol. Sensors exhibiting very high sensitivities, <b>and</b> fast <b>response</b> time <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> time were demonstrated. The average nanowire diameter ranges from 220 ± 15 nm to 90 ± 10 nm and decreases with the calcination time. The ZnO nanowires exhibit a strong UV emission at 368 nm and a very insignificant emission or nearly none at 465 nm. For the detection of ethanol at 220 °C, an excellent sensitivity of nearly 90 % was obtained at a low ethanol concentration of 10 ppm and the rest obtained at higher ethanol concentrations, up to 600 ppm, are all ≥ 90 %. Fast <b>response</b> time <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> times of 16 s and 25 s, were also obtained.|$|R
