40|$|Our {{research}} is targeting Instructors that have course material {{as a collection}} of various digital documents (raw content) and whose objective is to re-structure this raw content into a standards-based format in order to support a higher degree of content reuse, sharing and easier maintenance. In previous work, we differentiated a <b>Reusable</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Object</b> (<b>RLO)</b> from a Sharable Learning Object (SLO) and developed a model which can be applied to convert RLOs into SLOs [4]. In this paper, we present an iterative five-step method to re-structure selected raw content into RLOs. The model from the previous work is then applied to convert the RLOs into SLOs. Thus far, we have used raw content from one Instructor’s Computer Architecture course and found that conversion of the raw content can successfully result in a subset of the raw content residing in SLOs, a form which is more conducive to reuse, sharing and content maintenance. In ongoing work, we are applying the methodology to additional raw content from several other Instructors (Computer Science courses) with a view to refining and automating the process where possible. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} aims {{to present the}} general framework of an affective teaching system (affective tutoring system - ATS) oriented to engineering education. ATS system is equipped with an emotional agent inspired by the psycho-pedagogical researches of control-value theory that try to estimate the student's emotion during a <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> (<b>RLO),</b> having as a stimulus the ability evaluated by means of item response theory. To present a lesson the RLO model was improved, being organized in a matrix form with five columns and three rows. Each objective of teaching is assigned to a RLO array. The five columns cover a theoretical concept, its properties, relationships between concepts, {{the involvement of the}} human factor in these relationships and conclusions. The three lines cover the following aspects of teaching: theoretical teaching of the five concepts from the columns, teaching practical examples or typical experiment for each column, and on the last line specific exercises that must be solved for each column separately. The RLO matrix object with three rows and five columns has also, besides teaching objective, verification tests associated to each element in the array. Evaluation of matrix tests is performed by item response theory, which links estimated student emotion with the type of teaching objective by Extended-Value Emotional Control Agent...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{research}} has indicated {{the importance of having}} a sound pedagogical framework in place for the creation of learning objects which can support student learning, particularly higher order thinking skills. This paper describes the evolution of a learning object that has been in use for nearly eight years. The interactive graphing object (IGO) is a <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> (<b>RLO)</b> that supports students to develop a deeper understanding of concepts that can be expressed graphically. Previous research indicated that the IGO facilitates higher levels of student engagement and deeper approaches to learning than more conventional static displays or animations of graphs. However, the student learning environment continues to evolve and diversify. There is a need for the development of RLOs that can keep pace with these changes. Some limitations with the original authoring environment which prevented more widespread use of the IGO have been addressed. Moreover, the advent of more powerful Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) has resulted in the redesign of the student environment of the IGO, and development of a mobile form of the IGO—the mIGO. This paper discusses the design and development issues associated with improving a successful RLO, and then adapting it to facilitate learning in a mobile environment.

40|$|This is an 8 week {{experience}} for the college student that begins by setting a learning context through using library resources, especially online databases, for locating images and art that reflect a chosen research topic and creating a mural that demonstrates the students’ comprehension of the chosen topic. The experience includes conducting research on 3 significant events or people in women’s US history. The written research will be accompanied by images or art that the student has chosen (described) as reflective of, or related to the researched event or person. In {{order to determine the}} students’ level of information literacy, the research will include a detailed description of how the students located the images.

40|$|Instructional design {{theory and}} {{practice}} interact powerfully in live projects. This article describes one use of the Cisco Systems, Inc. ’s <b>Reusable</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Object</b> (<b>RLO)</b> approach (with their legal permission) to the building of automated RLOs for a national project. Through the definition of information as concept, fact, procedure, process, and principle to a live curricular build, a six-module automated training was created in 2006 for deployment beginning in 2007. This project involves 12, 000 geographically dispersed learners (of varying educational and cultural backgrounds) with a complex and regionally sensitive curriculum, with contents collected from national SMEs and deployed over an ontologybased database. The training involves evolving biological science materials and requires complex, real-time decisionmaking. This article examines the applied principles of instructional design (cognition, learner profiling, Clark and Mayer’s multimedia development and cognition findings, learner developmental phasing, and other theories) in a live project. It explores how the six modules were planned, created, alpha- and beta-tested and deployed. Vocabulary flashcards, multiple-choice pre- and post-test assessments (for certification), and {{the beginnings of a}} decision-making simulation were created. Decision trees were used for the simulation and the planning for a full experience “wrap” for the decision-makers in the simulation. This paper addresses the use of metadata and “invisible” metadata for inhouse password-protected use. Instructor notes added value for the occasions when instructors might choose to deploy the learning live F 2 F(face-to-face) or via online eLearning using these same digital materials, or when trainers might wish to use online spaces to bring geographically dispersed communities together. Challenges. Real-world strategies for collecting, gaining copyright release, and labeling digital artifacts affected the instructional design. The push for the lowest common denominator among users restricted some curriculum design options. The “affordances” of a database and the collaborative teamwork of dispersed grant principal investigators (PIs) led to yet further limitations. Important multimedia, pedagogical agent strategies, and other elements were harder to create in a cautious environment. This will explore how difficult it may be to create regionalization and customization builds. This will advocate the importance of the malleability and pliability of RLOs for more effective eLearning and reusability...|$|E
40|$|Although {{our health}} and social care (HSC) {{students}} have some experience of simple charts, such as pie and bar, and some intuition of histograms, they {{do not appear to}} have much knowledge or understanding about box and whisker plots and their relation to the data they are describing or to other charts, eg histograms. The boxplot is a versatile charting tool, useful for presenting data from surveys and any other projects, where a reasonable quantity of data has been collected. An opportunity arose with funding under the Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) initiative, sponsored by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), to create a <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> (<b>RLO)</b> to describe, explore, and interpret boxplots, especially in relation to their data and summary statistics, with links to interprofessional (IP) learning, as this was the main remit of the CETL established at this university. The RLO is aimed at both undergraduate and post-graduate HSC students, who would {{be able to use the}} resource flexibly, to augment their limited exposure to statistical techniques, and add to their appreciation of IP learning and working. The RLO includes animation and opportunities for students to interact, for example to experiment with changing data values to see the resulting effect on the chart. Links are made to existing websites with historical detail for further exploration if wanted. Existing, available 'real' data, collected as part of research projects concerning (IP) learning, as well as generated data, is used as illustrative material. This paper explores some of the issues raised during the creation of the RLO, and discusses limited feedback from users. Issues raised include the working of the project team, delivery platform, copyright and intellectual property rights and software incompatibilities. The completion of the project was delayed, which reduced the potential for evaluation. Interim feedback from colleagues and students has been very positive and encouraged further improvements. In conclusion, the creation of this RLO has been a longer and more time-consuming experience than anticipated, and has highlighted the importance of a team approach, with constant reviewing. It has been an enjoyable, although at times, a frustrating experience. It will be interesting to see how the RLO will be used, and usage will be evaluated in the futur...|$|E

40|$|A <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> (<b>RLO)</b> is {{a web-based}} {{multimedia}} digital resource {{based on a}} single learning objective, comprising a stand-alone collection of presentation, activity, assessment and links (Leeder et al, 2002, 2003), the advantage of which allow instructional designers to build small instructional components that can be re-used {{a number of times}} in different learning context (Wiley 2001). Reusable e-learning materials (REM) are known as the e-learning resources generated in the form of RLOs that utilise a wide range of multimedia components such as assessments and activities (Leeder tl al, 2003). REM offers a competitive advantage over interactive multimedia due to its cost effectiveness, reusability and scalability (Leeder et al, 2003, 2004; Muzio et al, 2001). Maximising learners’ engagement and motivation in the process of learning is critical towards learning outcomes (Alexander 2001). The integration of REM and face-to-face learning, known as interactive learning (IL), has been proposed in order to achieve this (Katzy, 2000; Sloman, 2001; Chang, 2002, 2003). There are problems involved during the integration, and technical problems often become the centre of attention (Grudin 1994). However, focus on the needs of educators and demands of their teaching and learning practice are ignored but important aspects in IL (Katzy, 2000; Sloman, 2001; Chang, 2002, 2003). Engaging educators in the creative process of REM content development is a recommended way for motivating educators and also allowing them to understand the benefits of using technology for teaching, learning and sharing purposes. (Leeder et al, 2002). By making “human factor” at the centre of practising e-learning, reuse of learning resources is further encouraged from active participation, feedback, peer sharing and IL, thus maximising learners’ engagement and motivation. In order to effectively create REM, a virtual learning environment (VLE) is often adopted at the heart of learning activities. But one such a disadvantage is the expectation of high quality materials required due to its principle of self-directed learning. However, a place for providing a forum for circulating ideas and resolving both technical and pedagogic problems is a solution (Leeder et al, 2003). This offers different educators and learners a collaborative environment face-to-face and in VLE, thus encouraging educators creating and sharing REM. User feedback on the use and effectiveness of REM delivered in the VLE is also an important step, since the peer review process can reflect REM evaluation (Leeder et al, 2003). This provides essential information for (1) knowing whether REM is helping to create and share REM and (2) knowing the extent of acceptance, adoption and uses of REM among educators. If the outcomes of (2) are not up to the expectation, providing practical workshops is a key factor, since this offers educators hand-on experience in creating, discussing and sharing REM, thus increasing their interests and enthusiasm in using REM. Finally, the active involvement of an organisation for providing learning assistance, workshops, consultancy, VLE and a series of interactive learning, is critical for maintaining momentum for encouraging educators in creating and sharing REM. This is an ongoing process that requires a strong collaboration and support between educators and this organisation, which can act as (1) a centre for learning, training and sharing and (2) a centre for providing recommended ways of practicing REM that suit individual cases, thus delivering the most effective REM by maximising the adoption of REM...|$|E

40|$|It seems {{a foregone}} {{conclusion}} that repositories for <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> (<b>RLOs),</b> based on common standards and supported by suitable search facilities, will foster a global economic market {{in the production of}} RLOs.

If the marked is defined as cost versus value, then the set of qualities that distinguishes RLOs from other educational software prohibits the development scalable search engines to search the repositories. At a more sophisticated level of market analysis, it is the needs of the producers, rather than the purchasers, that will define quality in the market. Any attempt to limit this imbalance will, paradoxically, require acceptance of alternative constraints that many may find hard to accept...|$|R

RLOs have been implemented in nursing, pharmacy, and physician assistant programs. However, {{there is a lack of}} literature regarding RLOs in occupational therapy education. An attitudinal survey was administered to occupational therapy students after they had used an RLO focused on goal writing. Student preferences toward RLO content, instructional design, and eLearning were generally positive. Nearly three-quarters of the students who responded to the survey indicated that the RLO presented was beneficial. All respondents noted that they would use the RLO for future occupational therapy courses. It is argued that incorporating RLOs offers a cost-effective, efficient learning tool, and also adds credibility to the given curriculum program as being innovative with instructing occupational-therapy related concepts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to design, build and test two {{sustainable}} <b>reusable</b> <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> (<b>RLOs)</b> for physical activity (PA) and provide opportunities to assess changes in knowledge and self-reported behaviour following exposure. The RLOs developed for this project encourage self-directed learning and help to foster transformational learning and facilitate critical reflection. Specifically, this means that students {{will be able to}} work through the content independently and engage with the RLO at a time and place convenient to them – an important factor in nursing since our students spend a significant proportion of time outside of the university setting. This project supports the integration of new technologies into the traditional learning environment for health promotion. The RLOs will be used as an interactive medium to promote the understanding of physical activity as both a key public health issue and one that they need to address both professionally (through their role as a nurse) and personally (through applying what they learn to their own behaviour). Additionally, the project will support critical reflection on students’ learning, since there will be opportunities to assess students’ knowledge and behaviour change before and after they have engaged with the RLOs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reusable</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Objects</b> (<b>RLOs)</b> support {{packaging}} {{of educational}} materials allowing their discovery and reuse. Open Educational Resources (OERs) emphasise {{the need for}} open licencing and promote sharing and community involvement. For both teachers and learners, finding appropriate tried and tested resources on a topic of interest {{and being able to}} incorporate them within or alongside other learning materials can enrich provision and share best practice. Resources are made available by a number of general and subject-specific repositories, but there are also many educational resources residing outside these repositories which may provide useful additional materials. Potential users of materials {{need to be able to}} locate relevant material and to assess it with respect to a number of factors (such as suitability for purpose and licence requirements). However, even such basic requirements can be less than straightforward to determine. This paper presents a view of the field from the user's perspective, bringing together themes from existing research relating to practice-oriented concerns including discoverability, reusability and quality. It provides a background in this area, exploring current trends, controversies and research findings. The discussion is also aligned with current provision and practice, indicating areas where further research, provision and support would be useful...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This study {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>Reusable</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>Objects</b> (<b>RLO)</b> integrated with two instructional strategies to reduce cognitive load {{as measured by the}} Paas mental effort rating scale. The main intention for utilizing the RLO strategy is to create smaller chunks of information to help reduce cognitive load, thus enabling incremental consumption of processed information as advocated in a constructivist environment. The RLO strategy has illustrated similar functionality of the working memory as indicated in the Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). The information delivered through two different instructional strategies with the incorporation of the RLO was expected to enhance learning with the reduction of cognitive load as learning progressed. However, does the reduction of cognitive load really reduce the mental effort invested by learners during the learning process? The subject matter selected for the RLO strategy was the Malaysian Form One English Literature Component. There were 160 subjects who participated in this study. Participants self-rated themselves using the Paas mental effort rating scale to measure their mental effort investment in their posttest. The results showed no statistically significant differences of the mental efforts between the groups of students following both instructional strategies. However, {{the effectiveness of}} the instructional strategies may potentially help reduce extraneous cognitive load...|$|R
