40|$|The area of Slovenia {{is rather}} widely {{intertwined}} with {{a network of}} centralised areas of various hierarchies. Several researchers (Drozg, Ravbar, Vrišer, Fister, and many others), who {{used a variety of}} input data and received adequate results, have been dealing with the topic of the influence of centres, their connections and characteristics. For a settlement to exist, it has to possess a program for the provision of its citizens. At the same time such a settlement has its own characteristics and ingredients {{at the level of the}} design of the settlement as well as construction. Fister (1993) dealt with the latter topic while Vrišer (1998) focused on the functionality of settlements and their influence on the catchment areas. In this context the question arises as to whether there is a connection between the categorisation of the Slovenian area in regards to the characteristics of construction by Fister and classification in regards to the program, its importance and the question whether classification criteria exists which could be connected into larger <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> <b>units</b> with similar characteristics in regards to the building and similar program characteristics of public open spaces by Vrišer. The basis for researching the problem in question was the comparison of the model by Fister with the model by Vrišer. Acquired results formed the basis for further research of public open spaces connecting constructions in settlements with centres of second level by Vrišer...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the display of}} existing spatial phenomena for the settlements of Zgornja and Spodnja Sorica, the two {{of which have been}} merged into one sensible <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> <b>unit</b> for the purpose of the thesis. The display of existing spatial phenomena is executed by regulations stipulated by The spatial planning law from 2007, and detailed by Rules on the display of existing spatial phenomena from 2008 (hereinafter the Rules). The thesis consists of the theoretical and the practical part. The legal basis is presented in the first part, continued by an example of the display of existing spatial phenomena for the settlement of Sorica (both Zgornja and Spodnja Sorica). After that Sorica and its municipality Železniki are presented. The display of existing spatial phenomena is composed of textual and graphical part. In the textual part there is mostly the town description and the interpretation of the graphical charts, in the graphical part there is a display of the discussed area, a display of the intended as well as the actual land use including restrictions and protection regimes like cultural heritage, forests, waters, natural values, etc. Graphical attachments are in the 1 : 25. 000 scale, which allows the display of the whole discussed area to be put on a A 3 -sized paper. But according to the Rules it is necessary to make the display of existing spatial phenomena in the scale of 1 : 5. 000 or less, that is why we created displays for a part of the settlement in the regulated scale. In the final part we have summed up our findings about the display of existing spatial phenomena and discussed about its usefulness in spatial planning. ...|$|R

30|$|Each of {{the four}} {{algorithms}} consists of three steps: node mapping, link mapping and definition of paths for transfer of the required images. For each step two procedures defines: how to round the real values off to binary ones and when such <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> should take place. In node mapping, the first procedure defines which variable will be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1 since only one Xn,m,ican be set to 1 for each virtual node m. The second procedure determines whether or not all the other variables values should be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1.
