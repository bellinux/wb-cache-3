The chapters first cover techniques relating to measurements of neutral dynamics and chemistry, then measurements of the various intermittent and excessive radiation sources which effect the middle atmospheric environment, and finally measurements of the plasma environment including electric fields. The weighting toward plasma related parameters is not accidental, but reflects both the historical headstart given by early development of radio wave and probe techniques to measure electron density, and by the relatively limited number of techniques available for neutral atmospheric measurements...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} {{diagnosis}} of alpha chain disease (alphaCD)) {{is essential to}} successful treatment and to epidemiological studies, the available immunodiagnostic techniques were compared for their sensitivity, specificity and ease of performance on a panel of sixteen sera, comprising ten alphaCD sera and six control sera containing either IgA myeloma protein or high levels of polyclonal IgA. Immunoselection by immunoelectrophoresis into gel containing a specially developed anti-Fabalpha antiserum provided the most sensitive and specific detection system for alphaCD protein. The same technique using anti-light chain antiserum for immunoselection was also highly sensitive, but proved less specific, being prone to false positives with difficult IgA myeloma proteins. Somewhat less sensitive, but specific and simple to perform, was immunoelectrophoresis using an antiserum recognizing the conformational specificities of Fabalpha {{as well as those}} of the constant region of alpha chains.

30|$|An in-situ <b>rocket</b> <b>technique</b> using foil chaff is used {{to observe}} wind fields in the {{mesosphere}} and lower thermosphere (80 – 98 km in altitude). We launched two micro-rockets at 1200 and 1315 UT on 14 January 1997 from Uchinoura, Japan (31 °N, 131 °E). The MU radar (MUR; 35 °N, 136 °E) and the Yamagawa MF radar (MFR; 31 °N, 131 °E) simultaneously observed winds at the same heights {{by means of a}} meteor scattering and partial reflection echo from the ionosphere received by spaced antennas, respectively. The chaff and MFR winds generally agree well at 80 – 88 km, while MFR data were missing at the heights > 88 km. In the chaff, MFR, and the MUR winds, we have found a coherent structure likely due to a large-scale gravity wave. The chaff results suggest that wind fluctuations with a vertical scale of ∼m at 82 – 85 km are quite consistent with gravity wave motions. It is noteworthy that a qualitative agreement is found between the chaff descent speed fluctuations and the wave-induced vertical component, although those vertical velocities are quantitatively inconsistent. On some special occasions chaff velocity might be affected by another process, of which tentative candidates are an apparent motion of the strong echo point in a chaff cloud, and an internal mesospheric “bore”.|$|R

The analysis of simultaneously recorded tweeks at both the stations on five international quiet days during one month each from summer (June), winter (January), and equinox (March) seasons shows that the D region electron density varies 21. 5 – 24. 5 cm 3 over the ionospheric reflection height of 85 – 95 km. The average values of Wait lower ionospheric parameters: ionospheric reference height h? and sharpness factor b are almost same during winter (85. 9 – 86. 1 km, 0. 51 – 0. 52 km 1) and equinox (85. 6 – 85. 7 km, 0. 54 km 1) seasons. The values of h? and b during summer season are about 83. 5 km and 0. 60 km 1 at both stations. Overall, equivalent electron density profile obtained using tweek method shows lower values of electron density by about 5 – 60 % than those obtained using the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI- 2007) model and lower/higher by 2 – 68 % than those obtained using <b>rocket</b> <b>technique.</b> The electron density estimated using all three techniques (tweek, IRI- 2007, and rocket) is consistent in the altitude range of 82 – 98 km.
