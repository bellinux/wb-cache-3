5000|$|Salt has two key {{characteristics}} {{that make it}} unique in a tectonic setting, and important economically. The first is that salt (and other evaporites) deform plastically over geologic time, and thus behaves as a fluid rather than a rigid structure. This allows structures with salt components to deform more easily and have a slightly different appearance. Take, for example the Appalachians, which contain some salt deposits, and the Rocky Mountains, which is an accretionary terrain with little to no salt. This also allows {{for the creation of}} structural traps for oil and gas, as well as metals [...] which makes them sought after targets in industry.The second, which is the fact that evaporites are often less dense, or more buoyant, than the surrounding rock, which aids in its mobility and creates a <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>Taylor</b> <b>instability.</b> This means that the less dense substance {{will find a way to}} rise through or away from the more dense one. In salt tectonics, this occurs in three ways; the first is differential loading, where the salt flows from an area of high pressure to lower pressure, the second is gravitational spreading, where the salt spreads out laterally under its own gravitational weight, the last is thermal convection, where warmer - and thus less dense - salt rises through colder and more dense salt. This is only seen in laboratory settings due to the unlikely occurrence of salt bodies with great enough temperature variance.|$|E

Some of the configurations adopted in classical plasmonics can be explored considering high intensity lasers interacting with properly structured targets. SP excitation at intensities such that the electrons quiver at relativistic velocities, poses new questions and might open new frontiers for manipulation and amplification of high power laser pulses. Here we discuss two configurations which show evidence of the resonant coupling between relativistically intense laser pulses with the SPs on plasma targets with surface modulations. Evidences of SP excitation were observed in a recent experiment when a high contrast (1012), high intensity laser pulse (I = 5 1019 W cm− 2) was focussed on a grating target (engraved surface at submicron scale); a strong emission of multi-MeV electron bunches accelerated by SPs was observed only in conditions for the resonant SP excitation.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and melt sources for crustal growth at active continental margins are analyzed {{by using a}} 2 D coupled petrological–thermomechanical numerical model of an oceanic-continental subduction zone. This model includes spontaneous slab retreat and bending, dehydration of subducted crust, aqueous fluid transport, partial melting, melt extraction and melt emplacement in form of extrusive volcanics and intrusive plutons. We could identify the following three geodynamic regimes of crustal growth: (i) stable arcs, (ii) compressional arcs with plume development, and (iii) extensional arcs. Crustal growth in a stable subduction setting results in the emplacement of flattened intrusions in the lower crust. At first dacitic melts, extracted from partially molten rocks located atop the slab (gabbros and basalts), intrude into the lower crust followed by mantle-derived (wet peridotite) basaltic melts from the mantle wedge. Thus extending plutons form in the lower crust, characterized by a successively increasing mantle component and low magmatic addition rates (10 km 3 /km/Myrs). Compressional arcs are accomplished by the formation and emplacement of hybrid plumes. In the course of subduction localization and partial melting of basalts and sediments along the slab induces <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>Taylor</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Hence, buoyant plumes are formed, composed of partially molten sediments and basalts of the oceanic crust. Subsequently, these plumes ascend, crosscutting the lithosphere before they finally crystallize within the upper crust in form of silicic intrusions. Additionally, intrusions are formed in the lower crust derived by partial melting of rocks located atop the slab (basalts, gabbros, wet peridotite) and inside the plume (basalts, sediments). Magmatic addition rates are somewhat higher compared to stable arcs (40 – 70 km 3 /km/Myrs). Subduction in an extensional arc setting results in decompression melting of dry peridotite. The backward motion of the subduction zone relative to {{the motion of the}} plate leads to thinning of the overriding plate. Thus, hot and dry asthenosphere rises into the neck as the slab retreats, triggering decompression melting of dry peridotite.

40|$|The finite ion Larmor radius (FLR) {{stabilization}} {{of the magnetic}} curvature-driven <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>Taylor</b> (MCD RT) <b>instability</b> in a low beta plasma with nonzero ion temperature gradient is investigated. Finite electron temperature effects and ion temperature perturbations are incorporated. A new set of nonlinear equations for flute waves with arbitrary wavelengths {{as compared with the}} ion Larmor radius in a plasma with curved magnetic field lines is derived. Particular attention is paid to the waves with spatial scales of the order of the ion Larmor radius. In the linear limit, a Fourier transform of these equations yields an improved dispersion relation for flute waves. The dependence of the M CD RT instability growth rate on the equilibrium plasma parameters and the wavelengths is studied. The condition for which the instability cannot be stabilized by the FLR effects is found.
