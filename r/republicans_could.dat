5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force a recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather than face recall. Because she resigned, the Democrats were able to appoint a replacement; {{if she had been}} recalled, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> have gained a majority in the state senate.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
25|$|In Rove's analysis, 10 of the 28 House seats Republicans lost were sacrificed {{because of}} various scandals. Another six, he said, were lost because incumbents did not {{recognize}} and react quickly enough to the threat. Rove argued that, without corruption and complacency, The Democrats would have gained around a dozen seats and <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> have kept narrow control of the House regardless of Bush's troubles and the war.|$|E
50|$|Arizona {{was still}} seeking statehood. After years of electing a Democrat as the {{territorial}} {{delegate to the}} U.S. Congress, feelings in the territory were that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> have better results achieving statehood in a Republican controlled Congress. This sentiment helped Ralph H. Cameron defeat long term territorial Delegate Mark Smith.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the odds}} he faced {{in the general}} election, Tufaro promised to {{campaign}} against O'Malley, not taking defeat as an inevitability. He pointed to Bret Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, as evidence that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> be elected in a heavily Democratic city. Schundler came to Baltimore to campaign for Tufaro.|$|R
500|$|For 1890, the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley {{one final}} time, placing Stark County {{in the same}} {{district}} {{as one of the}} strongest pro-Democrat counties, Holmes, populated by solidly Democratic Pennsylvania Dutch. The new boundaries seemed good, based on past results, for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891, but they could throw all their energies into the district, as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide, and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley's race. The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton, including Blaine (then Secretary of State), Speaker Reed and President Harrison. The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues. McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district, reaching out to its 40,000 voters to explain that his tariff ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1895, Republican John Griggs {{was elected}} {{governor}} of New Jersey; his campaign was managed by Hobart. [...] The election of New Jersey's first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation {{in the newspapers}} that Hobart would {{be a candidate for}} vice president. [...] New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart, both to see one of their own possibly elevated to national office, and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey. [...] Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state, and the Griggs victory showed that <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> hope to win New Jersey's electoral votes, which they had not done since 1872. [...] Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign.|$|E
500|$|Another new borough {{created by}} the {{residents}} to keep local school control was Woodcliff, which was formed around the settlement of Pascack from parts of Harrington Township and Orvil Township, and which in 1910 became Woodcliff Lake. Rural Upper Saddle River broke away from Orvil Township and Hohokus Township, taking one of Orvil Township's six schoolhouses—the press noted that the nascent borough would most likely go Democratic as only 16 <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> be found. Ridgewood, then a township, avoided further depredations by Midland Park and Glen Rock by incorporating as a village. The borough of Wood-Ridge was formed after the boundary lines were carefully drawn {{with an eye to}} the referendum, to exclude the home of a family of prominent landowners who were opposed to the incorporation—though not excluding their farmland. [...] Once Wood-Ridge was successfully established, the farmhouse was annexed by borough ordinance.|$|E
50|$|New {{technology}} improved {{production and}} better {{living and working}} conditions. In the 1930s Great Depression tensions between the Japanese and the Whites of the earlier decades went dormant. It became unwise to make demands. Anti-syndicate and anti-rioting laws ended unions and the labor movement dwindled and refusing to vote <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> result {{in the loss of}} employment.|$|R
500|$|Democrat Nancy Pelosi, {{who served}} as the Speaker from January 2007 through January 2011, asked her Democratic colleagues for their vote in the election. Steny Hoyer, the House Minority Whip, said that he {{expected}} that the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of Democrats to vote for Pelosi. He said that if a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> not get the votes needed, Democrats could consider their options.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the center}} of the Imperial Army kept its position. The {{infantry}} here formed squares to repel any attempt made by 2nd Corps of the enemy cavalry to subdue them. Only when {{it was clear that the}} <b>Republican</b> Army <b>could</b> encircle the 2nd Division, did it withdraw from the battlefield. The <b>Republican</b> Army <b>could</b> not pursue the enemy. The lack of proper means made Alvear order his men to put fire to the battlefield and leave the scene.|$|R
2500|$|On December 1, 2011, Hall gave an {{interview}} to National Journal in which he expressed disbelief in anthropogenic climate change. He accused climate scientists of concocting the evidence for anthropogenic climate change {{in order to receive}} federal research grants, citing the Climategate controversy and calling investigations which had largely exonerated them [...] "straw-man reviews". He stated that [...] "I'm really more fearful of freezing. And I don't have any science to prove that. But {{we have a lot of}} science that tells us they're not basing it on real scientific facts." [...] He responded to allegations that <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> be called anti-science in light of these views by saying [...] "I'm not anti-science, I'm pro-science. But we ought to have some believable science.... We have to be more careful what outlays we make for something that hasn't been proved." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{convention}} Gates returned home where a parade had been organized {{in his honor}} in Columbia City. He launched his campaign after the parade and began traveling around the state to stump. He spent considerable time in traditionally Democratic southern Indiana in hopes that he could win over their support. In all of his speeches he used the term [...] "a local problem can best be solved by local government." [...] He also continued to charge that leadership of the state had been abandoned to federal government and that <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> remedy the situation. Gates and his Democratic opponent, Samuel D. Jackson, did not hold any debates or travel to make joint appearances. The Republican party platform paid off and Gates defeated Jackson by more than 46,000 votes. Republicans also took a large two-thirds majorities {{in both houses of}} the Indiana General Assembly.|$|E

2500|$|Gurney {{blamed the}} 1970 defeat in Florida on the {{inability}} of the Republican nominees to attract cross-over Democratic support. Kirk said no <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> have won statewide that year because Askew and Chiles had commanded the majority coalition in the state. The Democrats found that [...] "fresh faces and new looks outweighed age and experience." [...] They gained extensive support from working-class whites, blacks (who were voting in higher numbers), Jews (including retirees from the North), Cuban Americans, urban residents, and rural voters.|$|R

50|$|NUSJ {{served as}} a {{foundation}} for the formation of a third political party, called the Union. It was formed to challenge Roosevelt in the election of 1936. Its founding members included Father Charles E. Coughlin, activist Francis Townsend, and politician Gerald L. K. Smith. Their goal was to propose a populist alternative to the New Deal reforms made by Roosevelt, as well as to help draw democratic voters away from Roosevelt so a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> be voted into office. This short-lived party broke up following the re-election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936.|$|R

Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other? Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did it. The proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one.

5000|$|Heffelfinger {{resigned}} on February 28, 2006, {{for personal}} reasons, {{and he was}} replaced by Rachel Paulose. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that it was unusual that [...] "the former U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Thomas Heffelfinger, was not invited" [...] to Paulose's swearing-in ceremony. Paulose's spokesperson, Jeanne Cooney, said, [...] "It was a public event. Anybody who wanted to go could have gone."

Brickhouse (1919-1925) had anyone served longer {{than four years}} as mayor of Little Rock. Wassell ignored Remmel, for he viewed the Republican nominee as too weak to warrant the reactivation of the precinct organization from the summer Democratic primary. Wassell claimed incorrectly that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> not be elected in Little Rock because the party during Reconstruction had [...] "left such an awful stink they haven't been back in seventy years." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although Connecticut is {{considered}} a solid Democratic-voting state, McMahon and Simmons sought {{to capitalize on the}} anti-establishment and anti-Democratic tide that had become a factor in the 2010 campaign season. In particular, Scott Brown's win in Massachusetts was seen as a good omen for Republicans nationally, as it showed that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> win in a [...] "deep blue" [...] state. A key factor in Brown's win had been his demand for fiscal responsibility, which McMahon made her centerpiece issue, attacking Simmons for his voting record as U.S. Representative. In new mailings, she pointed to Simmons' D-rating from the National Taxpayers Union.|$|R

50|$|Hammond {{served as}} a state {{representative}} from 1959 to 1965 and as a state senator from 1967 to 1973. Hammond served in the 1st Alaska State Legislature as an independent, joining thirty-four Democrats and five Republicans in the forty-member House. At the time, Hammond believed that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> not be elected in that particular time and place, but {{that he could not}} envision running as a Democrat on account of his upbringing and background. He did serve as a Republican in subsequent legislatures, however. He was Senate President in his final two years in the legislature.|$|R
40|$|Generals Mercier and Boisdeffre.. {{made the}} fatal error of {{standing}} {{on the principle that}} Army justice was, like the Army itself, a thing apart, and that civilian conceptions of justice had no weight before a military tribunal [...] . From this it will be seen that in reality the question of Alfred Dreyfus 2 ̆ 7 s guilt or innocence is minor to the far wider question of the position of the Army in a democratic State. No <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> for a moment accept the claim that the principles of justice were not identical, whatever the tribunal and whatever the procedure...|$|R
50|$|During the {{election}} of 1908, there was a widespread feeling throughout the territory that a <b>Republican</b> <b>could</b> have better results achieving statehood in a Republican controlled Congress than had been achieved by Arizona Territory's Democratic delegate, Mark Smith. Cameron received his party's nomination for the position on August 22. Smith had accumulated a number of political enemies during his many years in office and spent time campaigning for William Jennings Bryant instead of working for his own re-election. During the general election, Cameron defeated Smith {{by a vote of}} 12,435 to 11,727 with all other candidates receiving 2,205 votes combined.|$|R
50|$|Governor David Paterson had {{announced}} in October 2008 {{that he was}} running for election in 2010, but backed out in February 2010. He was asked by President Obama to withdraw from the race out of fear that <b>Republicans</b> <b>could</b> win the seat from Paterson.|$|E
