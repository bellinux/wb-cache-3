While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped <b>Record</b> <b>Room</b> {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E

50|$|Sindh was {{annexed to}} British {{rule in the}} year 1843 and {{integrated}} with Bombay Presidency in 1847. Considering that proper preservation of all records regarding Indus Valley is necessary an accommodation was acquired within the compound of Government house (now Governor’s House) and a <b>record</b> <b>room</b> was established there during 1853. Commissioner in Sindh was the Chief Officer of province at that time therefore Commissioner Office was entrusted with the responsibility to collect all important records. The records since 1820 onward were preserved at <b>record</b> <b>room.</b> The Commissioner's Record Branch was originally located in a bungalow situated within the cantonment limits. The record {{was moved to the}} house situated close to the government house in the same compound. In 1885, the Commissioner desired that the records of Survey Record Office Hyderabad be shifted to Karachi, owing to insecurity and unsuitability. The new accommodation was constructed in 1903, within the compound of commissioner’s office. In 1904, Superintendent Land Records and Agriculture moved their office to Karachi but after one year’s experience same was transferred back to Hyderabad, whole new arrangement was retained for <b>Record</b> <b>room</b> and Library of Commissioners Office. In 1923 the <b>Record</b> <b>Room</b> was extended as required, thus in next 6 years all the records were shifted from main building of the Office. The next years saw some more extensions, but after the separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency in 1937, the Commissioners' Office ceased to be the prime office of the Province, and much of the attention previously given to the records was now available no more. This was followed by the emergence of Pakistan as an independent state including Sindh as its province.|$|E

40|$|<b>Recording</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{generally}} required very small acoustic echoes and noiseness from exterior spaces. However, human beings recognize what they utter partly through acoustic echoes when they speak. In {{order to examine}} the feasibility of {{the achievement of the}} two opposite elements in a <b>recording</b> <b>room,</b> small acoustic echoes for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, this article set up a simplified anechoic room up to a room in Architectural Acoustic Lab. and assessed its performance. The reverberation time and the distance decay loss of sound pressure level were used as the evaluation indicators. The result showed that the reverberation time was longer than that of anechoic room, so that the speaker can utter more naturally in the <b>recording</b> <b>room.</b> However, the reverberation time was also short enough for blocking the influence of echoes. The effect of distance decay loss of the sound pressure level on the recordings was ignorable when the microphone was placed within 1. 0 meter long from the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s mouth. These results suggest that a <b>recording</b> <b>room</b> with the 2 opposite elements, small acoustic echoes for accurate recordings and moderate echoes for natural utterances, is realistic...|$|R
