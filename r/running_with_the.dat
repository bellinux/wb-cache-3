5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to protect it from development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000 ceremony, a dove {{image was}} {{projected}} on an enormous white cloth {{held by the}} athletes on the stadium floor. In 2004, an LED screen was used. In 2006, acrobats formed {{the shape of a}} dove. The 2008 ceremony had fireworks representing doves. In 2010, dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The 2012 ceremony had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the 2014 ceremony several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the 2016 ceremony , children with dove shaped kites were seen <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first Olympic Laurel winner, Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds her tail to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E

5|$|The first {{train to}} use the new line was pulled by the Victoria. It left Manchester at 8:00am, and arrived in Bolton 26minutes 30seconds later. The second train was pulled by the Fairfield. The trains {{originally}} ran on the right hand set of rails, an unusual practice in England, however the railway later changed to left-hand <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> connection of the MB at Clifton. Ten trains ran in each direction per weekday, and two on Sundays. The journey from Salford to Bolton took about 35minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{third part}} of {{qualifying}} determined pole position {{and only the}} two Mercedes drivers set two timed laps. After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers in his first run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second row on the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final positions determined very early on and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E

5|$|Liddell {{entered the}} youth team on {{his arrival in}} 1938. Before he {{established}} himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer Albert Shelley advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against Blackburn Rovers threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball. Doctors informed him {{of the extent of}} tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety about his future. He remained in Blackburn for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery. The Second World War precluded an official debut for Liddell, as the Football Association suspended competitive football from the abandoned 1939–1940 season and instituted a regional system in its place. Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI. Liddell was capped eight times for Scotland during the war, scoring on his debut in a 5–4 win over England in 1942.|$|E

25|$|Distinctive {{features}} {{common to}} both rugby codes include the oval ball and {{throwing the ball}} forward is not allowed, so that players can gain ground only by <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball or by kicking it. As the sport of rugby league moved further away from its union counterpart, rule changes were implemented {{with the aim of}} making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Florance {{appeared}} as May Swaisey—an elderly farm owner {{and friend of}} protagonist Max—in George Miller's hugely successful dystopian action film Mad Max.

25|$|During general play, players may {{position}} themselves {{anywhere on the}} field and use any part of their bodies to move the ball. The primary methods are kicking, handballing and <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball. There are rules on how the ball can be handled: for example, players <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball must intermittently bounce or touch it on the ground. Throwing the ball is not allowed and players must not get caught holding the ball. A distinctive feature of the game is the mark, where players anywhere on the field who catch a ball from a kick (with specific conditions) are awarded possession. Possession of the ball is in dispute at all times except when a free kick or mark is paid. Players can tackle using their hands or use their whole body to obstruct opponents. Dangerous physical contact (such as pushing an opponent in the back), interference when marking and deliberately slowing the play are discouraged with free kicks, distance penalties or suspension for a certain number of matches, depending on the seriousness of the infringement. The game features frequent physical contests, spectacular marking, fast movement of both players and the ball and high scoring.|$|E
25|$|Moscoe {{asked the}} Law Society of Upper Canada to {{intervene}} in his 1982 re-election campaign, alleging that rival candidate Sydney Moscoe was <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deliberate intent of confusing voters. He informed the media that the ten nominees who signed Sydney Moscoe's papers also signed those of Eleanor Rosen, a more serious challenger associated with the Progressive Conservatives. A Supreme Court of Ontario judge ruled that both Moscoes were legitimate candidates. Moscoe was re-elected, although by a reduced margin.|$|E

25|$|When Hidde Halbertsma died, in January 1809, and was {{followed}} in death {{by his wife}} Ruerdtsje Binnerts in December of that same year, the Brothers Halbertsma became orphans at a young age. Justus, the eldest brother, was in Amsterdam at that time, studying to become a minister, while Eeltsje, the youngest, was boarding in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden, where he attended the Latin school. In consequence, it fell to Tsjalling to keep their father's bakery <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of their father's baker's mates, until the third brother, Binnert, {{was old enough to}} take over the business.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photographs}} of Grace {{in later life}} reveal that he was by then corpulent, he was a fit man in his younger days, as his feats in 1866 confirm. He was a fine athlete and an example of his physical fitness was his 440 yards hurdles victory in the National and Olympian Association meeting at Crystal Palace {{the day after the}} long innings at The Oval for All-England against Surrey. At his peak, he was 6ft2in (1.88m) tall and usually weighed about 12st (76kg). A non-smoker, he kept himself in condition all year round by shooting, hunting or <b>running</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> beagles as soon as the cricket season was over.|$|E
25|$|The system {{consists}} of a mix of on-street running, reserved right-of-way and former railway alignment. The Middlewood and Malin Bridge lines run mainly on the street up to the City Centre; the Meadowhall line runs totally on reserved track – from Attercliffe to Meadowhall it runs on former railway line alongside a freight line to Tinsley Yard and the main line at Rotherham Central. The inner part of the Halfway and Herdings Park lines consist of on-street <b>running,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of the railway station and the viaduct at Granville Road. The Herdings line then runs on reserved track, and the Halfway line crosses the county border into Derbyshire and out again on reserved lines in the countryside. This line also serves Crystal Peaks Shopping Centre.|$|E
