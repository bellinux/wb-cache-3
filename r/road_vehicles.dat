5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E
5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A Bond Graph {{model of}} a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) powertrain test cell is proposed. The test cell consists of a motor/generator coupled to a HEV powertrain and powered by a bidirectional power converter. Programmable loading conditions, including positive and negative resistive and inertial loads of any magnitude are modeled, avoiding the use of mechanical inertial loads involved in conventional test cells. The dynamics and control equations of the test cell are derived directly from the Bond Graph models. The modeling and simulation results {{of the dynamics of}} the test cell are validated through experiments carried out on a scaled-down system.

The general aspects of <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> suspension dynamics and design are discussed, followed by descriptions of road-roughness excitations with a particular emphasis on road potholes. Passive suspension system designs and their effects on <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> dynamics and stability are presented in terms of in-plane and full-vehicle arrangements. Controlled suspensions are also reviewed and discussed. The paper concludes with some potential research topics, in particular those associated with the development of hybrid and electric vehicles...|$|R
