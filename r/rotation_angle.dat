30|$|The wall {{positions}} {{standing for}} the maximum ηt values are quite unexpected since they correspond to almost symmetrical arrangements.

It is believed that floor <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> θ reflect the torsional behavior of the structures more realistically.

We show theoretically and experimentally that by selecting a set of <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> properly, the resulted perceptual encryption system will be operating without affecting the coding efficiency, but with a higher encrypting capability.

Using Ampere's law, the toroidal plasma current can be determined as well.|$|R
30|$|In this experiment, <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> {{were the}} {{outcomes}} of both motion capture systems. However, other types (e.g., joint angles) of motion data—which can efficiently characterize human postures—can be obtained from motion capture systems and used as a feature for motion analysis. Taking into account that the selection of discriminating features significantly affects the classification performances (Mangai et al. 2010), we compared three data types in our previous study: <b>rotation</b> <b>angles,</b> joint angles (i.e., horizontal and vertical joint angles between a body part and x-y and x-z planes in a global coordinate system), and position vectors (i.e., normalized vectors of body parts) (Han, Lee, and Peña-Mora: Comparative study of motion features for similarity-based modeling and classification of unsafe actions in construction, submitted). The result reveals that, in the experiment, <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> outperformed the other two data types in applying the motion detection framework, which is also adopted in this paper. In this respect, 3 D <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> used as inputs for motion analysis are compared to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} Kinect and its impact on action recognition.|$|R
2500|$|Likewise, {{algorithms}} using Householder and Givens matrices typically use specialized {{methods of}} multiplication and storage. For example, a Givens rotation affects only {{two rows of}} a matrix it multiplies, changing a full multiplication of order [...] to a much more efficient order [...] When uses of these reflections and rotations introduce zeros in a matrix, the space vacated is enough to store sufficient data to reproduce the transform, {{and to do so}} robustly. (Following , we do not store a <b>rotation</b> <b>angle,</b> which is both expensive and badly behaved.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Their main {{advantage}} over other orientation descriptions {{is that they}} are directly measurable from a gimbal mounted in a vehicle. As gyroscopes keep their rotation axis constant, angles measured in a gyro frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame. Therefore, gyros are used to know the actual orientation of moving spacecraft, and Euler angles are directly measurable. Intrinsic <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> cannot be read from a single gimbal, so there has to be more than one gimbal in a spacecraft. Normally {{there are at least three}} for redundancy.

2500|$|Residues in α-helices {{typically}} adopt backbone (φ,nbsp&ψ) dihedral angles around (−60°,nbsp&−45°), {{as shown}} in the image at right. In more general terms, they adopt dihedral angles such that the ψ dihedral angle of one residue and the φ dihedral angle of the next residue sum to roughly −105°. As a consequence, α-helical dihedral angles, in general, fall on a diagonal stripe on the Ramachandran diagram (of slope −1), ranging from (−90°,nbsp&−15°) to (−35°,nbsp&−70°). For comparison, the sum of the dihedral angles for a 310 helix is roughly −75°, whereas that for the π-helix is roughly −130°. The general formula for the <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> Ω per residue of any polypeptide helix with trans isomers is given by the equation ...|$|E

40|$|The small <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> are {{typically}} {{involved in the}} traditional geodetic datum transformation, for which one can iteratively solve for its linearized model with ignoring its second-smaller terms. However, the big <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> are introduced to transform the outcomes from the advanced space surveying techniques. For this transformation model with big <b>rotation</b> <b>angles,</b> all elements of rotation matrix are usually parameterized as unknown parameters and then solved with the constrained adjustment theory by using the orthogonal condition of rotation matrix. With three-dimensional datum transformation with big <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> as example, this paper derives the analytical close-form solutions by formularizing the coordinates of multi-points as a matrix and using the orthogonal condition of rotation matrix. Expanding the transformation model with introducing the errors to common points of both datum, we derive out its analytical solutions as well. The results of simulation computations show that the presented three-dimensional datum transformation can realize the comparable transformation result while the new method can outcome the complicated and time-consuming iterations, therefore improving the computation efficiency...|$|R
2500|$|... n-fold helical symmetry: If the {{requirement}} that every {{cross section of the}} helical object be identical is relaxed, additional lesser helical symmetries become possible. For example, the cross section of the helical object may change, but still repeats itself in a regular fashion along the axis of the helical object. Consequently, objects of this type will exhibit a symmetry after a rotation by some fixed angleθ and a translation by some fixed distance, but will not in general be invariant for any <b>rotation</b> <b>angle.</b> If the angle (rotation) at which the symmetry occurs divides evenly into a full circle (360°), the result is the helical equivalent of a regular polygon. This case is called n-fold helical symmetry, where n=360°; for example, a double helix. This concept can be further generalized to include cases where [...] is a multiple of 360° – that is, the cycle does eventually repeat, but only after more than one full rotation of the helical object.|$|E
