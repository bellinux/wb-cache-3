40|$|This paper {{provides}} an in depth analysis of investors’ reluctance to crystallise losses and propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains,</b> a behavioural bias dubbed the disposition effect. We examine a comprehensive data set comprised of trading records for individual and institutional investors within the Finnish Stock Market over an extensive ten year period. Consistent with previous studies, {{we find that}} the disposition effect exists for not only individuals, but also for institutions. We conclude that despite significantly attenuating, ‘professionalism’ (i. e. investor sophistication) is unable to provide total immunity from the disposition bias. Moreover, this study confirms the existence of an apparent asymmetric relationship between trading experience and the disposition effect. Both individuals and institutions exhibit learning effects over time, with the accumulation of trading experience inversely related to the bias. However, while investors are capable of completely eliminating their tendency to ride losses, we found that no amount of trading experience is capable of eradicating an investor’s propensity to <b>realise</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R

These analytical models, which are based on the Gaussian distribution function, are applied to (i) develop realistic three-dimensional electromagnetic models of bond wire antennas and study their radiation characteristics and (ii) study the impact of process tolerances of bond wire parameters on the performance of the antennas. For these studies, a 42 GHz half-loop bond wire antenna is considered as an example. It is designed, fabricated and measured. Our results reveal that dbp has the most significant impact on the antenna performance. For example, - 10 % fluctuations in dbp causes similar to 2. 5 GHz shift in the resonance frequency and 24 % reduction in the maximum <b>realised</b> <b>gain.</b> Since this may completely detune the antenna, it is recommended that fluctuations in d(bp) should be kept below 10 % during the manufacturing process.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel design of an egg curve based wide-slot antenna for various wideband applications. The proposed printed antenna {{consists of an}} egg curved slot with a similar tuning stub. The egg curve is obtained by introducing an egg shaping parameter into standard elliptic curve equation. The effect on the impedance bandwidth through the variations in antenna design parameters has been investigated and analysed in detail. To validate the theoretical design, various egg curved slot antennas were designed, fabricated and measured. Good agreement between the simulated results and the measured ones is observed. An empirical formula is also proposed to approximately determine the frequency corresponding to the lower edge of − 10 dB operating bandwidth. The results demonstrate that the proposed egg curved slot antenna (ECSA) can obtain a measured bandwidth (BW) of 164. 46 % (1. 95 – 20. 0 GHz) for |S 11 | ≤ − 10 dB. A stable <b>realised</b> <b>gain</b> of about 4. 1 – 5. 1 dBi with consistent radiation patterns are measured over more than the entire ultrawideband (UWB) bandwidth (3. 1 – 10. 6 GHz) {{which makes it a}} suitable candidate for wideband and UWB wireless system applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to have an understanding of the population genetics and validity of the pertinent underlying assumptions of a species in order to design an effective breeding strategy. In a South African breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens, various scenarios investigating a range of assumptions were developed and used to predict genetic gain in the F 2. These were compared with realised gains achieved in a series of genetic gain trials. In the two scenarios using firstly, actual flowering for family (provenance) and, secondly, estimated flowering after 30 % roguing of poor families, a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33 resulted in predictions closest to <b>realised</b> <b>gain,</b> on average. The statistical information suggested that outcrossing in the seed orchards was[80 %. Indications were that the effects were additive, and that very little or no heterosis had occurred, due to the still significant provenance effects and the lack of provenance rank changes in the F 2. The custom of assuming a degree of inbreeding (and using a coefficient of relationship of 0. 33) and of including provenance effects in the models, on average resulted in genetic gain predictions which were very similar to the realised genetic gains in this population of E. nitens.

40|$|Clonal forestry, the {{establishment}} of plantations using tested clones, is highly sought after by the forestry industry in New Zealand and worldwide. Clonal testing is a vital element in the process leading to clonal forestry. Two clonal trials established in 1986 and 1987 by the Forest Research Institute with juvenile ortet material have been analysed in this study. The mating design in the 1986 clones-in-family trial was single-pair crossing with amplification of the clones by fascicle cuttings. It was replicated over two sites, and the trait analysed was diameter at 1. 40 m height at ages 4, 7, and 10 years. The estimation of additive, non-additive and genetic variances showed {{a high proportion of}} non-additive variance compared with the additive variance at one of the sites, whereas the proportion was less important at the other site. The high non-additive component of variance can be due to important dominance or epistasis, or to C-effects confounded with the non-additive variance. This trend was similar for all three ages. Realised genetic gains were obtained from selection of clones at age 10 years for clonal deployment and breeding. For clonal deployment, realised gains were high at both sites (13 % and 16 %). The gains were similar at both sites provided selection was based on performance values at the site, and not on indirect selection on performance of clones at the other site. Realised gains for selection at age 10 based on the performance of clones on combined sites (10 % and 13 %) were less than the maximum gain obtained at each individual site. Gains based on information from both sites (10 % and 12 % at respective sites) were more stable than those selections at any one site. For breeding, the level of gain was significantly inferior than for clonal deployment (4 % and 8 %), especially when the number of clones per family was restricted to one (2 % and 4 %). <b>Realised</b> <b>gain</b> on combined-site selection yielded less gain than direct selection at the optimum site for selection (1 % and 2 %). The presence of genotype x environment interaction emphasised the need to test clones in several sites if stability of performance is desired. It is possible to obtain gain from selections made at an early age, but selections made for breeding at the age of final assessment yielded greater expected total gain and gain per unit time. The mating design in the 1987 clones-in-family trial was a 3 x 3 disconnected factorial. The trial was established on a single site and the trait analysed was percentage of Dothistroma needle infection at ages 3, 4 and 7 years. The mating design allowed estimation of additive, dominance and epistasis variances, which were overestimated for the lack of replication over sites. In this trial measured for Dothistroma resistance, the additive variance was the major component of the genetic variance at both ages. The evolution of components of genetic variance was confounded with the level of Dothistroma infection. The analysis of these trials indicated the need to improve the mating and field designs to improve the accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters, highlights the importance of annual or biennual measurements to determine trends of those parameters over time, and showed the difference in gains obtained from selection for breeding and clonal deployment for early selection and selection at the age of final assessment. Accuracy in the estimation of genetic parameters can be achieved using factorial mating designs together with serial propagation to reduce the incidence of C effects, and with replication over several sites. Further considerations have to be made to find the most appropriate field and statistical design, but alpha designs are a possibility to explore. Investment in a series of carefully planned clonal trials is fundamental to the future of clonal forestry in radiata pine...|$|E

MethodsWe used stochastic simulation to estimate long-term rates of genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by breeding schemes that applied OCS without and with restrictions imposed during optimisation, where long-term refers to generations 23 to 25 (approximately). Six restrictions were imposed. Five of these removed solutions from the solution space. The sixth removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. We also simulated a conventional breeding scheme with truncation selection as a reference point. Generations overlapped, selection was for a single trait, and the trait was observed for all selection candidates prior to selection. ResultsOCS with restrictions realised 67 to 99 % of the additional <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions, where additional gain was {{the difference in the}} long-term rates of genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions and our reference point with truncation selection. The only exceptions were those restrictions that removed all solutions near the optimum solution from the solution space and the restriction that removed records of selection decisions made at earlier selection times. Imposing these restrictions realised only − 12 to 46 % of the additional gain. ConclusionsMost of the long-term genetic <b>gain</b> <b>realised</b> by OCS without restrictions can be realised by OCS with restrictions imposed during optimisation, provided the restrictions do not remove all solutions near the optimum from the solution space and do not remove records of earlier selection decisions. In breeding schemes where OCS cannot be applied optimally because of biological and logistical restrictions, OCS with restrictions provides a useful alternative. Not only does it realise most of the long-term genetic gain, OCS with restrictions enables OCS to be tailored to individual breeding schemes...|$|R

Planting the superior stand seedlot (CAN 101) could obtain moderate gain (7. 0 % in volume/tree and 3. 5 % in volume/ha at age 15). Growth improvement for the seedlot (UNROG) collected from a seedling seed orchard (FRA_SSO) established using phenotypically selected plus trees was negligible but genetic roguing improved the FRA_SSO seedlot’s growth, resulting in 3. 3 and 2. 1 % increase in 15 -yr volume per tree and per hectare, respectively. The highest gain was observed by deploying the elite half-sib family (01 - 15), which resulted in a gain of 27. 6 % in 15 -yr volume/ha. Three improved seedlots were included in the white spruce realised-gain test. The seedlot (OVSSO) collected from a provenance seedling seed orchard had 9. 2 % more volume/ha at age 15 years. Much higher gains were observed in the seedlots collected from an unrogued clonal seed orchard (DNR_CSO). Mixed cone collections from the DNR_CSO achieved 25. 6 % more volume/ha at age 15 than the unimproved seedlot.
