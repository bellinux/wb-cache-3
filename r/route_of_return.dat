40|$|Water falling {{upon the}} land as {{precipitation}} is the prime source of streamflow. The pattern in which this precipitation returns to its source in oceans and lakes is dependent upon many inter-related factors affecting both the precipitation and the physical <b>route</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> For example, precipitation on a completely imper-vious basin of barren rock would result in sudden runoff and frequent flooding, followed by a rapid decline in the streamflow, {{with little or no}} flow in {{a matter of a few}} days or even a few hours. On the other hand, a geographically similar basin underlain by thick permeable material would permit the infiltration of much of the precipitation to the ground water reservoir. Immediate surface runoff would be limited only to that portion of precipitation in excess of the infiltration capacity of the basin, and streams in the basin might show relatively small rises followed by lengthy periods in which the flow was maintained by seepage from the infiltrated ground water. The effect of the geology of a basin is thus reflected in its regimen of streamflow. This paper describes the relationship between the geology and streamflow in the Upper Little Miami Basin...|$|E

50|$|During {{actions on}} 15 February 1809, Reding's left wing {{was cut off}} from {{reinforcement}} by a French attack. Reding decided to retrieve this cut-off army, instead of counter striking at Souham. Planning {{to meet up with}} his northern units, Reding left Tarragona with only 2,000 men and most of his cavalry. On his way, he successfully met with units standing guard over the pass to Santa Cristina and another unit at Santas Cruces. Having sufficient strength, he continued to the town of Santa Coloma, whereupon he met with his previously cut-off left wing. With the combined left wing and the forces he took with him, Reding then had a total of almost 20,000 troops at his disposal. Deciding to defend Tarragona, he dispatched 4-5,000 of his men to watch Igualada and pressed home with his remaining men. St. Cyr, aware of Reding's movements, moved to block the two direct <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to Tarragona. Reding, aware that Souham had moved and taken position in the town of Valls, still decided to take the route. Committing his forces to a march at night, Reding got his army to a bridge only two miles out of the town before daybreak.|$|R

40|$|Particle {{ingestion}} by Acanthamoeba is rapid. Within 40 s bound particles can {{be surrounded}} by pseudopods, brought into the cytoplasm, and released as phagosomes into the cytoplasmic stream. In electron micrographs the phagosome appears as a flasklike invagination of the surface. Separation from the surface occurs by fragmentation of the attenuated "neck+ of the invagination. The separated phagosome membrane has a three- to fourfold greater density of intramembrane particles than the plasma membrane from which it derives. This change is evident within 15 min of ingestion and is detectable while the membrane is still tightly apposed to the particle. There is no direct evidence for the mechanism of this increase; no increase in particle density {{was seen in the}} membrane at an early stage in the forming phagosomes still connected to the surface. These morphological observations are consistent with chemical analyses, to be reported in a separate communication, that show that the phagosome membrane has a higher protein to phospholipid ratio and a higher glycosphingolipid content than the plasma membrane. Enlarged phagosomes (presumptive phagolysosomes) show multiple small vesiculations of characteristic morphology. The small vesicles are postulated to be the major <b>route</b> <b>of</b> membrane <b>return</b> to the cell surface...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} famous legends is about Shishman's final battle. The Ottomans camped at Kostenets, near the origins of the Maritsa river, while the Bulgarians were near Samokov, on a hill. After a fierce battle, Ivan Shishman was wounded seven times and retreated to the fortress, where he died; on the {{battlefield}} seven springs appeared, one for each of the emperor's wounds. He is also said to have fought in the Balkan mountains at Shishkin grad ("Shishman's town"), between Sliven and Kazanlak, where he killed 10,000 janissaries in a huge battle. The 18th century Bulgarian enlightener Paisius of Hilendar wrote in his Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya that during the siege of Tarnovo Ivan Shishman managed to reach Sofia with his boyars. He hid his treasury in the Iskar gorge and fought against the Turks for seven years before dying in battle. Some versions suggest that Kokalyanski Urvich remained the last fortress to fall and before Shishman died he buried treasure under the castle and tried to escape by cutting a passage through the mountain. The repeating motif of the treasure is a sacral symbol of the Bulgarian statehood and the usual locations of the imperial jewellery are monasteries, lakes or hideouts under rivers. Being undiscovered by the invaders, the treasure symbolises the sovereignty and power of the Bulgarian Empire and its inevitable resurrection. There are also a number of parallels between the legends about Ivan Shishman and the hagiography of saints, especially John of Rila, including the almost identical <b>route</b> <b>of</b> the emperor, Tarnovo-Sofia-Samokov in Rila, and the <b>route</b> <b>of</b> the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the relics of Saint John of Rila to the Rila Monastery in 15th century – Tarnovo-Sofia-Rila, and also the motif of the immortal rulers who foresees the restoration of the country.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{forests are}} areas rich in {{biodiversity}} {{that contribute to}} the maintenance of environmental sustainability through the production of litter and nutrient cycling. Litter is a major <b>route</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>return</b> to the system plant – soil – plant and its determination to analyze the restructuring of anthropogenic forest environments. The knowledge of litterfall is critical to determine the potential for regeneration of an area through the intake and nutrient cycling. We quantified litter production in areas of white sand with vegetation in different stages of regeneration the National Park Sierra de Itabaiana, Sergipe State. In each of the areas of white sands open (ABA), white sands intermediary (ABI) and white sands closed (ABF) was installed 15 litter traps and litter fall was collected monthly from January to December 2011. The total contribution of litter on the White Sand Closed (2092 kg ha- 1) was more than double the contribution in Areia Branca Open (881 kg ha- 1) and White Sand Intermediate (687 kg ha- 1). The leaf fraction contributed the largest mass in all areas and periods, and was the one with greater seasonal variation related to variation in precipitation. Precipitation was one of the factors that determined the seasonality of litter deposition in natural vegetation of the National Park of Sierra de Itabaiana, Sergipe State. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNanoparticle-based drug {{delivery}} to ease anticancer therapy relies {{primarily on the}} enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR). The leaky vascular structure in tumors allows extravasation of nanoparticles, often termed passive targeting. Long term retention of nanoparticles is attributed {{to the lack of}} lymphatic drainage, and unidirectional extravasation has been implied. Fluorescent liposomes with a plasma half-life of 29 h were injected into tumor-bearing rats, and biodistribution in tumor, skin, paws and ears was monitored via in vivo fluorescence measurements. To calculate tissue accumulation, an algorithm was developed to subtract the blood signal from the total fluorescence recorded. Accumulation in tumor tissue was much higher than that in other tissues monitored, initially exhibiting very rapid accumulation followed by a long plateau phase with little change. Discontinuous plasmapheresis was established that was as effective as highly sophisticated clinical plasmapheresis. We observed no difference in the tumor tissue's accumulation when plasmapheresis was performed 22 h after liposome injection. In contrast, plasmapheresis led to a significant inhibition of further accumulation in other tissues. When the liposomes' blood concentration was rapidly lowered, we detected no drop in tumor fluorescence. Thus extravasation via EPR is most likely a <b>route</b> <b>of</b> no <b>return.</b> These data support the emerging view of a more dynamic model of EPR, where gaps or entire vessels may open and close over time, or accumulated liposomes become entangled within the pores, hampering further accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical model {{describing}} energetic efficiency (defined as a {{ratio of}} energy obtained {{in the form of}} biofuel to the sum of energy inputs necessary to facilitate production) of agricultural subsystem as a function of technological parameters was developed. Production technology is characterized by parameters of machinery, topological characteristics of the plantation as well as transportation routes inside and outside of plantation. The relationship between the energetic efficiency of agricultural and industrial subsystems is also derived. Due to the assumed large area of the individual field, the operations last for several days increasing inter-fields <b>routes</b> because <b>of</b> several <b>returns.</b> The total distance driven outside of the fields is, however, small as compared to the distance driven inside of the fields. This results in small energy consumption during inter-fields transport that, however, causes a substantial decrease of the energetic effectiveness of the whole system...|$|R
