40|$|We {{measured}} the energy expenditure weekly in patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for bile duct cancer or pancreatic tumors. Twelve patients (5 women and 7 men; mean age 70. 1 years) {{were enrolled in}} this study, and their <b>resting</b> energy expenditure levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. In these patients, a significant correlation was observed between the measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditures and the predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditures calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation. The <b>resting</b> energy expenditures measured before surgery were almost {{the same as the}} predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditures (measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure: 22. 4  ±  3. 9  kcal/kg/day vs predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure: 21. 7  ±  2. 0  kcal/kg/day). The measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure ratio, which reflects the stress factor, was 1. 02  ±  0. 10. After the pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, a significant increase in energy expenditure was observed, and the measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure was 25. 7  ±  3. 5  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 7 and 25. 4  ±  4. 9  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 14. The measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure ratio was 1. 16  ±  0. 14 on postoperative day 7, and 1. 16  ±  0. 18 on postoperative day 14 respectively. In conclusion, patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy showed a hyper-metabolic status as evaluated by their measured <b>resting</b> energy expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> energy expenditure ratio.

40|$|The Daphnia galeata {{population}} in Lake Biwa (Japan) had almost ceased producing <b>resting</b> eggs by the 1980 s. To examine whether D. galeata {{had lost the}} ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs, or if chemical contamination was inhibiting <b>resting</b> egg production, individuals collected in fall (November) and late winter (March), were reared in the laboratory. More than 50 % of these D. galeata individuals produced <b>resting</b> eggs irrespective of the month of collection, when reared with food supplied at a level lower than that available during the maternal generation. The results reflect that D. galeata in Lake Biwa have a high ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs when appropriate stimuli are provided. As chemical substances, such as endocrine disrupters, are known to inhibit <b>resting</b> egg production in Daphnia and these accumulate in lake sediments, we tested whether Daphnia individuals produce <b>resting</b> eggs when reared in sediment-conditioned lake water. In sediment-conditioned lake water, only a few Daphnia that were collected in March produced <b>resting</b> eggs, while 50 % of the individuals collected in November produced <b>resting</b> eggs. Thus, D. galeata collected from Lake Biwa are able to produce <b>resting</b> eggs, but genetic variation likely leads to variation in <b>resting</b> egg production in the presence of chemical contaminants. These results suggest that the recent decrease in the <b>resting</b> egg production of Daphnia populations in lake Biwa is mainly due to a decrease in the strength of the environmental queue that stimulates <b>resting</b> egg production rather than a genetic shift to strains that have a lower ability to produce <b>resting</b> eggs; yet, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} a chemical contamination plays a role in the decrease of <b>resting</b> egg production...|$|R

Twenty-one individuals used 338 different nocturnal <b>resting</b> sites on 672 occasions. Mean number of <b>resting</b> sites per individual was 16. 1, though <b>resting</b> sites used by each individual increased when sample size did. Mean re-use rate was 1. 99 nights/site.

In a sample of 379 adolescents (212 boys, 167 girls), <b>resting</b> RSA was assessed during a laboratory session, and adolescents reported on parental support, negative interaction with parents, empathic concern and externalizing behavior during a home visit. We found no support for high <b>resting</b> RSA predicting low externalizing behavior or high empathic concern. However, in line with our hypotheses, we did find several instances of RSA functioning as a moderator, although the interaction patterns varied. First, negative interaction with parents was a negative predictor of externalizing behavior for girls low in <b>resting</b> RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls with high RSA. Second, higher negative interaction with parents predicted lower empathic concern for boys high in <b>resting</b> RSA, whereas the association was reversed for boys with low <b>resting</b> RSA. Third, parental support was a positive predictor of empathic concern for girls high in <b>resting</b> RSA, whereas the association was non-significant for girls low in <b>resting</b> RSA.
