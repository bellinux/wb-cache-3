He was a regular and played so much that he suffered from <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injury</b> in his shoulders and arms. He occasionally stole money from his mother's purse and at one point attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Matusow was taught Texas hold 'em in 1989 by a rounder named Steve Samaroff.|$|E
5|$|Trauma, {{rather than}} {{avascular}} necrosis, {{is thought to}} cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma {{is thought to be}} the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injury</b> in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{currently}} available {{evidence on the}} epidemiology and management of occupational <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries</b> with particular reference to Hong Kong. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Medline, PubMed and Cochrane Library searches of local and internationally published English journals from 1990 to 2007 regarding <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries.</b> DATA EXTRACTION: All articles involving occupational <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries</b> in Hong Kong were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were 16 articles contributing data {{on the impact of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries</b> both in Hong Kong and around the world. There were seven articles dealing with the problem of computer station set-ups and methods for improving the workstation environments. CONCLUSION: Currently there were significant data on the impact of <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries</b> in Hong Kong. The data took the form of compensation claims, days away from work, and cost of medical consultations. Other articles described proper workplace adjustments to help prevent <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries.</b> However, there were no figures in the current literature showing the impact of these adjustments in reducing the incidence of <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries.</b> More research could help to delineate the relationship between different types of interventions and occupational <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injuries.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R

He continues his work there.

25|$|While {{teachers}} {{point out}} the vital importance of good posture both {{for the sake of}} the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injury,</b> advice as to what good posture is and how to achieve it differs in details. However all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity. Things which are almost universally recommended is keeping the left wrist straight (or very nearly so) to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner. This, like any other unwarranted tension, would limit freedom of motion, and increase the risk of injury.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of any}} {{keyboard}} {{may cause}} serious injury (that is, carpal tunnel syndrome or other <b>repetitive</b> <b>strain</b> <b>injury)</b> to hands, wrists, arms, neck or back. The risks of injuries can be reduced by taking frequent short breaks {{to get up and}} walk around a couple of times every hour. As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges. Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.|$|E
