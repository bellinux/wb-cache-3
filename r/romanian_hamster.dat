2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl may hunt {{at least}} 300 species of bird. In Europe, {{the most common}} avian prey species are the {{normally}} feral or domestic [...] rock pigeons (Columba livia), although the [...] common wood pigeon (Columba palumbus) can be locally even more significant. In the Netherlands, the common wood pigeon {{is the most important}} prey species, making up 37.3% by number and 38.3% by biomass. Yet another, smaller study of the Netherlands found the rock pigeon to be the primary prey species. In a dietary study from Luxembourg, the common wood pigeon was the most frequent prey species, making 19% of the remains by number. A study from Romania listed the rock pigeon was the second most frequently recorded prey behind only the <b>Romanian</b> <b>hamster</b> and the largest contributed of biomass. Unusually, in the Netherlands, birds were the primary food in both number (77.6%) and biomass (72%). Also, in Luxembourg, eagle-owls hunted birds in general were more regularly than mammals, as nearly 70% of prey remains there were avian. At least six other species of pigeon and dove have also been recorded as prey. However, perhaps the most significant contributor of prey at the family level is the corvids. The [...] carrion crow (Corvus corone) is the second most widely recorded avian prey species in Europe and, locally, good numbers are also taken of [...] hooded crow (Corvus cornix), [...] western jackdaws (Corvus monedula), [...] Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius), [...] common ravens (Corvus corax), [...] rooks (Corvus corone), two species each of magpie and chough and the [...] spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes), in rough descending order of reportage in the eagle-owl’s diet. In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, the carrion crow was the most frequently recorded bird among an exceptionally diverse recorded prey base including than 65 bird species there (although birds only comprised 27% of the prey numbers overall). Unlike smaller passerines, corvids roost in numbers in relatively open spots, which make them fairly vulnerable to a predator as stealthy and powerful as the eagle-owl. [...] More than 17 species of gamebirds have been recorded in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet but they are normally taken in small numbers. There are, however, exceptions. In one study conducted in lower Austria, the most frequently identified prey species was the [...] grey partridge (Perdix perdix), which is the most widely reported gamebird prey for eagle-owls in Europe. One study of a “primeval” forested region of Finland found various grouse species to be the most significant contributor of biomass, namely in descending order the [...] western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the [...] black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the [...] hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). In inland areas of Norway, the large forest grouse were also significant biomass contributors. The same forest grouse species were also found to be significant to diet along the Pechora River in Russia. Other gamebirds can be important secondary prey species in different parts of Europe: the [...] red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) in western Europe, the [...] rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and the [...] rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) in alpine highlands, the [...] ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) in eastern Europe and the [...] willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in the sub-Arctic zone. In Turkey, the most significant prey by number was the [...] chukar (Alectoris chukar), comprising 20.5% of remains. A Korean study in two habitat types (forest and field) found that ring-necked pheasants were the main prey species, making up an average of 19.33% by number and 34.81% by biomass.

50|$|The <b>Romanian</b> <b>hamster</b> is a nocturnal or crepuscular species. It lives solitarily in {{a complex}} burrow system.

They reach sexual maturity when 56-70 days old and breed through early April to August. The common hamster has a gestation of 15 days, gives birth to a litter of 1-12 and weans after three weeks of pregnancy. It communicates by squeaking or with ultra-sound. Both sexes flank mark by rubbing their glands against objects.|$|E

40|$|The first {{detailed}} feeding {{record of}} the Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) in Cheia Gorge, the Casimcea plateau, Romania is reported. The diet contained mammals (51. 41 %), birds (43. 66 %) and amphibians (4. 93 %). A total of 11 mammal species were recorded, comprising representatives of four orders (Insectivora, Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Carnivora). Rodents dominated the diet spectrum (42. 56 % of all consumed prey), with the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Hamster</b> (Mesocricetus newtoni) being the most frequent (22. 5 %), followed by the Sibling Vole (Microtus epiroticus) and the Mound-building Mice (Mus spicilegus). Mammals comprise 40. 1 % of the consumed biomass. From biomass point of view the most important species is the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Hamster</b> (16. 2 %),but the East-European Hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor) and the European Hare (Lepus europaeus) have an important share in the diet,too. The bird food is much more diverse; altogether 27 species were recorded, representing a number of eight orders. The birdcomponent of the diet {{is the most important}} in terms of biomass (59. 2 %). Besides the pigeons and doves (35. 4 %) as well as waterfowl(8. 10 %) the Galliformes (5. 4 %) and the songbirds (5. 1 %) are to be mentioned. The most important taxonomic group is theColumbiformes (18. 3 % of MNI), represented by only three species. The House Pigeon (Columba livia domestica) is the most used birdspecies (12. 7 % of MNI). Smaller mammals, other birds and amphibians made up {{a small portion of the}} diet in terms of biomass. The diet composition is compared to similar studies, highlighting the importance of the steppe habitat and prey species’ diversity for themaintenance of this owl population. The results suggest that the Eurasian Eagle Owl is an opportunistic feeder, capable to exploit also species well adapted to steppe environments...|$|E
