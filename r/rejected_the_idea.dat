5|$|The 1970s {{brought a}} number of changes to the household: the couple moved to a smaller {{apartment}} following Reggie's early retirement from the BBC and 1972 appointment as a lecturer at the New University of Ulster in Coleraine. The couple subsequently lived apart for long periods, as Manning <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of moving to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|As {{explained}} below, chess theorists {{in recent}} decades have continued to debate the size and nature of White's advantage, if any. Apart from Berliner, they have <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that White has a forced win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional paradigm that Black's objective should be to neutralize White's initiative and obtain equality.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} that religious unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, {{her aunt}} Margaret {{suggested that she}} should marry King James V of Scotland. Mary <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> because she had loved her husband and did not wish another marriage. In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E
50|$|On this basis, Khatami thus {{advances}} a view {{of subjectivity}} that <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of subjectivity as achieved through modern philosophy that indicates gaining access to some inner realm of subjective meaning. For him, subjectivity is an ongoing process, rather than something that is ever completed, so he also <b>rejects</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that there is any}} final determinacy to human subjectivity.|$|R

5|$|The {{military}} campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign {{were generally}} defensive in nature, as the Emperor <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of expansionist warfare. His most significant military contribution was {{the development of}} the Limes Germanicus, which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire. Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the Chatti, and across the Danube frontier against the Suebi, the Sarmatians, and the Dacians.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a workplace romance with her. She {{seems to be a}} bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that {{evolution}} is guided in any way, but {{the evolution of}} some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E

5|$|European club {{football}} competitions {{began in}} the mid-1950s. Though Manchester City were moderately successful domestically in this period, the club did not play in Europe. City were not invited {{to play in the}} Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup did not begin until 1960. When eight players from neighbours Manchester United lost their lives in the Munich air disaster when returning from a European Cup match in February 1958, UEFA wished for City to take United's place in the competition. City <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> out of hand.|$|E
5|$|Fraser chaired {{a summit}} of {{leaders of the}} Coalition parties on 2 November. The {{resulting}} communiqué urged the Coalition senators to continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from {{taking place in the}} four states with non-Labor premiers. After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election. Whitlam <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, {{he did not see}} much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> He had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of art for art's sake, and insisted that all great art must be didactic.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Aksel Winther, who {{is based}} on Vilhelm Leifer, {{is the one who}} gives Flammen and Citron orders to kill. Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the {{meetings}} were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The {{original}} idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that {{it would be difficult to}} get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that mental}} states {{must have a}} causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, <b>rejected</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued {{that they would have to}} have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
