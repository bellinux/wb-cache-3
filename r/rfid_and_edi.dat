40|$|In {{this article}} the authors examine the IOS {{technologies}} <b>RFID</b> <b>and</b> <b>EDI.</b> RFID {{is a new}} technology with great potential for creating interorganizational networks such as decreasing cost or better access to information. This potential {{is the reason why}} many companies today must {{decide whether or not to}} adopt RFID in there supply chain. Using RFID has far-reaching consequences for companies, such as the intertwining of existing relationships between companies or the reorganisation of existing business processes. New technologies do not just provide new opportunities, they also create new problems. This article will assess possible problems surrounding the implementation of RFID. This analysis should help companies prepare for any difficulties they may encounter. To do this, the authors show how lessons learned from problem-solving in the area of EDI can be applied to RFID. Therefore this article takes a closer look at standardisation, integration into existing IT-systems and the need for trust in collaborative supply chains. Besides examining potential problems, the authors also give an overview of the possible costs and benefits of RFID. Hence the authors compare several surveys about the costs and benefits of EDI, in order to define possible costs and benefits of RFID. This article also includes a description of a cost benefit-sharing model for a collaborative supply chain...|$|E

Two {{of the most popular}} programs — <b>EDI</b> <b>and</b> outsourcing — have profound impact on people in logistics.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (<b>RFID)</b> <b>and</b> Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are two {{important}} wireless technologies that have {{wide variety of}} applications and provide limitless future potentials.

This paper first presents a brief introduction on <b>RFID,</b> <b>and</b> then investigates recent research works, new products/patents and applications that integrate RFID with sensor networks.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1960 s, the Beer Distribution Game (BDG) {{has been used}} to {{characterize}} the various instabilities that arise in multi-stage supply chains. Although an appreciable body of research exists for the BDG and its inherent nonlinear instabilities, there are three apparent technical voids in literature that have been addressed in this dissertation, including: characterizing the difference between discrete- and continuous-valued BDG implementations, characterizing various aspects of the transient behavior of the BDG, and characterizing the impact of both heterogeneously- and homogeneously-implemented Electronic Data Interchange (<b>EDI)</b> <b>and</b> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies on the nonlinear dynamics of the BDG. This dissertation utilizes numerical simulations, previously-validated data sifting methods, and an ordering heuristic known to mimic human decision making behavior to examine each topic. A high-throughput computing approach to the BDG allowed for, what is believed to be, the most computationally intensive investigation of the BDG to date. ^ This dissertation seeks to fill the first apparent void by examining the nonlinear behavior of four distinct BDG models: a continuous-variable implementation and three discrete implementations, incorporating conventional, nearest-integer rounding, floor functions, and ceiling functions, respectively. Specifically, numerical simulations and previous-validated data sifting methods are utilized to detail the cost and system response characteristics associated with each game implementation. The acquired results are subsequently compared to one another and used to derive refined ordering policies, which have distinct applicability to the operation of low volume supply chains of indivisible products. The in-depth numerical investigation is followed by a set of agent based simulations that utilize a reinforcement learning technique to learn optimal rounding methods. These rounding methods consist of various combinations of the aforementioned rounding functions and easily defined agent system states, which are based on ordering characteristics and operating costs. These simulations illustrate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning techniques in learning optimal behaviors for a highly nonlinear, often aperiodic, multi-stage supply chain model. ^ This dissertation seeks to address the second apparent void by examining the transient performance metrics (e. g. settling time, average settling time cost, total setting time cost, and number of stock outages) associated with the prototypical supply chain model – the BDG. Managerial insights, which both support and contradict common practice, were derived from the data distributions created through extensive simulations. ^ Process automation and information sharing are becoming increasingly important to the successful operation of supply chains. While previous works have investigated the effects of <b>RFID,</b> <b>EDI,</b> <b>and</b> other transparency technologies on multi-stage supply chain models, the studies completed to date have not fully examined the implications of these technologies on the dynamic behavior of the BDG. This is especially true for supply chains which feature heterogeneously-implemented transparency technologies. This dissertation seeks to fill this apparent technical void, by characterizing the impact of both heterogeneously- <b>and</b> homogeneously-implemented <b>EDI</b> <b>and</b> <b>RFID</b> technologies on the nonlinear dynamics of the BDG. To achieve this, the high-throughput numerical simulations are utilized to characterize the effects of <b>EDI</b> <b>and</b> <b>RFID</b> on the aforementioned transient performance metrics to form a series of succinct conclusions on the relative utility of these technologies. ...|$|R

The results are presented in Table  8 showing that a majority (more than 50  %) of the SME sub-group uses the eLogistics applications in the following functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems <b>and</b> <b>EDI.</b> But the Non-SME sub-group had more usage of eLogistics applications: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems <b>and</b> <b>EDI.</b> The TLSP even have a higher (than the Non-SME group) usage: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, Route Guidance Systems- GPS, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems <b>and</b> <b>EDI</b> as well. The Terminal Operators have usage of eLogistics system in the following six functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Transport Statistics and Assessment Systems <b>and</b> <b>EDI.</b> The Shippers have a limited usage of eLogistics applications: only in Order Management Systems and Invoicing. The authors find that the similarity among the usage of eLogistics applications of the Non-SME, the TLSP and the Terminal Operator groups is possibly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the TLSP and Terminal Operator participants belong to Non-SME group. And these groups have higher technical and financial capacity and skills to use the eLogistics applications. On the other hand the lower usage of eLogistics applications by the SME (and the Shipper) sub-group is possibly due the fact that they lack technical and final capacity and skills.|$|R
