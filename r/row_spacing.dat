50|$|<b>Row</b> <b>spacing</b> is {{the second}} factor that determines canopy closure and yield components. <b>Row</b> <b>spacing</b> can either refer to the space between plants in the same row or the {{distance}} between two rows. <b>Row</b> <b>spacing</b> determines the degree of plant to plant competition. Rows planted closer together in a population will decrease the space between plants. Closer row widths increase plant to plant competition for nutrients and water but also increase sunlight use efficiency. According to former Iowa State University Soybean Extension Specialist Palle Pedersen, current recommendations are to plant rows that are less than 30” apart. This increases light interception and decreases weed competition.|$|E

50|$|Disease control {{options for}} ASR are limited. Rust descends in clouds of spores across the countryside. Cultural {{practices}} such as <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> and crop rotations have little effect. Resistant cultivars do not exist.

Thus, remedial control measures—using fungicides as protective sprays—are the only effective disease control method.|$|E
5000|$|Seating arrangement: Seating {{arrangements}} in an auditorium seating layout (or assembly space) will either {{be identified as}} “multiple-aisle” or “continental.” These terms are commonly found in design standards manuals, building codes, and similar architectural reference documents. Each size is unique, with specific guidelines governing row size, <b>row</b> <b>spacing,</b> and exit ways. Basically, a multiple-aisle arrangement will have a maximum of 14-16 chairs per row with access to an aisle-way at both ends. In a continental arrangement, all seats are located in a central section. Here the maximum quantity of chairs per row can greatly exceed the limits established in a multiple-aisle arrangement. In order {{to compensate for the}} greater length of rows allowed, building codes will require wider <b>row</b> <b>spacing,</b> wider aisles, and strategically located exit doors. Although it would seem like more space is called for, a continental seating plan is often not any less efficient than a multiple-aisle arrangement. In fact, if it’s carefully planned, a continental arrangement can frequently accommodate more seating within the same space.|$|E

5000|$|Direct sowing: The seedbed {{should have}} a loose and fine structure, but should be reconsolidated using a packer roller imminently prior to sowing. Sowing time can be either in autumn or in spring. Seed density should be 6 kg/ha with <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> of 30 cm and 42-50 cm in autumn and spring, respectively. The {{disadvantage}} of direct sowing is that it usually leads to incomplete plant coverage. This drawback can be mitigated by covering the seedbed with a transparent perforated foil {{in order to improve}} seed germination. Further, weed control can be problematic as the stinging nettle has a slow seedling development time.|$|E
5000|$|Growing seedlings: For this {{technique}} pre-germinated seeds are sown between mid-/end-February and beginning of April and grown in nurseries. Seedlings are grown in tuffs with 3-5 plants / tuff and a seed density of 1.2-1.6 kg / 1000 tuffs. A fastened germination {{is achieved by}} alternating high temperature during daytime (30 °C for 8 h) and lower temperature during nighttime (20 °C for 16 h). Before transplanting, the seedlings should be fertilized and acclimated to cold temperatures. Transplantation should start around Mid-April with <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> of 42 - 50 cm and plant spacing within rows of 25-30 cm.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the master}} {{computerized}} copy has been recreated, {{all of the}} information in the roll is retained, and anything done after this can be done with the accuracy of the original roll. When using the analogue version, all its timing errors are carried through to whatever is done with it. This is particularly true when making recut rolls, where imposing the punch-row spacing of the perforator over the (different) <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> of the original roll causes surprisingly obvious and audible errors. However, even analogue uses of the scan, such as operating instruments directly, benefits from the recreated master because of the way it removes timing errors from the basic scan, and in so doing allows the accuracy of the scanner itself to be calibrated.|$|E

50|$|The initial Warwick Energy {{proposal}} {{was for a}} 30 turbine wind farm 7 km southwest of Walney Island (Cumbria), with a generating capacity of up to 108MW; electrical power supply to the mainland was to be via a ~25 km long 132kV cable making groundfall near Heysham, with connection to the mainland electrical grid at an extension to an existing electricity substation south of Heysham nuclear power station. Turbines were expected to have ~50m radius blades, with a 75m hub height, and be situated in water {{at a depth of}} ~20m, with a ~32.5m sub-sea bed monopile foundation; the turbines were to be spaced approximately 500m apart in four rows aligned to face the prevailing southwestery winds, with a <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> of ~750m.|$|E
50|$|Cultural {{practices}} {{can also}} promote reduction of Alternaria dauci. They include practices that will lower {{the duration of}} leaf wetness and soil moisture. Planting on raised beds with wider <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce soil moisture, thereby limiting the spread of the disease. Symptoms tend to be more severe on carrots that are stressed or poorly fertilized. In order to avoid more severe symptoms, keep the plants free of injury, watered, and adequately fertilized. Although resistant varieties are not available, the susceptibility of the carrot differs by variety. The varieties least susceptible vary by state, and a list of varieties appropriate to a specific area can be found through the state's extension program. In the Midwest, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan have bred varieties including Atlantis, Beta III, and Chancellor that exhibit resistance.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the primary}} use of Thinopyrum intermedium is as a forage, seed {{production}} is essential because {{farmers and ranchers}} continue to establish new stands by planting seed. In 1988 over 500 metric tons of seed were harvested in Saskatchewan alone, although more recently the harvest has fallen to less than 225 metric tons in that Canadian province. Average seed yields are about 330 pounds per acre, but on-farm yields of up to 880 pounds per acre have been achieved. Seed is generally produced in rows spaced 30 to 36 inches apart. The wide <b>row</b> <b>spacing</b> (relative to grain crops like wheat) allows for sustained seed yields for five to ten years. Without spacing and occasional tillage between the rows, yields decline rapidly as the plant population becomes increasingly dense through rhizome spread. Despite this, Thinopyrum intermedium is still considered lesser than Wheat by some, as its seeds are comparatively very small.|$|E
