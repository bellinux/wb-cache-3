50|$|This {{geometry}} ensures that, per rotation, {{a constant}} flow volume proportional to <b>rotary</b> <b>angle</b> is always produced. The flow direction is reversed {{by changing the}} direction of rotation. Volume is therefore clearly determined by degree angle. A further advantage of this technology is that a pressure-stable, linear pump characteristic curve is obtained. From these facts we can conclude {{that there is a}} definable ratio between rotation, time and flow volume. Therefore, these pumps can produce a constant dosing volume via the parameters of time or rotation, when used in an application. This results in a guaranteed dosing accuracy of 1% at the pump outlet (depending on the medium). This figure is often even better in practice.|$|R

This component is manufactured by forging after blanking from S 55 C plate with a thickness of 6 mm.

In order to solve this problem, according to the characteristic that the driving torque of left and right steering wheel can be independently controlled in electric wheel driving vehicle, a new non-trapezium-steering system has been proposed based on electric wheel driving and powering in this paper. This system makes use of the steering torque around the kingpin from electric wheel driving, and is controlled by steering constraint mechanism. Steering system force analysis was conducted to analyze the feasibility of the system in theory. On this basis, a small prototype vehicle was designed. With the use of Bluetooth wireless serial chip and STC 12 c 5 a 60 s 2 microcontrollers, the steering-by-wire system lower computer was developed.

But in practice, experimental system arrangement of XFH does not allow the measurement of the fluorescent intensity oscillations in the full sphere.

We performed single-molecule FRET measurements to monitor conformational changes in the stator ring-α 3 β 3, while simultaneously monitoring rotations of the central shaft-γ. In the ATP waiting dwell, two of three β-subunits simultaneously adopt low FRET nonclosed forms. By contrast, in the catalytic intermediate dwell, two β-subunits are simultaneously in a high FRET closed form. These differences allow us to assign crystal structures directly to both major dwell states, thus resolving a long-standing issue and establishing a firm connection between F 1 structure and the rotation angle of the motor. Remarkably, a structure of F 1 in an ε-inhibited state {{is consistent with the}} unique FRET signature of the ATP waiting dwell, while most crystal structures capture the structure in the catalytic dwell. Principal component analysis of the available crystal structures further clarifies the five-step conformational transitions of the αβ-dimer in the ATPase cycle, highlighting the two dominant modes: the opening/closing motions of β and the loosening/tightening motions at the αβ-interface.
