40|$|Due to its {{favourable}} properties, in particular, {{low permeability}} and swelling capacity, bentonite has been favoured as an engineered-barrier and backfill {{material for the}} geological storage of radioactive waste. To ensure its safe long-term performance {{it is important to}} understand any changes in these properties when the material is subject to heat-emitting waste. As such, this study investigates the hydraulic response of bentonite under multi-step thermal loading subject to a constant-volume boundary condition, to represent a barrier system used in a crystalline or other hard-rock <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> The experimental set up allows continuous measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical responses during each phase of the thermal cycle. After the initial hydration of the bentonite, the temperature was raised in 20 °C increments from 20 to 80 °C followed by a final step to reach 120 °C. Each temperature was held constant for at least 7 – 10 days to allow the hydraulic transients to equilibrate. The data suggest that the permeability of bentonite appears to be sensitive to changes in temperature which may extend beyond those explained by simple changes in water viscosity. However, permeability may be boundary-condition dependent and this should be considered when designing experiments or applying these results to other <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rocks.</b> Either way, the magnitude of the change in permeability observed in this study is minor and its impact on the hydraulic performance of the barrier is negligible...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{unsaturated}} {{flow and}} transport in porous media {{is critical for}} understanding the movement of water and solute through the unsaturated zone. The suction potential of rock determines the imbibition of water and, therefore, the moisture retention in the matrix. That, in turn, affects {{the relative importance of}} matrix flow and fracture flow, and their interaction, because greater suction potential moves more water from fractures into the matrix and therefore retards fracture flow. The moisture content {{as a function of the}} suction potential is called a moisture retention curve or a characteristic curve. Moisture-retention data are important input for numerical models of water movement in unsaturated porous media. Also important are the effect of sample history on the moisture-retention curves and whether there is significant hysteresis between wetting and drying measurements. The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project (YMP) of the U. S. Department of Energy is studying the suitability of the tuffaceous rock at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a potential high-level nuclear waste repository. The potential repository horizon will be in the unsaturated zone of the Topopah Spring member (densely welded) of the Paintbrush Tuff unit at Yucca Mountain. This unit is highly fractured. Therefore, transport of water within the near field of the nuclear waste package in the repository is strongly influenced by the suction potential of the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rocks</b> at elevated temperatures. In a high-level nuclear waste repository, the rock mass around the waste packages will become dry because of the thermal load of the waste but will then re-wet during the cool-down period as the thermal output of the waste packages declines. Much of this process will occur at temperatures above ambient temperature. The goal of our work is to determine the importance of temperature and the wetting-drying hysteresis on the measured moisture retention curves of the densely welded tuff. For Topopah Spring tuff the suction potential is assumed to be primary due to the matric potential...|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} of Benchmark Test 2 (BMT 2) is to quantitatively examine {{the reliability of}} estimates of <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> performance, using large-scale performance assessment (PA) models that are developed by upscaling small-scale parameters and processes. These small-scale properties and processes can be investigated based on either discrete-fracture-network (DFN) models or heterogeneous-porous-medium (HPM) models. While most research teams use DFN, we employ fractal-based HPM for upscaling purposes. Comparison of results based on fundamentally different approaches is useful for evaluating and bounding the uncertainties in estimating <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> performance. HPM has both advantages and limitations when compared with DFN. DFM is conceptually more appealing because it explicitly describes fractures and the flow and transport processes that occur within them. However, HPM is more consistent with approaches used to derive field measurements of hydraulic properties (such as permeability). These properties are generally determined based on assumptions related to the continuum approach. HPM is also more straightforward in describing spatial-correlation structures of measured hydraulic properties. For example, potential flow features in the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (BVG) were found to show marked spatial clustering (Nirex, 1997), {{which is expected to}} result in a long range correlation in measured permeability distributions. This important behavior may not be captured with conventional DFNs, in which random distribution (or similar distributions) of individual fractures is assumed. The usefulness of HPM will be partially demonstrated in this report by a satisfactory description of the short interval testing data using Levy-stable fractals. (Recently, Jackson et al. (2000) also showed that equivalent HPMs could approximately describe flow processes within subgrid fracture networks.) We use Monte Carlo simulations to determine flow and transport parameters at different scales. Since we have used a fractal-based approach supported by field measurements, effective properties will be scale-dependent. Effects of mechanical processes on flow and transport properties will be also considered in the upscaling procedure. Then, large-scale thermal-hydrologic-mechanical (THM) and transport processes will be modeled...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose and}} {{objective}} of the Waste Package Environment task is to establish and characterize the environmental processes affecting the near-field <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> after waste package emplacement. These processes, which reflect the perturbation induces in the environment by engineering effects and by the waste package decay heat and radiation, will influence chemical, mineralogical and hydrological features of the environment.

To assure that waste package design considerations reflect the characteristics of this evolving environment, it is necessary to determine the range of conditions that may develop in the pre- and post-emplacement waste package environment.

40|$|Swelling clays play a {{major role}} in current {{concepts}} for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste in deep geological formations. In one of the multi-barrier concepts for preventing the escape of radioactive substances from a high-level nuclear waste repository, the barrier consists of a copper container, compacted bentonite as buffer and backfill (the engineered barrier), and the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> Corrosion of the copper canister and radiolysis of water both produce hydrogen. When the buffer and backfill are saturated with water and the permeability of the bentonite is reduced by swelling, any hydrogen that is produced can accumulate in the space between the container and the engineered barrier. This will result in pressures exceeding the entry pressure of the bentonite and passage of gas through the engineered barrier. An experimental program was developed to investigate the thermal and hydraulic properties of the buffer and backfill under conditions expected to exist in a permanent repository for radioactive waste. Water retention curves were measured from low to high saturation using a pressure cell and a thermohygrometer. Non-isothermal drainage experiments were also designed. The measured water outflow, pressure and temperature values were used for inverse modeling using iTOUGH 2. The capillary pressure curves obtained with iTOUGH 2 were consistent with those obtained with the pressure cell and thermohygrometer. The influence of salinity on the capillary pressure curves was investigated...|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} {{model for the}} back end of the nuclear fuel cycle was developed for a once-through cycle, a standard reprocessing cycle, and a reprocessing cycle with fractionation of cesium and strontium. The development of the model was performed under the expected political constraints and scenario for the first nuclear waste repository. Technical issues concerning the repository design were analyzed, in particular the thermal design. A parametric thermal analysis was performed for waste emplaced in five different geologic formations: salt, granite, basalt, shallow tuff, and deep tuff. The results of the thermal analysis, in the form of maximum permissible loadings, were incorporated into the {{economic model}}. The economic analysis was performed for a variety of situations in order to compare the five possible <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rocks,</b> the three different back end cycles, and different locations of the Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility (MRS). A sensitivity analysis was also performed for evaluating the effect of variations in some parameters in the final cost of the system;The results of the thermal analysis indicated that the maximum permissible thermal loadings in granite and tuff were relatively high, whereas for basalt the thermal loadings are very restricted for both spent fuel and reprocessed waste and for salt the loadings are very restricted for spent fuel only. The results of the economic analysis showed that a repository in basalt always resulted in higher costs than in any other rock; the other repository media yield comparable costs, except in the case of spent fuel disposal in salt, where the costs are higher. Co-location of the MRS with the repository results in a lower system cost than locating it away from the repository. The regular reprocessing cycle presents the lower storage plus disposal costs among the three cycles studied, and disposal of spent fuel has the highest costs associated. The model proved to be very sensitive to variations of the discount rate, the storage facility capital cost, and the delay of repository backfilling after waste emplacement. Lower waste storage plus disposal costs can be obtained by delaying disposal in the fractionation waste cycle in any rock or disposal of any waste form in basalt. In the other cases, aging the waste before disposal does not reduce, in general, the total cost...|$|R

These shortcomings reduces the barrier role of the rock and the required effective isolation of HLW has to be provided by engineered barriers of which clay-embedded metal canisters are most important. The paper describes {{the performance of the}} near field rock of HLW packages according to two types of repositories: very long subhorizontal holes with large diameter (1. 9 m) bored or blasted at 400 - 600 m depth, and bored 4 km deep holes with clay/concrete seals in the upper 2 km parts and HLW packages separated by clay/concrete seals in the lower 2 km parts. The most important difference between the two concepts is the much higher groundwater transmissivity of the rock in the shallow repository. A common feature is the need for rock support by filling the space between waste containers and rock with clay mud after installing the containers in shallow repositories, and by keeping the holes in deep repositories filled with clay mud from the start of boring the holes and throughout the installation of clay/concrete seals.

While a repository for low-level radioactive waste (LLW) has recently been licensed, different <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> formations are considered for disposal of heat producing high-level waste (HLW).

Different canisters and disposal concepts are considered for spent fuel disposal, i. e. thick-walled iron casks in horizontal drifts or thin-walled BSK 3 steel casks in vertical boreholes.

Model calculations are needed to predict the near-field environment for the entire life-span of a repository.

40|$|International audienceA proper {{evaluation}} of the perturbations of the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> induced by the excavation and the emplacement of exothermic wastes {{is essential for the}} assessment of the long-term safety of high-level radioactive waste disposals in clay formations. The impact of the periodthermal transient on the evolution of the damaged zone (DZ) has been explored in a recent European Commission project called TIMODAZ (Thermal Impact on the Damaged Zone Around a Radioactive Waste Disposal in Clay <b>Host</b> <b>Rocks,</b> 2006 — 2010). This paper integrates the scientific results of the TIMODAZ project from a performance assessment (PA) point of view, showing how these results support and justify key PA assumptions and the values of PA model parameters. This paper also contextualises the significance of the thermal impact on the DZ from a safety case perspective, highlighting how the project outcomes result into an improved understanding of the Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical behaviour of the host clays. The results obtained in the TIMODAZ project strengthen the assessment basis of the safety {{evaluation of}} the current repository designs. There was no evidence throughout the TIMODAZ experimental observations of a temperature-induced additional opening of fractures or of a significant permeability increase of the DZ. Instead, thermal-induced plasticity, swelling and creep behaviour seem to be beneficial to the sealing of fractures and to the recovery of a very low permeability in the DZ, close to that of an undisturbed clay <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> Results from the TIMODAZ project indicate that the favourable properties of the clay <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> that guarantee the effectiveness of the safety functions of the repository system are expected to be maintained after the heating-cooling cycle.

40|$|Repositories {{for deep}} {{geological}} disposal of radioactive waste rely on multi-barrier systems to isolate waste from the biosphere. A multi-barrier system typically comprises the natural geological barrier {{provided by the}} <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> – in our case the Opalinus Clay – and an engineered barrier system (EBS). The Swiss repository concept for spent fuel and vitrified high-level waste (HLW) consists of waste canisters, which are emplaced horizontally {{in the middle of}} an emplacement gallery and are separated from the gallery wall by granular backfill material (GBM). We describe here a selection of five in-situ experiments where characteristic hydro-mechanical (HM) and thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes have been observed. The first example is a coupled HM and mine-by test where the evolution of the excavation damaged zone (EDZ) was monitored around a gallery in the Opalinus Clay (ED-B experiment). Measurements of pore-water pressures and convergences due to stress redistribution during excavation highlighted the HM behaviour. The same measurements were subsequently carried out in a heater test (HE-D) where we were able to characterise the Opalinus Clay in terms of its THM behaviour. These yielded detailed data to better understand the THM behaviours of the granular backfill and the natural host rock. For a presentation of the Swiss concept for HLW storage, we designed three demonstration experiments that were subsequently implemented in the Mont Terri rock laboratory: (1) the engineered barrier (EB) experiment, (2) the in-situ heater test on key-THM processes and parameters (HE-E) experiment, and (3) the full-scale emplacement (FE) experiment.

To investigate the possible alteration over timescales relevant for geological disposal (104 to 105 years), previous studies included short term (< 2 years) laboratory experiments, natural analogue studies (100 s to 105 years) and predictive modelling. However, the geochemical and mineralogical processes which may occur as such systems evolve remain poorly constrained. Here, rock alteration in high pH solutions, analogous to cement leachates, has been investigated on short (1 year), medium (15 years) and long (100 s years) timescales. The short term investigation agreed with previous studies finding that silicate mineral dissolution and C-S-H precipitation were the predominant alteration processes. In the medium term study, although initially silicate mineral dissolution and C-S-H precipitation occurred, by 15 years of reaction neo-formed Mg-silicates replaced the C-S-H. To investigate rock alteration on a longer timescale Herbert’s Quarry, where high pH fluids have existed for 100 s years, was characterised and assessed as a potential analogue site. However, the site was found to have limited applicability {{in the context of the}} high pH rock alteration expected at a radioactive waste repository. The impact of rock alteration on U(VI) behaviour was also investigated in the short and medium term. In the short term, U(VI) behaviour during rock alteration varied between solutions representative of different periods of cement leachate evolution, with potential impacts for radionuclide transport.

40|$|In many {{concepts}} {{considered for}} deep geological disposal of nuclear High Level Waste, a bentonite clay buffer {{will be used}} as a protecting and isolating barrier between the waste canisters and the surrounding host rock. The temperature development in the nearfield rock, and in particular the temperature at the buffer/rock interface, contributes to control the temperature within the buffer and at the canister/buffer interface. The temperature at the buffer/rock interface is a time-dependent boundary condition for coupled Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical processes in the buffer, and is consequently important when analysing the T-H-M-C development of the buffer. In this paper, an analytical method for calculating the rock temperature development at any point within, or around, a repository consisting of thousands of regularly distributed waste canisters is presented. Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the analytical solution by applying it to a KBS- 3 type repository, in which canisters are positioned in vertical deposition holes in the floor of horizontal deposition tunnels. It is shown that the analytical solution can be used to determine the rock temperature at the buffer/rock interface, or at any other point in the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock,</b> quite easily and with good accuracy. It is furthermore shown that this can be done for different assumptions regarding repository layout and extension, depth below ground surface, rock thermal properties, initial canister power and fuel decay characteristics, thus allowing for fast and accurate sensitivity analyses. The mathematical approach, the essence of which is superposition of a global solution and a quasi-stationary local double-periodic solution, is presented in a principal and descriptive way. Results from verification calculations, performed with independent numerical methods, are presented and compared with corresponding analytical results. The relevance, validity and limitations of the analytical solution are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Model Report is to {{document}} {{the development of the}} Mountain-Scale Thermal-Hydrological (TH), Thermal-Hydrological-Chemical (THC), and Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical (THM) Models and evaluate the effects of coupled TH/THC/THM processes on mountain-scale UZ flow at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This Model Report was planned in ''Technical Work Plan (TWP) for: Performance Assessment Unsaturated Zone'' (BSC 2002 [160819], Section 1. 12. 7), and was developed in accordance with AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models. In this Model Report, any reference to ''repository'' means the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, and any reference to ''drifts'' means the emplacement drifts at the repository horizon. This Model Report provides the necessary framework to test conceptual hypotheses for analyzing mountain-scale hydrological/chemical/mechanical changes and predict flow behavior in response to heat release by radioactive decay from the nuclear waste repository at the Yucca Mountain site. The mountain-scale coupled TH/THC/THM processes models numerically simulate the impact of nuclear waste heat release on the natural hydrogeological system, including a representation of heat-driven processes occurring in the far field. The TH simulations provide predictions for thermally affected liquid saturation, gas- and liquid-phase fluxes, and water and rock temperature (together called the flow fields). The main focus of the TH Model is to predict the changes in water flux driven by evaporation/condensation processes, and drainage between drifts. The TH Model captures mountain-scale three dimensional (3 -D) flow effects, including lateral diversion at the PTn/TSw interface and mountain-scale flow patterns. The Mountain-Scale THC Model evaluates TH effects on water and gas chemistry, mineral dissolution/precipitation, and the resulting impact to UZ hydrological properties, flow and transport. The THM Model addresses changes in permeability due to mechanical and thermal disturbances in stratigraphic units above and below the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> The Mountain-Scale THM Model focuses on evaluating the changes in 3 -D UZ flow fields arising out of thermal stress and rock deformation during and after the thermal periods...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the development and}} validation of the mountain-scale thermal-hydrologic (TH), thermal-hydrologic-chemical (THC), and thermal-hydrologic-mechanical (THM) models.

40|$|In {{high level}} nuclear waste <b>repositories,</b> the <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> is {{considered}} to be an important barrier to radionuclide migration by adsorbing metals at fluid rock interfaces. In granitic rock environments the surfaces of hydraulically conductive fractures are covered with mixed community biofilms. Biofilms were grown in situ on glass and rock surfaces in high pressure flow cells using groundwater sourced from a borehole 450 meters below sea level in the Aspo hard rock laboratory, Sweden. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), epifluorescence microscopy and energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed monolayer biofilms consisting of up to 2 x 10 (4) bacteria/mm(2) surrounded by an extensive extracellular matrix and carbonate precipitates that covered < 10 % of the total surface area of each glass slide. The total organic carbon (TOC) associated with each slide was 11 mu g +/- 1. 1 mu g of which approximately 40 % was attributed to bacteria and the rest to the extracellular matrix. The adsorption capacity of these biofilms was compared to the capacity of granite rock from the same environment. Surfaces were immersed for 42 days in an anaerobic synthetic groundwater containing either Co- 60 (II), Pm- 147 (III), Am- 241 (III), Th- 234 (IV), Np- 237 (V) or Mo- 99 (VI) as radioactive tracers. Adsorption and distribution of the tracers was investigated using 2 D autoradiography. Compared to the biofilm, the rock adsorbed 88 % more Co- 60, 87 % more Mo- 99, 40 % more Am- 241 and Np- 237 and 12 % more Th- 234 per unit area. The biofilm adsorbed 57 % more Pm- 147 than the rock. The beta-emitting daughter products Pa- 233 and Pa- 234 also adsorbed to both rock and biofilms. Comparisons between rock surfaces and rock surfaces covered in biofilms indicate that the biofilms form a barrier between the rock and the groundwater and slow down radionuclide diffusion to the rock. These results suggest that the differences in adsorption are related to the surface functional groups available and the chemical properties of the radionuclides. Biological suppression of subsurface radionuclide adsorption should be accounted for in performance safety assessment models...|$|R

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Project is {{currently}} evaluating the coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrological-chemical (TMHC) {{response of the}} potential <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> through an in situ thermal testing program. A drift scale test (DST) was constructed during 1997 and heaters were turned on in December 1997. The DST includes nine canister-sized containers with thirty operating heaters each located within the heated drift (HD) and fifty wing heaters located in boreholes in both ribs with a total power output of nominally 210 kW. A total of 147 boreholes (combined length of 3. 3 km) houses most of the over 3700 TMHC sensors connected with 201 km of cabling to a central data acquisition system. The DST {{is located in the}} Exploratory Studies Facility in a 5 -m diameter drift approximately 50 m in length. Heating will last up to four years and cooling will last another four years. The rock mass surrounding the DST will experience a harsh thermal environment with rock surface temperatures expected to reach a maximum of about 200 C. This paper describes the process of designing the DST. The first 38 m of the 50 -m long Heated Drift (HD) is dedicated to collection of data that will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the complex coupled TMHC processes in the host rock of the proposed repository. The final 12 m is dedicated to evaluating the interactions between the heated rock mass and cast-in-place (CIP) concrete ground support systems at elevated temperatures. In addition to a description of the DST design, data from site characterization, and a general description of the analyses and analysis approach used to design the test and make pretest predictions are presented. Test-scoping and pretest numerical predictions of one way thermal-hydrologic, thermal-mechanical, and thermal-chemical behaviors have been completed (TRW, 1997 a). These analyses suggest that a dry-out zone will be created around the DST and a 10, 000 m{sup 3 } volume of rock will experience temperatures above 100 C. The HD will experience large stress increases, particularly in the crown of the drift. Thermoelastic displacements of up to about 16 mm are predicted for some thermomechanical gages. Additional analyses using more complex models will be performed during the conduct of the DST and the results compared with measured data...|$|E
40|$|The {{required}} long-term {{isolation of}} radioactive wastes from the biosphere {{can be achieved}} by deep geological disposal through a multiple barrier system, consisting of a combination of a man-made engineered barrier system (EBS) with a suitable geological barrier, the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock.</b> The first barrier against the release of safety-relevant radionuclides from disposed high-level radioactive wastes (HLW) is the waste matrix (wasteform), which should exhibit sufficiently low radionuclide release rates over time. The understanding of processes that govern the corrosion behaviour of and the consequent radionuclide release from the disposed waste matrices constitutes an integral part of a long-term safety assessment for a geological disposal facility. Plutonium generated in uranium-based fuels during the operation of nuclear reactors due to capture of neutrons is recovered during reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels. The preliminary preferred policy on the long-term management of separated stocks of UK civil plutonium (about 90 tHM as PuO 2), which are currently held in storage as zero value asset, is reuse as MOX fuel, but consideration of disposal options will continue [1]. Notwithstanding future UK government strategies for plutonium disposition, at least a portion of the UK plutonium inventory (i. e. some tonnes) will probably be designated for geological disposal. However, experimental data on the performance of plutonium wasteforms under disposal conditions is rather limited to date and a detailed understanding of relevant processes that govern long-term radionuclide releases on a molecular level is still missing [2]. This paper will describe outcome and conclusions of a review on the long-term durability and performance of potential plutonium wasteforms under conditions relevant for geological disposal in the UK, performed on behalf of the NDA RWMD. Key issues addressed were the durability and chemical reactivity of the wasteforms in aqueous environments and the long-term radionuclide release under disposal conditions. An essential part of this work formed the elicitation of corrosion rate data for the potential wasteforms, based on available experimental data and analogue evidence from other nuclear wasteforms, e. g. HLW-glasses and spent nuclear fuels. Generic candidate wasteform types for plutonium considered in this study comprised nuclear waste glasses (i. e. borosilicate and phosphate glasses), single- and polyphase ceramic wasteforms, cementitious wasteforms, as well as low-specification (storage) MOX. The current UK disposal programme is in a generic stage, where no preferred disposal concept or type of host rock has yet been selected. Thus various disposal scenarios and a range of possible environmental conditions in the repository near-field were considered, including alkaline conditions potentially arising due to the usage of cementitious materials in the EBS or from a co-located cementitious LILW-repository module. The elicited corrosion rates for the various wasteforms can be used in Post-Closure Safety Assessments to calculate performance and safety indicators such as time-dependent radionuclide fluxes between repository compartments or mean annual individual risks that are related to plutonium disposal...|$|E
40|$|The natural {{near-field}} {{environment in}} and around the emplacement drifts of the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, includes the host rock, dust, seepage water, and pore water. The chemical compositions of these components have been analyzed to provide a basis for assessing possible chemical and mineralogical reactions that may occur {{in and around}} the emplacement drifts during the heating and cooling cycle. The crystal-poor rhyolite of the Topopah Spring Tuff of Miocene age with an average silica (SiO{sub 2 }) content of 76 percent will host the proposed repository. Samples of the rhyolite are relatively uniform in chemical composition as shown by an average coefficient of variation (CV) of 8. 6 percent for major elements. The major component of underground dust is comminuted tuff generated during construction of the tunnel. Average CVs for major elements of dust samples collected from the main tunnel (Exploratory Studies Facility, ESF) and a cross drift (Enhanced Characterization of the Repository Block, ECRB) are 25 and 28 percent, respectively. This increased variability is due to a variable amount of dust derived from trachyte with SiO{sub 2 } contents as low as 66 percent (from overlying crystal-rich members) and from surface dust with an even lower average SiO{sub 2 } content of 60 percent (from the abundance of trachyte in outcrop and carbonate dust derived from nearby ranges). The composition of the water-soluble fraction of dust is of interest with regard to possible salt deliquescence on waste canisters. The nitrate-to-chloride (NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -}) ratio (weight) is used to assess the potential corrosive nature of the salts because an excess of NO{sub 3 }{sup -} over Cl{sup -} may inhibit the formation of the more corrosive calcium chloride brines in deliquescing salts. The soluble fractions of dust samples typically have NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -} ratios between 1 and 10. About 30 samples of seepage into the south ramp of the ECRB have an average NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -} of 0. 62. Pore water extracted from core samples of the <b>repository</b> <b>host</b> <b>rock</b> has lower NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -}-ratios with an average value of 0. 28 and a range over two orders of magnitude. Of all the components of the natural system, pore water has the largest compositional variability with an average CV of 62 percent, and thus, is the most difficult to characterize. Because pore water is extracted from dry-drilled core, its solute content may have been increased by evaporation during drilling, handling, storage, and extraction by ultracentrifugation. Further, microbial activity in the core during storage may reduce the concentration of NO{sub 3 }{sup -} thus decreasing the NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -} ratio. Therefore, the more dilute pore water samples might be considered the most representative of native pore water with NO{sub 3 }{sup -}/Cl{sup -} ratios close to unity or greater...|$|E
