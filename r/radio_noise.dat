5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of <b>radio</b> <b>noise,</b> or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E

25|$|The {{new breed}} of {{electronic}} astronomers that Paul Wild joined were applying their wartime skills to radiophysics research, the Radiophysics Laboratory having achieved a number of successes since it was established, early in the war, to bring radar to Australia. In 1948, groups at the laboratory were studying several fields in addition to solar. Wild's work arose from the phenomenon of embryonic radar technology sometimes being jammed by mysterious interference, later discovered, in England, to be <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> coming from the Sun.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{problem is the}} vastness of space. Despite piggybacking on the world's most sensitive radio telescope, Charles Stuart Bowyer said, the instrument could not detect random <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> emanating from a civilization like ours, which has been leaking radio and TV signals for less than 100 years. For SERENDIP and most other SETI projects to detect a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization, the civilization {{would have to be}} beaming a powerful signal directly at us. It also means that Earth civilization will only be detectable within a distance of 100 light-years.|$|E

The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on <b>radio</b> <b>noise,</b> any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia.|$|E

40|$|The noise {{appearing}} as a modulation {{on the radio}} frequency energy generated by oscillators has been examined. These measurements have revealed a new effect: flicker noise and shot noise, generated within a tube at very low frequencies, modulates the radio frequency oscillation and in doing it produces <b>radio</b> frequency <b>noise.</b> At frequencies close to the carrier this noise greatly exceeds the noise from all previously recognized sources. Spectrum and correlation measurements have been made on bath the audio frequency and the <b>radio</b> frequency <b>noise</b> generated simultaneously by an oscillator tube. The spectra of the radio frequency and the audio frequency noises corresponded. Other measurements showed that the noise trains were as much as seventy percent correlated up to the limit of measurement, namely 10 kilocycles per second different for the carrier frequency. A method is provided for the calculation {{of the magnitude of}} the noise arising from this source...|$|R
40|$|The data {{on radio}} {{telemetry}} links (for water information) at VHF/UHF in Hokkaido {{are used to}} investigate the rate of disturbances on radio links (or connection failure) and its association with a huge earthquake, Tokachi-oki earthquake on 26 September 2003.

We suggest that these severe disturbances in VHF/UHF telemetry links are attributed to the generation of seismogenic VHF/UHF <b>radio</b> <b>noises</b> (emissions). Based on this idea, we have estimated that the intensity of these seismogenic emissions is on the order of 10 – 19 dB μV/m.
