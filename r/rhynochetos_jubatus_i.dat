50|$|The best-known {{animal species}} is the <b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus</b> or cagou, {{which is at}} risk from dogs, rats and other predators. It is a chicken-sized bird, almost unable to fly, with a long crest and a funny cackling song, found in leafy forest mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{sunbittern}} (Eurypyga helias) is a bittern-like bird {{of tropical}} {{regions of the}} Americas, and the sole {{member of the family}} Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga. It is found in Central and South America, and has three subspecies. The sunbittern shows both morphological and molecular similarities with the kagu (<b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus)</b> of New Caledonia, indicating an gondwanic origin, both species being placed in the clade Eurypygiformes.|$|R
50|$|The {{sunbittern}} {{is usually}} {{placed in the}} Gruiformes, but this was always considered preliminary. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the kagu (<b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus).</b> Molecular studies seem {{to confirm that the}} kagu and sunbittern are each other's closest living relatives and have a similar wing display. They are probably not Gruiformes (though the proposed Metaves are just as weakly supported). Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor Gondwanan lineage which could also include the extinct adzebills and/or the mesites, and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the kagu and mesites also have powder down.|$|R
50|$|While the kagu is {{the only}} living species in the family Rhynochetidae, a larger species, the lowland kagu (Rhynochetos orarius), has been {{described}} from Holocene subfossil remains. The measurements of this species were 15% bigger than <b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus,</b> with no overlap in measurements except those of the forelimbs. Given that the sites where R. orarius were all lowland sites, and that no fossils of R. jubatus were found in these sites, the scientists that described the fossils suggested they represented highland and lowland species respectively. R. orarius {{is one of many}} species to have become extinct in New Caledonia after the arrival of humans. The validity of the species has been questioned by some authors, but accepted by others.|$|R
50|$|The kagu or cagou (<b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus)</b> is a crested, long-legged, and bluish-grey bird {{endemic to}} the dense {{mountain}} forests of New Caledonia. It {{is the only}} surviving member of the genus Rhynochetos and the family Rhynochetidae, although a second species has been described from the fossil record. Measuring 55 cm in length, it has pale grey plumage and bright red legs. Its 'nasal corns' are a unique feature not shared with any other bird. Almost flightless, it spends its time {{on or near the}} ground, where it hunts its invertebrate prey, and builds a nest of sticks on the forest floor. Both parents share incubation of a single egg, as well as rearing the chick. It has proven vulnerable to introduced predators, and is threatened with extinction.|$|R

5000|$|Given its {{geographical}} isolation {{since the}} end of the Cretaceous, New Caledonia is a refugium, in effect a biological [...] "Noah's Ark", an island home to both unique living plants and animals and also to its own special fossil endowment. Birds such as the crested and almost flightless kagu (French, cagou) <b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus,</b> whose closest relative may be the distantly related sunbittern of South America, and plants such as Amborella trichopoda, the only known member of the most basal living branch of flowering plants, make this island a treasure trove and a critical concern for biologists and conservationists. The island was home to horned fossil turtles (Meiolania mackayi) and terrestrial fossil crocodiles (Mekosuchus inexpectatus) which became extinct shortly after human arrival. There are no native amphibians, with geckos holding many of their niches. The crested gecko (Rhacodactylus ciliatus), thought to have gone extinct, was rediscovered in 1994. [...] At 14 inches, Leach's giant gecko (Rhacodactylus leachianus), the world's largest and a predator of smaller lizards is another native. The only native mammals are four species of bat including the endemic New Caledonia flying fox.|$|R
40|$|The {{sunbittern}} (Eurypyga helias) is a South American Gruiformes, {{the only}} member of Family Eurypigidae. In most phylogenetic proposals, it is placed in a more distant position than other families of the so-called "core Gruiformes". Different studies based on molecular, morphological and biogeographical data suggest that the Eurypigidae is closely related to the kagu (<b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus),</b> the only species in Rynochetidae, another family not included in the core Gruiformes. Here, the karyotype of the sunbittern is described for the first time, by classical and molecular cytogenetics, using whole chromosome probes derived from Gallus gallus and Leucopternis albicollis. We found a diploid number of 80, with only one pair of biarmed autosomal macrochromosomes, similar to that observed in the kagu. Chromosome painting revealed that most syntenies found in the avian putative ancestral karyotype (PAK) were conserved in the sunbittern. However, PAK 1, PAK 2, and PAK 5 corresponded to two chromosome pairs each. Probes derived from L. albicollis confirm that fissions in PAK 1 and PAK 2 were centric, whereas in PAK 5 the fission is interstitial. In addition, there is fusion of segments homologous to PAK 2 q and PAK 5. From a phylogenetic point of view, comparisons of our results with two other Gruiformes belonging to family Rallidae suggest that the PAK 5 q fission might be a synapomorphy for Gruiformes. Fissions in PAK 1 and PAK 2 are found only in Eurypigidae, and might also occur in Rynochetidae, in view of the similar chromosomal morphology between the sunbittern and the kagu. This suggests a close phylogenetic relationship between Eurypigidae and Rynochetidae, whose common ancestor was separated by the Gondwana vicariancy in South America and New Caledonia, respectively...|$|R

Bird Conservation International, 6 (4), 295 - 306. I carried out two phases of an internationally co-ordinated recovery project for the kagu <b>Rhynochetos</b> <b>jubatus</b> of New Caledonia between June 1991 and March 1995. In Phase One, between June 1991 and January 1992, I established kagu abundance and distribution on Grande Terre in the first comprehensive survey of the species outside Parc Rivière Bleue, where kagu distribution was known through Yves Létocart's work there. In 177 different listening areas, I recorded a total of 491 adult kagus, including 208 pairs, in 84 of the areas, mostly in Province Sud (403 birds; 177 pairs). Low kagu numbers (1 - 4 birds) were recorded in 56 % (n = 47) of the areas. More than nine kagus were recorded in each of 19 areas, which accounted for 57 % (n = 282) of all birds. In these 19 areas, virtually all birds sang from intact forest. Kagus occurred in 'patches' over a large area of the island, but mostly in inland mountainous regions. Analyses indicated that larger numbers of kagus {{were likely to be}} found on volcanic rock types and with increasing distance from human settlements. In Phase Two, from August 1992 to March 1995, I carried out a 32 -month field-research programme at two high altitude study areas, Pic Ningua and Mt Cindoa, with the main objective of investigating if food supply was limiting annual fecundity of kagus. I found that kagu pairs probably lived on relatively fixed territories year-round where independent offspring may also be present, as was the case at Parc Rivière Bleue. At Pic Ningua, one pair nested in early December 1994, and another also probably around that time in 1993, which contrasted with the main breeding period of June-August at Parc Rivière Bleue. I recorded no breeding at Mt Cindoa, where kagus' bodyweights were generally lower than those of birds at Pic Ningua, probably due to poorer food supplies at Mt Cindoa. Kagus appeared to moult their primary feathers annually between approximately December and May, starting in close association with hot, wet conditions in the wet season, as they appeared to do at Parc Rivière Bleue. Moult may be delayed or suspended in parents feeding chicks in the wet season. After dogs Canis familiaris killed most of the kagus I knew at Pic Ningua (see below), remaining birds quit or extended the territories they held before the attacks. This behaviour in widowed birds may have been mostly related to a search for mates. I found distinct seasonal patterns in kagu food supplies at high altitude closely related to seasonality in climate, especially temperature, and probably highly similar year-to-year. Food supplies peaked in the wet season and were lowest around late October when conditions were driest, and were also relatively spatially uniform in forest. It is not clear why birds do not generally use the period of peak food supplies for breeding, but it may be better for birds to moult their primary feathers at that time. Kagus were generalists in the types of the larger-sized soil and litter fauna they ate, and I recorded many new taxa not previously known to be eaten by the birds. Birds' diets were strongly influenced by seasonality in climate and food supplies, but they did not just track changing patterns in food availability. They were probably also a result of birds approaching local optima in the efficient use of available prey in response to changing environmental and physiological conditions. Birds appeared to use larger prey items when food was more abundant, and be least selective at times of greatest food scarcity in the driest periods. Birds used larvae at high frequencies in the early dry season; larvae might provide energy assimilation benefits in cold conditions. Bodyweights of mostly non-breeding kagus at Pic Ningua and Mt Cindoa varied seasonally in close positive association with temperature and food supplies, and varied negatively with use of sheltered roosts. Bodyweights peaked {{at the end of the}} wet season around April and were lowest in the driest period of the late dry season around late October. Lack of other factors likely to be affecting the kagus' bodyweights like competition, parasites and reproduction indicated that climate and food supplies were closely linked to the seasonal variation in them. The close association between variation in temperature and kagu bodyweights and roosting behaviour appeared to be clear evidence of phenotypic adjustment in roosting behaviour for energy conservation in response to cold conditions, particularly wind chill, and food shortage. There is little direct evidence that food supply is limiting the kagu's annual fecundity, but indirect support for this comes from, for example, the difficulty birds have in finding and capturing prey present in the soil and litter, and that they generally breed outside the period of peak food supplies and forage for long hours each day. More research is needed on whether food is limiting for aspects of kagu reproduction like egg formation and chick provisioning. Data suggest that the kagu's food supplies are independent of pair densities, thus the kagu's life history characteristics may have been strongly influenced by selection to maximise energy resources through interaction with the environment rather than by competition. This is consistent with aspects of the kagu's life history like for example its relatively non-competitive social organisation which means that birds can devote most of their time to foraging. I propose that density-independent food limitation has played an important role in shaping annual fecundity and other life history characteristics like social organisation in tropical, and possibly south temperate, forest birds. At Pic Ningua in 1993, I described the first documented case of multiple kagu deaths caused by dogs. Twenty kagus were found dead (15) or wounded (5; one survived) from dog attacks in four distinct episodes over a 14 week period from late April to early August. Older remains of two other birds were also found. Eighteen of the 22 birds wore radio-transmitters, and the four non-radio-tracked birds were found by chance. Dogs errant from a nearby tribal village were strongly implicated in carrying out most, if not all, of the attacks. The events on the peak showed that dogs are dangerous predators of adult kagus, and dog predation may have been important in shaping kagu distribution patterns. Four other important implications of my study for kagu conservation management are (1) the kagu's reproductive success may be greater in low altitude compared to high altitude rainforest; (2) because the kagu's clutch size is low and invariable, and the number of successful broods per year is also low and seems to be more influenced by density-independent factor(s), birds are especially vulnerable to predation because they cannot respond to lower densities by lifting their reproductive output; (3) feral pigs Sus scrofa at sufficiently high densities could potentially reduce prey availability for kagus; and (4) at least two additional managed reserves like Pare Rivière Bleue protecting up to 200 kagus are required to ensure that birds remain in the wild for the long term...|$|R
40|$|Determining diets of {{pinnipeds}} by visually identifying prey remains {{recovered in}} faecal samples is challenging because {{of differences in}} digestion and passage rates of hard parts. Analyzing the soft matrix of faecal material using DNA-based techniques is an alternative means to identify prey species consumed, but published techniques are largely non-quantitative, which limits their applicability. I developed and validated a real-time PCR technique using species-specific mitochondrial DNA primers to quantify the diets of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias <b>jubatus).</b> <b>I</b> first demonstrated that the proportions of prey tissue DNA in mixtures of DNA isolated from four prey species could be estimated within a margin of ~ 12 % of the percent in the mix. These prey species included herring Clupea palasii, eulachon Thaleichthyes pacificus, squid Loligo opalescens and rosethorn rockfish Sebastes helvomaculatus. I then applied real-time PCR to DNA extracted from faecal samples obtained from Steller sea lions that had been fed 11 different combinations of herring, eulachon, squid and Pacific ocean perch rockfish (Sebastes alutus), ranging from 7 - 75 % contributions to a meal mix (by wet weight). The difference between the average percentage estimated by real-time PCR {{and the percentage of}} prey consumed was generally less than 12 % for all diets fed when percentages of prey consumed were corrected for differences in mtDNA density among the prey items. My findings indicate that real-time PCR can detect the quantity of prey consumed for a variety of complex diets and prey species, including cephalopods and fish. i...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 1986. A {{population}} of Eumetopias jubatus and Zalophus californianus was studied during the summers of 1983 and 1984 {{on the coast}} of Humboldt County. The {{population of}} E. jubatus and Z. californianus peaked during June and August. Z. californianus numbers peaked again during September. The E. jubatus population probably formed an incipient breeding colony. During June a territorial bull showed sexual interest toward cows and attempted copulation. No pupping was observed. Sea lions moved to drier areas on the study site when tidal height and ocean surge inundated haul-out areas. E. <b>jubatus</b> and <b>I.</b> californianus formed segregated clusters when hauling out. Behavioral interactions between the two species were generally not aggressive. As colony size increased, rate of behavioral interactions decreased. Four age-sex classes of E. jubatus were examined. Old Bulls were highly aggressive toward other Old Bulls, used visual displays of aggression toward Sub-adult Bulls, and showed frequent sexual interest toward Cows. Sub-adult Bulls mock-fought frequently and were highly aggressive among themselves. They displayed a weak sexual interest toward Cows but were usually rebuffed. Cows and Juveniles were usually non-aggressive. Individual E. jubatus did not frequently respond to other sea lions. Such behavior may result from sea lion iii lethargy, or may be an adaptation whereby subordinates avoid antagonizing dominants. Moving E. jubatus also frequently avoided behavioral interactions...|$|R
