40|$|<b>Researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> is an {{important}} form of cross-border education (CBE). It {{has the potential to}} generate significant benefits for economies as expert scholars and scientists come together to solve some of the most pressing challenges in the contemporary world. Among members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Community (APEC) <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> can strengthen ties between economies and enable the minimisation of barriers to economic growth and sustainability. There are not currently any comparable or rigorous data available on <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> among APEC economies. Proxy measures are needed to gain a sense {{of the extent to which}} researchers in APEC economies are collaborating with their peers. In this report, research collaboration, measured through data on joint publications, is analysed to identify patterns of collaboration among researchers in APEC economies. Although this approach does not encapsulate the outcomes of all forms of <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> it provides an illustration of the strength of patterns of research collaboration within, and among, the 21 economies that comprise APEC...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{acknowledgement}} {{around the world}} that contemporary research is increasingly – and needs to be – international. In a globalised world common problems can only be solved through the sharing of expertise and pooling of resources. At the same time, research developments are critical in stimulating economic growth in knowledge economies. Ensuring that researchers can access best practice through international research collaboration is essential in facilitating innovation. Policies and structures {{can go a long way}} to supporting increased international research collaboration. Online communication technologies have become a vital part of <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility,</b> enabling researchers to unite in conducting collaborative research across the world. It is inevitable that policy makers may regard communication developments as taking the place of physical <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> and hence reducing the cost involved. Research indicates, however, that face-to-face interaction remains vital in successful research collaborations, particularly at the early stage of projects and when multi-disciplinary approaches are required 1. This is due to the role of face-to-face interaction in creating trust between researchers. Thus, international research collaborations are fundamentally premised on <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> and, hence, <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> lies at the core of efforts to enhance the quality, impact and capacity of research to inform innovation in all APEC economies. This report has been written for the APEC <b>Researcher</b> <b>Mobility</b> Workshop, held in Jakarta in December 2015. Chapters 1 to 7 were prepared to stimulate consideration of the issues surrounding <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility.</b> They provide an overview of pertinent literature, case studies, data sets and policy of relevance to the topics that were discussed at the workshop.

30|$|The {{emergence}} {{of one or}} more foreign affiliations corresponds to <b>researcher’s</b> <b>mobility</b> in geographical spaces. Hence, synchronous international scientific mobility (SISM) can be defined as the emergence and loss of foreign affiliations. The SISM model considers that the researcher participates in each of the institutes with which she/he is affiliated not as a unified whole but only as a part; the latter we call ‘parton’. A parton has a virtual bibliometric identity that appears in processes of international division and cooperation of research if these processes are de jure formed via multiple simultaneous affiliations. As noted above, our sample counts 6249 MA, which constitute 10, 826 partons. According to the SISM model, a mobile researcher behaves as a combination of partons. The multiple affiliations in the framework of bibliometrics are to a some extent uncertainty in the sense that one cannot predict exactly where the scientist will be, but only the probability that she/he is in a country corresponding to one of several partons of this author. Therefore, it is necessary to include probability when describing SISM. Analogous to quantum mechanics, we only can estimate the probability that a researcher with multiple affiliations is located in a given country.|$|R

The wide spread usage of Android requires some areas for potential <b>researchers.</b> <b>Mobility</b> management, location awareness and security are among them. Vulnerability of theft exists as these phones are portable devices. This has opened new opportunities {{in the field of}} security of android based mobile phones. A cost effective technique is needed to protect phones using existing resources. Location based services is one of such technique that can provide the protection for smart phones with minimal cost investment. The currently available technique for providing location is GPS, but GPS does not work well at indoor locations for providing locations, so WI-FI signal strength can be used to find the indoor location. This viewpoint can be thus used as a medium to track the phone. An application is developed {{that can be used for}} securing android based smartphones in a particular area.

The degree evolution into a three-cycle system as well as students, teachers and <b>researchers</b> <b>mobility</b> within Europe are priorities.

40|$|Against {{the current}} of {{scientific}} researchers moving to universities and research institutes outside their home countries, {{there is also}} an observable flow of researchers who relocate back to their home countries following a foreign stay. The aim of this report is to take stock of conceptual and measurement issues related to this phenomenon, referred to as the “return mobility” of researchers. In the context of European policies striving to promote excellent research while realizing it by efficient spending, there are fears that <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> towards centers of excellence (seen as “brain drain” in “net exporter” countries) further widens the gap between regions of Europe. This fear is behind a growing concern for fostering the return mobility of talented researchers to ensure a more equal distribution of research capacity. The aim of this report is to take stock of conceptual and measurement issues related to the return mobility of researchers, and see how it may relate to research excellence. The in-depth literature survey carried out in the framework of this study suggests that the very concepts of “brain drain” or “brain gain” are associated with a specific understanding of <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility,</b> which rests on rather strict assumptions that strongly influences the framing of research problems and policy interventions. This most widely diffused, neo-classical, general equilibrium-based “allocative approach” conceptualizes <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> under the assumptions that human capital, embodied in rational agents, is efficiently used by the productive system. The study shows that at least two other approaches may be distinguished. These approaches may be more aligned with how scientific research activity is carried out and how it is embedded in the socio-economic fabric. An eventual shift of focus from the “allocative” to the “connective” approach (which, based on evolutionary economics, conceives human capital as inherently networked, in a complex, evolving system) would point in the direction of changing the object of study. Rather than on the changing stock of researchers, it would focus on the heterogeneity of research actors and networks, the impact of reconfigurations of scientific, technological and social networks in which researchers’ work is embedded. As one of the case studies reviewed shows, a research system of a given country can substantially benefit from the establishment of new academic and social network connections due to a temporary mobility event even if the mobile research in question has physically “emigrated” from the country in question. Alternatively, a focus on the “creativity” approach (which considers changes of contexts as inherent to creating the conditions for knowledge recombination) would lead to putting greater emphasis on the study of the evolution of ideas, research agendas and research careers. The possibilities for improving our knowledge regarding the role played by <b>researcher</b> <b>mobility</b> within the epistemic and organizational dynamics of the European Research Area are extensive, particularly if we do not only think of mobility as a re/allocative phenomenon. The empirical section of the study provides evidence on country-level return mobility patterns of researchers, following the “allocative approach”, using data collected {{in the context of the}} MORE 2 survey, a Study on Mobility Patterns and Career Paths of Researchers. Return mobility patterns are identified highlighting differences across gender, discipline, seniority, country of citizenship as well as of PhD. To the extent possible, motivations for return mobility of researchers are also investigated, which highlight the importance of personal and family ties apart from academic ones. Potential alternative data sources are also examined, including the Career of Doctorate Holders Survey, the Labour Force Survey as well as “big data”, highlighting the limitations in the former and the vast potential in the latter. A final contrast of return mobility of researchers with the research excellence of countries presents a mixed picture, showing that countries on the entire spectrum of research excellence may experience high shares of returning researchers.

40|$|Hydrogels are {{hydrophilic}} three-dimensional networks with demonstrated {{potential for}} medical and pharmaceutical applications. Specifically, biopolymer-based hydrogels offer certain advantages over synthetic polymers {{in terms of}} biocompatibility and biodegradability. Because of their inherent properties, hydrogels are able to efficiently encapsulate and liberate in a controlled release manner, different hydrophobic and hydrophilic therapeutic molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins and antibodies. Several strategies {{have been reported in}} the literature to minimize the potential burst release of encapsulated drugs, thus preventing their local accumulation and consequent toxic responses. Within this context, liposomes embedded in hydrogels have emerged as an attractive strategy to reduce this undesirable effect.
