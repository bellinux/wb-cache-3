40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory has {{designed}} an laboratory tested a prototype retractable spiked barrier strip for law enforcement. The proposed system, which {{is ready for}} controlled field testing, expands the functionality of existing spiked barrier strips. A <b>retractable</b> <b>barrier</b> strip, one that can place the spikes in either the active (vertical) or passive (horizontal) position, would allow law enforcement personnel to lay the unobtrusive strip across a road far in advance of a fleeing vehicle. No damage occurs to passing vehicles until the spikes are activated, {{and that can be}} done from a safe distance and at a strategic location when the offending vehicle is close to the strip. The concept also allows the strips to be place safely across several roadways that are potential paths of a fleeing vehicle. Since they are not activated until needed, they are harmless to nonoffending vehicles. The laboratory tests conducted on the system indicate that it will puncture tires only when the spikes are rotated to the active position and is safe to travel over when the spikes are in the down position. The strip itself will not cause instability to a vehicle driving over it, nor is the strip disturbed or adversely affected by vehicles driving over it. The spikes can be quickly rotated between the active (vertical) and passive (horizontal) position. However, the laboratory tests have only demonstrated that the retractable spiked barrier strip can perform its intended function in a laboratory environment. Field tests are needed to finalize the design and develop the system into a functional law enforcement tool...|$|E
40|$|After the {{air attacks}} of September 11, 2001 the United States {{government}} decided to fortify all public government buildings and spaces of importance in Washington, D. C. {{that might be}} targets of future attacks. The expenditures for these projects ran to {{millions of dollars and}} included the White House, Congress, and the Supreme Court. These extensive fortifications were inspired by widespread fear {{at all levels of the}} American government that extreme measures were needed to protect themselves and government buildings. This culture of fear quickly became an accepted part of American political discourse. Fear was no longer cowardly; it became a badge of courage. Streets around government buildings were closed. Streets that remained open were provided with <b>retractable</b> <b>barriers.</b> A security cordon around the White House was greatly expanded. The public was denied entrance to the grand staircase on the West side of the Capitol buildings. Armed police were placed on every corner of Capitol Hill twenty-four hours a day. To secure perimeters metal bollards were placed around buildings and public spaces at a cost of 10, 000 each. They could not protect against air attacks or suicide bombers [...] only truck and car bombs-but that fact did not deter the frenzy of construction that still continues. Thousands of bollards were put in place. The directors of every government agency stumbled over one another to arrange that their spaces be surrounded by these symbols of fear. The question that every director in Washington must have asked themselves again and again was 2 ̆ 2 How could their buildings be bereft of these symbols that made a public statement of their importance? 2 ̆ 2 Even the coal burning steam plant on Capitol Hill-the worst source of pollution in Washington-was fortified. 2 ̆ 7 The bollards around the Supreme Court were the only ones decorated with a Latin word: Lex. Why did the judges choose lex and not ius for those protective fences...|$|R
