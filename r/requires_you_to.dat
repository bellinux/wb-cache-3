25|$|The mere {{pocketing}} of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, {{many players}} to distraction is {{the unpredictability of}} the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards <b>requires</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when you understand the how and why of a ball's getting {{from one place to}} another.|$|E

Biden discussed the War in Iraq, his recent vote to continue the funding of the troops and briefly about illegal immigration. On immigration Biden stated that it would cost too much money to send all 14 million illegal immigrants back to their native countries. He stated that those who commit crimes should be sent back and the rest {{should be given a}} pathway to citizenship. His statement: [...] "Folks, being commander in chief <b>requires</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> occasionally be practical." [...] drew some laughter from the audience. Later in the debate Biden addressed his opposition to the [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy of the military and touched on the situation in Darfur.|$|E
500|$|The {{cooperative}} puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as {{a valuable}} addition to the game. Welsh called the cooperative mode [...] "one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend". Onyett wrote, [...] "Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but <b>requires</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success". Several reviewers praised the non-verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners. Portal 2 was praised {{for the amount of}} detail in its design, sound, and music. Nelson credited the [...] "sheer amount of detail" [...] put into the game's world, and wrote, [...] "it all feels very real and natural with brief moments where you're simply sucked into this world". Onyett was impressed with the amount of visual details and capabilities Valve achieved from their Source game engine and that the added details and animations of the levels [...] "consistently serv not only to entertain the eye but to expand our understanding of the game's characters". Hoggins wrote that the game's world reacted to the player-character Chell's presence [...] "in a startlingly organic way", and praised Valve's design as [...] "an achievement of world-building that compares favourably with BioShock underwater city of Rapture".|$|E

One reason cited by Microsoft {{is to provide}} [...] "much more robust support for content protection systems" [...] (see digital rights management).

[...] And there are still DirectShow features that aren't (yet) in Media Foundation".

2500|$|Building on the {{importance}} of idealism, some recent researchers suggest the 'engaged followership' perspective. Based on an examination of Milgram's archive, in a recent study, social psychologists Alex Haslam, Stephen Reicher and Megan Birney, at the University of Queensland, discovered that people are less likely to follow the prods of an experimental leader when the prod resembles an order. However, when the prod stresses {{the importance}} of the experiment for science (i.e. 'The experiment <b>requires</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> continue'), {{people are more likely to}} obey. The researchers suggest the perspective of 'engaged followership': that people are not simply obeying the orders of a leader, but instead are willing to continue the experiment because of their desire to support the scientific goals of the leader and because of a lack of identification with the learner. Also a neuroscientific study [...] supports this perspective, namely watching the learner receive electric shocks, does not activate brain regions involving empathic concerns.|$|E
