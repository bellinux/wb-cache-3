5|$|An {{example of}} {{gravitational}} lensing {{is found in}} the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> 3C 324. First thought to be a single overluminous <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> discovered, the source appears to be an elliptical galaxy with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy,</b> 3C 317. This <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
5|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> is {{an active}} galaxy that is very {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.|$|E
40|$|Radio contour maps, models, {{and optical}} identifications for 250 <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> in Abell {{clusters}} of galaxies are presented.

40|$|ROSAT is {{the first}} mission to have {{detected}} X‐ray emission in <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> which are both powerful (l_(178 MHz) > 10 ^(27) W Hz^(− 1) sr^(− 1)) and distant (z> 0. 4), enabling test of ‘‘unified schemes’’ through {{a comparison of the}} X‐ray and radio properties of powerful quasars and <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> These <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> are faint in X‐rays, but, nevertheless, ROSAT is capable of resolving any associated X‐ray‐emitting gas of cluster dimension. We present ROSAT PSPC observations of two such <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> and suggest that there is a component of unresolved X‐ray emission in powerful, high‐redshift <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> which {{may be related to the}} radio core; this will be tested by ROSAT observations of other powerful <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies...</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{work has}} been done {{attempting}} to use <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> as standard rulers to determine cosmological parameters. This method is fraught with difficulty because a <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy's</b> size depends on both its age and its environment. When a model of the radio source is used, though, methods based on <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> can give good agreement with other cosmological observations.|$|R
5|$|Blazars are {{believed}} to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of Earth. A <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets.

5|$|NGC 6251 is {{an active}} supergiant {{elliptical}} <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> more than 340 million light-years away from Earth. It has a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, {{and is one of}} the most extreme examples of a Seyfert galaxy. This galaxy may be associated with gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is also noted for its one-sided radio jet—one of the brightest known—discovered in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, the United States Naval Research Laboratory group {{launched}} an Aerobee 150 rocket {{equipped with a}} pair of Geiger counters. This flight discovered seven candidate X-ray sources, including the first extragalactic X-ray source; Virgo X-1 was designated as the first X-ray source detected in Virgo. A later Aerobee rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range on July 7, 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the HEAO 1 and Einstein Observatory showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.|$|E
40|$|Multifiber optical {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} performed on {{galaxies in the}} vicinity of strong, nearby <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> These <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> were selected from the 3 CR and B 2 catalogs based on their exclusion from the Abell catalog, which is puzzling given the hypothesis that an external medium is required to confine the radio plasma of such galaxies. Velocities derived from the spectra were used to confirm the existence of groups and poor clusters in the fields of most of the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We find that all <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> with classical FR I morphologies prove to reside in clusters, whereas the other <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> often appear to be recent galaxy-galaxy mergers in regions of low galaxy density. These findings confirm the earlier result that the existence of extended X-ray emission combined with a statistical excess of neighboring galaxies can be used to identify poor clusters associated with <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{generally}} accepted picture is that OVV quasars are intrinsically powerful <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> while BL Lac objects are intrinsically weak <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> In {{both cases the}} host galaxies are giant ellipticals.|$|R
50|$|The ORT has {{produced}} results on <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> quasars, supernovae and pulsars, One long-term program determined the angular structure {{of several hundred}} distant <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> and quasars using the lunar occultation method.|$|R
5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{remained}} at Cornell until 1964, {{when he went}} to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He remained there for the remainder of his career, becoming Institute Professor in 1976, and Institute Professor Emeritus in 1986. In 1963, working in collaboration with a student of his, James Felten, Morrison had investigated the effect of inverse Compton scattering, an important source of cosmic x-rays and gamma rays. At MIT, Morrison teamed up with Bruno Rossi's x-ray group there, and also with Riccardo Giacconi's group at nearby American Science and Engineering. Morrison became deeply involved in the exploration of the cosmos through its x-ray and gamma ray emissions. In a 1960 paper, he noted the similarities between pulsars and quasars. He returned to this in 1976, applying his model to the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> Cygnus A.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> nucleus.|$|E
40|$|About 54 % of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> at z � 3 and 8 % of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> at 2 � z 2. 5 <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The {{enhanced}} {{star formation}} activity in LAEs {{could be a}} consequence of a recent merger which has triggered both the star formation and the AGN/radio activities.

40|$|Relativistic and {{magnetised}} plasma ejected {{by radio}} loud AGNs through jets form the diffuse lobes of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The radiating particles (electron/electron-positron) in lobes emit in radio via the synchrotron process and X-ray via inverse-Compton scattering of {{cosmic microwave background}} photons. The thermal environment around <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> emits X-rays via the thermal bremsstrahlung process. By combining information from these processes we can measure physical conditions {{in and around the}} radio lobes and thus study the dynamics of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> including double-double <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures, Diffuse Radio Plasma Conference proceedings (held in Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, India...|$|R
40|$|We use the semi-analytical {{model of}} galaxy {{formation}} GALFORM to characterise an indirect signature of AGN feedback {{in the environment}} of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> at high redshifts. The predicted environment of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> is denser than that of radio-quiet galaxies with the same stellar mass. This is consistent with observational results from the CARLA survey. Our model shows that the differences in environment are due to <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> being hosted by dark matter haloes that are ~ 1. 5 dex more massive than those hosting radio-quiet galaxies with the same stellar mass. By running a control-simulation in which AGN feedback is switched-off, we identify AGN feedback as the primary mechanism affecting the build-up of the stellar component of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> thus explaining the different environment in <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> and their radio-quiet counterparts. The difference in host halo mass between radio loud and <b>radio</b> quiet <b>galaxies</b> translates into different galaxies populating each environment. We predict a higher fraction of passive <b>galaxies</b> around <b>radio</b> loud <b>galaxies</b> compared to their radio-quiet counterparts. Furthermore, such a high fraction of passive galaxies shapes the predicted infrared luminosity function in the environment of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in a way that}} is consistent with observational findings. Our results suggest that the impact of AGN feedback at high redshifts and environmental mechanisms affecting galaxies in high halo masses can be revealed by studying the environment of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> thus providing new constraints on galaxy formation physics at high redshifts.

It is classified as an active galaxy because the supermassive black hole at its nucleus is accreting matter, which produces two jets of matter from the poles.

40|$|We report Very Large Array (VLA) A-configuration {{studies of}} a sample of 49 <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> at {{redshift}} less than 1.

We compare the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> with the quasar sample and also {{with a sample of}} 29 <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> selected for steep spectrum and double-lobe structure.

The overall sizes of the two types of sources are similar, but the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> have a 3 times larger upper envelope. The distribution of bend angles is similar but the <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> have fewer very bent and straight sources. We discuss these and other comparisons in detail and suggest that while quasars appear to be viewed within a cone and <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> outside it, the two types of source also have intrinsic differences, and both have individual growth and evolution scenarios.

25|$|Fornax A is a <b>radio</b> <b>galaxy</b> with {{extensive}} radio lobes {{that corresponds to}} the optical galaxy NGC 1316, a 9th-magnitude galaxy. One of the closer active galaxies to Earth {{at a distance of}} 80 million light-years, Fornax A appears in the optical spectrum as a large elliptical galaxy with dust lanes near its core. These dust lanes have caused astronomers to discern that it recently merged with a small spiral galaxy. Because it has a high rate of type Ia supernovae, NGC 1316 has been used to determine the size of the universe. The jets producing the radio lobes are not particularly powerful, giving the lobes a more diffuse, knotted structure due to interactions with the intergalactic medium.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the angular correlation function of radio {{sources in the}} 1. 4 GHz NVSS and FIRST surveys. Below 6 arcminutes w(theta) {{is dominated by the}} size distribution of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies.</b> A model of the size distribution of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> can account for this excess signal in w(theta). The amplitude of the cosmological clustering of radio sources is roughly constant at A 0. 001 from 3 to 40 mJy, but has increased to A 0. 007 at 200 mJy. This can be explained if powerful (FRII) <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> probe more massive structures at z 1 compared to average power <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> consistent with powerful high-z <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> generally having massive (forming) elliptical hosts in rich cluster environments. For FRIIs we derive a spatial (comoving) correlation length of r_ 0 = 14 ± 3 h^- 1 Mpc. This is close to that measured for extremely red objects (EROs) associated with a population of old elliptical galaxies at z 1 by Daddi et al. (2001). Based on their similar clustering properties, we propose that EROs and powerful <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> may be the same systems seen at different evolutionary stages. Their r_ 0 is 2 times higher than that of QSOs at a similar redshift, and comparable to that of bright ellipticals locally. This suggests that r_ 0 (comoving) of these galaxies has changed little from z 1 to z= 0, in agreement with current LCDM hierarchical models for clustering evolution of massive early-type galaxies. Alternatively, the clustering of <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{can be explained by the}} galaxy conservation model. This then implies that <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> of average power are the progenitors of the local early-type field population, while the most powerful <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies</b> will evolve into a present-day population with r_ 0 similar to that of local rich clusters.

In five galaxies H I absorption was detected. We investigate how the detection rate is distributed among <b>galaxies</b> with different <b>radio</b> and optical properties. Among the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I <b>radio</b> <b>galaxies,</b> only one object (10 % of total) was detected in H I absorption. The H I absorption in these objects is likely to come from a nuclear disk, as found for other galaxies of this type (e. g. NGC 4261 and Hydra A).
