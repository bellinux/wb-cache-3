5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a <b>radiopharmaceutical</b> to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E
5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as <b>radiopharmaceutical</b> agents in the nuclear {{medicine}} imaging known as gallium scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, gallium, selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. Gallium nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; gallium citrate, a <b>radiopharmaceutical,</b> facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
30|$|Preparation of <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> for {{clinical}} trials {{is a crucial}} activity for Nuclear Medicine community. In fact, nuclear medicine departments are involved in clinical trials on both diagnostic and therapeutic <b>radiopharmaceuticals,</b> {{and there is an}} emerging and growing demand for new <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> following the experimental phase for registration. This is particularly true for <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> with short half-lives that are suitable for use with positron emission tomography scanners. However, the fact that not all clinical centres in Europe are qualified for GMP preparation seriously limits the use of such <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> {{for clinical}} trials. Correct implementation of Regulation 536 / 2014 could partially overcome this hurdle, at least for diagnostic <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> to be employed in clinical trials.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol <b>radiopharmaceutical</b> with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E

30|$|Conclusion: The Law on {{medicinal}} products and medical devices of the Republic of Macedonia is completely {{in compliance with}} the EU regulative. But, {{it is obvious that the}} requirements used for non-radioactive drugs could not be applied directly to the <b>radiopharmaceuticals.</b> Several special characteristics of the <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> had to be taken into consideration. Keeping in mind that recently in Republic of Macedonia PET centre was established and we have our own production of radiopharmacuticals it is necessary to take some steps forward and make the effort to separate <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> from general legislation for {{medicinal products}}. Most requirements concerning documentation of the safety and efficacy of a non-radioactive drug must be also appled to <b>radiopharmaceuticals.</b> But, it must be recognised that <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> do not have a measurable pharmacodynamic effect. In the same time <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> have a changing composition with time due to the radioactive decay of the ultra-short lived radionculides, so sometimes it is impossible to perform quality control.|$|R

At the MUMC, a growing interest in performing in-house clinical trials with new <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> and in the synthesis of radiotherapeuticals led to the decision of upgrading the current Radiopharmacy facility. Several restrictions applied: <b>radiopharmaceuticals</b> will not be sold to third parties and the surface area of the entire facility is limited to 55 m 2 (including the production lab, QC lab and separate sluices for personnel and goods). Additionally, the facility had to allow both preparation of routine 99 mTc-compounds as well as GMP-grade <b>radiopharmaceuticals.</b> This study examines the time line of implementation for such a small scale facility and may be relevant to other hospitals considering to comply with this regulation.|$|R
