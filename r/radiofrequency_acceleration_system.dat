The LLRF system is implemented in mixed analogue and digital hardware modules using a custom form factor based on the VMEbus platform. The control system, from the crate controller CPU and timing modules, through the front-end software and communications middleware to the application software interface, is implemented using tools and components provided by the CERN accelerator controls group, such as the new Front-End Software Architecture (FESA).

This allows researchers to get a nuanced understanding of access behavior that is not offered by aggregate data. Second, we present some analysis on this dataset, which provides tangible evidence for describing the increasingly fragmented and personal nature of web access even in developing countries. Finally, based on lessons learned from the analysis, we provide some recommendations for building effective web acceleration mechanisms in the face of an increasingly personal web.
