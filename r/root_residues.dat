In the first experiment, the allelopathic potential of shoot residues was evaluated using the sandwich method. Each genotype residue (0. 4 g) {{was placed in}} a sterile Petri dish and two layers of agar were poured on that. Radish seeds were placed on agar medium. The radish seeds were cultivated without safflower residues as the controls. The length of the radicle, hypocotyl, and fresh biomass weight and seed germination percentages were measured. A pot experiment was also done on two genotypes with the highest and two with the lowest allelopathic activity selected after screening genotypes in the first experiment. Before entering the reproductive phase, irrigation treatments (normal irrigation and drought stress) were applied. Shoots were harvested, dried, milled and mixed with the topsoil of new pots and then radish seeds were sown. The pots with safflower genotypes were used to evaluate the effect of <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> allelopathy. The shoot length, fresh biomass weight, and germination percentage were measured. Different safflower genotypes showed varied allelopathic potential. The results of the first experiment showed that Egypt and Iran-Khorasan genotypes caused maximum inhibitory responses and Australia and Iran-Kerman genotypes resulted in minimum inhibitory responses on radish seedling growth. Fresh biomass weight had the most sensitivity to safflower residues. The results of the pot experiment were consistent with the results of in vitro experiments.

In a field experiment, the influence of two preceding cover crops, stooling rye and annual ryegrass, on the growth of maize and the weed Cyperus esculentus were compared with herbicides and weed control by hoeing. Maize emergence and early growth were delayed in the presence of physical residues of both cover crop species, especially in annual ryegrass residues. Growth of C. esculentus was significantly inhibited in the inter-row maize planting lines by the cover crops for the first 16 days after maize emergence, but this effect had diminished by day 28. In a pot experiment, the influence of the same two cover crops on maize and C. esculentus growth was evaluated together with oats and two additional annual ryegrass cultivars. Here the growth of maize and C. esculentus growth was suppressed, especially by the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of the annual ryegrass, in particular the cultivar Midmar. Chemical analysis of the leachate of the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> indicated the presence of phenolic acids and benzoxazolin- 2 (3 H) -one (BOA).

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{direct contact with}} the soil, roots are exposed to colonizing {{micro-organisms}} that persist after the plant has died. These micro-organisms may affect intrinsic root-chemical quality and the kinetics of root residue decomposition in soil, or interact with soil micro-organisms during the decomposition process. The aims in this work were i) to determine the interactions between the presence of root-colonizing micro-organisms and root-chemical quality and ii) to quantify the effect of these micro-organisms on root decomposition. Roots were selected from six maize genotypes cultivated in the field and harvested at physiological maturity. The roots of two genotypes (F 2 and F 2 bm 1) had a higher N content, lower neutral sugars content and higher Klason lignin content than the other genotypes (F 292, F 292 bm 3, Mexxal, Colombus). Location of the root residue micro-organisms by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots were more colonized than roots of the other genotypes. Electron Dispersive X-Ray microanalyses of in situ N confirmed a higher N content in the colonizing micro-organisms than in the root cell walls. Residues of F 2 and F 2 bm 1 roots decomposed more slowly {{and to a lesser extent}} than those of the other genotypes during incubation in a silty loam soil under controlled conditions (15 °C, - 80 kPa). After 49 days, 40. 6 % of the total C from F 292 was mineralized but only 20. 7 % of from F 2 bm 1. These results suggest that residue-colonizing micro-organisms decompose the cell-wall sugars to varying extents before soil decomposition thereby modifying the chemical quality of the residues and their mineralization pattern in soil. Due to their high N content, colonizing micro-organisms also impact on the total N content of <b>root</b> <b>residues,</b> reducing their C to N ratio. Gamma sterilized <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> were incubated under the same conditions as non-sterilized residues to see if micro-organisms colonizing <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> could modify the action of soil micro-organisms during decomposition.

The aqueous leachates of D. stramonium roots and shoot did not produc {{a significant effect on}} germination and shoot length of maize, but root length of maize was significantly reduced at the highest (1 / 1) D. stramonium roots leachate compared to control. From the other side, germination of sunflower was significantly reduced at the highest (1 / 1) D. stramonium shoot leachate concentration, but lower (1 / 5 and 1 / 2) D. stramonium roots leachate concentrations significantly increased root and shoot length of sunflower compared to control. In glasshouse experiment, no one treatment with different D. stramonium plant residues significantly affected density, height and fresh weight of maize plants compared to control.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{decomposition}} rates of shoot and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of perennial grasses. This knowledge is important to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of the grasses. An incubation experiment was carried out in a sandy clay loam with shoot and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of three native perennial grasses (Wallaby grass, Stipa sp. and Kangaroo grass) and the annual grass barley either separately or in mixtures of two residues. Respiration rate was measured over 18 days, and microbial C and available N were measured on days 0 and 18. Decomposition was lower for roots than for shoots and lower for residues of perennial grasses than for barley. Cumulative respiration was positively correlated with water-soluble C in the residues but not with residue C/N. In the mixtures, the measured cumulative respiration was higher than the expected value in five of the nine mixes usually where the differences in cumulative respiration between the individual residues were relatively small. Lower than expected cumulative respiration were found in two of the mixtures in which barley shoots (high cumulative respiration) were mixed with residues with low cumulative respiration. There was a negative correlation between the change in microbial biomass C concentration from day 0 to day 18 and cumulative respiration on day 18. In the amended soils, the available N concentration decreased from day 0 to day 18. It is concluded that the low decomposition rate of perennial grasses residues should favour C sequestration, but that mixing residues of similar decomposition rate may accelerate their decomposition.

In a field experiment the influence of two cover crops, Secale cereale (stooling rye), and Lolium multiflorum (annual ryegrass), on the growth of Zea mays (maize) and C. esculentus (yellow nutsedge) was compared to the latter crop and weed’s growth at three control treatments which involved weed residues left on the soil surface, application of herbicides and weed control by hoeing. Maize emergence and growth were delayed {{in the presence of}} residues of both cover crop species, especially in annual ryegrass residues. C. esculentus growth was significantly inhibited in the area between the maize planting rows by the cover crops for the first 14 days after maize emergence, but this growth suppressing effect diminished after 28 days. In a controlled environment study, the influence of the same cover crops, together with Avena sativa (oats) and three cultivars of annual ryegrass were evaluated. Maize and C. esculentus growth were suppressed, especially by the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> of the cover crops with the annual ryegrass cultivar ‘Midmar’ being the most suppressive. Chemical analysis of the leachate of <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> indicated the presence of phenolic acids and benzoxazolin- 2 (3 H) -one (BOA).

In an integrated weed management approach a possible reduction in the type and number of herbicide applications required for effective weed control, could be implemented.

Litterbags containing vetch or rye <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> {{were buried in}} soil at {{the same day as}} either vetch or rye winter catch crops were incorporated into the field soil from which the materials were gathered. The litterbags were sampled after 6 weeks in the field. In vetch, bacterial and fungal biomasses were similar whereas fungi dominated microbial biomass in rye. The biomass of the bacterial consuming fauna dominated by nematodes and microarthropods was similar to the biomass of bacteria in vetch as opposed to in rye where bacterivore biomass was lower than bacterial biomass. This suggests a much higher bacterial production in vetch compared to rye. Furthermore, in vetch dauer larvae of bacteria feeding nematodes prevailed, which is also a sign of high bacterial production followed by food shortage for the bacterivores. Bacterivorous and predatory nematodes with capability of consuming protozoa showed an inverse relationship to flagellated protozoa. This suggests that these nematodes controlled the protozoan biomass constituting a lower fraction of the bacterivore biomass in vetch compared to in rye. Such intraguild predator–prey relationship is therefore indicated for microbivorous organisms among bacterivorous and predatory nematodes (the intraguild predator) protozoa (the intraguild prey) and bacteria (the common prey). The much higher fungal biomass in rye than in vetch litterbags was not reflected in the biomass of the fungal feeders. Due to the generally lower intrinsic rate of increase of the fungivores, {{as well as of the}} omnivores and predators, in comparison with the bacterial feeders, they were not able to generate dense populations at this early stage of decomposition...|$|E

We studied how temporal variation of legume <b>root</b> <b>residue</b> δ 15 N could be explained by considering differential decomposition kinetics and 15 N content of residue fractions. A mathematical model on the isotopic patterns of soil and a N recipient plant during root decomposition was developed and applied for testing assumptions about residue characteristics against two experimental datasets. Observed 15 N patterns of the recipient plants could be satisfactorily simulated only when the residue was assumed to consist of at least two fractions with distinct δ 15 N and decomposition rates depending on their C[*]:[*]N ratio. Assuming δ 15 N of residue constant over time resulted in substantial underestimates of N derived from low-quality residue (%Ndfr) by the recipient plant when compared with experimental data.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate soil biological and chemical factors that give rise to cereal yield enhancing effects of legume rotations on sandy, nutrient poor West African soils. The aim was not only to gain more information on the role of legume residues and microorganisms in the soil nutrient cycle. But the study aimed at evaluating if differences in substrate qualities (e. g. <b>root</b> <b>residues)</b> cause changes in the microbial community structure due to specific and highly complex microbe-root-soil interactions. Site and system specific reactions of microorganisms towards rewetting, simulating the onset of rainy season, were observed. Higher respiration rates, higher amounts of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) as well as higher ergosterol, muramic acid, glucosamine and adenylate concentrations were measured in CL soils of Koukombo and in both soils from Fada. The immediate increase in ATP concentrations after rewetting was likely caused by rehydration of microbial cells where N was not immobilized and, thus, available for plants facilitating their rapid development. Legume <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> led only to slightly better plant performances compared to the control, while the application of cereal roots reduced seedling growth. In contrast to sorghum seedlings, the microbial community did not react to the mineral treatment. Thus the energy supply in form of organic amendments increased microbial indices compared to mineral P application and the control. The results of basal respiration rates, Cmic and Corg levels indicate that the microbial community in the soil from Koukombo is less efficient in substrate use compared to microorganisms in the soil from Fada. However, the continuous carbon input by legume <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> might have contributed to these differences in soil fertility. With the 33 P isotopic exchange method a low buffering capacity was detected in both soils irrespective of treatments. Calculated E values (E 1 min to E 1 min- 1 d and E 1 d- 3 m) indicated a slowly release of P due to root turnover while applied mineral P is taken up by plants or fixed to the soil. Due to the fact that sorghum growth reacted mainly to the application of mineral P and the microorganisms solely to the organic inputs, the combination of both amendments seems to be the best approach to a sustainable increase of crop production on many nutrient-poor, sandy West African soils. In a pot experiment, were CC and CL soils from Fada and Koukombo were adjusted to the same level of P and N concentrations, crop growth was significantly higher on CL soils, compared to the respective treatments on CC soils. Mycorrhizal infection of roots was increased and the number of nematodes, predominantly free living nematodes, was almost halfed on rotation soils. In conclusion, increased nutrient availability (especially P and N) through the introduction of legumes is not the only reason for the observed yield increasing effects. Soil biological factors seem to also play an important role. In a root chamber experiment the pH gradient along the root-soil-interface was measured at three times using an antimony microelectrode. For Fada soils, pH values were higher on CL than CC soils while the opposite was true for the Koukombo soils. Site-specific differences between Fada and Koukombo soils in N content and microbial community structures might have created varying crop performances leading to the contrasting pH findings. However, the mechanisms involved in this highly complex microbe-root-soil interaction remain unclear. This study was financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG, BU 1308 / 4 - 1...|$|E
30|$|The soil {{property}} that increases PR dissolution and its availability to plants is soil organic matter. This seems to arise from (i) the high {{cation exchange capacity}} of organic matter, (ii) the formation of Ca organic matter complexes, and (iii) organic acids dissolving PR and blocking soil P sorption sites. At the point when arable crops are harvested, an expansive extent of the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> and at times some portion of the over the ground parcels are abandoned in soil. The deterioration of plant buildups in soil brings about the creation of various natural acids, for example, oxalic, citrus, and tartaric acids. These acids can be relied upon to break up PR by providing the hydrogen particles expected to neutralize the hydroxyl ions delivered when PR disintegrates and by forming complex with cations, particularly the Ca from PRs. The natural particles and humus can likewise diminish P sorption limit of soils by blocking P sorption destinations and by forming complex with iron and aluminum hydrous oxides, prompting increased P concentration in solution (Zapata and Roy 2004).|$|E

The N 2 adsorption isotherm follows either the Freundlich law KFP which is the small equation limit of a Weibull shaped isotherm or the classical BET isotherm. The surface area of the activated carbons are determined using the BET method. The KF value is proportional to the BET surface area. The value increases slightly when the burn-off increases and also when there is a clear increase in the micropore distribution widt...|$|R
50|$|A hoe is {{an ancient}} and {{versatile}} agricultural and horticultural hand tool used to shape soil, remove weeds, clear soil, and harvest root crops. Shaping the soil includes piling soil {{around the base of}} plants (hilling), digging narrow furrows (drills) and shallow trenches for planting seeds or bulbs. Weeding with a hoe includes agitating the surface of the soil or cutting foliage from roots, and clearing soil of old <b>roots</b> and crop <b>residues.</b> Hoes for digging and moving soil are used to harvest root crops such as potatoes.|$|R
40|$|The {{cotton growing}} in Turkey has {{monoculture}} system and any crop is not grown in approximately five months between two cotton growing which caused lower seed cotton yield, poor lint quality and early leaf senescence. The influences of different tillage systems and winter cover crops on cotton lint yield and quality were evaluated in Aegean Region of Turkey during two cotton-growing seasons. In second year {{compared to the}} first year, the dry matter yield of cover crop <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> increased by 40 % in conventional tillage system and 60 % in no tillage system. Similar increases were also determined for residue organic matter yield in soil. Dry matter and organic matter in soil harvest residues were higher in conventional tillage system as compared to no tillage system. Among cover crop treatments common vetch + oat and hairy vetch + oat mixtures provided the highest dry matter and organic matter in soil harvest residues. Cotton lint yield and quality were not affected by cover crop treatments and tillage systems. Also, tillage by cover crop interactions was non-significant for cotton lint yield and quality. During the observations at 50 % boll opening period of cotton, it was monitored that leaf senescence decreased under no-tillage cotton production system in both years...|$|E
40|$|Incorporation {{of plant}} {{residues}} strongly enhances the methane production and emission from flooded rice fields. Temperature and residue type are important factors that regulate residue decomposition and CH 4 production. However, {{the response of}} the methanogenic archaeal community to these factors in rice field soil is not well understood. In the present experiment, the structure of the archaeal community was determined during the decomposition of rice root and straw residues in anoxic rice field soil incubated at three temperatures (15 °C, 30 °C, and 45 °C). More CH 4 was produced in the straw treatment than root treatment. Increasing the temperature from 15 °C to 45 °C enhanced CH 4 production. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses in combination with cloning and sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed that Methanosarcinaceae developed early in the incubations, whereas Methanosaetaceae became more abundant in the later stages. Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae seemed to be better adapted at 15 °C and 30 °C, respectively, while the thermophilic Methanobacteriales and rice cluster I methanogens were significantly enhanced at 45 °C. Straw residues promoted the growth of Methanosarcinaceae, whereas the <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> favored Methanosaetaceae. In conclusion, our study revealed a highly dynamic structure of the methanogenic archaeal community during plant residue decomposition. The in situ concentration of acetate (and possibly of H 2) seems to be the key factor that regulates the shift of methanogenic community...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{management}} and crop rotation can directly affect the soil microbial community. This study aimed at determining soil quality indicators and soilborne fungi in a no-tillage system. A randomized blocks design, in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, was used. Three cover crops (palisade grass, millet and common bean) provided straw and <b>root</b> <b>residues</b> {{to the following}} crops of corn and soybean. The common bean-soybean sequence provided little soil covering and higher metabolic quotient and soil basal respiration and total enzymatic activity, {{as well as a}} general increase of soilborne fungi. The principal component analysis revealed that 76. 61 % of the variance {{can be explained by the}} three first components, with cover crops, soil basal respiration and metabolic quotient regarded as the main qualitative and quantitative sources of variance in the first component. Carbon from the microbial biomass was the soil quality indicator best correlated to crop yield and negatively correlated to Fusarium solani density. The Rhizoctonia solani population was correlated with higher metabolic quotient and soil total enzymatic activity and basal respiration. The palisade grass crop favored soil fungistasis and enhancement of antagonist Trichoderma spp. populations. The multivariate approach demonstrated the association of soil fungi with soil quality indicators, as well as a higher influence of cover crops on the variance observed, in comparison to cash crops...|$|E
30|$|Graphite oxide (GO) {{required}} for the preparation of SP-HRG was synthesized according to our previously reported method [61]. Initially, as-prepared graphite oxide or GO (200  mg) was dispersed in 40  mL of DI water and sonicated for 30  min to obtain graphene oxide (GRO) sheets. The resulting suspension was taken in a round bottom flask mounted with a cooling condenser, which is heated to 100  °C. Subsequently, 10  mL of an aqueous solution of the root extract (0.1  g mL− 1) {{was added to the}} suspension, which was then allowed to stir for 24  h at 98  °C. After this, black powder of highly reduced graphene oxide (PE-HRG- 1) was collected by filtration, which was further washed with DI water several times to remove the excess <b>root</b> extract <b>residue</b> and redistributed into water for sonication. This suspension was centrifuged at 4000  rpm for another 30  min. Subsequently, the supernatant was thrown out and the precipitate was collected and dried in vacuum.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of our {{numerical}} computations, we make many new observations on primitive roots modulo primes. For example, we conjecture that for any odd prime $p$ there is a primitive root $g 0 $, and that for any prime $p> 3 $ there is a prime $q 3 $ there exists a Fibonacci number $F_k<p/ 2 $ which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$. This implies that there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to find square <b>roots</b> of quadratic <b>residues</b> modulo an odd prime $p$. Comment: 13 pages.

30|$|After {{release from}} plant <b>roots,</b> {{glyphosate}} <b>residues</b> {{come into contact}} with an immensely diverse community of microbial species dwelling in the root zone or rhizosphere. Microbial responses to glyphosate vary considerably between species. Some species possess GS forms of microbial EPSPS and suffer metabolic disruptions following exposure to GBHs [34]. Sensitive portions of the ubiquitous rhizosphere biota include some Pseudomonas species and some species of Mn-reducing bacteria [35 – 37], as well as some species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) [38 – 40] and symbiotic N-fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroides within soybean nodules [34]. The above are usually regarded as beneficial organisms. It is noteworthy that, in contrast, some potentially phytopathogenic species express relatively glyphosate-tolerant forms of the EPSPS enzyme (including some Fusarium, Pythium and Rhizoctonia spp.) and are unharmed or even stimulated in response to treatment of plants with GBHs [41, 42]. These differential impacts are of considerable concern, since they may cause alterations to microbial community dynamics that may, in turn, impact negatively upon the health and productivity of crops.|$|R
