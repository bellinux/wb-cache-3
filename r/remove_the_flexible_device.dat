40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple {{strategy}} to fabricate flexible {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} {{involves the use of}} photoanodes based on TiO 2 nanotube (TNT) arrays with rear illumination. The TNT films (tube length ∼ 35 μm) were produced via anodization, and sensitized with N 719 dye for photovoltaic characterization. Pt counter electrodes of two types were used: a conventional FTO/glass substrate for a device of rigid type and an ITO/PEN substrate for a <b>device</b> of <b>flexible</b> type. These DSSC devices were fabricated into either a single-cell structure (active area 3. 6 × 0. 5 cm 2) or a parallel module containing three single cells (total active area 5. 4 cm 2). <b>The</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>devices</b> exhibit remarkable performance with efficiencies η = 5. 40 % (single cell) and 4. 77 % (parallel module) of power conversion, which outperformed their rigid counterparts with η = 4. 87 % (single cell) and 4. 50 % (parallel model) under standard one-sun irradiation. <b>The</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>device</b> had a greater efficiency of conversion of incident photons to current and a broader spectral range than the rigid device; a thinner electrolyte layer for <b>the</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>device</b> than for <b>the</b> rigid device is a key factor to improve the light-harvesting ability for the TNT-DSSC device with rear illumination. Measurements of electrochemical impedance spectra show excellent catalytic activity and superior diffusion characteristics for <b>the</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>device.</b> This technique thus provides a new option to construct <b>flexible</b> photovoltaic <b>devices</b> with large-scale, light-weight, and cost-effective advantages for imminent applications in consumer electronics...|$|R

A buffer layer inserted between the ITO and PET substrate with an optimized Young’s modulus and film thickness is suggested so that, according to theoretical calculations, the stress in the ITO layer can be reduced by up to 60 %. Finally <b>the</b> <b>flexible</b> OLED <b>devices</b> were fabricated and their electroluminescence (EL) was measured when the OLED layers were applied with a tensile strain and compressive strain.
