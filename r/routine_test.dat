5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a <b>routine</b> <b>test.</b> The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E

Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able {{as a matter of}} routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a <b>routine</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Routine</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{practice}} whereby medical professionals ask all patients {{whether they would}} like an HIV test, regardless of whether there is anything unique to a given patient that suggests the presence of HIV. In three respects I aim to offer a fresh perspective on the debate about whether a developing country with {{a high rate of}} HIV infection morally ought to adopt <b>routine</b> <b>testing.</b> First, I present a neat framework that organises the moral issues at stake, bringing out the basic principles involved and exhibiting their logical relationships. Second, appealing to the Kantian principle of respect for the dignity of persons, I offer a thorough justification for <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> when it serves as a gateway to anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Third, I present a respect-based defence of the controversial and novel thesis that <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> is morally justified even if ART is unaffordable or otherwise unavailable...|$|R
40|$|Tests by counter-immunoelectrophoresis for {{antibody}} to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) {{were introduced}} into a <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> programme {{for evidence of}} hepatitis B virus infection.

The sensitivity and specificity of the test were assessed and correlations made with the presence of HBsAg. The presence of anti-HBc was very useful in the interpretation of a doubtful positive result for HBsAg in the haemagglutination test. With very few exceptions the serum samples positive for HBsAg by <b>routine</b> <b>tests</b> also contained anti-HBc.

25|$|A stool {{culture can}} detect the bacterium, {{although}} it is not a <b>routine</b> <b>test</b> and so must be specifically requested. The sample is cultured on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, or the variant cefixime potassium tellurite sorbitol-MacConkey agar (CT-SMAC). On SMAC agar O157 colonies appear clear due to their inability to ferment sorbitol, while the colonies of the usual sorbitol-fermenting serotypes of E. coli appear red. Sorbitol nonfermenting colonies are tested for the somatic O157 antigen before being confirmed as E. coli O157. Like all cultures, diagnosis is time-consuming with this method; swifter diagnosis is possible using quick E. coli DNA extraction method plus PCR techniques. Newer technologies using fluorescent and antibody detection are also under development.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a preventable disease {{that can have}} improved outcomes with early diagnosis and treatment. The CDC recommends that HIV testing be incorporated into clinical settings as part of routine medical care. Methods: Individual, open-ended {{interviews were conducted with}} primary care providers and administrators to obtain their views regarding the meaning of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> and the barriers and facilitators to implementing <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> in their respective practices. Results: Most respondents supported <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing,</b> although their definitions of routine varied. Barriers for providers included time and financial constraints to appropriately conduct HIV counseling and testing and inadequate HIV education and training. Facilitators for implementing <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> included patients’ feelings of empowerment and reduced HIV stigma. Conclusions: The implementation of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> in primary care practices appears to be an acceptable public health intervention. Next steps should include efforts to standardize the definition of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> and working with primary care settings to better understand and reduce barriers to <b>routine</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> is an {{essential}} approach to identifying undiagnosed infections, linking people to care and treatment, and preventing new infections. In Washington, DC, where HIV prevalence is 2. 4 %, a combination of <b>routine</b> and targeted <b>testing</b> approaches has been implemented since 2006. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health's routine and targeted HIV testing implementation strategies. We collected HIV testing data from 3 types of DC Department of Health-funded testing sites (clinics, hospitals, and community-based organizations); collected testing and labor costs; and calculated effectiveness measures including cost per new diagnosis and cost per averted transmission. Compared to <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> targeted testing resulted in higher positivity rates (1. 33 % vs. 0. 44 %). <b>Routine</b> <b>testing</b> averted 34. 30 transmissions per year compared to targeted testing at 17. 78. The cost per new diagnosis was lower for targeted testing ($ 2, 467 vs. $ 7, 753 per new diagnosis) as was the cost per transmission averted ($ 33, 160 vs. $ 104, 205). When stratified by testing site, both testing approaches were most cost effective in averting new transmissions when conducted by community based organizations ($ 25, 037 routine; $ 33, 123 targeted) compared to hospitals or clinics. While <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> identified more newly diagnosed infections and averted more infections than targeted testing, targeted testing is more cost effective per diagnosis and per transmission averted overall. Given the high HIV prevalence in DC, the DC Department of Health's implementation strategy should continue to encourage <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> implementation with emphasis on a combined testing strategy among community-based organizations...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} impact of <b>routine</b> antenatal HIV <b>testing</b> for {{preventing}} mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in urban Zimbabwe. Methods Community counsellors were trained in <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing</b> policy using a specific training module from June 2005 through November 2005. Key outcomes during the first 6 months of <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> were compared with the prior 6 -month “opt-in ” period, and clients were interviewed. Findings Of the 4551 women presenting for antenatal care during the first 6 months of <b>routine</b> HIV <b>testing,</b> 4547 (99. 9 %) were tested for HIV compared with 3058 (65 %) of 4700 women during the last 6 months of the opt-in testing (P < 0. 001), with a corresponding increase in the numbers of HIV-infected women identified antenatally (926 compared with 513, P < 0. 001). During <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> more HIV-infected women collected results compared to the opt-in testing (908 compared with 487, P < 0. 001) resulting in a significant increase in deliveries by HIV-infected women (256 compared with 186, P = 0. 001); more mother/infant pairs received antiretroviral prophylaxis (n = 256) compared to the opt-in testing (n = 185); and more mother/infant pairs followed up at clinics (105 compared with 49, P = 0. 002). Women were satisfied with counselling services and most (89 %) stated that offering <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> is helpful.

40|$|The recent severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) outbreak {{resulted in}} {{calls for an}} accurate diagnostic test that can be used not only for <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> but also for generating nucleotide sequences to monitor the epidemic. Although the identity of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome was confirmed by DNA sequencing, it is impractical to sequence the entire 29 -kb SARS-CoV genome on a routine basis. Therefore, alternative assay methods such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR have been pursued for <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> primarily to resolve probable cases. We report here a modification of standard DNA sequencing technology for accurate identification of SARS-CoV in <b>routine</b> <b>testing.</b> Instead of requiring the sequencing of the whole SARS-CoV genome, our modification enables the simultaneous sequencing of three regions of the SARS-CoV genome, the spike protein-encoding gene (35 nucleotides), gene M (43 nucleotides), and gene N (45 nucleotides), in a single electropherogram. Comparing these nucleotide sequences to DNA databank entries (National Institutes of Health) conclusively identified them as SARS-CoV sequences...|$|R

40|$|The Botswana {{government}} recently {{implemented a}} policy of routine or "opt-out" HIV testing {{in response to the}} high prevalence of HIV infection, estimated at 37 % of adults. We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study of 1, 268 adults from five districts in Botswana to assess knowledge of and attitudes toward <b>routine</b> <b>testing,</b> correlates of HIV testing, and barriers and facilitators to testing, 11 months after the introduction of this policy. Most participants (81 %) reported being extremely or very much in favor of <b>routine</b> <b>testing.</b> The majority believed that this policy would decrease barriers to testing (89 %), HIV-related stigma (60 %), and violence toward women (55 %), and would increase access to antiretroviral treatment (93 %). At the same time, 43 % of participants believed that <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> would lead people to avoid going to the doctor for fear of testing, and 14 % believed that this policy could increase gender-based violence related to testing. The prevalence of self-reported HIV testing was 48 %. Adjusted correlates of testing included female gender (AOR = 1. 5, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 1. 9), higher education (AOR = 2. 0, 95 % CI = 1. 5 - 2. 7), more frequent healthcare visits (AOR = 1. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 2. 7), perceived access to HIV testing (AOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 2. 5), and inconsistent condom use (AOR = 1. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 2. 1). Individuals with stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV and AIDS were less likely to have been tested for HIV/AIDS (AOR = 0. 7, 95 % CI = 0. 5 - 0. 9) or to have heard of <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> (AOR = 0. 59, 95 % CI = 0. 45 - 0. 76). While experiences with voluntary and <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> overall were positive, 68 % felt that they could not refuse the HIV test. Key barriers to testing included fear of learning one's status (49 %), lack of perceived HIV risk (43 %), and fear of having to change sexual practices with a positive HIV <b>test</b> (33 %). <b>Routine</b> <b>testing</b> appears to be widely supported and may reduce barriers to testing in Botswana. As <b>routine</b> <b>testing</b> is adopted elsewhere, measures should be implemented to assure true informed consent and human rights safeguards, including protection from HIV-related discrimination and protection of women against partner violence related to testing...|$|R
