50|$|Any {{electromagnetic}} relay {{has a certain}} level of isolation between the input and output circuits. However, in ordinary relays, this function is not prevalent and, hence, not considered in the existing system of <b>relay</b> classification. In <b>interface</b> <b>relays,</b> however, the property of galvanic isolation (decoupling) between the input and output circuits is significantly bolstered, and parameters of the galvanic isolation have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay.

40|$|This {{software}} {{provides a}} new capability for landed Mars assets to perform forward link relay through the Mars Express (MEX) European Union orbital spacecraft. It solves {{the problem of}} standardizing the <b>relay</b> <b>interface</b> between lander missions and MEX. The Mars Operations Relay Service (MaROS) is intended as a central point for relay planning and post-pass analysis for all Mars landed and orbital assets. Through the first two phases of implementation, MaROS supports relay coordination through the Odyssey orbiter and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). With this new software, MaROS now fully integrates the Mars Express spacecraft into the relay picture. This new software generates and manages {{a new set of}} file formats that allows for relay request to MEX for forward and return link relay, including the parameters specific to MEX. Existing MEX relay planning interactions were performed via email exchanges and point-to-point file transfers. By integrating MEX into MaROS, all transactions are managed by a centralized service for tracking and analysis. Additionally, all lander missions have a single, shared interface with MEX and do not have to integrate on a mission-by mission basis. Relay is a critical element of Mars lander data management. Landed assets depend largely upon orbital relay for data delivery, which can be impacted by the availability and health of each orbiter in the network. At any time, an issue may occur to prevent relay. For this reason, it is imperative that all possible orbital assets be integrated into the overall relay picture...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The {{principal}} {{reasons for}} the development of a prototype improved control system are the high maintenance costs and unreliability of Spoomet's fleet of class 6 E/ 6 E 1 resistor technology electric main line locomotives. These factors may largely be attributed to two fundamental shortcomings of the existing locomotive control systems, namely the lack of inherent feedback and application of inconsequent control practices during acceleration from standstill. The improved control system features the application of a rule based fuzzy controller, implementing human skill and experience to control tractive effort of a resistor technology main line locomotive. The aim of the fuzzy controller is to accelerate the train from standstill to approximately 35 km/h, smoothly and safely. The prototype fuzzy controller was implemented with a personal computer using an advanced fuzzy logic development system. A simulation model was developed for the locomotive and the load. This model was used to first test the structure of the controller and the initial rule blocks. Following the verification of the fuzzy rules on the simulation model, a <b>relay</b> <b>interface</b> was developed to implement the operation of the control system in coupled mode with the existing control system on a locomotive. The interactive fine-tuning and evaluation of the fuzzy rules were performed during this phase of the development. The test results include the successful evaluation of the prototype fuzzy controller under a variety of typical and "worst case" operating conditions, as well as under conditions of wheel slip. The industrialisation and long term considerations for continued development of the fuzzy logic controller are described in the conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Digital {{technology}} has advanced very significantly {{over the years}} {{both in terms of}} software tools and hardware available. It is now applied extensively in many area of electrical engineering including protective relaying in power systems. Digital relays have many advantages over the traditional analog relays. The digital relay is able to do what is difficult or impossible in the analog relays. However, the complex algorithms associated with the digital relays are difficult to test and verify in real time on real power systems. Although non real-time simulators like PSCAD/EMTDC are employed to test the algorithms, such simulations have the disadvantage that they cannot test the relay dynamically. Hence, real-time simulators like RTDS are used, but the latter needs large space and it is very expensive. This paper uses EMTP MODELS to simulate the power system and the distance relay. The distance relay algorithm is constructed and the distance <b>relay</b> is <b>interfaced</b> with a test power system. The distance relay’s performance is then assessed interactively under various fault types, fault distances and fault inception angles.

5000|$|It is {{agreed that}} the most {{important}} characteristic of opto-electronic systems is their noise robustness and insensitivity to electromagnetic fields. What is not considered, however, is that, in addition to the fiber optic line and the output actuator, such a system includes the source of light pulses on the transmitting side and the amplifier on the receiving side that are generally based on micro-circuitry. It is precisely these elements, with low trigger levels, that get damaged by pulse noise (interference, voltage spikes and discharges) of the high voltage power equipment, which negates the main advantage of opto-electronic systems. Moreover, the optical fibers themselves are subject to a severe negative effect of ionizing radiation and external mechanical impacts (which is critically important in military applications).

40|$|Performance {{testing of}} the {{protection}} relays ensures that a particular protection scheme will operate reliably and fast enough to disconnect a faulty zone {{from the rest of}} the network, thus mitigating the effect of fault on the power system. It is therefore important to validate the settings of power protection equipment and to confirm its performance when subject to different fault conditions. Traditionally, commissioning engineers make use of standalone protection relay test sets for analyzing the performance of relays when subjected to different voltage and current injections. With the advent of digital simulators the model of the power system can be executed in real-time and protection <b>relays</b> can be <b>interfaced</b> as hardware-in-the-loop to evaluate their performance when subjected to different faults in the simulated power system. This gives an added value of analyzing the overall behavior of the power system coupled with the relay performance under faulty conditions. In addition, the utilization of GOOSE messages for status, control and protection purposes puts an extra requirement to completely test the IEC 61850 capabilities of the protection relays. This article illustrates two different techniques namely standalone testing and real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing used for protection relays performance verification. Both techniques are evaluated for hardwired and IEC 61850 - 8 - 1 (GOOSE) signals. The instantaneous overcurrent protection feature of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories Relay SEL- 421 is used for complete standalone and RT-HIL testing. For RT-HIL testing, the test case is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and executed in real-time using Opal-RT's eMEGAsim real-time simulator. The event reports generated by standalone and RT-HIL testing for both hardwired and GOOSE signals is used to verify the tripping times achieved.

40|$|In a free-space optical {{communication}} system, the mitigation of transient outages through {{the incorporation of}} error-control methods is of particular concern, the outages being caused by scintillation fades and obscurants. The focus of this innovative technology {{is the development of}} a data relay system for a reliable high-data-rate free-spacebased optical-transport network. The data relay boards will establish the link, maintain synchronous connection, group the data into frames, and provide for automatic retransmission (ARQ) of lost or erred frames. A certain Quality of Service (QoS) can then be ensured, compatible with the required data rate. The protocol to be used by the data relay system is based on the draft CCSDS standard data-link protocol Proximity- 1, selected by orbiters to multiple lander assets in the Mars network, for example. In addition to providing data-link protocol capabilities for the free-space optical link and buffering the data, the data <b>relay</b> system will <b>interface</b> directly with user applications over Gigabit Ethernet and/or with highspeed storage resources via Fibre Channel.

30|$|In {{finite element}} (FE) based {{solution}} schemes, such problems are generally tackled using cohesive zones [12, 13], see Fig.  1 (a_ 1,a_ 2,a_ 3). Interfaces are identified a priori and interface elements are introduced at these physical locations. This is possible since the FE discretisation {{is made to}} conform to the sharp interfaces. The opening behaviour of these interface elements is governed by a traction-separation law (TSL) that is assigned to them. FFT based spectral methods, however, rely on a regular grid and a method to include sub-dimensional (e.g. planar in 3 D) elements cannot be used. Composite pixel based approaches, for example [14], which make use of the interface normal to assign homogenised mechanical properties to grid points near the interfaces, are a step in that direction. But at this point {{it is not clear how}} they will perform in situations of damaging interfaces that are inclined or curved. The high mechanical contrast combined with inherent pixelation effects of FFT may cause stresses <b>relayed</b> across damaging <b>interfaces,</b> which is undesirable for the modelling of cracks. This limitation is dealt with using the idea of an interphase (volumetric) band, as depicted in Fig.  1 (b_ 1,b_ 2,b_ 3). The material points in the vicinity of the sharp interface are identified and furnished with a damage constitutive behaviour (softening) and corresponding kinematics—in addition to the deformation mechanisms attributed to them as a part of the respective grains they belong to. We aim to have multiple points across the thickness of the interphase. We expect this to reduce the pixelation effect and ensure that the two crack faces are fully decoupled. This approach allows capturing the interfacial mechanics and still benefits from the computational (memory and speed) and implementation related advantages of FFT based methods. Such an approach to represent interfaces as interphase has been used previously in the literature. Hsueh-Hung et al. [15] used it to assign different material behaviour to grain boundary regions than the bulk. Their approach was physically motivated and directed towards understanding metal plasticity in the nanocrystalline regime. Clayton et al. [16] used this approach within a finite element implementation of phase field damage to understand the competition between intergranular and intragranular damage.|$|R
