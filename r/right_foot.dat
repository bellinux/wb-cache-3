5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand.

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown with her <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali {{with her left}} foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E

5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime.
