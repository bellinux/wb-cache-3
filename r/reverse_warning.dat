50|$|The Corniche II {{name was}} applied for the United States market from 1986 and for other markets from 1988. Anti-lock brakes were added for 1988, but air bags would not be {{available}} until the Corniche III. Also new for 1988 were some detail changes to the interior. Later in 1988 {{there was also a}} new <b>reverse</b> <b>warning</b> lens type and pattern around the rear license plate, as well as newly designed seats and redesigned instrumentation.|$|E

The bus (the result of a survey of 31000 schools) was unveiled at the 1998 British Motor Show, and professional driver training for 3 drivers was also free with {{the purchase of the}} vehicle, making it gain a reputation as the 'king of the primary schools'.|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} ultrasonic <b>reverse</b> <b>warning</b> {{system is}} a new system that can assist drivers while car is braking. It is includes ultrasonic emitter and receiver that can producing and receiving the ultrasonic waves to determine the distance between car and obstacle. But {{it is not good}} enough for the safety of cars, in this paper, we are meant to design a system that can help drivers stop the car automatically, an electronic circuit was constructed. According to this circuit we design, a signal was produced to the braking system of car based on the distance between car and obstacle for a safe braking purpose. Error is also discussed and during the experiment, the improvement for the original system has also achieved...|$|E

50|$|Residents of an {{affected}} community {{might be}} informed that shelter in place is being implemented through the news media, Emergency Alert System, <b>Reverse</b> 911, <b>warning</b> sirens or horns, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather reports, and announcements from {{vehicles equipped with}} public address systems. In the United States, facilities like nuclear power plants are required to be equipped with audio alert systems that can be heard within a 10 mi radius.|$|R
5000|$|In {{light of}} Zimbabwe's {{dramatic}} inflation rate, Mugabe massively raised {{the salaries of}} members of the security forces in February, and on 10 March he approved raises for teachers and civil servants. At around the same time, he signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Bill, which requires all businesses to be majority owned (at least 51%) by black Zimbabweans. Mugabe subsequently accused business of raising prices to nullify the benefit of the pay raises, demanding that the price increases be <b>reversed</b> and <b>warning</b> that [...] "profiteering" [...] white-owned businesses would be taken over by the government.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 October 1996, Leyte Gulf {{collided}} with the , [...] while conducting operations {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. The incident occurred as the carrier, without prior <b>warning,</b> <b>reversed</b> her engines while Leyte Gulf was behind her and slammed into the cruisers bow. There were no personnel casualties or injuries reported, and damage to the Leyte was only $2 million.|$|R
50|$|But in 2017, {{speaking}} at a Supreme People's Court meeting on January 14, Zhou appeared to <b>reverse</b> course, <b>warning</b> the courts against the 'idea of judicial independence'. He said: courts must firmly resist the western idea of “constitutional democracy”, “separation of powers” and “judicial independence”. These are erroneous western notions that threaten {{the leadership of the}} ruling Communist Party and defame the Chinese socialist path on the rule of law. We have to raise our flag and show our sword to struggle against such thoughts. We must not fall into the trap of western thoughts and judicial independence. We must stay firm on the Chinese socialist path on the rule of law.|$|R

In 1992, he had a show at the Randy Alexander gallery. Work included a stained orthopedic mattress covered with dildos, a medical model of a diseased scrotum, a prosthetic leg brace attached to a three legged chair, and a wheelchair balanced {{on top of an}} aluminum stepladder, the latter piece representing shamanism. Critic Gretchen Faust wrote, [...] "There is a quirky humor underlying the work that <b>reverses</b> without <b>warning</b> into a strange and cutting malevolence". In December that year, in a group show, Fever, at Exit Art in New York, he exhibited a leg brace resting on a three-legged chair.|$|R
50|$|On 14 October 1996, USS Theodore Roosevelt {{collided}} with USS Leyte Gulf the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, while conducting operations {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. The incident occurred as the carrier, without prior <b>warning,</b> <b>reversed</b> her engines while Leyte Gulf was behind her and slammed into the cruiser's bow. There were no personnel casualties or injuries reported, but the Roosevelt suffered more than $7 million damage to the stern of the Roosevelt and $2 million damage to the Leyte Gulf's bow in collision damage.|$|R
50|$|A self-defeating prophecy can be {{the result}} of {{rebellion}} to the prediction. If the audience of a prediction has an interest in seeing it falsified, and its fulfillment depends on their actions or inaction, their actions upon hearing it will make the prediction less plausible. If a prediction is made with this outcome specifically in mind, it is commonly referred to as <b>reverse</b> psychology or <b>warning.</b> Also, when working to make a premonition come true, one can inadvertently change the circumstances so much that the prophecy cannot come true.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{typically}} include headlamps {{and tail}} lights. Headlamps are white or selective yellow lights {{placed in the}} front of the vehicle, designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible. Many manufactures are turning to LED headlights as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional headlamps. Tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle's direction of travel to following drivers. White rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle's transmission has been placed in the <b>reverse</b> gear, <b>warning</b> anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards, or about to do so. Flashing turn signals on the front, side, and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction. In the late 1950s, some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements.|$|R
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. <b>Reverse</b> thrust <b>warning</b> lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011, five tobacco {{companies}} {{filed a lawsuit}} against the FDA in an effort to <b>reverse</b> the new <b>warning</b> mandate. Tobacco companies claimed that being required to promote government anti-smoking campaigns by placing the new warnings on packaging violates the companies' free speech rights. Additionally, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc. claimed that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing {{tobacco companies}} to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government's behalf. A First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, represented the tobacco companies in the case, contending that requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the verdict of acquittal in “Sweden’s largest insider trading case” once again a debate concerning illegal insider trading has arisen and a lot of criticism is directed towards the laws. The purpose of this master´s thesis is to investigate the occurrence of insider trading and whether or not Swedish legislation has decreased the presence of insider trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. For this purpose the legal aspects and relevant arguments are presented and discussed. An event study is performed in order to see if profit warnings show evidence of insider trading on the Swedish stock exchange. The event study show statistically significant evidence of illegal insider trading in 21 out of 44 cases on the Stockholm stock exchange. There is no significant difference in insider trading between profit <b>warnings</b> and <b>reversed</b> profit <b>warnings.</b> The regression show evidence of that the law has had a small negative impact on insider trading in the sample which is surprising and that insider trading is industry correlated. The high frequency of insider trading shows evidence of that the laws are inefficient in stopping insider trading. Since {{it is clear that the}} law is seriously flawed in stopping insider trading and that insider trading actually may positively affect the market and its participants, it is argued that it is very questionable if the legislation is necessary and if insider trading should be prohibited at all...|$|R
