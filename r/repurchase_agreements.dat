25|$|To smooth {{temporary}} or cyclical {{changes in}} the money supply, the desk engages in <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On {{the day of the}} transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E
5000|$|Repo is an {{abbreviation}} for <b>Repurchase</b> <b>agreement,</b> which involves a simultaneous [...] "sale and purchase" [...] agreement. When banks have any shortage of funds, they can borrow it from Reserve Bank of India or from other banks. The {{rate at which}} the RBI lends money to commercial banks is called repo rate, a short term for <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement.</b> A reduction in the repo rate will help banks to get money at a cheaper rate.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} analyze two different bad bank schemes, an outright sale of toxic assets to a state-owned bad bank and a <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement</b> between the bad bank and the initial bank. For both schemes, we derive a critical transfer payment that induces a bank manager to participate. Participation improves the bank's solvency and enables the bank to grant new loans. Therefore, both schemes can reestablish stability and avoid a credit crunch. However, an outright sale will be less costly to taxpayers than a <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreement</b> only if the transfer payment is sufficiently low.

2500|$|Money {{market funds}} seek to limit {{exposure}} to losses due to credit, market, and liquidity risks. Money market {{funds in the}} United States are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Rule 2a-7 of the act restricts the quality, maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds. [...] Under this act, a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt, which matures in under 13 months.

2500|$|Bernanke further {{explained}} that specific triggering events began in mid-2007, as investors began to withdraw {{funds from the}} shadow banking system, analogous to depositors withdrawing money from depository banks in past bank runs. Investors became unsure {{of the value of}} the securities (loan collateral) held by the shadow banks, as many derived their value from subprime mortgages. [...] Mortgage companies could no longer borrow money to originate mortgages, and many failed in 2007. The crisis accelerated in 2008, as the largest five U.S. investment banks, which had $4 trillion in liabilities by the end of 2007, could no longer obtain financing. They had grown increasingly dependent on short-term sources of financing (e.g., <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements),</b> and were unable to obtain new funding from investors. These investment banks were forced to sell long-term securities at fire-sale prices to meet their daily financing needs, suffering enormous losses. Concerns about the possible failure of these banks led the financial system to essentially freeze by September 2008. The Federal Reserve increasingly intervened in its role as lender of last resort to stabilize the financial system as the crisis deepened.|$|E
2500|$|While in {{the offing}} of an ASEAN common currency, {{the leaders of the}} member-states of ASEAN agreed in November 1999 to create the {{establishment}} of currency swaps, and <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements,</b> as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, the finance minister of the ASEAN agreed through the [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] to plan for closer monetary and financial co-operation. The [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] or CMI, named after the City of Chiang Mai in Thailand, has two components: an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement, and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The ASEAN Swap Arrangement or ASA preceded the regional financial crisis. ASA was originally established by the ASEAN central bank and monetary authorities of the five founding members of ASEAN with a view to help countries meet temporary liquidity problems. An expanded ASA now includes all ten ASEAN countries with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has a combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and <b>repurchase</b> <b>agreements</b> among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for members which may be in balance-of-payments difficulties. In 200, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) have been successfully concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion. The original CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 which took effect on 20 March 2014, while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement with a total size of US$240 billion, governed by a single contractual agreement, while the CMI is a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the [...] "Plus Three" [...] and ASEAN countries' authorities. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse regional economies, and to support the CMIM decision-making process. The amendments will effectively allow access of the ASEAN+3 member countries and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the level of access not linked to an International Monetary Fund program from 20%–30%, [...] and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.|$|E
