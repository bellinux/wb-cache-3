40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. A wave height transformation model is developed using surface roller theory. Roller energy production {{is included in}} the energy flux balance equation to predict rms wave height for randomly varying, irregular waves over arbitrary bathymetry. The dissipation function is defined using wave roller theory, where the area of the roller is defined from a simple bore analogy. The Rayleigh distribution is used to statistically describe wave heights as waves shoal, break, and dissipate. Model predictions are compared with data acquired on both barred and near planar beaches. The surface <b>roller</b> <b>wave</b> height transformation model predicts rms wave heights with an average rms error of 6. 5 % for a barred beach over three days, 3. 0 % for two planar beaches over four days, and 4. 5 % average error for all locations over seven days. The model has two free parameters, alpha representing the type of breaker and gamma a measure of breaking wave saturation, also a function of beach slope. Optimal values of both parameters are chosen by model fitting. The model is sensitive to gamma, but not sigma. The surface roller model improves the bore dissipation model Thornton and Guza, 1983 by decreasing the average rms error by 40 % while decreasing model sensitivity to input parameters.

The optical {{intensity}} {{signals from}} surf zone waves {{in a laboratory}} flume are analyzed using several different phase-averaging techniques, and a methodology is developed for estimating <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> lengths and local wave dissipation. The intensity signals (i. e., phase-averaged intensity profiles) of individual breaking waves are compared with the wave profiles measured by in situ wave gauges, and the optical signal of the <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> is shown to ramp up from the toe of the <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> on the front face of the wave to a maximum intensity at the wave crest. The remote sensing observations capture the growth, equilibrium, and decay phases of the roller as it propagates over a fixed bed arranged in a bar/trough morphology. Next, for the regular wave conditions considered here, the local maxima of the phase-averaged intensities are shown to better indicate the initial onset of wave breaking and the occurrence of wave breaking in the bar trough, {{as compared to the}} more commonly used time-averaged mean intensity. In addition, the phase-averaged profiles are used to measure the size of the roller, and these measurements are compared to previous observations of smaller-scale rollers in equilibrium. The observed roller lengths are shown to agree with predictions from a <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> model and to provide a new physical link between the remotely sensed signal and roller dissipation. Finally, as an example application of these new data, a simple wave height inversion model is presented that allows an estimation of surf zone wave heights from the remotely sensed roller lengths...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Wave {{breaking}} is {{the largest}} forcing mechanism in the surf zone. Therefore, quantifying energy dissipation due to wave breaking is important for improving models that seek to predict nearshore circulation, wave-current interactions, air-sea gas exchange, erosion and accretion of sediment, and storm surge. Wave energy dissipation is difficult to measure with in situ instruments, {{and even the most}} reliable estimates are limited to point measurements. Using remote sensing technologies, specifically infrared (IR) imagery, the high spatial and temporal variability of wave breaking may be sampled. Duncan (1981) proposed a model (D 81) for dissipation on a wave-by-wave basis, based on <b>wave</b> slope and <b>roller</b> length, the crest-perpendicular length of the aerated region of a breaking <b>wave.</b> The <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> is composed of active foam, which, in thermal IR images, appears brighter than the surrounding water and the residual foam, the foam left behind {{in the wake of a}} breaking wave. Using IR imagery taken during the Surf Zone Optics 2010 experiment at Duck, NC, and exploiting the distinct signature of active foam, a retrieval algorithm was developed to identify and extract breaking <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> length. Roller length was then used to estimate dissipation rate via the D 81 formulation. The D 81 dissipation rate estimates compare reasonably to in situ dissipation estimates at a point. When the D 81 estimates are compared to the bulk energy flux into the surf zone, it is found that wave breaking dissipates approximately 25 - 36 % of the incoming wave energy. The D 81 dissipation rate estimates also agree closely with those from a dissipation parameterization proposed by Janssen and Battjes (2007) (JB 07) and commonly applied within larger nearshore circulation models. The JB 07 formulation, however, requires additional physical parameters (wave height and water depth) that are often sparsely sampled and are difficult to attain from remote sensing alone. The power of the D 81 formulation lies in its dependence on surface signatures alone, and with the methods developed here and those proposed for future work, wave energy dissipation rate maps could be produced for any imageable coastline...|$|R

The good agreement between observations and predictions implies that the one-dimensional assumption holds for the range of conditions examined, despite the presence of small along-shore bathymetric nonuniformities.

While previously derived models predict wave heights adequately (root-mean-square errors typically less than 20 %), the models can be improved by tuning a free parameter or by using a new parameterization based on the deep-water wave height. Based on a sensitivity analysis of the cross-shore momentum balance used to predict setup, a one-dimensional (1 -D) model is developed that includes <b>wave</b> <b>rollers</b> and bottom stress owing to the mean offshore-directed flow.

Positive feedback leading to realistic formation of up-current bars only occurs if a novel term, i. e., the resuspension of sediment due to the turbulence created by the rollers, {{is included in the}} model. The modeled wavelength, crest orientation and growth rate agree with those of the observed up-current bars but the model overestimates the migration rate. The wavelength and migration rates of crescentic bars in case of oblique wave incidence are more accurately simulated if the reference longshore current is modeled including the roller dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous and {{colocated}} {{optical and}} microwave signals from {{waves in the}} surf zone are presented and analyzed. The field data were collected using a high-resolution video system and a calibrated horizontally polarized marine radar during the decaying phase of a storm. The resulting changes in the received signals from varying environmental conditions were analyzed. The analysis of the optical signal histograms showed functional shapes that {{were in accordance with}} the expected imaging mechanisms from the breaking and nonbreaking waves. For the microwave returns, the histogram shape showed a little dependence on the environmental parameters and exhibited an inflexion point at high returned power that is attributed to a change in the scattering mechanism. The high intensity signals were clearly associated with active wave breaking. However, with either sensor, {{it can be difficult to}} effectively isolate the wave breaking signature from other sources, such as a remnant foam or the highly steepened nonbreaking waves. A combined method was developed using the joint histograms from both sensors, and it is shown to effectively discriminate between active breaking, remnant foam, and steepened waves. The new separation method allows a further analysis of the microwave scattering from the breaking waves and a better quantification of the length scales of the breaking <b>wave</b> <b>roller</b> and the spatial/temporal distribution of wave breaking and wave dissipation in the surf zone...|$|R
