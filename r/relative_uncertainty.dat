5|$|The {{following}} table catalogues {{the notable}} changes in determination of fundamental physical constants. The constants {{are expressed in}} direct measurements and fixed constants to minimize and determine the uncertainty. Some constants in that expression do not contribute significantly to the uncertainty; only the significant factors are noted. The value of the <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainty</b> by the data of CODATA of 2014 is given, and is expressed in the <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the significant factors, noted with ur(constant). An approximately equals sign (≈) is used if an uncertainty is only approximated by the expression. This is due to unsignificant factors or rounding errors.|$|E
40|$|Stabilization of {{uncertain}} dynamic {{systems is}} investigated focusing on plant models that involve both multiplicative and <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainties</b> that are bounded by H(infinity) -norm. A new notion of stability margin is proposed {{to study the}} robustness of the feedback stability. It is shown that the largest possible stability margin is a two-disk problem. An {{upper and lower bounds}} are derived which differ by only a factor of root 2. The results are then applied to networked feedback control systems where logarithmic quantization is employed at both the plant input and output. Our results show that the coarsest quantization density can be computed based on the robust stability margin for plant models involving H(infinity) -norm bounded multiplicative and <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainties...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards {{would be the same}} as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainty</b> when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored with the objective of producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E

500|$|When the New SI {{was first}} designed, {{there were more}} than six {{suitable}} physical constants from which the designers could choose. For example, once length and time had been established, the universal gravitational constant G could, from a dimensional point of view, be used to define mass.M−1T−2, so once standards have been established for length and for time, mass can in theory be deduced from G. Also, when fundamental constants as relations between these three units are set, the units can be deduced by a combination of these constants, for example as a linear combination of Planck units. [...] It should be noted that in practice G can only be measured with a <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of the order of 10−5 which would have resulted in upper limit of the kilogram's reproducibility being around 10−5 whereas the current international prototype kilogram can be measured with a reproducibility of 1.2×10−8. The choice of physical constants was {{made on the basis of}} minimal uncertainty associated with measuring the constant and the degree of independence of the constant in respect of other constants that were being used. Although the BIPM has developed a standard mise en pratique (practical technique) for each type of measurement, the mise en pratique used to make the measurement is not part of the measurement's definition—it is merely an assurance that the measurement can be done without exceeding the specified maximum uncertainty.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{estimates}} of source statistical economic data such as trade flows, {{greenhouse gas emissions}} or employment figures are always subject to uncertainty (stemming from measurement errors or confidentiality) but information concerning that uncertainty is often missing. This paper uses concepts from Bayesian inference and the Maximum Entropy Principle to estimate the prior probability distribution, uncertainty and correlations of source data when such information is not explicitly provided. In the absence of additional information, an isolated datum is described by a truncated Gaussian distribution, and if an uncertainty estimate is missing, its prior equals the best guess. When the sum {{of a set of}} disaggregate data is constrained to match an aggregate datum, it is possible to determine the prior correlations among disaggregate data. If aggregate uncertainty is missing, all prior correlations are positive. If aggregate uncertainty is available, prior correlations can be either all positive, all negative, or a mix of both. An empirical example is presented, which reports <b>relative</b> <b>uncertainties</b> and correlation priors for the County Business Patterns database.
