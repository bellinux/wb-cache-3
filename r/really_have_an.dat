5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E

500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

2500|$|Chris True of Allmusic called [...] "Even Flow" [...] "the {{somewhat}} less ballady more swaggering follow {{up to the}} breakout single 'Alive'." [...] True said that the song [...] "doesn’t even <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> intro—it just starts and keeps going—and the band seems more in the groove than on the overly earnest 'Alive'." [...] True said that the song [...] "confirmed that Pearl Jam were more than just one hit grunge rock wonders." [...] The song was placed at number 77 {{on a list of}} [...] "The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time" [...] by Rolling Stone. It was also included on VH1's countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs" [...] at number 30.|$|E
2500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Marvel {{had been working}} to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they {{announced}} their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, [...] "Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [...] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [...] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three." [...] It was said that Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, producers for the Amazing Spider-Man series, would serve as executive producers, and neither director Marc Webb nor actor Andrew Garfield would return for the new film. Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man, with Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien considered front-runners. In March 2015, Drew Goddard was being considered to write and direct the film, while O'Brien {{said he had not}} been approached for the role. Goddard, who was previously attached to Sony film based on the Sinister Six, later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he [...] "didn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea" [...] for it, adding [...] "it's very hard to say, 'Ok, now write a new movie,'" [...] after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset. The next month, while promoting , Feige said the character of Peter Parker would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film, which would not be an origin story, since [...] "there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [...] {{we are going to take}} it for granted that people know that, and the specifics." [...] Parker's Uncle Ben is referenced in the film, but not by name. Later in April, Nat Wolff, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Timothée Chalamet, and Liam James were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man, with Holland and Butterfield the front-runners.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not think}} the fiction of our own time even always equal to this work, or perhaps more than seldom so. But as I once expressed, to the long-reverberating discontent of two continents, fiction is now a finer art than it, has been hitherto, and more nearly meets the {{requirements}} of the infallible standard. I have hopes of real usefulness in it, because it is at last building on the only sure foundation; but I am by no means certain that it will be the ultimate literary form, or will remain as important as we believe it is destined to become. On the contrary, it is quite imaginable that when the great mass of readers, now sunk in the foolish joys of mere fable, shall be lifted to an interest in the meaning of things through the faithful portrayal of life in fiction, then fiction the most faithful may be superseded by a still more faithful form of contemporaneous history. I willingly leave the precise character of this form to the more robust imagination of readers whose minds have been nurtured upon romantic novels, and who <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> imagination worth speaking of, and confine myself, as usual, to the hither side of the regions of conjecture.|$|E
60|$|We are perpetually boring {{the world}} and each other with talk about the bonds that bind us to America. We are perpetually crying aloud that England and America are very much alike, {{especially}} England. We are always insisting that the two are identical in all the things in which they most obviously differ. We are always saying that both stand for democracy, when we should not consent to stand their democracy for half a day. We are always saying that at least we are all Anglo-Saxons, when we are descended from Romans and Normans and Britons and Danes, and they are descended from Irishmen and Italians and Slavs and Germans. We tell a people whose very existence is a revolt against the British Crown that they are passionately devoted to the British Constitution. We tell a nation whose whole policy has been isolation and independence that with us she can bear safely the White Man's Burden of universal empire. We tell a continent crowded with Irishmen to thank God that the Saxon can always rule the Celt. We tell a populace whose very virtues are lawless that together we uphold the Reign of Law. We recognise our own law-abiding character in people who make laws that neither they nor anybody else can abide. We congratulate them on clinging to all they have cast away, and on imitating everything which they came into existence to insult. And when we have established all these nonsensical analogies with a nonexistent nation, we wait {{until there is a}} crisis in which we really are at one with America, and then we falter and threaten to fail her. In a battle where we really are of one blood, the blood of the great white race throughout the world, when we really have one language, the fundamental alphabet of Cadmus and the script of Rome, when we really do represent the same reign of law, the common conscience of Christendom and the morals of men baptized, when we <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> implicit faith and honour and type of freedom to summon up our souls as with trumpets--then many of us begin to weaken and waver and wonder whether there is not something very nice about little yellow men, whose heroic stories revolve round polygamy and suicide, and whose heroes wore two swords and worshipped the ancestors of the Mikado.|$|E
