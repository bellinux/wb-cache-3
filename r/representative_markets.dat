40|$|Online {{statistics}} in patent databases offers {{the possibility to}} use patent data {{as a source for}} technical and market information. By this it also contributes to a decline in the information gap small and medium-sized enterprises face compared to big companies which have an own patent department. Differences in the capacity of statistical commands make it necessary to discuss advantages and disadvantages of the statistical procedures of different hosts. Based on own experiences, the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI), Karlsruhe, has developed a standardized analytical package named "patent- statistical competition analysis". By using online statistics, a deep insight into development trends in certain technology markets will become possible. Additionally, lists of competitors can be produced and the competitiveness on <b>representative</b> <b>markets</b> can be analysed. Patent databases should therefore not only be used for legal patent searches, but also as a source for technical and marketing information. By adjusting the file structures according to the needs of online statistics, the database producers could also contribute to a higher acceptability and diffusion in the utilization of technical and market related patent data...|$|E
40|$|Published {{studies of}} physician-owned {{specialty}} hospitals have typically examined {{the impact of}} these hospitals on disparities, quality, and utilization at a national level. Our objective was to examine the impact of newly opened physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals on individual competing general hospitals. We used Medicare Part A administrative data to identify all physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals performing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between 1991 and 2005. We identified newly opened specialty hospitals in three <b>representative</b> <b>markets</b> (Durham, NC, Kansas City, and Oklahoma City) and assessed their impact on surgical volume and patient case complexity for the five competing general hospitals located closest to each specialty hospital. The average general hospital maintained THA and TKA volume following the opening of the specialty hospitals. The average general hospital also did not experience an increase in patient case complexity. Thus, based on these three markets, we found no clear evidence that entry of physician-owned specialty orthopaedic hospitals resulted in declines in THA or TKA volume or increases in patient case complexity for the average competing general hospital...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that the fast information-communication, coupled with {{technological}} development, has created a high degree of dependence on financial and other markets. Such dependence in times of general economic growth through transmission channels had a huge impact on the stability of financial markets, respectively to global economic prosperity. However, with the onset of the mortgage crisis, the transmission channels erupted to the fore and, above all, the stock market channel, which has played a key role in the speed and transfer of instability from one to the other markets. This is why its irreplaceable role in the functioning of modern market. Stock exchange channel we observed through the stock exchange indices, which represent an important indicator of financial market development, but also the economy as a whole. The paper uses the method of generalization observation average of stock market indices. As global underdeveloped stock markets have the greatest impact on the transmission of the crisis in an unstable period, so in this article we look at the stock indices elected <b>representative</b> <b>markets</b> such as: America, China and the European Union. Results of testing this interactive market largely allow us to come to the conclusion what impact the stock markets have on transmission of instability in the crisis period...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the integration of horticultural markets in East Africa. The analysis is conducted using monthly wholesale prices of fresh tomatoes and fresh onions. Four <b>representative</b> <b>markets</b> (two in Tanzania and two in Kenya) are selected for the analysis. These markets are analyzed in pairs using the bivariate Joe-Clayton copula (BB 7). This copula involves two parameters, which control the degree of overall dependence of price shocks as well as the strength of dependence at the extremes of their joint distribution. The overall dependence is assessed by the Kendall’s tau, which is calculated from a number of concordant and discordant pairs of observations. Information about dependence at the lower and the higher ranks is obtained by measuring the upper and the lower tail dependence coefficients. These coefficients give the probability that a price shock in one market will be above (below) a high (a low) quantile if a price shock in another market is also above (below) a high (a low) quantile. When considered together, the overall strength of co-movement and co-movement at the extremes provide information about the degree of market integration. Empirical results of this study suggest that the investigated markets are generally not very well integrated. The overall dependence of price shocks between different pairs of markets varies from low to medium. The pattern of dependence of these price shocks also appears to be predominantly asymmetric...|$|E
40|$|An {{index was}} {{developed}} to rank U. S. metropolitan areas according to overall similarities in their socio-economic characteristics to the U. S. average. This index is given {{as a solution to}} matching a representative city or market area to a target market as well as matching a group of cities which are similar to each other. The index shows stability in ranking these cities with different consumption data for similar products and proves to be a promising approach whenever the researcher must find a group of cities which are similar {{to each other and to}} the target market. Market research sometimes requires selec-tion of cities or market areas for testing new product performance, effects of changes in different market variables on product sales, effects of changes in different economic var-iables on product consumption, and so on. This type of research uses <b>representative</b> <b>markets</b> as proxies for a target market area in order to get meaningful information [Shoraka, R. ]. A relatively large sample size and repetitive market research are needed to obtain precise results; however, the larger the sample size, the greater are research costs [Ladik, et al. ]. In many cases, the cost of increasing the sample size (number of cities) is not justifiable or may be prohibitive to the small firm undertaking the analyses [Lipstien, B. ]. That is why a representative market area or city is still a practical approach in marketing research [Scott, F., Jr. ]. It is difficult to find a group of markets or cities which are similar to each other and to the target market areas in all socio-economic characteristics [Scott, F., Jr. ]. The conven-tional method of selecting representative market areas is to examine the demographi...|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSKnowledge of consumers’ {{willingness-to-pay}} (WTP) {{provides a}} company with invaluable data for both pricing decisions and product development. Without an understanding of consumers’ WTP for its products, a company may not pursue an optimal pricing strategy or achieve its pricing objectives. There are theoretical and practical shortcomings associated with existing WTP models. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a model for estimating consumers’ WTP in order to facilitate determination of the optimal price for new products or relaunched products. To address some of the shortcomings of existing WTP models, multi-factorial experiments and direct survey stated preference methods were integrated in a novel WTP model. The proposed model produces predictive equations for six stated price responses, including the WTP price. To empirically establish the validity of the proposed model, the ability of the model to estimate WTP at the individual and group level was evaluated in a <b>representative</b> <b>market.</b> The cell phone handset market was chosen as a <b>representative</b> <b>market.</b> In this market, the proposed model produced statistically significant predictive equations for stated WTP at the individual, group, and subgroup level...|$|R

For any given information realization, the equilibrium price can be interpreted as a posterior belief given a <b>representative</b> <b>market</b> prior belief. However, across information realizations, we show that this market prior belief is a decreasing function of the likelihood ratio of the private information possessed by the traders. Thus, the market price underreacts to information, consistent with the favoritelongshot bias.
