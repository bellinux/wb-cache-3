40|$|Abstract—The {{extremely}} long {{propagation delay}} between interplanetary nodes poses {{challenges to the}} investigation of Store-and-forward Deep Space Autonomous Network (DSAN). Long propagation delay combined with scarcity of energy at the planetary wireless nodes and relays, introduces new dimensions to the congestion control challenge. In this paper, we take advantage of long propagation delay between nodes and propose a novel approach for congestion control. The long delayed channel can be utilized as a memory resource. Instead of dropping the packets {{due to lack of}} storage at the intermediate nodes such as satellite or a robotic spacecraft, they are transmitted back to the source. This significantly reduces packet loss, and lowers the per packet energy consumption. In addition, this method provides feedback on the congestion status of the relay node. Consequently, the source is able to dynamically control traffic flow in the source-relay channel until congestion is abated. Two proposed protocols, i. e., (i) <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> (without rate control) and (ii) <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> with rate control are investigated, and compared with a conventional protocol where no <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> is utilized. Extensive simulations are conducted which validate that the performance with <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> especially <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> with rate control, far outweigh the conventional approach, in terms of energy consumption, and retransmission per successful packet.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{investigation}} presented is the characterisation of the nonlinear cyclic behaviour of steel joints between I profile beams to hollow section columns with welded <b>reverse</b> <b>channel.</b> When compared with other steel shapes, tubular profiles show a privileged structural behaviour due {{to their ability to}} withstand axial loads, bending in several directions and torsion, besides considerable advantages in terms of maintenance and aesthetics. The welded <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> connection is a good solution since it allows for a bolted joint between I beam to hollow column. Furthermore, this type of joint detail has a reasonable construction cost, is easy to implement and possesses large ductility through the deformation of the web panel. In this paper a comparison is made between experimental and numerical finite element model results. The main focus will be on the results concerning the main components of the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> i. e. web face in bending, flanges panels in shear, compression and tension.

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} {{network is}} one {{in which there is a}} mismatch between the characteristics of the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>channel.</b> Typically, the forward channel is capable of high transmission rates and the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> has lesser bandwidth. Cable modem networks and satellite networks are some technologies that exhibit network asymmetry. TCP, due to its widespread acceptance, is also used in asymmetric networks. However, the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> being a bottleneck causes many problems in the behavior of traditional TCP protocols. The TCP protocol is heavily dependent on ACKs. The variation in the ACK arrival rate, caused due to network asymmetry, results in slower initial window growth and burstiness on the forward channel. Existing approaches to improve the performance of TCP in asymmetric networks use techniques such as reduction in number of ACKs. However, these approaches do not take into consideration the high bandwidth availability in the forward direction for early ramp up of TCP window. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Transmit antenna {{selection}} (TAS) in multiple-input-multiple output (MIMO) {{has several}} advantages, particularly in hardware-costly transmit schemes {{such as those}} requiring linearisation.

This process involves a <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth cost, but also implies a delay between the channel sampling and the switching. To reduce <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> costs, the bandwidth may be rate constrained. Thus both delay and feedback rate will limit {{the performance of a}} TAS system.

In order to analyze the impact of retailing and recycling competitions on the profits of the manufacturer and the competitive retailers, two collection models (coordinated collection (Model C) and decentralized collection (Model D)) are established, respectively. Then, based on game theory, we derive the optimal retail price, the optimal repurchase price, and the optimal profits of the manufacturer and the retailers. The managerial insights demonstrate that more intense retailing competition induces the increase of the manufacturer's profits in both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>channels</b> and retailers' profits in the forward channel and the decrease of retailers' profits in the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> while more intense recycling competition induces the decrease of the profits of the manufacturer and retailers in both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>channels.</b> Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models...|$|R

Using perturbation techniques, a lower bound on the forward link capacity is derived with respect to which the training sequence is optimized. Thus, the <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> training sequence makes use of the channel knowledge at the receiver.

40|$|The {{economical}} {{and environmental}} benefits of product remanufacturing {{have been widely}} recognized in the literature and in practice. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} interaction between a manufacturer's <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive. To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e. g., print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in which the retailers act as product return points (e. g., single-use cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer faces while choosing an optimal <b>reverse</b> <b>channel</b> structure. When a direct collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect <b>reverse</b> <b>channel,</b> supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale pricing flexibility {{that can be used to}} price discriminate between retailers of different profitability. reverse logistics, product remanufacturing, supply chain coordination, distribution channels...|$|R
