30|$|Now, {{assume that}} the vectors a_ 1,...,a_m are linearly independent. According to Theorem 2.5, we have N(H_i)= 2 i- 1 and N(H_l_i)= 2 i. Therefore, 2 i- 1 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> matrix H_i are depend on the other <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> H_i and 2 i <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> the matrix H_l_i are depend on the other <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> H_l_i. As we have defined the matrix H_i and H_l_i {{in such a way}} that exactly 2 i- 1 <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> H_i and 2 i <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> matrix H_l_i are the zero vectors, we can delete these zero vectors using {{appropriate}} operator.

This experiment was {{laid out in a}} Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replicates and six treatments. Base crop (T 1) and intercrop (T 2) were grown in pure stands and other treatments were 20 / 50 cm paired <b>row</b> planting <b>of</b> radish with three (T 3) or four (T 4) <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> vegetable amaranthus in between paired <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> radish and 25 / 40 cm paired <b>row</b> planting <b>of</b> radish with three (T 5) or two (T 6) <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> vegetable amaranthus in between paired <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> radish. Growth parameters were recorded at regular intervals. The results showed that land equivalent ratio was superior in all tested intercropping treatments. In T 3, radish yield was high (37. 8 tons/ha) and most of the yield components exhibited high average values as compared with other intercropping treatments. The present study revealed that 20 / 50 cm paired <b>row</b> planting <b>of</b> radish with three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> vegetable amaranthus in between paired <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> radish (T 3) would be the most suitable planting system in sandy regosol...|$|R
5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar <b>row</b> <b>of</b> much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to explain why the {{extension}} of the previously published C=(S/Ho) sqrt(J) scaling for opposed <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> staggered jets wasn‚Äôt directly successful in the study by Choi et al. (2016). It is not surprising that staggered jets from opposite sides do not pass each other at the expected C value, because Ho/D and sqrt(J) are much larger than the maximum in previous studies. These, and large x/D‚Äôs, tend to suggest development of 2 -dimensional flow. Although there are distinct optima for opposed <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> in-line jets, single-side injection, and opposed <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> staggered jets based on C, opposed <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> staggered jets provide as good or better mixing performance, at any C value, than opposed <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> in-line jets or jets from single-side injection...|$|R
