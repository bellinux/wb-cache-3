40|$|How is nature {{transformed}} into natural resources? Histories analyzing the state sciences {{of agriculture and}} forestry in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries showed that these sciences redefined nature as natural resources by making them amenable to cameralistic calculation, bookkeeping and accountability. Against this background, my first line of inquiry is exploring how, over the twentieth century, nonfuel mineral <b>resource</b> <b>appraisals,</b> i. e. attempts to quantify the metal content of the earth’s crust, became the first hold that societies took on earth matters, transforming them into mineral resources. My second objective is to describe and explain a widening of scope. Around 1900, geologists and other mineral resource experts began to appraise minerals {{on a global scale}} and survey trends in the worldwide production and consumption of minerals. I argue that, after World War I, states started to use global mineral <b>resource</b> <b>appraisals</b> as tools of geopolitical calculation, aimed at measuring and managing both natural resources and state power relations. The global perspective was only one reason why mineral resources became amenable to economic and political management on a vast scale, though. In addition, global mineral resource supply and estimates had to be cast and discussed in an explicitly functionalist language in order to fit the interwar technocratic ideas of planning and maintaining world order...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{undertook}} a preliminary {{investigation of the}} staff well-being model with support staff working with adults with intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviour. The staff well-being model was conceptualised from Lawton et al. ’s (1991) two-factor model of caregiving appraisal and psychological well-being, Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984) transactional model of stress, and research literature investigating staff stress and burnout. The proposed staff well-being model was used to explore hypothesised relationships between staff stressors, <b>resources,</b> <b>appraisals,</b> and outcome. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was completed by 47 support staff working in intellectual disability community services, with non-parametric tests of means and correlational analysis undertaken to explore nine relationships. Appraisals of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment, measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, were compared with staff perceptions of intellectual disability, challenging behaviour, and organisational demands (stressors), organisational support, social support, wishful thinking, and practical coping (resources), positive feelings and negative feelings (outcomes). Results: Five significant relationships were found (p <. 001). Appraisals of emotional exhaustion were positively associated with organisational demands, wishful thinking coping, and negative feelings, and negatively associated with organisational support. Appraisals of personal accomplishment were positively associated with positive feelings. Conclusions: This preliminary exploration of the staff well-being model found five significant relationships between staff stressors, <b>resources,</b> <b>appraisals</b> and outcome.

The project sites were Barangays Antipolo in Baao and Duran inNabua, Camarines. Participatory <b>Resource</b> <b>Appraisal</b> (PRA) was used to characterize the production systems of the sites. Thirty one farmers participated.

The project sites were the rolling and mountainous areas of Barangay Antipolo in Baao and Duran in Nabua, Camarines Sur, Philippines.
