After being {{removed from the}} set of children's television series <b>Romper</b> Room for being disruptive {{at the age of}} five, he followed his older stepbrother Adam Farrar into television commercials, landing an ad for Matchbox cars at 14. In 1990, he got his break on television when he was cast in the short-lived series based on the movie Parenthood. After Parenthood, DiCaprio had bit parts on several shows, including The New Lassie and Roseanne, as well as a brief stint on the soap opera Santa Barbara, playing the young Mason Capwell. His involvement in Parenthood and the daily soap earned him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor each.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most TV {{game shows}} of the time, which were taped in New York or Hollywood and {{broadcast}} nationally, Bowling for Dollars {{was produced by}} local TV stations and featured contestants from the immediate area.

25|$|Until the 1980s, {{the station}} {{produced}} {{a series of}} classic public service shorts titled Bits and Pieces, often featuring two talking puppets, Charley and Humphrey, which Pat McCormick had brought over to KTVU from his tenure at KGO-TV. The shorts, which often aired during children's programs shown on the station, were aimed at delivering positive and educational messages to kids. In the late 1970s, Charley and Humphrey were spun off into a daily children's program on KTVU, which was hosted by McCormick. Channel 2 also served as the Bay Area's originating station for the children's television program franchise <b>Romper</b> Room; originally hosted by Nancy Besst, the half-hour program aired at 8:30a.m. on weekday mornings {{for much of the}} 1980s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rompers</b> {{appeared}} in the United States of America in the early 1900s. They were popular as playwear for younger children because people thought they were ideal for movement. <b>Rompers</b> were {{in many ways the}} first modern casual clothes for children. They were light and loose fitting, a major change from the much more restrictive clothing children wore during the 19th Century Victorian era. Styles and conventions varied from country to country. In France they were, for many years, only for boys. While primarily a play garment, some French children wore dressy <b>rompers.</b> Their popularity peaked in the 1950s when they were used by children as playwear and by women as leisure- and beachwear. Thereafter the garment has continued to be used by infants and toddlers; however, it has become less common among older girls and women, although never disappearing entirely.|$|R

5000|$|Pucker! marks another stylistic {{deviation}} for the band. According to Terry <b>Rompers</b> of Trouser Press, {{the album}} is mostly a [...] "mild-mannered version" [...] of the band's ska roots, [...] "clinging to the familiar peppy keyboard, bass, guitar and snare syncopation of ska," [...] but also adding giddy elements from new wave music and power pop. The sound of the album {{has been compared to}} [...] "the Yachts, perhaps, or the Go-Go's" [...] discovering [...] "some old Skatalites records." [...] <b>Rompers</b> described the album as containing a [...] "harmlessly bizarre blend of elements" [...] that helped distance the album from its predecessor, while Martin C. Strong saw the album as an attempt to broaden the band's horizons. In his overall review of the band's discography, <b>Rompers</b> said of the new direction taken by the band on Pucker!: [...] "The same mob made The Happy Album made Pucker!, but you'd never know it from the catchy chorus of 'My Perfect World,' which leads it off, or the cornball pot-centric version of Bob Dylan's 'Rainy Day Women #12 & 35' that curls up near the end." ...|$|R
25|$|On November 29, 1999, Cox Enterprises {{acquired}} San Jose-based independent station KICU-TV from Detroit {{businessman and}} Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson and KICU president/general manager Jim Evers. The resulting pairing of KICU with KTVU created the Bay Area's first television station duopoly when {{the deal was}} finalized in March 2000; the operations of KICU migrated from that station's original studio facilities in San Jose, where KTVU relocated its South Bay news bureau, and were consolidated into KTVU's Jack London Square facility in Oakland. On March 3, 2008, KTVU celebrated its 50th anniversary of broadcasting. In honor of the anniversary, a series of fifteen promos were produced, which included those honoring past KTVU programs such as <b>Romper</b> Room and Captain Satellite {{as well as the}} station's sports programming.|$|E
25|$|After {{appearing}} in the TV series Neighbours and Living with the Law, Crowe was cast by Faith Martin in his first film, The Crossing (1990), a small-town love triangle directed by George Ogilvie. Before production started, a film-student protégé of Ogilvie, Steve Wallace, hired Crowe for the film Blood Oath (1990) (aka Prisoners of the Sun), which was released a month earlier than The Crossing, although actually filmed later. In 1992, Crowe starred in the first episode of the second series of Police Rescue. Also in 1992, Crowe starred in <b>Romper</b> Stomper, an Australian film which followed the exploits and downfall of a racist skinhead group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne, directed by Geoffrey Wright. For the role, Crowe won an Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Actor, following up from his Best Supporting Actor award for Proof in 1991.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of its release, <b>Rompers</b> was never ported to a home video game console, nor was given an {{official}} North American release, possibly due to one of the enemies, Fumajime Pyokorin, being involved in drug use, and the Japanese voice samples; the game's soundtrack was released in two compilation discs known as Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 5, and Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 6, which included soundtracks for other Namco games as well. The first official home conversion for the game was in Namco Museum Encore, the series' only Japanese-exclusive installment (which also featured Wonder Momo and was released on the Sony PlayStation) - and in 2009, <b>Rompers</b> went on to appear on the Nintendo Wii's Japanese Virtual Console market.|$|R

[...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe McVicker took Play-Doh to an {{educational}} convention for manufacturers of school supplies, and Woodward & Lothrop, {{a department store}} in Washington, DC began selling the compound.

[...] Also in 1956, a three-pack of 7-ounce cans {{was added to the}} product line, and, after in-store demonstrations, Macy's of New York and Marshall Field's of Chicago opened retail accounts. In 1957, chemist Dr. Tien Liu reduced Play Doh's salt content (thus allowing models to dry without losing their color), and Play-Doh ads were telecast on Captain Kangaroo, Ding Dong School, and <b>Romper</b> Room. In 1958, Play-Doh's sales reached nearly $3 million.|$|E

500|$|Australian {{novelist and}} critic Robert Drewe gave a {{positive}} review, praising {{the performance of}} Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and director Steven Vidler's choice of such a controversial subject for a first film. Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual {{people involved in the}} Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is [...] "asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories", though he concluded that the film should be [...] "compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers." [...] Rob Lowing from The Sun-Herald noted that the film belonged to a slew of Australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating, [...] "if you went to see <b>Romper</b> Stomper, Metal Skin, Idiot Box or Once Were Warriors, this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963, NBN won the Logie Award for Enterprising Programming (which {{was only}} for country stations), and another Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station award in 1978. NBN {{purchased}} the <b>Romper</b> Room franchise from Fremantle International in 1967, which broadcast for over three decades. The original hostess was Miss Anne, followed by Miss Lyn, Miss Pauline and finally, Miss Kim who hosted the program until its demise due to 'political correctness'. (For example, a favourite feature called 'bounce-the-ball' was deemed inappropriate because not all children could bounce a ball). At first the 'Miss's' were assisted by NBN's station mascot, Buttons the Cat, who underwent a number of incarnations as its costume aged and became outdated. Later, Buttons was retired, being replaced by Humphrey B. Bear (as NBN had gained {{the rights to the}} character through their purchase of Southern Television Corporation), [...] A Local suited character was then determined to be more suitable for a regional television station and the concept of Big Dog was created, the character and suit were created in Wyong on the NSW Central Coast and Big Dog came into being.|$|E
