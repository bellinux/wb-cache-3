All laboratories were asked to use their routine in-house real-time RT-PCR protocols and a standardized protocol commonly used by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) on a panel of well-characterized samples. In general, all participants produced results within the acceptable range. The FLI assay, several in-house assays, and the commercial kits had high analytical sensitivity and specificity values. Nevertheless, some in-house systems had unspecific reactions or suboptimal sensitivity with only a single CSFV genotype. Follow-up actions involved either improvement of suboptimal assays or replacement of specific laboratory assays with the FLI protocol, with or without modifications. In conclusion, the <b>ring</b> <b>trial</b> showed reliability of classical swine fever diagnosis on an international level and helped to optimize CSFV-specific RT-PCR diagnostics...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{next-generation}} whole-genome sequencing (WGS) {{is increasingly}} {{used to determine}} the genetic relationships of bacteria on a nearly whole-genome level for infection control purposes and molecular surveillance. Here, we conducted a multicenter <b>ring</b> <b>trial</b> comprising five laboratories to determine the reproducibility and accuracy of WGS-based typing. The participating laboratories sequenced 20 blind-coded Staphylococcus aureus DNA samples using 250 -bp paired-end chemistry for library preparation in a single sequencing run on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The run acceptance criteria were sequencing outputs > 5. 6 Gb and Q 30 read quality scores of > 75 %. Subsequently, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), ribosomal MLST, and core genome MLST (cgMLST) were performed by the participants. Moreover, discrepancies in cgMLST target sequences in comparisons with the included and also published sequence of the quality control strain ATCC 25923 were resolved using Sanger sequencing. All five laboratories fulfilled the run acceptance criteria in a single sequencing run without any repetition. Of the 400 total possible typing results, 394 of the reported spa types, sequence types (STs), ribosomal STs (rSTs), and cgMLST cluster types were correct and identical among all laboratories; only six typing results were missing. An analysis of cgMLST allelic profiles corroborated this high reproducibility; only 3 of 183, 927 (0. 0016 %) cgMLST allele calls were wrong. Sanger sequencing confirmed all 12 discrepancies of the <b>ring</b> <b>trial</b> results in comparison with the published sequence of ATCC 25923.

Establishing networks of reference laboratories is – in addition to reference measurement procedures and reference materials – {{one of the biggest challenges}} in implementing the concept of measurement traceability. With respect to these requirements, the Joint Committee on Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM), established by the BIPM, the IFCC and the ILAC, has launched two projects in its working groups. WG- 1 has to date published tables of reference materials and reference procedures on the BIPM web-sites, whereas WG- 2 is identifying reference measurement laboratories.

Due to its high level of persistence and the lack of information about the efficiency of its diagnostic techniques, the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for IPNV in Chile performed the first inter-laboratory <b>ring</b> <b>trial,</b> to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and repeatability of the qRT-PCR detection methods used in the country. Results: Results showed 100 % in sensitivity and specificity in most of the laboratories. Only three of the twelve participant laboratories presented problems in sensitivity and one in specificity. Problems in specificity (false positives) were most likely caused by cross contamination of the samples, while errors in sensitivity (false negatives) were due to detection problems of the least concentrated viral sample. Regarding repeatability, many of the laboratories presented great dispersion of the results (Ct values) for replicate samples over the three days of the trial. Moreover, large differences in the Ct values for each sample were detected among all the laboratories. Conclusions: Overall, the <b>ring</b> <b>trial</b> showed high values of sensitivity and specificity, with some problems of repeatability and inter-laboratory variability.

To fully exploit {{the potential of}} DP, the BIOPOOL project develops software for extracting and gathering DP slides with well defined associated data from multiple biobanks and pathology archives to create pools of images, as biobanks networks, on which clinicians and researchers can search for reference, score for similarities with their own images using an innovative Content Based Image Retrieval system, and perform indepth image analyses. Methods: The BIOPOOL Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with minimal, critical functionality serves as the basis on which the system will be further developed. For this PoC we are studying existing DP image formats and systems that could be of use, designed both PoC and end-phase validation plans and end-phase functional requirements. Results: For the PoC, only colon DP slides with associated data (normal and high grade carcinoma), digitalised on Hamamatsu and Olympus scanners, are used. Pathologists have assigned morphological areas of interest for image searching development and creation of the basic DPpool, which were both validated. Functional requirements include a user-interface for searching on textual and morphology aspects, multiscanner format support, storage capacity, computational power for search processing and IT equipment and support.
