50|$|The Type 97 mortar {{examined}} had {{an extension}} fitted to the sight, raising {{the latter to}} the level of the muzzle of the mortar. This extension probably was added to permit sighting of the weapon when it was deeply dug in or slightly in defilade. Elevation scale of the sight is graduated in 50-mil intervals from 700 to 1,600 mils, and a micrometer drum enables elevation readings to be made to the nearest mil. The collimator can be traversed in a full circle, and the azimuth scale is calibrated in 100-mil graduations in two sections of 3,200 mils each. As in the case of elevation, a micrometer drum permits azimuth readings to be made to the nearest mil. There is a throw-out lever for <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> of the collimator, which may be placed at an angle of elevation and locked in position by a series of meshing notches.

50|$|The <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> of {{resonances}} {{through the}} asteroid belt leaves its population and the overall distribution of its orbital elements largely preserved. The asteroid belt's depletion, the mixing of its taxonomical classes, and the excitation of its orbits, yielding a distribution of inclinations peaked near 10° and eccentricities peaked near 0.1, therefore must have occurred earlier. These may be the product of Jupiter's Grand Tack, provided that a few hundred million years elapsed {{between it and the}} Nice model instability for interactions with the terrestrial planets to remove an excess of higher eccentricity asteroids. Gravitational stirring by planetary embryos embedded in {{the asteroid belt}} could also produce its depletion, mixing, and excitation. However, most if not all of the embryos must have been lost before the instability. An initially small mass asteroid belt could have its inclinations and eccentricities excited by secular resonances that hopped across the asteroid belt if Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits became chaotic while in resonance.|$|E

50|$|As states grew in size, {{speed of}} {{movement}} became crucial because central power {{could not hold}} if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly.

This work describes a system for autonomous cross country navigation as implemented on the NavLab II, a computer-controlled off-road vehicle at Carnegie Mellon. The navigation software is discussed. The perception subsystem constructs digital maps of the terrain from range sensor data in real time. The planning subsystem uses a generate-and-test scheme to find safe trajectories through the map, and validates them through simulated driving. The planning process considers both kinematic and dynamic constraints on vehicle motion. The system was successful in achieving 300 m autonomous runs on moderate terrain at speeds up to 4. 25 m/s.

30|$|If any of {{the first}} two options is chosen, i.e. ‘Flexible Production’ and ‘Mass Production’, an {{automatically}} filled up interrelationship matrix with default values appears. On the other hand, if ‘Custom’ option is selected, the end user needs to fill up the interrelationship matrix based on the subjective judgments. The customers’ requirements can be either beneficial (higher the better) or non-beneficial (lower the better), and are attributed by the value of the corresponding improvement driver (+ 1 for beneficial criteria and − 1 for non-beneficial criteria). The next stage comprises of assigning priority weights to the requirements of the customers. For assigning priority values to customers’ requirements, a scale of 1 – 5 is set, where 1 —not important, 2 —important, 3 —much more important, 4 —very important and 5 —most important. After critically analyzing the relationship between customers’ requirements and technical specifications of CNC turning centres, it is observed that productivity is highly correlated to spindle speed, motor power and <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> speed; whereas, area, height and weight of CNC turning centre have the least relationship with it. Similarly, it is also found that flexibility is strongly related to spindle speed and number of tools, while availability of space is highly interrelated with area and height. Furthermore, it is revealed that the allocated fund is greatly associated with cost of the CNC turning centre; whereas, machining time is strongly related to spindle speed, and <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> in X- and Z-axes. Moreover, it is also noticed that power requirement is positively related to spindle motor power, but it is least influenced by maximum length and diameter of the workpiece, and travel in X- and Z-axes. Additionally, it is observed that number of tools considerably influences the capability of a CNC turning centre to generate complicated parts. The interrelationships between the remaining customers’ requirements and technical requirements are subsequently developed similarly with values from an appropriate scale of 1 – 9, where 1 —very very weak, 2 —very weak 3 —weaker, 4 —weak, 5 —moderate, 6 —strong, 7 —stronger, 8 —very strong and 9 —very very strong.|$|E

The length of time in the process of milling machining is influenced by selection and design of machining parameters including cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The purpose of this study to know the influence of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut as independent variables versus operation time at CNC milling process as dependent variables. Each independent variable consists of three level of factors; low, medium and high. Time machining process is measured from operation time simulation program, feed cut length and <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> length. The results of statistically from software simulation MasterCam X Milling, then do the comparison to CNC Milling machine.   The data from experiments was statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Regression methods by software Minitab 16.

40|$|Planetary hoppers are a {{new class}} of vehicle being {{developed}} that will provide planetary surface mobility by reusing the landing platform and its actuators to propulsively ascend, translate, and descend to new landing points on the surface of a planetary body. Hoppers enhance regional exploration, with the capability of <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse</b> over hundreds to thousands of meters, traverse over hazardous terrain, and exploration of cliffs and craters. These planetary mobility vehicles are fuel limited and as a result are enabled by carrying sensor payloads that require low mass, low volume, and low onboard computational resources. This thesis describes methods for hoppers to traverse and land safely in this constrained environment. The key questions of this research are: - What types of missions will hoppers perform and how does a hopper traverse as part of these missions? - How does a hopper traverse from its current location to a new landing site safely? This thesis: - describes various hopper mission scenarios and considerations for their mission designs. - creates an operational concept for safe landing for the traverse hop mission scenario. - develops a method {{that can be used to}} rapidly and safely detect landing areas at long ranges and low path angles. - develops a method to do fine detection of hazards once at the landing area. by Babak E.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{information}} {{on the distribution of}} total cell cycle times in hairless mouse epidermis, basal cells were isolated and prepared for DNA flow cytometry at intervals after a pulse labeling with 50 μCi of thymidine. The DNA distributions were recorded, and cells were sorted from windows in the S, G 2, and G 1; phases of the cell cycle, collected on glass slides, and subjected to autoradiography. The proportions of labeled cells were scored in each fraction, and the percentage of labeled mitoses was determined in histologic sections from the same animals. Grain count distributions were recorded at selected time points over labeled cells in sorted fractions and over labeled mitoses. The movement of the labeled S-phase cohort was thus followed through all cell cycle phases. Peaks in labeled cells were observed at about 36 h in S phase, G 2 phase, and mitosis, and high levels of labeled G 2 cells and mitoses were seen at about 80 h. These results indicate the existence of one rapidly cycling subpopulation of keratinocytes with a cell cycle time slightly less than 30 h, in addition to keratinocytes with considerably longer cell cycle times. The first peak of labeled G 2 cells reached only about 30 %. This is consistent with earlier findings of about 30 % G 2 cells with a <b>rapid</b> <b>traverse,</b> and 70 % with a considerably delayed traverse through G 2 phase. The proportion of labeled G 1 cells reached a value corresponding to twice the initial labeling index at 8 h after pulse labeling.
