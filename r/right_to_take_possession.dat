The measure was planned both to remove Cato, potentially a serious and difficult opponent, from Rome for some time (he would be away for more than two years) and to turn him into an advocate for the legitimacy of Clodius' adoption and tribunate, which happened, later causing a great deal of friction between Cato and Clodius' bitterest enemies, especially Cicero.|$|R

5000|$|The term bounty land is {{somewhat}} self-explanatory. Tracts of land were given outright by the states, {{and later by}} the federal government as partial compensation (or [...] "bounty") for service in times of military conflict. Such bounty was also occasionally used by the government to incite men to serve in war or conflicts. Bounty land warrants were issued from the colonial period until 1858, when the program was discontinued, and five years later, in 1863, the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> locate and <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of bounty lands ceased.|$|R

50|$|Under common law, {{specific}} performance {{was not a}} remedy, with the rights of a litigant being limited to the collection of damages. However, the court of equity developed the remedy of {{specific performance}} as damages often could not adequately compensate someone for the inability to own a particular piece of real property, land being regarded as unique. Specific performance is often guaranteed through the remedy of a right of possession, giving the plaintiff the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of the property in dispute.

50|$|This arrangement, {{whereby the}} lender was in theory the {{absolute}} owner, {{but in practice}} had few of the practical rights of ownership, was seen in many jurisdictions as being awkwardly artificial. By statute the common law's position was altered so that the mortgagor (borrower) would retain ownership, but the mortgagee's (lender's) rights, such as foreclosure, the power of sale, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession,</b> would be protected. In the United States, those states that have reformed the nature of mortgages in this way are known as lien states. A similar effect was achieved in England and Wales by the Law of Property Act 1925, which abolished mortgages by the conveyance of a fee simple.|$|E

40|$|In a {{fascinating}} and enigmatic {{passage of the}} Metaphysik der Sitten, Kant produced a definitive methodological change in the justification of the acquisition of what is «mine and thine exterior». This change was introduced {{by means of the}} rational and not empirically verifiable hypothesis of common original acquisition of land: «All men are originally and before any juridical act of will in rightful possession of the soil; that is, they have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be (da Sein) wherever nature or chance has placed them without their will». In this way, the passionate supporter of the acquired -not innate- character of property rights makes room for the only natural right proceeding from the exercise of (external) freedom: the <b>right</b> of mankind <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of a place on the Earth's limited spherical surface. A historical and political interpretation of these passages makes possible to assess the revolutionary consequences of an apparently «minor» methodological change. En un pasaje a la vez críptico y fascinante de la Metaphysik der Sitten, Kant generó un cambio metodológico definitivo para justificar la adquisición de «lo mío y lo tuyo exterior», mediante la hipótesis racional y no empíricamente comprobable de la apropiación originaria común del suelo: «Todos los hombres están originariamente (con anterioridad a todo acto jurídico del arbitrio) en posesión legítima del suelo, es decir, tienen derecho a existir (da Sein) ahí donde (al margen de su voluntad) los han situado la naturaleza o el azar». Es así como el apasionado defensor del carácter adquirido -no innato- del derecho de propiedad deja espacio para un único derecho natural emanado del ejercicio de la libertad (externa) : el derecho de todo el género humano a tomar posesión de un lugar en la superficie esférica y no infinita de la tierra. Una interpretación histórica-política de estos pasajes permitiría evaluar las consecuencias revolucionarias de un cambio metodológico aparentemente «menor»...|$|R

In 1585-1587, he commanded the English army in the Netherlands, and was appointed Governor-General of the Netherlands in 1586 by the Dutch (against Elizabeth's wishes); he gave up his post in December 1587, and was appointed general of the armies to repel the Spanish invasion in 1588, but died shortly after. Sir Christopher Hatton, another favourite, became captain of her bodyguard in 1572, her spokesman in the House of Commons, and was made Lord Chancellor in 1587 despite little legal training, he was also an eminent privy councillor. Sir Walter Raleigh was such a favourite that he was showered with gifts, including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of land in the New World, where he organised the exploration of what would be Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|A UCC-1 {{financing}} statement (an abbreviation for Uniform Commercial Code-1) {{is a legal}} form that a creditor files to give notice that it has or may {{have an interest in}} the personal property of a debtor (a person who owes a debt to the creditor as typically specified in the agreement creating the debt). This form is filed in order to [...] "perfect" [...] a creditor's security interest by giving public notice that there is a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of and sell certain assets for repayment of a specific debt with a certain priority. Such notices of sale are often found in the local newspapers. Once the form has been filed, the creditor establishes a relative priority with other creditors of the debtor. This process is also called [...] "perfecting the security interest" [...] in the property, and this type of loan is a secured loan. [...] A {{financing statement}} may also be filed in the real estate records by a lessor of fixtures to establish the priority of the lessor's rights against a holder of a mortgage or other lien on the real property. The creditor's rights against the debtor and the lessor's rights against the lessee are based on the credit documents and the lease, respectively, and not the financing statement.|$|E

This [...] "consolation of sinners" [...] (with the colophon [...] "Liber Bellial") is a lawsuit between Lucifer and Jesus Christ, Solomon presiding, in which the Devil is suing Christ for having trespassed by descending into Hell. At the first trial Moses is counsel for Jesus Christ and Belial for the Devil. At the second trial the Patriarch Joseph is judge, Aristotle and Isaiah defend Jesus Christ, and the Emperor Augustus and Jeremiah defend the Devil. In both trials the decision is in favor of Christ, but at the second trial the Devil is granted the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of the bodies and souls of the damned at the Last Judgment. This work was printed repeatedly and translated into several languages. A very early edition in German was printed by Albrecht Pfister in Bamberg in the 1460s. The work was later placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. It was printed as late as 1611 at Hanover, as Processus Luciferi contra Iesum coram Iudice Salomone http://www.wierus.com/catalog/processus/.|$|E
40|$|Jacobus da Teramo, an {{excellent}} lawyer and high-ranking {{person in the}} ecclesiastical hierarchy, is known {{for a number of}} prominent scholarly works, but he also wrote (ca. 1382) a narration known under various titles: Consolatio peccatorum, seu Processus Luciferi contra Jesum Christum, Liber Belial, and Processus Luciferu contra Iesum coram Iudice Salomone. This is a lawsuit between Lucifer and Christ, in which Devil sues Christ for having trespassed by descending into Hell and taking many souls with him. At the first trial, Moses speaks for Christ and Belial for Lucifer, and in the second Aristotle and Isaiah defend Christ, while Lucifer is defended by Emperor Augustus and Jeremiah. In both trials, the decision is in favor of Christ, but in the second trial the Devil is granted the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>possession</b> of the bodies and souls of the damned at the Last Judgment. This work was very popular and is still known in many manuscript copies and printed editions. The theme of a trial in extraterrestrial territory performed by famous historical and literary persons was very popular in medieval Europe, and several authors used the motif of a lawsuit involving the Devil and Christ. Da Teramo’s text was translated into German, and it gained broad audiences. He described well the persons and sequences of scenes familiar to him from the courts; his strong descriptions placed the persons in the realm of satire because these descriptions do not lack irony and some psychological teasing. It is also an allegory of the order of the world, presented in a didactic and moralizing tone. It is interesting to realize that, half a century before da Teramo’s Belial, a poem of 2, 438 verses was composed in the parish of Vellach, Austria (Sln. Koroška Bela), yet another proof that this theme was also largely known in Carniola and Carinthia. Moreover, several examples of comparable texts are preserved from Slovenian medieval monasteries...|$|E
