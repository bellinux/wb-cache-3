5|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} built over Toby Creek. One was built in 1920 and <b>repaired</b> in 1989. Another was built in 1928 and <b>repaired</b> in 1963 and a third was built in 1939. Six bridges were built over the creek in 1941, {{all of them in}} Kingston Township or Dallas Township. Another bridge was built over Toby Creek in 1955 and four more were built in 1963, one of which was <b>repaired</b> in 1988. One was built in 1970 and <b>repaired</b> in 1980 and another was built in 1976 and <b>repaired</b> in 1997. Two more bridges were built across the creek in 1980, one more in 1984, and one in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Ten-Go was {{the last}} major Japanese naval {{operation}} of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations {{for the rest of}} the conflict. Suzutsuki was never <b>repaired.</b> Fuyuzuki was <b>repaired</b> but hit a U.S. air-dropped mine at Moji, Japan, on 20 August 1945, and was not subsequently <b>repaired.</b> Yukikaze survived the war almost undamaged. Hatsushimo hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945, near Maizuru, Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war.|$|E

50|$|<b>Repair</b> trades can be {{specified}} for the <b>repair</b> of any element, {{and they}} represent manpower {{in the form of}} a set of skilled maintenance workers with a particular trade. A <b>repair</b> trade can be used for the duration of an element <b>repair</b> (i.e. logistic delay plus a time value drawn from the element <b>repair</b> distribution). On completion of the <b>repair,</b> the <b>Repair</b> Trade becomes available to <b>repair</b> another element. the number of <b>repairs</b> which can be performed simultaneously for elements requiring a particular <b>repair</b> trade depends on the number of <b>repair</b> trade resources allocated and the number of that <b>repair</b> trade specified as a requirement for the <b>repair.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} a new maintenance policy called the delayed <b>repair</b> policy. For delayed <b>repair</b> models, <b>repair</b> facilities are not always available.

In this work, we suppose that the <b>repair</b> facilities are available only during a time interval of the working period. We study this maintenance policy under the designation type I delayed <b>repair</b> policy. We analyze this strategy <b>repair</b> and we obtain bounds for the optimal type I delayed <b>repair</b> policy. Repairable systems, delayed <b>repair...</b>|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{telephone}} service onto {{the island was}} disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and <b>repaired,</b> which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April12, or {{three days after the}} typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was <b>repaired.</b> One power station on the island was <b>repaired,</b> but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.|$|E
5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be <b>repaired</b> or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and <b>repaired</b> were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E

40|$|DNA is {{subjected}} to many endogenous and exogenous damages. All organisms have developed a complex network of DNA <b>repair</b> mechanisms. A variety of different DNA <b>repair</b> pathways have been reported: direct reversal, base excision <b>repair,</b> nucleotide excision <b>repair,</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> and recombination <b>repair</b> pathways. Recent studies of the fundamental mechanisms for DNA <b>repair</b> processes have revealed a complexity beyond that initially expected, with inter- and intrapathway complementation as well as functional interactions between proteins involved in <b>repair</b> pathways.

5|$|All 29 {{items of}} gold {{jewellery}} were analysed, with silver and copper {{found to be}} present.

50|$|Cancer {{cells are}} {{frequently}} deficient in a DNA <b>repair</b> gene. (Also see DNA <b>repair</b> deficiency in cancer.) This DNA <b>repair</b> defect either {{may be due}} to mutation or, often, epigenetic silencing (see epigenetic silencing of DNA <b>repair).</b> If this DNA <b>repair</b> defect is in one of seven DNA <b>repair</b> pathways (see DNA <b>repair</b> pathways), and a compensating DNA <b>repair</b> pathway is inhibited, then the tumor cells may be killed by synthetic lethality.

40|$|Transcription-coupled <b>repair,</b> the {{targeted}} <b>repair</b> of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD 26 and ERCC 6, respectively. Other factors probably are also uniquely involved in transcription-repair coupling. Recently, a defect {{was described in}} transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> for Escherichia coli mismatch <b>repair</b> mutants and human tumor cell lines with mutations in mismatch <b>repair</b> genes. We examined removal of UV-induced DNA damage in yeast strains mutated in mismatch <b>repair</b> genes {{in an effort to}} confirm a defect in transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> in this system. In addition, we determined the contribution of the mismatch <b>repair</b> gene MSH 2 to transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> in the absence of global genomic <b>repair</b> using rad 7 Δ mutants. We also determined whether the Rad 26 -independent transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> observed in rad 26 Δ and rad 7 Δ rad 26 Δ mutants depends on MSH 2 by examining <b>repair</b> deficiencies of rad 26 Δ msh 2 Δ and rad 7 Δ rad 26 Δ msh 2 Δ mutants. We found no defects in transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> caused by mutations in the mismatch <b>repair</b> genes MSH 2, MLH 1, PMS 1, and MSH 3.
