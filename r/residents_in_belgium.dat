30|$|Last but not least, {{repudiation}} {{and distribution}} of the survivor’s pension may create a fairness issue in the west corridors. Moroccan civil law (Mudawana) allows two types of dissolution of marriage: divorce and repudiation. Divorce requires spouses {{to go to the}} Tribunal to formally dissolve the marriage, which can be very costly and time-consuming (Ouali 1992). Repudiation enables one spouse to unilaterally break the contract, which limits costs and duration. This is why men—and in a small number of cases, women—use repudiation more often than divorce. However, repudiation is not always recognized as valid in Belgian civil law for Moroccan <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Belgium.</b> This can lead to a risk of polygamy and can also affect both pension rates and the distribution of the survivor’s pension for spouses.|$|R

Characteristics of nursing homes and residents were collected by a questionnaire survey and were analysed by multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 2791 screened residents in 60 participating nursing home, the weighted prevalence of ESBLE and MRSA carriage were 6. 2 % (range: 0 to 20 %) and 12. 2 % (range: 0 to 36 %), respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} frailty and sarcopenia, by evaluating the prevalence of sarcopenia among frail, pre-frail and robust elderly nursing home <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Belgium.</b> Methods: This is an analysis of baseline data collected from the SENIOR (Sample of Elderly Nursing home Individuals: an Observational Research) cohort. All subjects received a sarcopenia evaluation, based on the definition proposed by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). The frailty evaluation was primarily based on FRIED’s definition but also on 9 other operational definitions. Results: A total of 662 subjects (73. 1 % of women) were included in this analysis (mean age: 83. 2 ± 8. 99 years). The prevalence of sarcopenia was 38. 1 % whereas the prevalence of frail and pre-frail persons was respectively 24. 7 % and 61. 4 %. Among frail, pre-frail and robust subjects, respectively 47 %, 38. 9 % and 16. 3 % were diagnosed sarcopenic.

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between frailty and a large number of indicators related to physical and muscular performance as well as quality of life. Methods This is an analysis of data collected at baseline in the Sample of Elderly Nursing home Individuals: an Observational Research (SENIOR) cohort including nursing home residents. Subjects are volunteer, oriented and able to walk (walking assistance allowed) nursing home <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Belgium.</b> A large number of demographic and clinical characteristics, including physical and muscular performance, were collected from each patient. The prevalence of frailty in this population was assessed using Fried’s definition. Results In total, 662 subjects are included in this analysis. The mean age of the sample is 83. 2 ± 8. 99 years, and 484 (73. 1 %) are women. In this population of nursing home residents, the prevalence of frailty is 25. 1 %, pre-frailty, 59. 8 % and robustness, 15. 1 %. Compared to non-frail subjects, frail subjects have lower physical and muscular performances and a lower quality of life. Conclusion Frailty, according to Fried’s definition, seems to be associated with several clinical indicators suggesting a higher level of disability and an increased propensity to develop major clinical consequences. Follow-up data of the SENIOR cohort will be helpful in confirming these findings, establishing cause–effect relationships and identifying the most predictive components of physical frailty for adverse outcomes in nursing homes.

40|$|Rogers Brubaker {{remarks that}} “as a {{category}} of practice, ‘diaspora’ is used to make claims, to articulate projects, to formulate expectations, to mobilize energies, to appeal to loyal- ties. ” It is {{in times of crisis}} and trauma, we will argue in this paper, that these practices con- struct and intensify an awareness of community, generated by emotion, feelings, and affect. When the 3 / 11 Triple Disaster struck Japan in 2011, Japanese nationals living abroad took a dia- sporic stance and immediately showed their commitment and loyalty to the homeland by organ- izing fundraising and charity events as well as moral support activities. Interpreting these events from the perspective of gift-giving (Marcel Mauss), {{it can be argued that}} remittances and material gifts served to show solidarity of an individual as well as a group to the homeland (furusato) and thus strengthening the feeling of belonging to it. Yet, what is the “homeland” that they support? The idea of homeland is a concept that is culturally and thus historically negotiated, and dia- sporic communities tend to develop a romantic idea of it. In Japanese, the English term “home- land” would be captured by the term furusato, which already embraces a strong element of nos- talgia and memory (similar to the German “Heimat”). It originally refers to one’s place of birth and is recently used to point to the “idea of originary, emotive space. ” Based on fifteen in-depth interviews with both short-term and long-term Japanese <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Belgium,</b> this paper sets out to analyze the effect the triple disaster of 2011 had on the Japanese diasporic communities in Belgium...|$|E

Despite the legalization, what can we say about adults’ attitudes? This study is part of an international project, and aims at studying the attitudes towards different kind of same-sex constellations – single gays and lesbians, couples, and families – and at examining the correlates to those attitudes. Attitudes were assessed through self-report questionnaires in a cohort of 366 heterosexual participants <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Belgium,</b> 72 % females and 28 % males aged from 26 to 40 (age class corresponding to transition lifecycle and parenting choices). Participants were asked to answer socio-demographic questions and to self-report their contact with homosexual people (frequency and satisfaction). Then different scales assessed their attitudes toward homosexuality (General Attitudes Toward Homosexuality, Da Costa, 2011; ATLG, Herek), same-sex marriage (Katuzny Scale on Same-Sex Marriage, 2012) and different types of same¬-sex parenting – adoption, alternative insemination, in vitro, ovocyte donation (D’Amore & Green Homoparentality Scale, 2012). It is hypothesized that correlates to positive attitudes will be associated with female gender, lower religiosity, non-protestant religions, liberal political ideology, and higher education and socioeconomic status.

40|$|Background: Providing {{good quality}} {{care for the}} growing number of {{patients}} with dementia is a major challenge. There is little international comparative research on how people with dementia die in nursing homes. We compared the relative's judgment on quality of care {{at the end of life}} and quality of dying of nursing home <b>residents</b> with dementia <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> and the Netherlands. Methods: This was a Belgian cross-sectional retrospective study (2010) combined with a prospective and retrospective study from the Netherlands (January 2007 -July 2011). Relatives of deceased residents of 69 Belgian and 34 Dutch nursing homes were asked to complete questionnaires. We included 190 and 337 deceased nursing home <b>residents</b> with dementia <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> and the Netherlands, respectively. Results: Of all identified deceased nursing home residents with dementia, respectively 53. 2 % and 74. 8 % of their relatives <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> and the Netherlands responded. Comfort while dying (CAD-EOLD, range 14 - 42) was rated better for Dutch nursing home residents than for Belgian nursing homes residents (26. 1 vs. 31. 1, OR 4. 5, CI 1. 8 - 11. 2). We found no differences between countries regarding Satisfaction With Care (SWC-EOLD, range 10 - 40, means 32. 5 (the Netherlands) and 32. 0 (Belgium)) or symptom frequency in the last month of life (SM-EOLD, range 0 - 45, means 26. 4 (the Netherlands) and 27. 2 (Belgium)). Conclusion: Although nursing home structures differ between Belgium and the Netherlands, the quality of care in the last month of life for residents with dementia is similar according to their relatives. However, Dutch residents experience less discomfort while dying.

40|$|Context: <b>In</b> <b>Belgium,</b> data {{on actual}} advance care {{planning}} (ACP) {{in nursing homes}} (NHs) are scarce. Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of documented advance directives and physicians' orders for end-of-life care in NHs, and the authorization of a legal representative {{in relation to the}} residents' demographic and clinical characteristics and care received. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, including all NH residents deceased during September and October 2006 in all 594 NHs <b>in</b> Flanders, <b>Belgium.</b> Structured mail questionnaires about the resident's characteristics, hospital transfers, palliative care delivery, ACPs, and authorization of legal representatives were completed via the NH administrators and nurses involved in the care of the resident. Results: Administrators of 318 NHs (53. 5 %) reported 1303 deaths. Nurses provided information about 1240 (95. 2 %) of these deaths. At the end of life, NH residents often had dementia (65. 2 %) and were severely dependent (76. 1 %). Almost half (43. 1 %) had at least one hospital transfer during the last three months of life and two-thirds received palliative care. Half had an ACP, predominantly a physician's order and less often an advance directive. Having advance directives or physician's orders was associated with receiving palliative care. Residents with a physician's order more often died in the NH. Nine percent had an authorized legal representative. Conclusion: Prevalence of ACPs and formal authorization of a legal representative was low among the deceased NH <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> Flanders, <b>Belgium.</b> There was a higher prevalence of physicians' orders, often established after the resident had lost capacity. Initiatives should be developed to stimulate more advance discussion on care options and making end-of-life decision with the residents while they retain capacity. © 2013 U. S.

METHODS: In the Brussels region, children {{in the first grade}} at the same schools were sampled in cohort 1983 (n = 396) and cohort 1998 (n = 473). Caries experience of Belgian and non-Belgian nationals was summarized in dmf scores. The socioeconomic status of the children was established based on their parents' education and profession. The children were categorized in eight subgroups in relation to their socioeconomic status, ethnic origin and cohort (SESEC subgroups). RESULTS: The percentage of caries-free children increased significantly from 31. 5 % to 47. 5 %. A reduction was observed in the dmft scores from 3. 9 to 2. 3 (P < 0. 001) and in the dmfs scores from 6. 9 to 5. 0 (P < 0. 001). The odds ratio of being caries-free was 2. 5 times higher for privileged children and 2. 3 times higher for children belonging to cohort 1998.
