25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the <b>return</b> <b>key,</b> and the shift key.|$|E
2500|$|Most Selectric IIIs and Electronic Typewriters {{only had}} keys for 92 {{printable}} characters; the 96-character keyboard was an optional feature. [...] Fitting the additional keys onto the keyboard required shrinking the <b>Return</b> <b>key</b> and Backspace keys. This was annoying to many typists, {{so it was}} not the default configuration. The keytops on the Selectric III and Electronic Typewriters were larger and more square than those on earlier Selectrics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{operator}} of a Wang 1200 typed text on a conventional IBM Selectric keyboard; when the <b>Return</b> <b>key</b> was pressed, {{the line of}} text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text, and could be [...] "played back" [...] (e.g., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on continuous-form paper in the 1200 typewriter's [...] "print" [...] mode. The stored text could also be edited, using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, Koplow's {{interface}} {{program was}} developed into the Wang 1200 Word Processor, an IBM Selectric-based text-storage device.

5000|$|... "I wasnt {{thrilled with}} the {{placement}} of left Shift and <b>Return</b> <b>keys,</b> either", IBMs Don Estridge stated in 1983.

50|$|On some {{keyboard}} layouts, {{the return}} and enter key {{are two different}} keys, an artifact of the differing handling of newlines by different operating systems. As an example, on the Macintosh, the <b>return</b> <b>key</b> is the usual key, while the enter key is positioned at the lower right of the numeric key pad. While using the type tool in Adobe Photoshop, the <b>return</b> <b>key</b> produces a new line while the enter key ends editing mode.|$|E
50|$|In Mathematica, the <b>Return</b> <b>key</b> {{creates a}} new line, whereas the Enter key (or Shift-Return) submits the current command for execution.|$|E

5000|$|On {{computer}} keyboards, the {{enter key}} (or the <b>return</b> <b>key</b> on Macs and most Sun Workstations) {{in most cases}} causes a command line, window form, or dialog box to operate its default function.

We find that some modeling assumptions risk being institutionalized, and suggest a renewed exploration of industrial practice.
