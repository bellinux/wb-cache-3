Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models.

The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible <b>rollover</b> <b>risk</b> following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn.

50|$|Debt {{sustainability}} {{is a major}} issue, {{particularly for}} countries facing higher public debts, such as what most advanced economies are currently experiencing. These countries are vulnerable to <b>rollover</b> <b>risks</b> as maturing debt obligations could become more expensive to refinance considering that investors will demand significant premium {{to compensate for the}} greater risks that they will be assuming. The punitive action of the market through higher borrowing costs will {{make it more difficult for}} these countries to service their obligations, creating a vicious cycle of debt trap. This could be aggravated when governments planning to undertake unpopular measures that will increase revenues and/or reduce public expenditures face political backlash that render them not politically feasible.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} the liabilities {{model of the}} Exchange Fund Account (EFA). The EFA is managed using an asset-liability matching framework that requires currency and duration matching of {{both sides of the}} balance sheet. The model chooses the mix of liabilities across instruments and tenors that maximizes the return of the fund subject to a fixed asset-allocation rule and duration matching. The model considers two types of instruments: cross-currency swaps and global bonds. The main trade-off in the model is the cost advantage of cross-currency swaps relative to global bond issuance. Cross-currency swaps are, on average, a cheaper source of funding, but carry counterparty risk. The model penalizes a skewed maturity profile of liabilities because it carries <b>rollover</b> <b>risks.</b> The model also reports the implied asset-liability gap, which {{is a function of the}} total amount of cross-currency swaps.

40|$|Bank {{liability}} guarantee schemes {{have traditionally been}} viewed as costless measures to shore up investor confidence and prevent bank runs. However, as the experiences of some European countries, most notably Ireland, have demonstrated, the credibility and effectiveness of these guarantees are crucially intertwined with the sovereign's funding risks. Employing methods from the literature on global games, we develop a simple model to explore the systemic linkage between the <b>rollover</b> <b>risks</b> of a bank and a government, which are connected through the government's guarantee of bank liabilities. We show the existence and uniqueness of the joint equilibrium and derive its comparative static properties. In solving for the optimal guarantee numerically, we show how its credibility can be improved through policies that promote balance-sheet transparency. We explain the asymmetry in risk transfer between the sovereign and the banking sector, following {{the introduction of a}} guarantee as being attributed to the resolution of strategic uncertainties held by bank depositors and the opacity of the banks' balance sheets...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} unified {{structural}} credit risk model incorporating both insolvency and illiquidity risks, {{in order to}} investigate how a firm's default probability depends on the liquidity risk associated with its financing structure. We assume the firm finances its risky assets by mainly issuing short- and long-term debt. Short-term debt can have either a discrete or a more realistic staggered tenor structure. At rollover dates of short-term debt, creditors face a dynamic coordination problem. We show that a unique threshold strategy (i. e., a debt run barrier) exists for short-term creditors to decide when to withdraw their funding, and this strategy {{is closely related to}} the solution of a non-standard optimal stopping time problem with control constraints. We decompose the total credit risk into an insolvency component and an illiquidity component based on such an endogenous debt run barrier together with an exogenous insolvency barrier.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} impact of {{environmental}} variables on firms’ capital structure throughout the recent financial crises (dot. com bubble, subprime crisis, and European sovereign debt crisis). For the first time, the sovereign general gross debt and current account balance appear in the debate, revealing evidence that the sovereign’s irrational exuberance of debt has been mimicked by firms. The proposed approach revealed two important trends, broadly consistent throughout those disturbed episodes. Under stress firms firstly increase leverage and rely, or are forced to rely, secondly on short-term borrowings, heightening <b>rollover</b> <b>risks.</b> Altogether, the pronounced outbreak of those crises had on its own the seeds of a new one. Regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, {{the presence of an}} asymmetric shock was noticed, with the periphery and the centre of the European Union being targeted with different magnitudes.

40|$|Risks {{to global}} {{financial}} stability have declined since the October 2010 Global Financial Stability Report, helped {{in part by}} improving macroeconomic conditions. However, sovereign balance sheets remain under strain in many advanced economies, structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the euro area pose significant risks to bank balance sheets, credit risks remain high, and capital inflows to emerging markets could strain their absorptive capacity. Many advanced economies are struggling with the legacy of high debt and excessive leverage. High debt levels are evident {{in many parts of}} the global economy, including households with negative equity, banks with thin capital buffers and uncertain asset quality, and sovereigns facing debt sustainability challenges. Sovereign balance sheets are under strain in many advanced economies. As long as sovereign funding concerns persist, investors are likely to have a diminished appetite for riskier credits, in turn driving up funding costs and posing <b>rollover</b> <b>risks.</b> Economies with higher marginal funding costs and larger nearterm financing needs are most vulnerable.

40|$|We {{construct}} a new monthly dataset for UK government debt {{over the period}} 1694 to 2017 based on price and quantity data for each individual bond issued. This enables us to examine long run fiscal sustainability using the theoretically relevant variable of {{the market value of}} debt, and investigate the historical importance of debt management. We find the general implications of the tax smoothing literature are replicated in our data, especially around financing wars, although we find major shifts over time in how fiscal sustainability is achieved. Before the 20 th century, governments continued to pay bond holders a high rate of return and achieved sustainability through running fiscal surpluses but since then governments have relied on low growth adjusted real interest rates. The optimal debt management literature tends to favour the use of long bonds but we find the government {{would have been better off}} over the 20 th century issuing short bonds. The contrast with the literature occurs because of an upward sloping yield curve and long bonds rarely providing fiscal insurance. This is particularly true during periods of financial crises when falling interest rates lead to sharp rises in the price of long bonds, making them an expensive form of finance. We examine the robustness of our conclusions to liquidity effects, <b>rollover</b> <b>risks,</b> buyback operations and leverage. In general, these do suggest a greater role for long bonds but do not overturn an issuance strategy based mainly on short term bonds.
