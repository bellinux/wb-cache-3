50|$|A {{sideways}} roll is {{also known}} as a log <b>roll,</b> <b>barrel</b> roll, or pencil roll. This can be started by lying down on the back or front with the body outstretched. The gymnast then rolls onto their side and does a complete rotation of the body, remaining parallel to the performing surface. The log roll is a sideways roll with the hands next to the waist and the pencil roll is with the hands stretched above the head. A sideways roll can also be performed when a gymnast over-rotates or loses their balance in a vertical, forward or sideways direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{magnetic}} method of steel mechanical properties and microstructure {{has been applied}} in {{the territory of the}} former USSR since early 70 s. The main principles of this testing are described in the standard GOST 30415 - 96 “The steel. The NDT of mechanical properties and microstructure of steel articles by magnetic technique”. The method is widely applied so it is completely presented in special literature. The present work describes the method application in iron and steel industry, particularly in a roll state testing. The following tasks are fulfilled by means of testing of structural stressed state of a <b>roll</b> <b>barrel</b> surface layers: 1. Accomplishment of incoming control of a roll structural stressed state before its service life starting. Incoming control makes it possible to reveal a roll residual stress caused by a supplier’s methodical violations. 2. Diagnosis of abnormal areas in a <b>roll</b> <b>barrel</b> working layer which appeared due to the roll damage in the run of operation. 3. Determination of the optimal depth of re-grinding which guarantees removal of layers with intolerable level of accumulated residual stress. Calculation of residual resource of each roll that allows to define optimal amount of roll inventory. Diagnostics of preparation and installation defects of rolls in the rolling mill stands. Optimal stress redistribution in multi-stand mills. Magnetic monitoring makes it possible to reduce roll consumption per a tonne of rolled products, to increase a roll service life and to improve geometric characteristics of rolled products...|$|E
40|$|The mathematic {{model of}} CVC-Plus work roll curve is built. The {{ratio of the}} initial {{shifting}} value to the target crown is determined, and the mathematical model considering {{the relationship between the}} coefficients A 2, A 3, A 4, A 5 and is established. According to the theoretical analysis, the distance between the maximum or minimum point of the high order equivalent crown for work roll with CVC-plus roll curve and the rolling central point is the times of the <b>roll</b> <b>barrel</b> length. In general, the initial shifting value of the CVC-plus roll curve is not equal to the initial shifting value of the 3 -order CVC roll curve. The coefficient A 1 can also be obtained by optimizing the target function with minimizing the axial force...|$|E
50|$|The {{counter to}} a break is often a {{displacement}} <b>roll</b> called a <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> attack. A <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> consists of performing a roll and a loop, completing {{both at the same}} time. The result is a helical roll around a straight flight path. The <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> attack uses a much tighter loop than the roll, completing a full loop while only executing 3/4 of a roll. The result is a virtual 90 degree turn, using all three dimensions, in the direction opposite of the roll. Rolling away from the defender's break, the attacker completes the roll with the aircraft's nose pointed {{in the direction of the}} defender's travel.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{influential}} parameters affecting the work roll wear are investigated. Essential theories related to work roll wear predictions are explained. The wear profile prediction after a rolling program {{is related to}} the material tonnage rolled. The <b>roll</b> <b>barrel</b> was divided into a number of equal segments and for each segment, the passed tonnage is obtained according to the whole tonnages and the widths of the strip in a rolling program. This is used as the input data for the neural network training while the output is the quantity of wear for each segment. A large number of experimental results were acquired from the roll surface graphs in the grinding machine of the roll shop unit in a steel company and the training is performed using the real work roll wear graphs. The present model can easily and quickly predict the roll wear. Predicted wear graphs are found to be in good agreement with the industrial measured values...|$|E
40|$|The {{heavy plate}} rolling process needs {{accurate}} {{predictions of the}} process parameters. The plate thickness, flatness and rolling stability are of this direct influenced {{as well as the}} productivity. Therefore, careful calculation of the process parameters and pass schedules is necessary. The thesis is concerned with two aspects of controlling rolling; the choice of optimal pass schedules and roll wear. A software has been developed in Paper A to determine optimal pass schedules for thermomechanical rolling in order to obtain a fine microstructure. It includes models of the effect of strain, precipitates, static and dynamic recrystallization and austenite grain size on the final grain size. The predicted grain sizes for four different cases were compared with experimental results. It was also used to study the effect of different delay times during the pass schedule of rolling thermomechanical plate. The results shows that an increase in delay times results in finer ferrite grains are received. The refinement is however small for long delay times. Long delay times also affect the productivity negatively. A method for modeling of the work roll contour in a four high mill is presented in Paper B. The active parameters were found to be the plate length and the variations of the pressure from the plate and the back-up roll on the work roll along the work <b>roll</b> <b>barrel.</b> The method is build up with statistical methods. The bases for the statistics are simulations of different rolling cases and measurements from the production of heavy plates in Oxelösund. The proposed wear contour model was found to be in good agreement with the measurements from the production. Godkänd; 2006; 20061206 (pafi...|$|E
5000|$|A high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> is {{a last-ditch}} {{defensive}} maneuver, performed when the attacker {{has achieved a}} suitable firing solution. The maneuver is performed when the attacker is very close, and a <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> performed by the defender may cause an overshoot. The maneuver begins by cutting the throttle, extending the speed brakes, or turning very hard to encourage an overshoot. The maneuver is then executed by applying excessive elevator pressure and hard rudder input during the <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> {{to assist with the}} roll. The sudden change in the relative forward speed may cause a surprised attacker to fly {{out in front of the}} defender. Depending on the situation, a high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> can be performed [...] "over the top," [...] by beginning the roll like a normal <b>barrel</b> <b>roll.</b> The roll can also be performed [...] "underneath," [...] by doing a half aileron roll into the inverted position and beginning the <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> while upside-down.|$|R

5000|$|A high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> is a {{combination}} of a loop and a snap roll. A high g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> is a last-ditch defensive maneuver, performed when the attacker has achieved a suitable guns solution, in order to cause an overshoot. The high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> is a violent maneuver which is performed much more aggressively than a normal <b>barrel</b> <b>roll.</b> Range is {{critical to the success of}} the roll, and the defender will usually turn very hard, or employ other measures to draw the opponent very close before performing the roll. The roll is executed by applying hard back-stick pressure, creating the high g-forces, and adding hard rudder input to assist the ailerons in rolling the fighter. A high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> can be performed [...] "over-the-top", or it can be performed [...] "underneath", which is accomplished by rolling upside-down and beginning the maneuver from the inverted position. The high-g <b>barrel</b> <b>roll</b> is an energy-depleting maneuver that rarely causes the attacker to fly out in front, but usually will result in a flight path overshoot, a flat scissors, or, at the very least, will temporarily disrupt the attacker's aim.|$|R

The attacker pulls back on the stick more than a normal <b>barrel</b> <b>roll,</b> performing a tighter loop than the roll.
