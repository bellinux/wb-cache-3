25|$|Baggott {{felt that}} the CERN people were getting <b>really</b> <b>close</b> to {{discovering}} the Higgs boson and approached his editor about writing on the topic. His idea was to start writing the book, get about 95% done, and then, when the discovery was announced, {{he would be able}} to finish the last 5% and the book would be on the shelves very soon after the announcement. Throughout 2011 and 2012 he kept updating the book, leaving the last 1,500 words unsaid. He watched CERN's live webcast announce the discovery of the boson on July 4 and finished writing the book the next day.|$|E

So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe.

25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come <b>really</b> <b>close</b> together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

The singer wanted to take more opportunities and learn more about herself, which she often let go when in a relationship, but felt that she was in a now-or-never situation. Milian described Lyon as an amazing guy, and said that although there was a chance for the couple in the future, she needed to focus on herself.|$|E

[...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it.

500|$|Rather than {{create a}} typical [...] "save-the-world" [...] {{story with a}} large cast, Futatsugi wanted to {{concentrate}} on {{a small number of}} characters [...] "who you are <b>really</b> <b>close</b> to", which he felt would make the story more meaningful. An early version had Edge as an imperial soldier who defects; Craymen also had an extensive backstory, explaining his motivations for betraying the Empire. Both stories were cut for time. Although Edge is not a silent protagonist, Futatsugi minimized his dialogue outside cutscenes to focus on Azel's story, who he felt was the most important character. Sega estimated that the game's dialogue amounted to over 1,500 pages of Japanese text. Like the other Panzer Dragoon games, Saga features a fictional language, [...] "Panzerese", which combines elements of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian; Saga only features Panzerese in the introduction sequence, {{with the rest of the}} dialogue in Japanese, subtitled in English for the western release.|$|E

[...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent.
