40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{extension}} of a two-dimensional, axisymmetric, Timoshenko-beam finite-element rotordynamic code to include a three-dimensional non-axisymmetric solid-element casing model. Axisymmetric beams are sufficient to model <b>rotors.</b> <b>Spring</b> and damper forces provide the interface between the rotor and its casing and capture the dynamics of the full model. However, axisymmetric beams limit the modeling of real-case machine structures, where the casing is not axisymmetric. Axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric 3 D finite element casing structures are modeled. These structures are then reduced using a technique called substructuring. Modal equations are developed for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric casing models. In a 3 D non-axisymmetric model, structural dynamics modes can be modeled by lateral modes in two orthogonal planes. Modal information of the complex 3 D casing structures are generated, and then incorporated into the 2 D code after a series of pre-processing steps. A reduction method called Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) is used to reduce the large dimensionality involved in calculation of rotordynamic coefficients. The results from the casing structures are merged with the rotor model to create a combined rotor-casing model. The analysis of the combined structure shows that there is a difference in the natural frequencies and unbalance response between the model that uses symmetrical casing and the one that uses non-axisymmetric casing. XLTRC 2 is used {{as an example of a}} two-dimensional axisymmetric beam-element code. ANSYS is used as a code to build three-dimensional non-axisymmetric solid-element casing models. The work done in this thesis opens the scope to incorporate complex non-axisymmetric casing models with XLTRC 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{derivation}} of coupled flap-lag equations {{of motion}} for a rigid articulated <b>rotor</b> with hinge <b>springs</b> and viscous dampers is reported. Three different flapping-lag-pitch hinge sequences are considered and the Lagrange method is used to derive the equations. The effects of the complete six degrees-of-freedom aircraft motions are included and all the inertia dynamic terms are retained; no small-angle assumptions {{are used in the}} development. Comparisons of the results with those available in the literature are made. Sources of terms missing in previous analyses, especially those of the inertia dynamics, are identified...|$|R
40|$|A new mechanism, an elastically coupled tri-rotor system, is {{proposed}} to implement synchronization. It {{is composed of}} a rigid body, three induction motors, coupling unit and springs. According to the Lagrange equation, {{the model of the}} system is established. The average method of small parameters is applied to study the synchronization characteristics of the system, therefore, the balance equation and stability criterion of the system can be obtained. Obviously, many parameters affect the synchronous state of the <b>rotors,</b> especially the <b>spring</b> stiffness, the stiffness of the coupling unit and the installation location of the system. Finally, computer simulations are used to verify the correctness of theoretical analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the experimental evaluation of performance of squeeze film dampers without centralizing retaining <b>springs.</b> <b>Rotor</b> amplitudes in the damper plane and damping coefficient {{have been considered}} to assess the system performance. Tests were conducted on two damper configurations that were {{to go in the}} rotor assembly of a certain gas turbine engine. Land width and film thickness were varied, and experiments were conducted for different values of excitation frequency, oil supply pressure, and unbalance. The test program showed that the parameters are to be individually optimized to obtain better overall performance in the damper systems without centralizing springs. The damper configurations subjected to severe dynamic conditions due to unbalance on overhung mass were also experimentally analyzed...|$|R

The experiment was conducted {{with the help of}} a subsonic wind tunnel together with the experimental set-up of the vane type <b>rotor</b> and a <b>spring</b> balance. To ensure a Reynolds number independent approach, different stream flow was maintained. The flow velocities varied from 5 m/s to 9 m/s covering the Reynolds number from 0. 6375 X 10 5 to 1. 2 X 10 5. A four, five and six bladed vertical axis vane type rotor was used to determine the aerodynamic properties in dynamic condition. It is found that the power coefficient increases with increasing the number of blade but the significant effect of even and odd number blade is observed on the range of tip speed ratio. An odd number bladed rotor covered a wide range of tip speed ratio compare to the even number one...|$|R
50|$|In July 1754, Russian Mikhail Lomonosov had {{developed}} a small coaxial modeled after the Chinese top but powered by a wound-up spring device and demonstrated it to the Russian Academy of Sciences. It was powered by a spring, and was suggested as a method to lift meteorological instruments. In 1783, Christian de Launoy, and his mechanic, Bienvenu, used a coaxial version of the Chinese top in a model consisting of contrarotating turkey flight feathers as rotor blades, and in 1784, demonstrated it to the French Academy of Sciences. Sir George Cayley, influenced by a childhood fascination with the Chinese flying top, developed a model of feathers, {{similar to that of}} Launoy and Bienvenu, but powered by rubber bands. By the end of the century, he had progressed to using sheets of tin for <b>rotor</b> blades and <b>springs</b> for power. His writings on his experiments and models would become influential on future aviation pioneers. Alphonse PÃ©naud would later develop coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870, also powered by rubber bands. One of these toys, given as a gift by their father, would inspire the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of flight.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} response of a diatomic periodic chain of <b>rotors</b> coupled by <b>springs,</b> whose unit cell breaks spatial inversion symmetry. In the continuum description, we derive a nonlinear field theory which admits topological kinks and antikinks as nonlinear excitations but where a topological boundary term breaks the symmetry {{between the two}} and energetically favors the kink configuration. Using a cobweb plot, we develop a fixed-point analysis for the kink motion and demonstrate that kinks propagate without the Peierls-Nabarro potential energy barrier typically associated with lattice models. Using continuum elasticity theory, we trace {{the absence of the}} Peierls-Nabarro barrier for the kink motion to the topological boundary term which ensures that only the kink configuration, and not the antikink, costs zero potential energy. Further, we study the eigenmodes around the kink and antikink configurations using a tangent stiffness matrix approach appropriate for pre-stressed structures to explicitly show how the usual energy degeneracy between the two no longer holds. We show how the kink-antikink asymmetry also manifests in the way these nonlinear excitations interact with impurities introduced in the chain as disorder in the spring stiffness. Finally, we discuss the effect of impurities in the (bond) spring length and build prototypes based on simple linkages that verify our predictions. Comment: 20 pages, 21 figure...|$|R

40|$|Cracked <b>rotors</b> have {{nonlinear}} <b>spring</b> {{characteristics of}} a piecewise linear type due to an open-closed mechanism of cracks. There have been many studies on the dynamic behaviour of cracked rotors {{in order to develop}} fault diagnosis systems for detecting cracks. However, most of these studies concern the change in resonance phe-nomena mainly due to cracks in rotor systems with linear supports. In many practical rotor systems, various kinds of nonlinear spring characteristics may exist due to mechanical elements, such as nonlinear bearing sup-ports, and the rotor systems become nonlinear. Therefore, existing fault diagnosis systems are unable to detect cracks in such nonlinear rotor systems which are supported by nonlinear bearings. In this paper, we study the vi-brational behaviour of a cracked rotor with nonlinear bearing supports and focus on the effect of combined reso-nances caused by a crack and nonlinear bearing supports. In particular, we investigate in detail the resonance phenomena of a harmonic resonance and a II 2 -order subharmonic resonance by numerical simulations using a PWL model and theoretical solutions using a PS model. The results show that the dynamic behaviours of a cracked rotor in a nonlinear rotor system are obviously different from those in a rotor system with linear sup-ports, and the change in vibrational behaviour of a harmonic resonance and a 1 ! 2 -order subharmonic resonance are significant due to changes of angular positions of an unbalance. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Actuators convert {{electrical}} {{signals and}} energy into motion of some kind. The three most common types of actuators are electrostatic, thermal, and magnetic. Electrostatic actuators use {{the force of}} electrostatic energy to move objects. Two mechanical elements, one that is stationary (the stator) {{and one that is}} movable (the rotor) have two different voltages applied to them, which creates an electric field. The field competes with a restoring force on the <b>rotor</b> (usually a <b>spring</b> force produced by the bending or stretching of the rotor) to move the rotor. The greater the electric field, the farther the rotor will move. Thermal actuators use the force of thermal expansion to move objects. When a material is heated, it expands an amount depending on material properties. Two objects can be connected {{in such a way that}} one object is heated more than the other and expands more, and this imbalance creates motion. The direction of motion depends on the connection between the objects.This is seen in a [...] "heatuator", which is a U-shaped beam with one wide arm and one narrow arm. When a current is passed through the object, heat is created. The narrow arm is heated more than the wide arm because they have the same current density. Since the two arms are connected at the top, the stretching hot arm pushes in the direction of the cold arm. Magnetic actuators used fabricated magnetic layers to create forces.|$|R
