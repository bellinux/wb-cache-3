25|$|Uncured rubber is {{used for}} cements; for adhesive, insulating, and {{friction}} tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. Vulcanized rubber has many more applications. <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>abrasion</b> makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.|$|E
25|$|At 178-180°C, {{the melting}} point of nylon 12 {{is the lowest}} among the {{important}} polyamides. Its mechanical properties, such as hardness, tensile strength, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>abrasion,</b> {{are similar to those}} of nylon 6 and nylon 66. Low water absorption and density, 1.01 g/mL, result from its relatively long hydrocarbon chain length, which also confers it dimensional stability and an almost paraffin-like structure. Nylon 12 is also chemical resistant and insensitive to stress cracking.|$|E
25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>abrasion</b> and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with active metal such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E

2500|$|A bird's {{feathers}} undergo {{wear and}} tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending {{on the stage of}} growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>abrasion.</b> One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action of bacteria on pigmentations of two song sparrow species and observed that the darker pigmented feathers were more resistant; the authors cited other research also published in 2004 that stated increased melanin provided greater resistance. [...] They observed that the greater resistance of the darker birds confirmed Gloger's rule.|$|E

30|$|Degradation of coarse {{aggregates}} {{was considered}} {{as one of the}} primary reasons for the decreased mechanical properties of concretes under elevated temperature. The <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>abrasion</b> and impact of all these three aggregates decreased with increasing temperature. Limestone and granite yielded the highest and the lowest loss by abrasion, respectively.

50|$|Tool steel {{refers to}} a variety of carbon and alloy steels that are {{particularly}} well-suited to be made into tools.

40|$|Two {{series of}} {{composite}} resins were prepared with a light-cured urethane dimethacrylate matrix to which varying amounts of two types of silanated silica particles were added. One series contained volume fractions ranging from 15. 8 to 28. 8 % silica particles of 20 nm in diameter (Type I filler) and the other series volume fractions offrom 24 to 49. 4 % of an agglomerated silica particle of 40 nm in diameter (Type II filler).

Analysis of the data obtained for these two microfilled series indicate that increased filler levels result in trends for increased depth of cure, color stability, hardness, compressive strength, and stiffness, while water sorption and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both toothbrush <b>abrasion</b> and wear by hydroxyapatite were reduced. These trends were more pronounced for the Type II filler series than for the Type I filler series. However, there was a greater differential in filler levels within the Type II series than within the Type I series...|$|R
