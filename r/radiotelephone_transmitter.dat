2500|$|During World War One the U.S. {{government}} had prohibited {{the operation of}} radio transmitters by civilians, and the ban wasn't lifted until October 1, 1919. Shortly thereafter, Doubleday-Hill's radio department manager, Francis C. Potts, announced {{that the company was}} in the process of installing a De Forest <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>transmitter,</b> to be used for communication with a second station to be located at the company's branch store in Washington, D.C. A month later, in late November, Potts reported that the company had been unable to obtain the commercial license needed to operate the business plan, however, [...] "a special amateur license has been applied for, to cover the wireless telephone demonstration station which the company has ordered installed and which is expected to be opened in the near future".|$|E
5000|$|To {{realize his}} idea of distributing {{entertainment}} by radio, Herrold first needed to perfect a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>transmitter.</b> He was not unique in this endeavor. Although he would later claim that only he had conceived of entertainment broadcasting, there were actually a few others who had speculated about the possibilities. On December 21, 1906, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated an alternator-transmitter of his own design, and one reviewer noted that it was [...] "admirably adapted to the transmission of news, music, etc. as, owing {{to the fact that}} no wires are needed, simultaneous transmission to many subscribers can be effected as easily as to a few". However, Fessenden would almost exclusively focus on point-to-point transmissions intended to supplement the wire telephone system.|$|E
5000|$|The Benwood Company {{was a small}} {{electrical}} firm, {{specializing in}} radio, that was named after its co-founders, the companys president William E. Woods, and vice president Lester Arthur [...] "Eddie" [...] Benson. On election night November 2, 1920, the two broadcast election results provided by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper, over a <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>transmitter</b> operated at Woods home at 4312 De Tonty Street. (At least two other stations made election night broadcasts, {{both of which were}} more widely publicized: one by the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing company at East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under a Special Amateur authorization, 8ZZ (now KDKA), and the other over the Detroit News [...] "Detroit News Radiophone" [...] station, operating under an amateur station authorization, 8MK (now WWJ).) ...|$|E
50|$|An FCC GROL is {{required}} to adjust, maintain, or internally repair FCC licensed <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>transmitters</b> in the aviation, maritime, and international fixed public radio services. It conveys all of the operating authority of the Marine Radio Operator Permit (MP). It is also required to operate the following: any compulsorily equipped ship radiotelephone station operating with more than 1500 watts of peak envelope power, a voluntarily equipped ship or an aeronautical (including aircraft) stations with more than 1000 watts of peak envelope power. Until 2013, a GROL was required also for international fixed public radiotelegraph and radiotelephone stations, including a HF broadcast station such as the Voice of America, but NOT U.S. based MW stations.|$|R

50|$|During {{the first}} two decades of radio development, {{transmissions}} were primarily made by spark-gap transmitters, which were only capable of sending Morse code dots-and-dashes. Power {{recognized the importance of}} the recent invention of vacuum tube transmitters, which could be used for audio transmissions. He also came up with an imaginative demonstration to a key investor for his new company. Power had previously worked as a radio operator on the Morgan family's steam yacht Corsair. On March 18, 1916, as the Philadelphia approached the United States from a European voyage, he contacted the ship and over a three hour period transmitted a concert to showcase his <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>transmitter</b> for banker J. P. Morgan, Jr., who was the son of the late famed millionaire John Pierpont Morgan. The younger Morgan was duly impressed, and became AMRAD's primary sponsor.|$|E
