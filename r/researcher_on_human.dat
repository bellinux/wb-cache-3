In another study when A 549 cells were exposed to SW-CNTs at 250 – 500  µg/ml for 72  h, it resulted in oxidative response and membrane damage, induced by inflammatory response [111]. Another study reported suppression of inflammatory mediators including IL- 6, IL- 8 and MCP- 1 in vitro [112]. The effects of multi-wall carbon nanotube were also evaluated <b>on</b> <b>human</b> epidermal keratinocytes [74]. It was suggested that toxicity induced by multi-wall carbon nanotubes is mediated by pro-inflammatory effects which are facilitated by NF-κB and ROS [113]. In vitro studies reported various toxicological effects of MW-CNTs including oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis in mammalian cells lines. Other effects include VE-cadherin distribution and actin filament integrity in human aortic endothelial cells [114, 115, 116, 117, 118].|$|R
40|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>on</b> <b>human</b> {{body heat}} {{conductivity}} variability in population have given some {{reasons to believe}} that probably dark skin pigmentation of early humans in Africa occurred {{not only as a}} means of organism protection against ultraviolet radiation, but as a means able to provide supplementary energy (solar heat) for maintenance of temperature homeostasis in a body. Dark pigmentation has acquired such value also {{due to the fact that}} by that time our remote ancestors’ skin was deprived of hair. Early non hairy hominids being homoeothermic organisms should somehow maintain relatively constant level of core temperature. However, early humans not always were able to find sufficient food in order to fully provide organism’s energy demands, including thermoregulation needs. In such conditions organism could compensate energy deficiency through solar radiation. Though thermal energy penetrated into a body through skin is not used for useful physiological work performance in organism (for instance, does not participate in cellular metabolism), solar energy, by heating blood circulating in skin, could promote maintenance of temperature homeostasis in bodies of first people in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Owing to the {{complexity}} of higher eukaryotic cells, a complete proteome is likely {{to be very difficult to}} achieve. However, advantage can be taken of the cell compartmentalization to build organelle proteomes, which can moreover be viewed as specialized tools to study specifically the biology and "physiology" of the target organelle. Within this frame, we report here the construction of the human mitochondrial proteome, using placenta as the source tissue. Protein identification was carried out mainly by peptide mass fingerprinting. The optimization steps in two-dimensional electrophoresis needed for proteome research are discussed.

An International Index of Children’s Human Rights (CHILDEX) is proposed with the primary goals of monitoring children’s human rights in all countries and strengthening international awareness about children’s human rights internationally. There is a significant correlation between CHILDEX and Freedom House’s Index (FHI) (Pearson correlation test rs = 0. 65, P< 0. 05). From this positive correlation we can infer that open and democratic societies, independent of their degree of development, were more attentive to children’s human rights than non-democratic societies. CHILDEX could serve multiple purposes: (1) it could become an international tool to enhance children’s welfare in a standardized manner, (2) {{it could be useful}} to children’s rights advocate NGOs and IGOs, (3) it could serve as an academic tool that provides data to <b>researchers</b> <b>on</b> children’s <b>human</b> rights’s progress, and finally (4) it could also serve as a public policy mechanism that could pressure governments to improve their children’s human rights policies and their CHILDEX ranking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Electroencephalogram (EEG) is {{a record}} of {{electrical}} signal to represent the human brain activity. Many <b>researchers</b> are working <b>on</b> <b>human</b> brain as they are fascinated {{by the idea of}} secret, thought and feeling from the external and internal stimuli. Feature extraction, analysis, and classification of EEG signals are still challenging issues for researchers due to the variations of the brain signals. Different features are used to identify epilepsy, coma, encephalopathies, and brain death, etc. However, we have observed that extracted features from same kinds of signal transformations are not effective to differentiate the epilepsy periods including Ictal (active seizure period) and Interictal (interval between seizures) of EEG signals. In this paper, we present a new approach for feature extraction using high frequency components from DCT transformation. We also combine the new feature with the bandwidth feature extracted from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). These features are then used as an input to least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to classify Ictal and Interictal period of epileptic EEG signals from different brain locations. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method for better classification of Ictal and Interictal period of epilepsy for benchmark dataset.

This study will compare the similarities and differences of recruitment and selection in Islam and conventional. The approach of this study is qualitative approach based on an extensive review of existing relevant literature studies to identify Islamic and conventional human resource management concept. The recruitment and selection process has been choosen in this study as both of them are the most important part or phase in human resource management function. Both process will determine whether the organisation will achieve the objective of the organisation or not. Disqualified candidates will give bad results in achieving objective of the organisation. For Muslim managers, it is important for them to apply the Islamic approach in managing employees and it is important also for a manager to understand human capital development. The process of recruitment and selection has been explain very well in this study. The ideas and suggestion for this study have been compiled in a concise and ordered form.

However '[n]either European and national directives nor the ethnographic disciplinary tradition inform on how one should undertake research <b>on</b> <b>human</b> beings in online contexts, {{where much of the}} information used is technically publicly available, but may become sensitive in the context in which it is collected and presented'. In this document we will describe 'ethical guidelines, which will be considered in the phase of data collection, data analysis and dissemination of the findings'. These guidelines have been developed as rules of conduct during the whole project as well as a generic 'recommendation for <b>researchers</b> undertaking investigations <b>on</b> <b>human</b> beings in online contexts'. This paper aims to look at the specific situation of Internet research and how established ethical principles can be applied to it. Since most of the ethically critical research for the FLOSSPOLS project is undertaken in the ethnographic studies these guidelines are based upon principles established in the anthropological discipline. The deliverable has been written by one and supervised by other researchers of the University of Cambridge. It thereafter has been discussed with the concerned consortium member (University of Maastricht) and adjusted to their corresponding requirements. Furthermore we consulted several members of the subject community to comment on the guidelines.
