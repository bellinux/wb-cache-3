Investigations revealed that the bus driver {{lost control of the}} vehicle after its steering mechanism failed. The bus veered into oncoming traffic, hitting the taxi.|$|E
500|$|The police gave Brown £5,000 in 1993 and an {{additional}} £590 in January 2011 toward his rent; they also paid for credits for his mobile phone {{so that they could}} reach him, and paid to have his car put through an MOT test (an annual <b>roadworthiness</b> test). The court heard that Brown had also been also [...] "made aware" [...] by police that the Sun newspaper had offered a £100,000 reward.

500|$|The C5's {{reputation}} {{received a}} further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations. The Automobile Association questioned many of Sinclair's claims {{in a report}} published {{at the start of}} May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about 10 miles (16km) rather than the [...] promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5's battery ran flat after only [...] on a cold day. The C5's running speed was more usually around [...] than the claimed , while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped. The stability, general <b>roadworthiness,</b> and especially the safety of the C5 were questioned, and the AA suggested that the High-Vis Mast should be included as part of the standard package. It concluded: ...|$|E

50|$|In Sweden {{the main}} source of grey market {{vehicles}} is the US via Germany, which has more liberal laws and better tax deals on new imported cars.
