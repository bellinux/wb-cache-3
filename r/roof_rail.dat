40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the {{analytical}} methodology to evaluate the dynamic versus residual roof deformation characteristics of a compact SUV subjected to SAE J 2114 dolly rollover tests. Two FMVSS 208 dolly rollover tests with instrumented, restrained driver side Hybrid III dummies were evaluated during the first driver’s side <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> ground strike. Kinematic targets were mounted on the driver dummy head and tracked via onboard cameras as a means of visual validation of <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> deformation (assuming rail-to-dummy head contact). Test instrumentation included: accelerometers at the vehicle center of gravity (CG), <b>roof</b> <b>rail,</b> pillars and rocker panel, lap and shoulder belt load transducers, triaxial accelerometers at the center of gravity of the head, chest and pelvis of the dummies and six-axis force (and moment) transducers in the neck of the dummy. All data was recorded consistent with SAE J 211 - 1 recommendations Vehicle angular velocity and attitude were estimated using the data from multiple accelerometers, which correlated well with the test video. The accelerometer data indicate that the driver <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> dynamic deformation was significantly greater than the residual deformation to which the <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> rebounded following loss of ground contact. The dynamic deformation was of such magnitude that the rail intruded into the driver’s occupant survival space. A spike in driver dummy head acceleration was observed immediately following the acceleration pulse that caused the rail intrusion The presence of significant dynamic <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> deformation is new and important quantitative information that should be added to the body of knowledge surrounding reconsideration of FMVSS 216 and catastrophic injury prevention in rollover crashes...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study of rear-seat passenger headroom perception {{was conducted with}} 102 men and women using a reconfigurable vehicle mockup. The subjects rated three different roof shapes at five different roof positions on numerical sufficiency and acceptability scales. The subjects’ head and hair contours were digitized prior to testing and combined with measured head positions in the vehicle mockup to obtain actual head and hair clearance dimensions {{in each of the}} test conditions. Statistical analysis demonstrated that subject body dimension (stature), vertical roof position, lateral roof position, and vertical roof-to-rail offset all have important interactive effects on headroom perception. For example, the degradation in perceived headroom with an inboard lateral movement of the <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> is dependent on the vertical offset of the rail relative to the roof. Logistic regression analysis was used to create statistical models that accurately predict the percentage of an occupant population who will rate the headroom at a desired criterion level as a function of roof geometry and position. Three new geometric measurements are introduced that are substantially better related to subjective headroom perception than the conventional SAE dimensions. In addition to the mathematical models, which can be applied to any desired population, an Appendix is provided with graphical plots that {{can be used as a}} design guide for one particular reference population...|$|E
