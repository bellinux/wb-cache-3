2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{purpose is}} [...] "look-down/shoot-down" [...] capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler {{is also used}} for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles. Pulse-Doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation {{in close proximity to}} aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using nap-of-the-earth flying techniques and stealth technology to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require medium PRF which prevents range from being determined directly, and <b>range</b> <b>ambiguity</b> resolution processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. Radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces audible signals {{that can be used for}} threat identification.|$|E

40|$|For future {{spaceborne}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) missions, digital beamforming (DBF) on receive in elevation to form a sharp high receive beam will be adopted to improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) level and suppress <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities.</b> However, in some special cases, <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities</b> may be received by grating lobes with the high receive beam gain, and <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities</b> would not be well suppressed and even may be increased. In this paper, a new receiving approach based on analog beamforming (ABF) and DBF is proposed. According to the spaceborne SAR imaging geometry and the selected pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the antenna patterns of all subapertures of the whole receive antenna in elevation are adjusted by ABF at first. Afterwards, signals from all subapertures in elevation are combined by a real time DBF processor onboard. Since grating lobes could be suppressed by the antenna pattern of the subapertures via ABF, <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities</b> would be well suppressed even if ambiguities are received by grating lobes.

40|$|Abstract—Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) is a {{well known}} {{technique}} {{in the area of}} airborne radars, which is used to detect weak target returns embedded in strong ground Clutter, Jammers, and receiver Noise. STAP has the unique property of compensating for the platform motion induced Doppler spread, thus making detection of slow targets possible. But there are other problems resulting from the characteristics of the airborne radar that may limit the performance of detection of the radar, for instance, the <b>ambiguities</b> (<b>Range</b> or Doppler <b>ambiguities)</b> which are dependent on the value of the pulse repetition frequency (PRF).

40|$|Interest on {{circular}} and multicircular SAR acquisitions {{has been}} {{increased in the}} past few years due to the inherent potentials they provide, e. g., full 3 -D reconstruction and subwavelength resolution. However, one main limitation is the size of the spotlighted region, which is basically defined by the <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities,</b> the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and the minimum half-power beamwidth (HPBW) in the range and azimuth directions. This paper introduces multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques in order to tackle this limitation, thereby being able to extend the applications of CSAR to much wider areas. The basic principle of the proposed solution is based on three methods, namely scan-on-receive (SCORE), multi-channel reconstruction in azimuth (MCRA) and the use of orthogonal waveforms for quad-polarized systems. The impact and dependency of the PRF, HPBW and the <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities</b> is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time the basic {{principle}} to unify advantages between active sensors and the simultaneous capturing of an image for an extended area of dynamical 3 D applications in close range is given by range imaging (RIM) sensors. The drawback of data which is captured with RIM sensors is the absolute range accuracy and the limited non-ambiguity range. From other sensor systems different techniques are known to solve this problem in order to obtain a non-ambiguity range, e. g. by utilizing different modulation frequencies as most continuous-wave (CW) modulated laser scanner and radar systems do or by (pseudo) random modulation. In this paper a post-processing task is presented. The Goldstein 2 D unwrapping procedure for unwrapping the <b>range</b> <b>ambiguities</b> of <b>ranging</b> sensors (e. g.

The reconstruction performances of the proposed processing methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, point target ambiguity ratio, peak-to-sidelobe ratio, and signal-to-ambiguity-plus-noise ratio are investigated according to the PRF and compared {{with each other for}} an exemplary HRWS SAR system...|$|R
