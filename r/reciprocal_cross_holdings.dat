40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} work was conducted during winter 2013 – 14 and 2014 – 15  at Agricultural Research Station, Chitral-Pakistan. Objectives of the {{present research}} {{was to determine the}} mean performance and correlations of parents, direct and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> in bread wheat varieties for different yield components under 6 X 6 diallel combinations. Days to heading of parents exhibited highly significant differences for plant height, grains per spike, grain weight per spike, 100 -grain weight and grain yield while significant for days to heading and days to maturity and non significant for biological yield. Both direct and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> showed highly significant differences for all the studied traits. Correlations of grain yield with 100 -grain weight of parents was significant and positive while grains per spike and grain yield with plant height of direct crosses was significant and positive and grain yield with biological yield of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> was highly significant and positive. Maximum days to heading of parent (Dirk), direct cross (NR- 218 X Dirk), <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross</b> (Pirsabaq- 2013 X Dirk) and difference were 171 days, 170 days and 172 days, and 6 days, respectively.

Pollen viability, stigma receptivity and embryo development were compared for each hybrid and <b>reciprocal</b> <b>cross.</b> Results Pollen viability of the individual cultivars ranged from 4. 1 % to 20. 2 %, with the highest level (> 11. 9 %) for all cultivars observed from the earliest collected grains (05 : 00 – 06 : 00 [*]a. m.). Stigmatic pollen germination peaked at 4 [*]h after pollination and varied from 4. 8 to 60. 6 grains per stigma among the crosses. Production of normal embryos ranged from 7. 6 % to 58. 8 % at 1 d after pollination and from 0 to 25 % by 11 d after pollination.

40|$|Drosophila pseudoobscura harbors a rich gene {{arrangement}} polymorphism on {{the third}} chromosome generated {{by a series of}} overlapping paracentric inversions. The arrangements suppress recombination in heterokaryotypic individuals, which allows for the selective maintenance of coadapted gene complexes. Previous mapping experiments used to determine the degree to which recombination is suppressed in gene arrangement heterozygotes produced non-recombinant progeny in non-Mendelian ratios. The deviations from Mendelian expectations could be the result of viability differences between wild and mutant chromosomes, meiotic drive because of achiasmate pairing of homologues in heterokaryotypic females during meiosis, or a combination of both mechanisms. The possibility that the frequencies of the chromosomal arrangements in natural populations are affected by mechanisms other than adaptive selection led us to consider these hypotheses. We performed <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> involving both heterozygous males and females to determine if the frequency of the non-recombinant progeny deviates significantly from Mendelian expectations and if the frequencies deviate between <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses.</b> We failed to observe non-Mendelian ratios in multiple crosses, and the frequency of the non-recombinant classes differed in only one of five pairs of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>crosses</b> despite sufficient power to detect these differences in all crosses. Our results indicate that deviations from Mendelian expectations in recombination experiments involving the D. pseudoobscura inversion system are most likely due to fitness differences of gene arrangement karyotypes in different environments...|$|R
