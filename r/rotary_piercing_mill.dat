40|$|In <b>rotary</b> <b>piercing,</b> as in {{most other}} metal-working processes, there occur {{redundant}} deformations, i. e. deformations which are not essential to the required change of shape of the workpiece. Since these deformations are responsible for unnecessary additional straining of the material and can impose limitations on the range of applications of the process, {{it is important to}} establish their nature {{and the way in which}} they vary with piercer conditions. Means can then be devised of reducing them and hence reducing the severity of the process. This investigation, based on work carried out on a specially designed experimental mill and using wax as model material, was concerned with three types of deformation, viz. circumferential shear, longitudinal shear, and shear due to twist. The incidence and pattern of these deformations for two-roll barrel piercers, both with freely rotating and with driven plugs, are analysed and the probable reasons for their occurrence are given. Methods of calculation of redundancy in the system are derived which enable all redundant deformations in <b>rotary</b> <b>piercing</b> to be compared with each other and, if necessary, with redundant deformations in other processes. General conclusions concerning the pattern and flow for various conditions of <b>rotary</b> <b>piercing</b> are set out and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Researchers at the Timken Company {{conceived}} {{a project}} to develop an on-line instrument for wall thickness measurement of steel seamless mechanical tubing based on laser ultrasonic technology. The instrument, which has been installed and tested at a <b>piercing</b> <b>mill,</b> provides data on tube eccentricity and concentricity. Such measurements permit fine-tuning of manufacturing processes to eliminate excess material in the tube wall and therefore provide a more precisely dimensioned product for their customers. The resulting process energy savings are substantial, as is lowered environmental burden. The expected savings are $ 85. 8 million per year in seamless mechanical tube piercing alone. Applied across the industry, this measurement has a potential of reducing energy consumption by 6 x 10 {sup 12 } BTU per year, greenhouse gas emissions by 0. 3 million metric tons carbon equivalent per year, and toxic waste by 0. 255 million pounds per year. The principal technical contributors to the project were the Timken Company, Industrial Materials Institute (IMI, a contractor to Timken), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Timken provided mill access as well as process and metallurgical understanding. Timken researchers had previously developed fundamental ultrasonic analysis methods on which this project is based. IMI developed and fabricated the laser ultrasonic generation and receiver systems. ORNL developed Bayesian and wavelet based real-time signal processing, spread-spectrum wireless communication, and explored feature extraction and pattern recognition methods. The resulting instrument has successfully measured production tubes at one of Timken's <b>piercing</b> <b>mills.</b> This report concentrates on ORNL's contribution through the CRADA mechanism. The three components of ORNL's contribution were met with mixed success. The real-time signal-processing task accomplished its goal of improvement in detecting time of flight information {{with a minimum of}} false data. The signal processing algorithm development resulted in a combination of processing steps that can be set to generate no spoofs from noise, while simultaneously missing fewer than 10 % of good trials. The algorithm leads to a 95 % probability that the estimate of time of flight is good to within 4 time bins or fewer for laser excitations above 30 mJ for the first two echoes of the signal. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the algorithm indicate that the algorithm is very robust against errors for excitations above at 35 mJ and above, tolerable at 30 mJ and unacceptable below 30 mJ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the work {{carried out to}} develop a prototype knowledge-based system 'KBS-SETUPP' to generate process plans for the manufacture of seamless tubes. The work is specifically related to a plant in which hollows are made from solid billets using a <b>rotary</b> <b>piercing</b> process and then reduced to required size and finished properties using the fixed plug cold drawing process. The thesis first discusses various methods of tube production {{in order to give}} a general background of tube manufacture. Then a review of the automation of the process planning function is presented in terms of its basic sub-tasks and the techniques and suitability of a knowledge-based system is established. In the light of such a review and a case study, the process planning problem is formulated in the domain of seamless tube manufacture, its basic sub-tasks are identified and capabilities and constraints of the available equipment in the specific plant are established. The task of collecting and collating the process planning knowledge in seamless tube manufacture is discussed and is mostly fulfilled from domain experts, analysing of existing manufacturing records specific to plant, textbooks and applicable Standards. For the cold drawing mill, tube-drawing schedules have been rationalised to correspond with practice. The validation of such schedules has been achieved by computing the process parameters and then comparing these with the drawbench capacity to avoid over-loading. The existing models cannot be simulated in the computer program as such, therefore a mathematical model has been proposed which estimates the process parameters which are in close agreement with experimental values established by other researchers. To implement the concepts, a Knowledge-Based System 'KBS- SETUPP' has been developed on Personal Computer using Turbo- Prolog. The system is capable of generating process plans, production schedules and some additional capabilities to supplement process planning. The system generated process plans have been compared with the actual plans of the company and {{it has been shown that}} the results are satisfactory and encouraging and that the system has the capabilities which are useful...|$|R

50|$|Henry Lillie Pierce (1825-1896) {{was the son}} of Colonel Jesse Pierce (1788-1856) and Elizabeth Vose Lillie Pierce (1786-1871) of Stoughton, Massachusetts. His {{father had}} been an {{educator}} at Milton Academy and later served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As a gentleman farmer, he maintained a large farm in Stoughton (formerly a part of Dorchester) until he moved, in 1849, to Washington Street in the Lower Mills of Dorchester {{with his wife and two}} sons. Edward Lillie Pierce was then attending Brown University, while Henry Lillie Pierce was at Milton Academy and was to later attend the Bridgewater Normal School. In 1849, Henry L.

Walter Baker, the owner of the chocolate company and stepbrother of Pierce’s mother, hired him at a salary of three dollars per week. However, as their political views invariably clashed and caused tremendous animosity (Pierce was a vociferous and deeply opinionated Free-Soiler), Pierce left after only a year of politically tinged employment to take up newspaper work in the Midwest.
