5|$|The Beatles: Rock Band {{was well}} <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> {{both as a}} genuine means of {{experiencing}} the music {{and history of the}} Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with {{more than half a million}} units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession.|$|E
5|$|With {{a budget}} of $2 million and 350,000 lines of C++ and UnrealScript, Unreal Tournament took almost {{a year and a}} half to develop. When Unreal (the first {{installment}} of the Unreal series) was released in May 1998, it was well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> However, it soon became apparent that the quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game's further success. In the months following Unreals release, improving the game's multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.|$|E
5|$|During 1930, Allen again had {{leave in}} which he could play cricket, and was among the front-runners for {{a place in the}} England team. His first {{appearance}} of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

25|$|Vaporware first implied {{intentional}} fraud when it {{was applied}} to the Ovation office suite in 1983; the suite's demonstration was well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> but the product was never released.|$|E
25|$|Keith Robinson also {{directed}} a second {{version of the}} play. He brought some of his company to work with students of the BA (Hons) Drama, Applied Theatre and Education Course at the Central School of Speech and Drama. The joint production was performed at the Minack Theatre, in Cornwall, England, in late June 2008. It was well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and community.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reputation}} for the contrary, the Salon d'Automne in 1905 was rather well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> including critical {{praise for the}} Ingres and Manet retrospectives. The artists exhibiting were {{for the most part}} known, even the most innovative who a few months before exhibited at the Berthe Weill Gallery. However, a few critics reacted violently, both in the daily press aimed at a wide audience; and in the specialized press, some of whom were active advocates of symbolism, and vehemently detested the rise of the new generation.|$|E
50|$|The Arnage {{was well}} <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{motoring}} <b>press,</b> with most critics admiring the unimpeachable image but criticising {{the price and}} running cost.|$|R
50|$|The {{prize in}} the {{nomination}} Civil Leader of the Year {{was awarded to}} Siarhej Mihalok (music band “Liapis Trubiackoj”). <b>The</b> prize was <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> band’s <b>press</b> secretary Dzmitry Bezkaravajny.|$|R
50|$|Acuras new models—particularly the TL and TSX—were well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{motoring}} <b>press</b> {{and became}} Acuras top selling vehicles. The TSX was on Car and Drivers Ten Best list from 2004-2006.|$|R
500|$|The German premiere was {{not well}} <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> and Chicago Tribune music critic John von Rhein found faults in the United States production. He said that the novel [...] "falls flat as music theater", there is [...] "no {{compelling}} dramatic narrative", and the music [...] "drifts along innocuously". Von Rhein also complained that [...] "score breaks no new stylistic ground, nor does it define the characters dramatically".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} very well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> at the time. Boys and Girls considered it [...] "undoubtedly {{one of the}} hits of the summer of 1984", OK called it [...] "a very promising first 7"", and Chanson 84 stated that it was [...] "great: rhythmic, spicy, original; the orchestration, based on a synth and drums, is enriched over the couplets". Le Matin de Paris said it was [...] "a funny perverse little song", and Les Grands de la Variété stated: [...] "The tone is original, the music is subtle: it's a good surprise".|$|E
500|$|Dianetics was poorly <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and the {{scientific}} and medical professions. The American Psychological Association criticized Hubbard's claims as [...] "not supported by empirical evidence". Scientific American said that Hubbard's book contained [...] "more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing", while The New Republic called it a [...] "bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology". Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; Isaac Asimov considered it [...] "gibberish" [...] while Jack Williamson called it [...] "a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology".|$|E
50|$|His {{official}} {{debut album}} Origins {{was released in}} January 2009 by Marchpane Records and was <b>received</b> positively <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> It {{was chosen as the}} album of the month in issue 01/2009 of Kulturnews magazine.|$|R
50|$|The Quattrovalvole {{was better}} <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{automotive}} <b>press</b> and <b>the</b> public, {{although some of}} the previous poor reviews for the Mondial 8 engendered negative perceptions that would follow the Mondial line throughout its life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{generally}} well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> critics, <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> and <b>the</b> public. It was recognized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FBW as [...] "especially valuable", and {{was awarded a}} Bambi for being the most financially successful film of 1955.|$|R
500|$|Newspapers {{stressed}} {{different aspects}} of Bakke, often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative Chicago Sun-Times bannered Bakke's admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. The Washington Post, a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, [...] "Affirmative Action Upheld" [...] before going on {{to note that the}} court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas. The Wall Street Journal, in a headline, deemed Bakke [...] "The Decision Everybody Won". According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court's decision [...] "was <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most".|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Drummond {{released}} 45, a book {{consisting of}} a [...] "series of loosely related vignettes forming the rambling diary of one year." [...] 45 also explored Drummond's KLF legacy, and was well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The four {{crossover}} episodes which {{broadcast in}} November 2005 were generally well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The opening episode was a recommended [...] "TV Choice" [...] of The Daily Telegraph Chris Riley, a [...] "Pick of the Day" [...] of The Mirror Simon, and a [...] "Pick of the Night" [...] of the Evening Standard Ramsey. The crossover {{was also a}} [...] "Drama Choice" [...] of Sarah Moolla of The People, who commented that: [...] "There's something weirdly thrilling when these two medical shows collide." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} badly <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French <b>press</b> of its time. Bernard Dort, {{in one of}} the few {{positive}} reviews, noted that the film was more a study of its two main characters than an anti-war tirade.|$|R

50|$|The car {{was well}} <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{motoring}} <b>press,</b> which praised <b>the</b> car's handling and grip. The fuel consumption was also considered reasonable at the time, {{in comparison with}} the larger and multi cylinder engines used in competitor GT cars.|$|R
2500|$|The car was warmly <b>{{received}}</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> {{and even}} received the European Car of the Year award for 1977. [...] Its launch on the European mainland coincided with its {{appearance at the}} Geneva Motor Show in March 1977, some {{three months after the}} Car of the Year announcement. Dealers had no left-hand drive cars for sale, however, since production had been blocked by a tool makers' strike affecting several British Leyland plants and a [...] "bodyshell dispute" [...] at the company's Castle Bromwich plant. Closer to home, the car and its design team received The Midlander of the Year Award for 1976, because they had between them done most in the year to increase the prestige of the (English) Midlands region.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{also proved}} to be very well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> and leading public figures of the day. Gladstone, then the Prime Minister, responded to the copy of the novel that Heinemann had sent on Caine's request, saying that, “The Bondman {{is a work of}} which I {{recognise}} the freshness, vigour and sustained interest no less than its integrity of aim." [...] Leo Tolstoy read the book [...] "with deep interest." [...] The Times reviewed the book saying that, [...] "It is impossible to deny originality and rude power to this saga, impossible not to admire its forceful directness, and the colossal grandeur of its lead characters." [...] Caine's biographer in 1901 wrote that the critics [...] "proclaimed it as one of the masterpieces of the century", describing the book as: ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{retirement}} of President Ulysses S. Grant after two terms, the Republicans had to settle on a new candidate for the 1876 election. Hayes's success as Governor of Ohio immediately elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency, alongside James G. Blaine of Maine, Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, and Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Despite {{the strength of the}} other candidates, the Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind Hayes, and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to aid the nomination to his fellow Ohioan. In June 1876, the convention assembled in Hayes's hometown of Cincinnati with Blaine as the favorite. Hayes did not see himself as the favorite to win the presidential nomination, but made an effort to position himself as a potential compromise candidate. Hayes placed fifth on the first ballot of the convention, behind Blaine, Morton, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Conkling. After six ballots, Blaine remained in the lead, but on the seventh ballot, Blaine's adversaries rallied around Hayes, granting the presidential nomination to the latter. The convention then selected Representative William A. Wheeler of New York for Vice President, a man about whom Hayes had recently asked, [...] "I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?" [...] Hayes's views were largely in accord with the party platform, which called for equal rights for all (including women), continued Reconstruction, the prohibition of public funding for sectarian schools, and the resumption of specie payments. Hayes's nomination was well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> with even Democratic papers describing Hayes as honest and likable. In a public letter accepting the nomination, Hayes vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve for only one term.|$|E
2500|$|... 1968 was a {{successful}} year for Torino with 172,083 units produced. Including Fairlane production, 371,787 cars were produced.

50|$|General Motors {{moved into}} the sports car market in 2000 with the Vauxhall VX220/Opel Speedster, a {{two-seater}} roadster based on the Lotus Elise chassis.

6000|$|These unexcelled {{short stories}} really {{revealed}} Stevenson as the narrator, his path lay clear before him. But even {{his friends were}} then divided in opinion; some preferring his essays, and his two books of sentimental travel, [...] "An Inland Voyage" [...] (1878) and [...] "Travels with a Donkey" [...] (1879). These were, indeed, admirable in style, humour, description, and incident, but the creative imagination in the stories of Villon's night and of the Sieur de Malétroit's door, the painting of character, the romance, the vividness, were worth many such volumes. They were well <b>received</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Press,</b> these sketches of travel, but, as Monsieur Got says in his [...] "Journal" [...] (1857), [...] "Les succès des délicats sont, même quand ils s'établissent, trop lents à s'établir. La foule s'est tellement démocratisée qu'il n'a pas de salut si l'on ne frappe brutalement." [...] The needful brutality was not employed till Stevenson [...] "knocked them" [...] with [...] "Jekyll and Hyde." ...|$|E
