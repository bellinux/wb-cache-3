The BSS keyword was later incorporated into FAP (FORTRAN Assembly Program), IBM's standard assembler for its 709 and 7090/94 computers. It defined a label (i.e. symbol) and reserved a block of uninitialized space for a given number of words [...] In this situation BSS served as a shorthand in place of individually reserving a number of separate smaller data locations.

40|$|Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enables mobile {{operators}} to virtualize their network entities as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), offering fine-grained on-demand network capabilities. VNFs can be dynamically scale-in/out {{to meet the}} performance requirements for future 5 G networks. However, designing an auto-scaling algorithm with low operation cost and low latency while considering the capacity of legacy network equipment is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a VNF Dynamic Auto Scaling Algorithm (DASA) considering the tradeoff between performance and operation cost. We also develop an analytical model to quantify the tradeoff and validate the analysis through extensive simulations. The system is modeled as a queueing model while legacy network equipment is considered as a <b>reserved</b> <b>block</b> of servers. The VNF instances are powered on and off according {{to the number of}} job requests. The results show that the proposed DASA can significantly reduce operation cost given the latency upper-bound. Moreover, the models provide a quick way to evaluate the cost-performance tradeoff without wide deployment, which can save cost and time. Comment: 18 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

In order to improve the restoration capability, we classify the selected coefficients into three types, and assign different bits for each type to generate reference bits. The generated reference bits are embedded into the original image, along with authentication bits derived from the content by hash function. On the receiver side, after identifying tampered blocks by authentication bits, reference bits are extracted from the <b>reserved</b> <b>blocks</b> to approximately reconstruct the principal content of the lost information.
