5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on <b>reentrant</b> connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations, see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

Following an idea put forward originally for Chasma Boreale, we propose for the genesis of Chasma Australe a mechanism of catastrophic outflow preceded by a tectonically induced powerful sapping process. A detailed geomorphological analysis of Chasma Australe shows erosional and depositional features that can be interpreted as produced by the motion of a fluid.

The tectonics of the area is characterised by two major rentrants (Kangra and Dehradun) interposed by the Nahan Salient. The first order topography between the Himalayan Frontal Thrust and the Main Boundary Thrust shows a marked lateral variation along strike of the mean gradient, characterised by a very small mean slope angle (ca. 1 °) in correspondence with the <b>reentrants</b> and higher values (ca. 3 °) in the salient.

Swath bathymetric, lithologic, and chronologic data from jumbo piston cores from four sites along the East Antarctic margin (Iceberg Alley, the Nielsen Basin, the Svenner Channel, and the Mertz-Ninnis Trough) {{are used to}} demonstrate that these cross-shelf features controlled development of calving bay <b>reentrants</b> in the Antarctic ice sheet during deglaciation. At all sites except the Mertz-Ninnis Trough, the transition between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene is characterized by varved couplets deposited during a short interval of extremely high primary productivity in a fjordlike setting. Nearly monospecific layers of the diatom Chaetoceros alternate with slightly more terrigenous layers containing a mixed diatom assemblage. We propose that springtime diatom blooms dominated by Chaetoceros were generated within well-stratified and restricted surface waters of calving bays that were influenced by the input of iron-rich meltwater. Intervening post-bloom summer-fall laminae were formed through the downward flux of terrigenous material sourced from melting glacial ice combined with mixed diatom assemblages.

25|$|The 6809 {{design team}} {{believed}} that future system integrators would look to off-the-shelf code in ROMs to handle common tasks. Motorola's official programming manual contains the full listing of assist09, a so-called monitor, a miniature operating system {{intended to be}} burned in ROM. Another example of ROM code might be binary floating point arithmetic, which is a common requirement in many systems. In order to speed time to market, common code modules would be purchased, rather than developed in-house, and integrated into systems with code from other manufacturers. Since a CPU designer could hardly guarantee where this code would be located in a future system, the 6809 design focused heavily on support of position-independent, <b>reentrant</b> code that could be freely located anywhere in the memory map. This expectation was, in reality, never quite met: Motorola's only released example of a ROM'd software module was the MC6839 floating-point ROM.

40|$|The entire Mariana Trench, {{from its}} {{northern}} end at Dutton Ridge to the southwestern terminus at the Yap Trench, was mapped in 2010 using a Kongsberg EM 122 12 -kHz multibeam echosounder. The region ranges in depths from the shoreline at Guam to almost 11, 000 m at the Challenger Deep. The {{northern part of}} the trench is receiving seamounts and guyots of the Magellan Seamount chain, whereas the southern section is receiving seafloor that carries the Caroline Ridge to the trench. The area immediately seaward of the trench where the Pacific Plate has bent downward toward the subduction zone has been broken by a series of subparallel horst and graben structures generated by extension on the bending upper surface of the Pacific Plate. Four bathymetric “bridges” span across the trench axis and extend from the Pacific Plate to the inner wall of the trench. The bridges stand as much as 2500 m above the trench axis and are composed of Latest Jurassic to Early Cretaceous accreted seamounts and guyots of the Magellan Seamount chain that {{are in the process of}} breaking up and being subducted beneath the Philippine Plate. Only two seamounts of the Caroline Ridge are in the vicinity of the trench and they both presently reside on the outer trench wall. The faults of the horsts and grabens have fractured the seamounts and guyots within the trench depression seaward from the axis outward for about 80 km, but within ~ 5 km of the trench axis the faults have reactivated to compressional thrust faults. The faults tend to parallel the axis of the trench until the immediate vicinity of an accreting seamount or guyot where the faults bend inward toward the trench axis, as has been observed in many other trenches. Most of the accreted seamounts and guyots are not associated with embayments or <b>reentrants</b> on the inner trench wall, as has been documented in the Middle America and Japan Trenches, perhaps because there is not a large accretionary prism that extends seaward of the forearc. The one exception is a large seamount of the Caroline Ridge that has been fractured into several sections, some of which appear to be mostly subducted, that are associated with a 30 km embayment landward from the trench axis. However, there are <b>reentrants</b> along the inner trench wall but without bathymetric expression of an associated subducting seamount or guyot. These <b>reentrants</b> may mark zones where seamounts and guyots have been completely consumed into the trench. There is no evidence from the acoustic backscatter of sediment filling by debris flows and other failure deposits along the entire trench axis, although the inner trench wall has numerous scarps from wall failures. The forearc area has numerous features that resemble diapirs with what appears from the acoustic backscatter to be ponded sediment in bathymetric lows that are surrounded by diapirs.

The equilibrium level of job loser unemployment is shown to fluctuate given the degree to which firms monitor shirking over the business cycle.

40|$|The frontal Himalayan region, India, {{represents}} a classical example of relief evolved and evolving within a compressional tectonic setting. Relief-creation processes are mainly induced by dip-slip reverse faulting along major low-angle thrusts {{and the consequent}} uplift of the hanging-wall block(s). The most external of these major fault planes, i. e. the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), also marks the tectonic and topographic boundary between the Himalayan orogen and the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain representing its foredeep basin. The hanging-wall block of the HFT consists of clastic deposits belonging to the Siwalik Group and geographically coincides with the socalled Sub-Himalayan mountain belt characterized by low-relief hills variably dissected by the ongoing erosion. This major tectonic unit is in turn delimited to the north by the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT). The relatively young age of the Sub-Himalayan hills provides an opportunity to investigate the thrust-related evolution of the relief, especially {{in the early stages}} of nucleation and propagation of a thrust as well as the relationships between large-scale topography and local seismicity. The new data presented in this paper mainly pertains to the first order topography of the uplifted hanging-wall block of the HFT. They reveal a marked lateral variation along the strike of the Sub-Himalayan belt, in terms of both topographic features and mean topographic gradient. Two major settings are recognised; the one characterised by a very small mean slope angle (ca. 1), the other by typically higher values (ca. 3). Transitions between the two topographies are relatively sharp that allows to distinguish different sectors within the Sub-Himalayan belt roughly reflecting the occurrence of the well-known Kangra and Dehradun <b>reentrants</b> and Nahan salients. Both relief distribution and associated topographic features also show a good correspondence with the peculiar macroseismic field of the M= 7. 8, 1905 Kangra earthquake, which is characterised by two distinct intensity maxima, separated by a distance of about 100 km, clearly overlapping the two major tectonic <b>reentrants.</b> A similar dichotomy is observed in the distribution of the recent instrumental seismicity. Moreover, based on available geological information and constraints, we analyse the area in terms of critical taper model attempting to clarify the possible correlations between tectonics, morphology and seismicity in the Sub-Himalayan belt. The analysis allows constraining possible seismotectonic scenarios and hence suggesting the existence of a seismic gap in the area corresponding to the Nahan Salient, which may experience an event possibly of significant magnitude...|$|R

As compression persists, the ophiolite is emplaced onto the continental margin.|$|R
