50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times resonance circuit has a flat shape. Although the magnetic path structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the step-up transformer is increased to some degree, whereby a resonance circuit is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the step-up transformer. The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary side circuit. The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a <b>resonance</b> <b>capacitor.</b> As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the step-up transformer is further miniaturized.|$|E

5000|$|The {{power factor}} of {{induction}} motors varies with load, typically from around 0.85 or 0.90 {{at full load}} to as low as about 0.20 at no-load, due to stator and rotor leakage and magnetizing reactances.

It is intended for use as single trip or limited use tickets in public transportation networks, loyalty cards or day passes for events as a replacement for conventional ticketing solutions such as paper tickets, magnetic stripe tickets or coins. As the usage of contactless proximity smart cards becomes more and more common, transport and event operators are switching to completely contactless solutions. The introduction of the MIFARE Ultralight for limited use tickets may lead to a reduction of system installation and maintenance costs.

40|$|Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is {{a method}} for {{treating}} diseases like Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and various other movement disorders. An Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) {{is placed in the}} chest and wires are run through the neck to provide electrical pulses to a certain target in the brain via an electrode. Results with this treatment are good but today’s stimulators are bulky and last only three to five years. Furthermore the electrode and pulse generator are often placed in two different surgeries. The device should be miniaturized {{so that it can be}} placed in the skull while inserting the electrode. This reduces the number of placement surgeries and eliminates lead failures. The size of the device is dominated by the battery volume, however no compromises on battery life can be made since battery replacement requires, again, surgery. Switching to a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery that can be recharged through the skin is a way to reduce battery size without compromising the lifetime of the device. Lithium-Ion batteries are, however, delicate devices and should be charged and discharged with care. The classic method to ensuring safe charging of these types of batteries is the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) method. Here a fixed current is pushed into the battery until the battery reaches its maximum voltage. After this the voltage is kept constant and the current slowly decreases to a small fraction of the initial current. Although this method ensures safe and complete charging of Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries it also has some downsides. The abrupt switch from constant current to a constant voltage might introduce stability issues. Furthermore, characteristics of a battery vary depending on their state of charge and this is not taken into account by this algorithm. In this research a possible new algorithm that smoothly regulates charge current is investigated. It turns out that this algorithm is slightly less efficient and slower than the classical CCCV method. The best method to charge the battery of an implantable device is via the CCCV method. An implementation of this method is proposed where both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) phases are controlled by the same control loop and the transition between the two phases is a smooth hyperbolic tangent function. An inductively powered system was designed that reaches an average efficiency, in circuit simulation, of 87. 36 % from antenna output to battery. For this implementation, the rectifier is the only part in series with the inductive link and the battery. The efficiency is therefore mostly limited by the diodes used for the AC to DC rectifier. An prototype of the designed system was built and the correct operation of the system was verified by wirelessly charging a 160 mAh Li-Ion battery. The results of the performed measurements showed that the inductive link had a poor power transfer efficiency. Mismatch between the <b>resonance</b> <b>capacitor</b> value and coil inductances caused the resonance frequency to deviate from the desired value. The efficiency of the charger was, as expected, mostly determined by losses in the rectifier. Further research should be done in optimization of the inductive link to provide good efficiency even when the device is poorly aligned with the charger. Furthermore the parameters of the system should be tuned to a medical grade battery and the possibility of combining the power transfer with data communication can be investigated.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{process is}} a critical consideration for combustion devices. External energy transfer to the combustor is required for ignition in common combustion systems. There {{are many ways to}} deposit energy into the flow but a standard method is a spark discharge because it is simple, compact, and reliable. Sparks can be categorized as either inductive or capacitive sparks that use a coil or an electrical <b>resonance</b> circuit with <b>capacitor,</b> respectively, to amplify the voltage. The creation of a successful ignition event depends on the spark energy deposited into the flow, the initial composition, pressure, temperature, turbulence level of flow etc. The deposited energy by the spark into the flow is critical for estimation of initial energy available for ignition of the mixture. Therefore, the electrical characteristics of the sparks were investigated under various flow conditions. Then measurements of deposited energy into the flow were conducted using a very accurate experimental procedure that was developed in this research. The results showed considerable electric energy losses to the electrodes for the relatively long, inductive sparks. However, the short, capacitive spark deposits electric energy into the flow with minimal loss (above 90 % deposition efficiency). In addition, the characteristics of inductive spark are affected by flow velocity and by the existence of a flame. However, variations in the flow conditions do not affect the characteristics of the capacitive spark such as voltage-current time trace and energy deposition efficiency. Two ignition systems using above mentioned two spark types were developed. First, the capacitive spark energy was directly deposited into the premixed flow. Most researchers have not concentrated on the early initiation process but on the flame growth. Therefore, the generated kernel formed by the energy deposition was observed and characterized using optical methods, immediately following the spark. In addition, the mixing effect for this ignition kernel with surrounding gas was simulated using a numerical method. Based on the time trace of the OH* chemiluminescence, the reaction starts with the discharge and it is continuous until combustion begins. This means that {{in the presence of a}} high density spark in premixed flow, there exists no traditional delay as defined by other researchers for auto ignition. A simple Radical Jet Generator (RJG) was developed that is able to ignite and stabilize a flame in a high-speed flow. The inductive spark initiates the combustion in the RJG chamber. The RJG then injects the partially-burned products carrying large amounts of heat and radicals into a rapidly moving flammable main stream. Then it ignites and stabilizes a flame. The RJG requires low levels of electrical power as long as the flow velocity is relatively low since most of the radicals are produced by the incomplete combustion in its chamber. The importance of radicals was analyzed by RJG experiments and numerical methods. The reaction zone for RJG using a rich mixture was located both inside and outside of the RJG chamber. Therefore, the RJG using a rich mixture performed better in the ignition and stabilization of combustion in the main flow. According to an analysis using the CHEMKIM simulation software combined with the San Diego chemical mechanism, the RJG jet resulting from a rich mixture contains more radicals and intermediates than that produced by a lean mixture for the same sensible enthalpy. In addition, the burned gas contains less radicals and intermediates than the partially burned gas. If the RJG is operating with a high speed main flow, the flow rate through the RJG chamber must be increased to allow the radical jet to penetrate well into the rapid flow due to their higher injection velocity. Unfortunately, this leads to unsteady combustion in the RJG, which results in the pulsation of the radical jet. This reduces the number of radicals injected into the main flow. To investigate this operating condition, special attention was focused on four possible factors: unburned reactant pockets caused by motion of the spark channel, spark frequency, flame propagation speed and ignition delay. It was shown that the unsteadiness is affected by the flame speed and ignition delay because the frequency of pulsation in the chamber is highly dependent on the equivalence ratio. In addition, the interaction between the RJG operation and the combustion dynamics in the main combustor was documented. The acoustic pressure oscillations in the main combustor were suppressed when the RJG jet was turned on because the reaction region is relocated by the operation of the RJG. Ph. D...|$|R
