25|$|The {{assessment}} of homology models' accuracy is straightforward when the experimental structure is known. The most common method of comparing two protein structures uses the <b>root-mean-square</b> deviation (RMSD) metric {{to measure the}} mean distance between the corresponding atoms in the two structures {{after they have been}} superimposed. However, RMSD does underestimate the accuracy of models in which the core is essentially correctly modeled, but some flexible loop regions are inaccurate. A method introduced for the modeling assessment experiment CASP is known as the global distance test (GDT) and measures the total number of atoms whose distance from the model to the experimental structure lies under a certain distance cutoff. Both methods can be used for any subset of atoms in the structure, but are often applied to only the alpha carbon or protein backbone atoms to minimize the noise created by poorly modeled side chain rotameric states, which most modeling methods are not optimized to predict.|$|E

[...] A graph of the accepted model's <b>root-mean-square</b> deviation (RMSD), which measures how structurally similar the accepted model is to the native model, is shown far right.

[...] Since the rectified average value and the <b>root-mean-square</b> value of a waveform are only the same for a square wave, simple rectifier-type circuits can only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms. [...] Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. This type of circuit usually has fairly limited frequency range. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low AC voltage values.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experimental}} {{technique that}} is expected to provide the most precise determination of the <b>root-mean-square</b> charge radius of the proton is the measurement of the frequency of photons (precise [...] "color" [...] of light [...] ) emitted or absorbed by atomic transitions in muonic hydrogen.

[...] The muon is particularly well suited for this purpose because its much larger mass results in a much more compact bound state and hence a larger probability for it to be found inside the proton in muonic hydrogen compared to the electron in atomic hydrogen. The Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen was measured by driving the muon from a 2s state up to an excited 2p state using a laser. The frequency of the photons required to induce two such (slightly different) transitions were reported in 2014 to be 50 and 55nbsp&THz which, according to present theories of quantum electrodynamics, yield an appropriately averaged value of [...] for the charge radius of the proton.|$|E
