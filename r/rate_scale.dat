40|$|This paper {{examines}} the relation, or "synaptic coding", between the discharges of inhibitory fibres whose instantaneous firing rate is modulated periodically and pacemaker postsynaptic neurons using crayfish synapses and point process statistics. Several control parameters were varied individually, {{and the other}} maintained constant as far as possible: it extends the preceding publication that described the general features and varied only the modulation frequency [Segundo et al. (1995) Neuroscience 68, 657 - 692]. Statistics were mainly cycle histograms and Lissajous diagrams (with presynaptic and post-synaptic histograms on the abscissae and ordinate, respectively), complemented occasionally by displays of intervals along time and of interval differences along order ("basic graphs" and "recurrence plots", respectively). The postsynaptic influence of modulated inhibitory discharges is characteristically sensitive to all control parameters examined. (1) The frequency {{was reported in the}} companion paper [Segundo et al. (1995) Neuroscience 68, 657 - 692]. (2) The average slope per half-cycle, controlled via either frequency or depth, acts by way of its magnitude and sign in ways revealed by hysteretic loops. Hysteresis increases and varies as the modulation's steepness increases: it is minor and with a single clockwise loop at small slopes, but major and multi-looped at the larger ones. Slopes, because of their different postsynaptic consequences, were separated into the categories of "steep", "gentle" and "abrupt" if around, respectively, 1. 0, 30. 0 and 150. 0 s- 2. The influence of slopes in restricted portions of the cycle depends on their position on the inhibitory <b>rate</b> <b>scale.</b> (3) The modulation's range acts by way of its depth and of its position on the inhibitory <b>rate</b> <b>scale.</b> Deeper ranges, when compared with the shallower ones they contain, induce effects similar to those of shallower modulations with their central portion, plus effects peculiar to them at extreme rates. Changes in range position from the centre to the extremes of the inhibitory <b>rate</b> <b>scale</b> are influential (e. g., saturations appear). Changes within the centre can be highly influential, particularly when ranges are narrow and close to the postsynaptic natural rate, and modulation frequencies are low: relations between corresponding rates can be linear increasing, linear decreasing or piecewise linear. Changes around extreme rates are negligible, however, and saturations are present.
