5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular <b>reabsorption</b> of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica is {{the result}} of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, which results in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the <b>reabsorption</b> of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the <b>reabsorption</b> of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the <b>reabsorption</b> of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{action of}} some fibers {{is to reduce}} the <b>reabsorption</b> of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the <b>reabsorption</b> of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone further {{increases}} the Na+ and H2O <b>reabsorption</b> in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.|$|E
25|$|Glycine, proline and {{hydroxyproline}} {{share common}} renal tubular mechanisms of <b>reabsorption,</b> a function {{specific to the}} proximal tubule. Both <b>reabsorption</b> or absorption of glycine and imino acids takes place respectively at the proximal tubule or intestinal brush border epithelium. The more selective transport of proline and other imino acids is driven {{at the molecular level}} by a mammalian cellular transport mechanism aptly known as system IMINO.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone stimulates Na+ {{and water}} <b>reabsorption</b> from the gut, salivary and sweat glands in {{exchange}} for K+.|$|E
25|$|The hormone vasopressin, {{stimulates the}} {{activity}} of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride <b>reabsorption</b> in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water <b>reabsorption</b> in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.|$|E
25|$|His {{research}} on the uterine luminal fluid in the rat showed that estrogen causes secretion and progesterone causes <b>reabsorption</b> of uterine luminal fluid.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide {{and other}} loop diuretics inhibit the {{activity}} of NKCC2, thereby impairing sodium <b>reabsorption</b> in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.|$|E
25|$|Further effects include glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from {{adipose tissue}} and liver, {{as well as}} {{secretion}} from sweat glands and Na+ <b>reabsorption</b> from kidney.|$|E
25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which {{can compete with}} cholesterol for <b>reabsorption</b> in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol <b>reabsorption.</b> When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Decreases sodium <b>reabsorption</b> in {{the distal}} {{convoluted}} tubule (interaction with NCC) and cortical collecting duct of the nephron via guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) dependent phosphorylation of ENaC.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{increase}} of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of henle. This {{adds to the}} countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water <b>reabsorption</b> later in the distal tubule and collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone is {{responsible}} for the <b>reabsorption</b> of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates.|$|E
25|$|The AT1 {{receptor}} mediates Ang II {{to cause}} increased cardiac contractility, sodium <b>reabsorption</b> and vasoconstriction which all {{lead to increased}} blood pressure. By blocking AT1 receptors, ARBs lead to lower blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Increases {{blood flow}} through the vasa recta, which will wash the solutes (NaCl and urea) out of the {{medullary}} interstitium. The lower osmolarity of the medullary interstitium leads to less <b>reabsorption</b> of tubular fluid and increased excretion.|$|E
25|$|The macula densa {{cause an}} {{increase}} in Na+ <b>reabsorption,</b> which causes water to follow in via osmosis and leads to an ultimate increase in plasma volume. Further, the macula densa releases adenosine which causes constriction of the afferent arterioles.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{human and}} animal studies have {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for reducing serum cholesterol levels, presumably by breaking down bile in the gut, thus inhibiting its <b>reabsorption</b> (where it enters the blood as cholesterol).|$|E
25|$|The subcommissural organ/Reissner’s fiber {{complex is}} one of the factors {{involved}} in the cerebrospinal fluid <b>reabsorption</b> and circulation, which under normal physiological conditions, is secreted continuously, although this secretion undergoes circadian variations. Together, this complex is associated to functions regarding electrolyte and water balance.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the known}} actions of Ang II are {{mediated}} through the AT1 receptors, for example vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, renal sodium <b>reabsorption</b> and vasopressin secretion. The AT2 receptor also takes part in regulation of blood pressure and renal function but mediates antagonistic effects compared to the AT1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{permeability}} of {{the inner}} medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its <b>reabsorption</b> into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Hypercalciuric hypomagnesemic syndromes, which {{encompass}} the syndromes caused by mutations in CLDN16, CLDN19, CASR or CLCNKB. In these diseases, <b>reabsorption</b> of divalent cations (such as magnesium and calcium) {{in the thick}} ascending limb of Henle's loop of the kidney is impaired. This results in loss of magnesium and calcium in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include low blood {{pressure}} with standing, ringing in the ears, {{and sensitivity to}} the sun. Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. Furosemide {{is a type of}} loop diuretic that works by decreasing the <b>reabsorption</b> of sodium by the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|ANP acts on {{the kidney}} to {{increase}} sodium and water excretion {{in the following}} ways: 1) it dilates the glomerular afferent arterioles, constricts the efferent arterioles, and relaxes the mesangial cells. This increases pressure in the glomerular capillaries, increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in an increased amount of sodium and water being filtered and excreted. 2) It increases blood flow through the vasa recta, which washes the solutes NaCl and urea out of the medullary interstitium – the lower osmolarity here leads to less <b>reabsorption</b> of tubular fluid and increased excretion. 3) It decreases sodium <b>reabsorption</b> in the distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct. 4) It inhibits renin secretion, thereby inhibiting the production of angiotensin and aldosterone. 5) It inhibits the renal sympathetic nervous system. ANP has the opposite effect of aldosterone on the kidney: aldosterone increases renal sodium retention and ANP increases renal sodium loss.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Liddle's Syndrome {{has been}} implicated with {{autosomal}} dominant activating mutations in the WW interaction motif in the β-(SCNNB_HUMA) and γ-(SCNNG_HUMA) subunits of the Epithelial sodium channel ENaC. These mutations abrogate the binding to the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4, thereby inhibiting channel degradation and prolonging the half-life of ENaC, ultimately resulting in increased Na+ <b>reabsorption,</b> plasma volume extension and hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Decay {{from the}} 2p state by {{emitting}} a Lyman-α photon. This photon will almost always be reabsorbed by another hydrogen atom in its ground state. However, cosmological redshifting systematically decreases the photon frequency, {{and there is}} a small chance that it escapes <b>reabsorption</b> if it gets redshifted far enough from the Lyman-α line resonant frequency before encountering another hydrogen atom.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining {{water and}} salt {{level of the}} body. Any {{significant}} rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. An increase in osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water <b>reabsorption</b> by the kidney {{and an increase in}} urine concentration. The two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{are believed}} to increase the extracellular level of the neurotransmitter serotonin by limiting its <b>reabsorption</b> into the presynaptic cell, increasing the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft available to bind to the postsynaptic receptor. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other monoamine transporters, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine organ — bone {{controls}} phosphate metabolism {{by releasing}} fibroblast growth factor – 23 (FGF-23), which acts on kidneys to reduce phosphate <b>reabsorption.</b> Bone cells also release a hormone called osteocalcin, which {{contributes to the}} regulation of blood sugar (glucose) and fat deposition. Osteocalcin increases both the insulin secretion and sensitivity, in addition to boosting the number of insulin-producing cells and reducing stores of fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the <b>reabsorption</b> of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys secrete {{a variety}} of hormones, {{including}} erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin. Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. Calcitriol, the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal <b>reabsorption</b> of phosphate. Part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, renin is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Potassium is {{eliminated}} from the body through the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands. In the kidneys, elimination of potassium is passive (through the glomeruli), and <b>reabsorption</b> is active in the proximal tubule and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is active excretion of potassium in the distal tubule and the collecting duct; both are controlled by aldosterone. In sweat glands potassium elimination is quite similar to the kidney, its excretion is also controlled by aldosterone.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mutation}} suspected {{to convey}} the iminoglycinuria phenotype {{may be found in}} the SLC36A1 (PAT1) gene. Identified as the low-affinity intestinal transporter of glycine and imino acids, PAT1 works in cooperation with the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger NHE3 (SLC9A3). As absorption and <b>reabsorption</b> of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline occurs through PAT1 as well, it is believed to play another role in expressing the malabsorptive iminoglycinuria phenotype. Recent reports, however, suggest a more diminished role from PAT1 in some cases of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|The epoxy eicostrienoic acids (or EETs)and, presumably, the epoxy eicosatetraenoic acidshave vasodilating {{actions on}} heart, kidney, and other blood vessels {{as well as}} on the kidney's <b>reabsorption</b> of sodium and water, and act to reduce blood {{pressure}} and ischemic and other injuries to the heart, brain, and other tissues; they may also act to reduce inflammation, promote the growth and metastasis of certain tumors, promote the growth of new blood vessels, in the central nervous system regulate the release of neuropeptide hormones, and in the peripheral nervous system inhibit or reduce pain perception.|$|E
25|$|Defined as the sodium-dependent proline {{transporter}} not inhibited by alanine, system IMINO, {{believed to}} be formed by the SLC6A20 (SIT1) gene, is a crucial mammalian transport mechanism responsible for both renal <b>reabsorption</b> and intestinal absorption of proline and other imino acids, such as hydroxyproline and pipecolate. The mRNA sequence for SIT1 is expressed in {{a great deal of}} the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon. It is also found in the kidney, optical choroid, and parts of the central nervous system such the brain and microglial cells.|$|E
