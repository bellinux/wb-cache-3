The North Vietnamese quickly overran large parts of eastern Cambodia, reaching to within 15 mi of Phnom Penh. The North Vietnamese turned the newly won territories over to the Khmer Rouge.

[...] University’s president Rüdiger Bormann declared, that Guttenberg had “objectively not conformed” to academic standards. According to Bormann this fast revocation was possible because of Guttenberg’s statement. The doctoral commission made no judgment as to whether Guttenberg had acted intentionally, something that led to criticism. Such an investigation would “surely have been an extended process”, Bormann declared, which was unnecessary after Guttenberg’s <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>withdrawal</b> of his title.

The withdrawal plan envisaged that the last personnel of UNEF would leave the area on June 30, 1967. On the morning of May 27, Egypt demanded that the Canadian contingent be evacuated within 48 hours [...] "on grounds of the attitude adopted by the Government of Canada in connection with UNEF and the United Arab Republic Government's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> its <b>withdrawal,</b> and ‘to prevent any probable reaction from the people of the United Arab Republic against the Canadian Forces in UNEF.’" [...] The {{withdrawal of}} the Canadian contingent was accelerated and completed on May 31, with the effect that UNEF was left without its logistics and air support components.

40|$|Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) experience a progressive deterioration in health {{leading to a}} shortened life expectancy with concomitant psychologic challenges that also may require intervention. Approaches to address psychologic dysfunction include insight-oriented therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, hypnosis, massage, music therapy, relaxation, and family therapy. Patients who learn to use coping strategies {{are more likely to}} adhere to treatment, which helps improve both their physical and psychologic well-being. Unique stressors arise for patients awaiting lung transplant {{as a result of their}} advanced state of disease along with their fear of death before donor lungs become available. This case report demonstrates some of the psychologic struggles faced by a 10 -year-old with CF as he awaited lung transplantation, which led to a loss of hope and his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of care. Encouraging of the patient to express how his life might be improved yielded changes in his management that restored his hopefulness, and allowed him to survive long enough to undergo successful lung transplantation.

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) affects 0. 5 - 1 % {{of population}} {{all over the}} world. As the duration of treatment is more in RA, patient′s adherence to treatment is less. Controlling {{the number of patients}} lost to follow-up is essential for the successful completion of randomized clinical trials. Also, patient adherence is critical in clinical trial setting as it has impact on validity of clinical data and also it remains an issue of utmost importance to pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as scientific and regulatory community. The studies which show reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trials are done for diseases like tuberculosis (TB). None of the study is available to find reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trials in RA. Hence, this study is planned. Aims and Objectives: Find reasons and effect of age, sex, duration of therapy, and distance from home on withdrawal from clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis. Primary outcome are to find reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from trial. Results: Withdrawal from clinical trial in patients of RA is more in female. In this study, reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from study are change in location, loss to follow-up, failure of therapy, concomitant illness, patient withdrew consent, and adverse effects is the common reason <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trial in both patient and investigator-related reason <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal...</b>|$|R
