At the time, the Labour Trilogy was a profound disappointment to those who had hoped that the Charter would enlarge the rights of workers. 3 Instead, the Court reacted to fears about section 2 (d) ’s implications for labour relations with a confused and apprehensive concept of entitlement. Despite failing to establish a definition of the right, the Labour Trilogy was determinative; until this This article was originally published in the Canadian Labour and Employment Law Journal (2006 - 2007) 13 C.

Conventional {{approaches to}} leadership in sport management regard leadership as a leader-centric phenomenon. Recent {{advances in the}} generic leadership literature have highlighted the way that people construct their own understanding of leadership and shown that these influence their assessment and responses to people they regard as leaders. This observer-centric perspective is collectively known as {{the social construction of}} leadership. In this conceptual paper, we demonstrate how this emerging theoretical approach can reframe and invigorate our understanding of leadership in sport management. We explore the research implications of this new approach, reflect on what this might mean for teaching, and discuss the practical ramifications for leadership in sport management that might flow from the adoption of this approach...|$|R

The {{current study}} explored coaches’ interpersonal behaviors {{as a mechanism}} for well- and ill- being contagion from coach to athlete, and vice versa. Eighty-two coach-athlete dyads from individual sports completed self-report measures before and after a training session. Structural equation modeling supported three actor-partner interdependence mediation models, in which coaches’ pre-session well- and ill-being were associated with changes in athletes’ well- and ill-being {{over the course of}} the session. These relationships were mediated by athletes’ perceptions of their coaches’ interpersonal styles during the session. The reciprocal transfer from athlete to coach was not fully supported. Nonetheless, coaches’ perceptions of their own interpersonal behavior were associated with changes in their post-session well- and ill-being. Overall, evidence is provided for the contagion of affect from authority figures to those under their instruction, but not vice versa...|$|R

Purpose: In {{light of}} the extensive empirical evidence that implicit theories have important motivational consequences for young people {{across a range of}} educational settings we seek to provide a summary of, and personal reflection on, implicit theory research and practice in physical education (PE). Overview: We first provide an introduction to the key constructs and theoretical propositions associated with implicit theories. We then include a brief summary of the research findings on ability beliefs in school PE, which we draw on to identify several key issues that we feel are crucial to furthering our understanding of this topic. We conclude by offering a number of ideas for future research and discuss the potential misinterpretation of implicit theories when applied to professional practice in PE. Conclusion: We argue that researchers need to address more nuanced questions around implicit theories to prevent this area of inquiry stalling. Moreover, we need to provide teachers with more specific recommendations to help them integrate theory and research into practice...|$|R
40|$|Accepted author {{manuscript}} version <b>reprinted,</b> <b>by</b> <b>permission,</b> from Journal <b>of</b> Applied Biomechanics, 2017 (ahead of print) 1 - 19, [URL] © Human Kinetics, Inc. Paralympic wheelchair curling is an adapted {{version of}} Olympic curling played by individuals with spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and lower extremity amputations. To {{the best of}} the authors’ knowledge, there has been no experimental or computational research published regarding the biomechanics of wheelchair curling. Accordingly, the objective of this research was to quantify the angular joint kinematics and dynamics of a Paralympic wheelchair curler throughout the delivery. The angular joint kinematics of the upper extremity were experimentally measured using an inertial measurement unit system; the translational kinematics of the curling stone were additionally evaluated with optical motion capture. The experimental kinematics were optimized to satisfy the kinematic constraints of a subject-specific multibody biomechanical model. The optimized kinematics were subsequently used to compute the resultant joint moments via inverse dynamics analysis. The main biomechanical demands throughout the delivery (i. e., in terms of both kinematic and dynamic variables) were about the hip and shoulder joints, followed sequentially by the elbow and wrist. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to wheelchair curling delivery technique, musculoskeletal modelling, and forward dynamic simulations. This research was funded by Dr. John McPhee’s Tier I Canada Research Chair in Biomechatronic System Dynamics...|$|R

Background: Physical {{activity has}} been found to alleviate mental health problems and could be beneficial for at-risk populations, such as transgender people. This study had three aims. First, to explore the amount of physical activity that treatment seeking transgender people engage in, and to compare this to matched cisgender people. Second, to determine whether there was a difference in physical activity depending on cross-sex hormone use. Third, to determine factors which predict physical activity among treatment seeking transgender people. Method: Transgender (n= 360) and cisgender people (n= 314) were recruited from the UK. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires about physical activity, symptoms of anxiety and depression, self-esteem, body satisfaction and transphobia. Results: Transgender people engaged in less physical activity than cisgender people. Transgender people who were on cross-sex hormones engaged in more physical activity than transgender people who were not. In transgender people on cross-sex hormones, high body satisfaction was the best statistical predictor of physical activity while high self-esteem was the best statistical predictor in people who were not. Conclusion: Transgender people are less active than cisgender people. Cross-sex hormone treatment appears to be able to indirectly increase physical activity within this population, which may be beneficial for mental well-being...|$|R

Background: There {{are scarce}} {{number of studies}} describing the lifestyle of adolescents living in Arab countries. We described physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours patterns among Kuwait adolescents and the associations with parental education. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 435 adolescents (201 boys) from the Study of Health and Activity among Adolescents in Kuwait (SHAAK), conducted between 2012 - 2013. Outcomes variables included PA (Actigraph GT 1 M accelerometers) and sedentary behaviours. Exposure variable was parental education. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the association between parental education and outcomes variables. Results: Total sedentary time (minutes/day) was higher in girls (568. 2 ± 111. 6) than boys (500. 0 ± 102. 0), whereas boys accumulated more minutes in light, moderate and vigorous PA (all P-values≤ 0. 001). In total, 3. 4 % of adolescents spent ≥ 60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous PA (by accelerometry) whilst only 21 % met screen-time guidelines. Low/medium maternal education {{was associated with a}} higher odds of exceeding screen-time guidelines (OR, 95 % CI: 2. 09, 1. 09 - 4. 02). Conclusions: Most Kuwaiti adolescents in this sample were physically inactive and exceeded screen-time guidelines.
