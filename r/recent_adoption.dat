These measures include: public awareness campaigns on railway safety in the media; construction of fences and safety barriers at critical level crossings in major cities; mobilization of volunteers for traffic control at train stations and level crossings, especially during holiday seasons; the installation of additional auto-signal systems; and the construction of flyovers and underpasses to redirect traffic.|$|E
25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised {{with respect to the}} United States Department of Defense's <b>recent</b> <b>adoption</b> of RFID tags for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E

"Green" [...] {{in modern}} European {{languages}} corresponds to about 520–570nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using {{a term for}} the range of ca. 450–530nm ("blue/green") and another for ca. 530–590nm ("green/yellow"). In the comparative study of color terms in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue). (See distinction of green from blue) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote [...] "green", but these terms are recognizable as <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> {{that are not in}} origin color terms (much like the English adjective [...] being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit).

5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Newfoundland, Anderson became a strong proponent of {{daylight}} saving time and three times introduced a bill to the Legislative Council for its adoption. The first two attempts, in 1909 and 1910, failed. In 1917, spurred on perhaps by the <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> of DST in Europe, Anderson introduced a third bill which passed on June 17, 1917. The new law stated that at nine o'clock in {{the evening of the}} second Sunday in June clocks would be put ahead to ten o'clock and would not be turned back until the last Sunday in September. It is not clear exactly when clocks were put ahead in 1917, as the bill became law one week after DST was scheduled to take effect. In St. John's DST was first applied on April 8, 1917 by virtue of a local ordinance. DST in Newfoundland {{came to be known as}} [...] "Anderson’s Time", at least in the years immediately following its adoption.|$|R

In this article, the authors analyze the dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing on {{the adoption of a}} new high-technology product. Social influence is likely to play a role because the decision to adopt a high-involvement product requires extensive information gathering from various sources. The authors use call detail records to construct ego networks for a large sample of customers of a Dutch mobile telecommunications operator. Using a fractional polynomial hazard approach to model adoption timing and multiple social influence variables, they provide a fine-grained analysis of social influence. They show that the effect of social influence from cumulative adoptions in a customer's network decreases from the product introduction onward, whereas the influence of <b>recent</b> <b>adoptions</b> remains constant. The effect of direct marketing is also positive and decreases from the product introduction onward. This study provides new insights into the adoption of high-technology products by analyzing dynamic effects of social influence and direct marketing simultaneously...|$|R
