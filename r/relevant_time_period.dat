40|$|Abstract: Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{a normal}} by-product of cellular metabolism that in higher concentrations can cause oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species impair the physiological functions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are known as one major cause of ocular pathologies. Most studies investigating the influence of H 2 O 2 on cells in culture but H 2 O 2 concentrations are not sustained in culture medium. Continuous generation using glucose oxidase (GOx) system allows application of relevant low H 2 O 2 concentrations over physiologically <b>relevant</b> <b>times</b> <b>periods</b> (up to 24 h). Recent findings suggest that bolus and GOx treatments can lead to different cellular response, thus warranting a quantitative comparison between the two approaches. When added as a pulse H 2 O 2 is rapidly depleted. Continuous generation of H 2 O 2 produces different behavior in function of GOx activities. Cytotoxicity analyses show that cells can tolerate short exposure to high H 2 O...|$|R

40|$|We review recent methodological {{advances}} in electromagnetic source imaging and present EEG data from our laboratory obtained by {{application of these}} methods. There are two principal steps in our analysis of multichannel electromagnetic recordings: (i) the determination of functionally <b>relevant</b> <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> in the ongoing electric activity and (ii) the localization of the sources in the brain that generate these activities recorded on the scalp. We propose a temporal segmentation of the time-varying activity, {{which is based on}} determination of changes in the topography of the electric fields, as an approach to the first step, and a distributed linear inverse solution based on realistic head models as an approach to the second step. Data from studies of visual motion perception, visuo-motor transfer, mental imagery, semantic decision, and cognitive interference illustrate that this analysis allows us to define the patterns of electric activity that are present at given <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> after stimulus presentation, as well as those <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> where significantly different patterns appear between different stimuli and tasks.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between openness and inflation has been generally posed {{as a negative}} relationship. Since Romer (1993) first proposed his study, under the guise {{that the absence of}} precommitment to monetary expansion can lead to higher inflation, many other studies and regressions have been done, attributing the effects to different causes or under special circumstances. Terra (1998) argued that the negative results were due to severely indebted countries in the 1980 s, resulting in largely different magnitudes during different periods. Alfaro (2005) incorporated Reinhart and Rogoff's (2004) measure of exchange rate regime and found a positive relationship. And recently, Lin (2010) incorporated Koenker's (2004) quantile regression method, accounting for effects of openness on different levels of inflation, resulting in positive and negative effects as well as significant and insignificant.

This protein serves as the vital link between the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and the extracellular matrix (ECM) via interactions with integrins and a-dystroglycan. Loss of laminin results in impaired myofiber anchoring, structural instability, and a multitude of dysregulated signaling pathways leading to many devastating secondary pathologies. Much of the work to date has focused on studying pathology at the end-stages of disease in mouse models.

40|$|Acceptance {{of marine}} {{protected}} areas (MPAs) as fishery and conservation tools has been hampered {{by lack of}} direct evidence that MPAs successfully seed unprotected areas with larvae of targeted species. For the first time, we present direct evidence of large-scale population connectivity within an existing and effective network of MPAs. A new parentage analysis identified four parent-offspring pairs from a large, exploited population of the coral-reef fish Zebrasoma flavescens in Hawai’i, revealing larval dispersal distances ranging from 15 to 184 km. In two cases, successful dispersal was from an MPA to unprotected sites. Given high adult abundances, the documentation of any parent-offspring pairs demonstrates that ecologically-relevant larval connectivity between reefs is substantial. All offspring settled at sites {{to the north of}} where they were spawned. Satellite altimetry and oceanographic models from <b>relevant</b> <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> indicated a cyclonic eddy that created prevailing northward currents between sites where parents and offspring were found.
