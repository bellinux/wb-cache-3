The Quarc scheme significantly outperforms the Spidergon NoC through balancing the traffic {{which is the result}} of the modifications applied to the topology and the routing elements. The proposed architecture is highly efficient in performing collective communication operations including broadcast and multicast.

A dynamic control policy that utilizes the maximal matching (for scheduling) and the join-the-shortest-queue (for <b>routing)</b> <b>discipline,</b> {{is shown to}} maximize the throughput and stabilize the system in a sense called “uniform mean recurrence time property ” under fairly mild stochastic assumptions. Owing to the non-Markovian nature of the states, system stability is established using a perturbed Lyapunov function method.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{performance}} bound calculus on feedforward networks where data packets are routed under wormhole <b>routing</b> <b>discipline.</b> We are interested in determining maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs of messages or packets going from a source node to a destination node, through a given virtual path in the network. Our objective here is to give a network calculus approach for calculating the performance bounds. First we propose a new concept of curves that we call packet curves. The curves permit to model constraints on packet lengths of a given data flow, when the lengths are allowed to be different. Second, we use this new concept to propose an approach for calculating residual services for data flows served under non preemptive service disciplines. Third, we model a binary switch (with two input ports and two output ports), where data is served under wormhole discipline. We present our approach for computing the residual services and deduce the worst case bounds for flows passing through a wormhole binary switch. Finally, we illustrate this approach in numerical examples, and show how to extend it to feedforward networks. Comment: 26 page...|$|E

Connor arrived with the 3rd Regiment of California Volunteers in 1862. While in Utah, Connor and his men soon became discontent with this assignment wanting to head to Virginia where the [...] "real" [...] fighting and glory was occurring. Connor established Fort Douglas just three miles (5km) east of Salt Lake City and encouraged his bored and often idle men {{to go out and}} explore for mineral deposits to bring more non-Mormons into the state. Minerals were discovered in Tooele County, and some miners began to come to the territory. Conner also [...] "solved" [...] the Shoshone Indian [...] "problem" [...] in Cache Valley Utah by luring the Shoshone into a midwinter confrontation on January 29, 1863. The armed conflict quickly turned into a <b>rout,</b> <b>discipline</b> among the soldiers broke down, and the Battle of Bear River is today usually referred to by historians as the Bear River Massacre,where about 200 American troops (Not the Confederate States) swooped in and killed over 250 men, women, and even children. Between 200 and 400 Shoshone men, women and children were killed, as were 27 soldiers, with over 50 more soldiers wounded or suffering from frostbite.|$|R
40|$|As new {{networking}} applications rapidly arise {{to support}} the growing needs of various communication services, the traffic patterns in networks have {{become more and more}} difficult to predict. It is therefore important for the routing infrastructure to be reliable and robust to accommodate unpredictable traffic patterns and guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). Conventional routing schemes, however, require accurate traffic matrix knowledge to achieve good performance. But real traffic patterns are difficult to predict and as a result, can differ from the traffic matrix assumed in the planning phase. This makes it difficult to design a reliable routing scheme and provide QoS guarantees. Therefore, developing a routing scheme that can handle unpredictable traffic patterns has become a critical task. This thesis addresses the above mentioned problem by focusing on the theories and applications of oblivious routing - a <b>routing</b> <b>discipline</b> that can maintain a stable performance even when the traffic matrix changes. Through static pre-configured paths, a network with oblivious routing need not constantly re-calculate and re-deploy routing paths. The major challenge, however, lies in how to reduce the capacity cost or increase the throughput of such a network. Optimization problems are formulated and solved for this purpose in unicast networks. The main contribution of this thesis can be grouped in two parts, one is related to the theories and the other related to the applications of oblivious routing. On the theory side, we focus on multicast networks and discrete-bandwidth networks. For multicast networks, we show that network coding can be used to achieve oblivious routing with high throughput. We prove that the optimal paths between a source-destination pair in a unicast network are also the optimal paths for the pair in a multicast network with network coding; and that a multicast network can admit the same amount of traffic as a unicast network. For discrete-bandwidth networks, we present a framework for designing a discrete-bandwidth nonblocking network by combining theories from both oblivious routing and Clos switching networks. As for applications, we apply the theories developed for oblivious routing in designing new Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) architectures. We propose a new design methodology that will lead to NoCs with a predicable performance regardless of the traffic pattern produced by an application, and the network cost is minimized under the given model. We also explore ways to design oblivious-routing Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). We explore how to incorporate the new constraints imposed by link interferences into the throughput optimization formulation and obtain optimal routing and link scheduling...|$|E

The quality-of-service (QoS) metrics are represented as functions of link bandwidth, node buffers and the queuing service disciplines {{employed in the}} routers along the path. Our scheme allows smart tuning of buffer-space and bandwidth during the routing process to adjust the QoS of the interdomain path. We formulate and solve the bandwidth and buffer allocation problem for a path over heterogeneous networks consisting of different queuing services disciplines such as generalized processor sharing (GPS), packet by packet generalized processor sharing (PGPS) and self-clocked fair queuing (SCFQ).

Experimental results are given showing that the bounds give good analytical predictions of the actual performance of both random destination routing and practical probabilistic PRAM simulation on meshes. The experiments are carried out on a mesh with small fixed queues and memory randomized by pseudo-random hash functions.

40|$|The Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) is a {{component}} of the global DECnet Internet, which has over 17, 000 host computers. The growth of SPAN from its implementation in 1981 to its present size of well over 2, 500 registered SPAN host computers, has created a need for users to acquire timely information about the network through a central source. The SPAN Network Information Center (SPAN-NIC) an online facility managed by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) was developed to meet this need for SPAN-wide information. The remote node descriptive information in this document is not currently contained in the SPAN-NIC database, but will be incorporated in the near future. Access to this information is also available to non-DECnet users over a variety of networks such as Telenet, the NASA Packet Switched System (NPSS), and the TCP/IP Internet. This publication serves as the Yellow Pages for SPAN node information. The document also provides key information concerning other computer networks connected to SPAN, nodes associated with each SPAN <b>routing</b> center, science <b>discipline</b> nodes, contacts for primary SPAN nodes, and SPAN reference information. A section on DECnet Internetworking discusses SPAN connections with other wide-area DECnet networks (many with thousands of nodes each). Another section lists node names and their disciplines, countries, and institutions in the SPAN Network Information Center Online Data Base System. All remote sites connected to US-SPAN and European-SPAN (E-SPAN) are indexed. Also provided is information on the SPAN tail circuits, i. e., those remote nodes connected directly to a SPAN routing center, which is the local point of contact for resolving SPAN-related problems. Reference material is included for those who wish to know more about SPAN. Because of the rapid growth of SPAN, the SPAN Yellow Pages is reissued periodically...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{classical}} store-and-forward routing has {{and will}} continue to be the most important routing architecture in many modern packet-switched communication networks. In a packet-switched network, data is sent in the form of discrete packets that traverse hop-by-hop from a source to a destination. At each intermediate hop, the router stores and examines the packets it receives then forwards them to the next hop until they reach the correct destinations according to some pre-defined routing algorithms. Importantly, the intermediate routers do not modify but simply store and forward the contents of the packets. In contrast, a new generalized approach to routing called Network Coding (NC) allows the intermediate routers to modify and combine packets from different sources and destinations in such a way that increases the overall throughput. The core idea of NC allowing the intermediate nodes in a network to perform data processing has a wide range of applications well beyond its initial application to <b>routing,</b> impacting different <b>disciplines</b> from distributed data storage and security to energy efficient sensor networks and Internet media streaming. To that end, this dissertation aims to develop the theories and applications of NC via four main thrusts: 1) Energy efficient NC techniques for sensor networks, 2) Novel NC techniques and protocols for Internet video streaming, 3) Stochastic data replenishment for large scale NC-based distributed storage systems, 4) Real-world implementation of NC-based distributed video streaming system. In thrust one, we describe a novel cross-sensor coding technique that combines network topology and coding techniques to maximize the life-time of a sensor network, by addressing the uneven energy consumption problem in data gathering sensor networks where the nodes closer to the sink tend to consume more energy than those of the farther nodes. Our approach is based on the following observation from the sensor networks using On-Off Keying and digital transmission: transmitting bit " 1 " consumes much more energy than bit " 0 ". Our proposed coding technique exploits this difference to reduce the communication energy by limiting the number of bits " 1 " in the output codeword (low-weight codeword) and to use NC-based cross-sensor coding technique to equalize the communication energy among the nodes. This cross-sensor coding scheme can significantly extend the network lifetime as compared with traditional (binary) coding by solving the energy-consumption unfairness problem. The theoretical and experimental results confirm that transmission energy can be reduced substantially (e. g., a factor of 15) and the unequal energy consumption among nodes can be practically eliminated. In thrust two, we describe a rate distortion aware hierarchical NC technique and transport protocol for Internet video streaming. We begin by proposing a NC-based multi-sender streaming framework that reduces the overall storage, eliminates the complexity of sender synchronization, and enables TCP streaming. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Network Coding (HNC) technique that facilitates scalable video streaming to combat bandwidth fluctuation on the Internet. This HNC technique enables receiver to recover the important data gracefully in the presence of limited bandwidth which causes an increase in decoding delay. Simulations demonstrate that under certain scenarios, our proposed NC techniques can result in bandwidth saving up to 60...|$|R
