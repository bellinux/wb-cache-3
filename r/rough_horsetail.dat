50|$|Equisetum hyemale, {{commonly}} known as <b>rough</b> <b>horsetail,</b> scouring rush, scouringrush horsetail and in South Africa as snake grass, is a perennial herb in the fern Division Pteridophyta. It is a native plant throughout the Holarctic Kingdom, found in North America, Europe, and northern Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Other names include candock for {{branching}} individuals, and snake {{grass or}} scouring-rush for unbranched or sparsely branched individuals. The latter name {{refers to the}} rush-like appearance of the plants, and {{to the fact that}} the stems are coated with abrasive silicates, making them useful for scouring (cleaning) metal items such as cooking pots or drinking mugs, particularly those made of tin. In German, the corresponding name is Zinnkraut ("tin-herb"). <b>Rough</b> <b>horsetail</b> E. hyemale is still boiled and then dried in Japan, to be used for the final polishing process on woodcraft to produce a smoother finish than any sandpaper. In Spanish-speaking countries, these plants are known as [...] "cola de caballo," [...] meaning [...] "horsetail." ...|$|E
5000|$|The genus Equisetum as a whole, while {{concentrated}} in the non-tropical northern hemisphere, is near-cosmopolitan, being absent only from Antarctica, though they are not known to be native to Australia, New Zealand nor the islands of the Pacific. They are most common in northern North America (Canada and the northernmost United States), where the genus is represented by nine species (arvense, fluviatile, palustre, pratense, sylvaticum, hyemale, laevigatum, scirpoides, and variegatum). Only four (bogotense, giganteum, myriochaetum, and ramosissimum) of the fifteen species {{are known to be}} native south of the Equator. They are perennial plants, herbaceous and dying back in winter as most temperate species, or evergreen as most tropical species and the temperate species <b>rough</b> <b>horsetail</b> (E. hyemale), branched horsetail (E. ramosissimum), dwarf horsetail (E. scirpoides) and variegated horsetail (E. variegatum). They typically grow 0.2-1.5 m tall, though the [...] "giant horsetails" [...] are recorded to grow as high as 2.5 m (northern giant horsetail, E. telmateia), 5 m (southern giant horsetail, E. giganteum) or 8 m (Mexican giant horsetail, E. myriochaetum), and allegedly even more.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} use of sandpaper was in 1st-century China when crushed shells, seeds, and sand were bonded to parchment using natural gum. Shark skin (placoid scales) {{has also been}} used as an abrasive and the rough scales of the living fossil, Coelacanth are used for the same purpose by the natives of Comoros. Boiled and dried, the <b>rough</b> <b>horsetail</b> plant is used in Japan as a traditional polishing material, finer than sandpaper. Glass paper was manufactured in London in 1833 by John Oakey, whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. Glass frit has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive. Cheap sandpaper was often passed off as glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing published in 1688. [...] In 1921, 3M invented a sandpaper with silicon carbide grit and a waterproof adhesive and backing, known as Wet and dry. This allowed use with water, which {{would serve as a}} lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was in automotive paint refinishing.|$|E
40|$|In England in {{the early}} 19 th century at least two {{products}} went by the commercial name Dutch Rush, viz. the <b>Rough</b> <b>Horsetail</b> Equisetum hyemale L. used in cabinet making and similar crafts, and the Common Club-rush/Bulrush Schoenoplectus lacustris (L.) Palla used in matting and chair manufacturing. Some authors did not heed the scientific names and confused the properties and geo-cultural backgrounds of both products. Thus the myth took hold that E. hyemale was in culture in the Netherlands and that is was deliberately planted and cared for to protect that country from the sea. Scarce but widespread evidence of trade reveals that this species was economically insignificant. The idea that it owes its common name to imports from Holland could be correct; however, other parts of North and Central Europe, especially the upper Rhine Valley, {{are more likely to}} be the original sources from where the Dutch obtained the plants. North America can be reasoned to be an alternative origin, but evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking...|$|E
