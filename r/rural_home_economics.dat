Tavoitteena on kuvata ja tulkita alan ammattikasvatuksen historiallisia kerrostumia, muutoksia ja jatkuvuuksia. Tutkimuksen tulkinnan mukaan kotitalousalan ammattikasvatus muodostuu varhais-, maaseutu-, kotitalous- ja palveluammatillisista kehitysvaiheista. Varhaisvaiheessa alan koulutusta syntyi erilaisten taustayhteisöjen tukemana kouluhallinnon ja sittemmin perustetun maataloushallinnon alaisuuteen. Ensimmäinen kotitalouskoulutusta määrittelevä laki ohjasi sitä maatalouden yhteyteen. Maaseutuammatillisen koulutuksen kehittämisestä vastasi maataloushallinto, jonka merkittävä saavutus oli kotitalousopettajakoulutuksen käynnistäminen. Kotitalousammatillisessa vaiheessa syntyi koti- ja laitostalousala. Ammatillinen koulutus järjestyi ammattikasvatushallintoon mittavassa keskiasteen uudistusprojektissa. Palveluammatillinen vaihe ilmeni alan laaja-alaistumisena osaksi palvelusektoria ja kotitalouspalvelujen kehittymisenä. Tuolloin koulutus jakautui ammatilliselle toiselle asteelle ja korkea-asteelle. Tutkimuksessa esitellään kahden tapauskoulutarinan avulla kotitalousalan koulutuksen kehityskaari alkuvaiheesta nykypäivään. Historian tunteminen tarjoaa perspektiivin tuleville valinnoille. Vaikka {{historian}} ratkaisut eivät sellaisenaan ole siirrettävissä nykypäivän toimintamalleiksi, ne voivat tuottaa virikkeitä kehittämisprosesseihin. Alan taustojen tunteminen auttaa eri toimijoita ymmärtämään tehtyjä ratkaisuja ja niiden perusteluita. Näin ollen teos palvelee kaikkia alan ammattikasvattajia. Erityisesti tuleva tutkimus hyötyy tästä perustutkimukseen lukeutuvasta aihepiirin käsittelystä. Tutkimuksen tietoa voidaan soveltaa ammattikasvatuksen ja kasvatuksen tulevassa tutkimuksessa sekä koulutuksen opetus- ja kehittämistyössä. Tutkimuksen voi toivoa löytävän tiensä lukuisten tutkijoiden ja opettajien käsiin. Tulosten perusteella voidaan päätellä, että koulumuotoisesta ammattikasvatuksesta on muodostunut suomalainen tapa tuottaa uutta ammatillista osaamista työelämän tarpeeseen. Koulutustaso ja -rakenne ilmentävät eri aikoina vallinnutta käsitystä koulutuksen järjestämisestä. Yksialaiset koulut ovat muuttuneet pienistä sisäoppilaitoksista ensin tavallisiksi päiväkouluiksi ja edelleen osaksi monialaisia koulutuskonserneja. Opettajien ammattitaidon varaan rakentunut ammatillinen opetus on muuttunut moniammatilliseksi tiimityöksi. Kuusi luokkaa kansakoulua on vaihtunut peruskoulu-, ammattikoulu- ja lukiotaustoiksi. Ennen aikaan kotona opituista arkielämän taidoista on kehittynyt osaamista vaativia ammatteja ja tutkintoja. Kotitaloustyössä on kyse pääosin naisten tekemästä matalapalkkaisesta työstä. Alan ammattien vähäinen arvostus juontuu sekä ammattitaidon yhdistymisestä naisten osaamiseen että sen liittymisestä arkisiin toimiin. The {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis, situated {{within the}} field of education, is to depict and analyze the various development stages, changes and continuums of home economics vocational training from an administrative-political viewpoint. The research question is: “How has home economics vocational education been formed in the case schools?” The framework of reference covers vocational education as a form of education. The paradigm of vocational education within home economics education comprises the field itself, its administration and different aspects of education. The core of the research lies in education, when scrutinized from the administrative-political angle. The methodological orientation is the history of education. The informative research material comprises research papers, statistics and documents that cover the field, education in general and administration of education. The archives of two case schools and material collected through interviews were exploited. The first case school, Elias Lönnrotin Emännyyskoulu, represents vocational training, whereas the second case school, Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto, is a teacher training facility. Developing home economics education has had two orientations in Finland: it has been developed both for the needs of the countryside and cities. The focus in this thesis is mainly on the <b>rural</b> <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> education. In the countryside home economics comprised the tasks needed to carry out in home, with livestock and when farming. The case schools merge into Laurea University of Applied Sciences’ degree programmes in Service Management. Already before the reform in the 1990 s, when the vocational institute was separated from the university-level education, the case schools had seen major changes in their field of operation, administrative and educational structure. The housekeeping school, which was founded in Sammatti in 1897, operated 50 years as a private school, under the administration of school administration, and taught girls, who had been to elementary school, home economics skills. The housekeeping school was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and it became a state-owned school in the 1940 s and it carried out its operations as a housekeeping school until the 1980 s. During the reform of the secondary education the home economics education, which was supervised by agricultural administration, became a part of the vocational education system and was now being supervised by the National Board of Vocational Education. The housekeeping school became a home economics institute that qualified students for vo- cational professions in its programmes. Jobs corresponding these qualifications were available in the field of home economics and institutional household and the education focused on see- ing to the services within public administration. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos was established to provide for educational needs as a result of migration. This school, owned by the federation of municipalities, was founded as an affiliated school of Elias Lönnrotin emäntäkoulu. Espoon koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos became Espoon palvelualojen oppilaitos in 1996. Its institutes merged into a university of applied sciences and the secondary education re- mained where it was, as part of the federation of municipalities. The school, which was foun- ded in Sammatti, is nowadays Lönnrotin Opisto, owned by Työtehoseura, and it produces know-how for the service field. Järvenpään Kotitalousopettajaopisto (teacher training institute) was established in 1928 and it was supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture to serve the needs of the home economics skills as needed in farming. The operations of Kotitalousopettajisto were stabilized after the years of war and the Great Depression. The housekeeping and home economics schools that were parts of the institute served the needs of teacher training as placement schools. The teacher training institute became a home economics school in 1963 where candidates with university-level degrees could qualify as teachers. When Kotitalousopettajaopisto was closed down in 1997, the teacher training was merged into Jyväskylä Teacher Education College. The secondary vocational education was continued in Tuusulanjärvi-instituutti and the various in- stitute-level programmes joined the local university of applied sciences. The vocational education {{within the field of}} home economics consists of the development stages of an early stage, agricultural industry, home economics and service trade professions. In the early stage of de- velopment, education within the field was created and supported by various communities under the governance of school administration and later on under the governance of agricultural administration. The first law dictating home economics education unified different school forms and forced them under the governance of agricultural administration. The Department of Home Economics was in charge of developing the education in the countryside. The education in its entirety was further advanced by the introduction of teacher training in Järvenpää. The development of home economics education comprises the advancement of middle school education into professional education as well as the introduction of the field of home economics and institutional household. Vocational education focusing on services can be seen as an element of both the advancement of the service field and development of home economics services and the division of education at two levels, vocational upper secondary level and university-level...|$|E

What are the beliefs of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers concerning: a. the students who can profit from <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> b. the image of <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> c. the status of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> in the secondary curriculum? d. the factors which they believed counselors should consider when counseling students to enroll or not to enroll in <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> e. the grade or grades in which girls and/or boys should take <b>home</b> <b>economics?</b> 2. How do <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers help counselors understand the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program in their schools? Represented in this study were 160 teachers who made up 49 percent of the junior and senior high school <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers in Oregon. A questionnaire sent out to the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers contained items concerning the school and <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program, the teachers' background, beliefs about <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> is part of the curriculum, beliefs about who should enroll in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes, beliefs about what a counselor should consider when enrolling a student into <b>home</b> <b>economics,</b> and practices of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers in helping counselors understand the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> program. Analysis of the data shows that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers believed that all students can profit from <b>home</b> <b>economics.</b> They also believed that some <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> courses should be taken by all students at some time during their secondary school career. They also felt that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes for girls are valuable in all grades, seven through 12, but that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes for boys are most valuable in the eleventh and twelfth grades. Over 75 percent of the teachers believed that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes are interesting and challenging and that a <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> degree from college offers a chance to have an interesting and rewarding career.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the differences in perception of competence in processes practised in <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> education as expressed by students of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> and those who have not studied <b>Home</b> <b>Economics.</b> The research method consisted of applying a questionnaire to five hundred senior students enrolled in high schools in Brisbane, Queensland. The survey items were designed to test students perception and source of competence and the value they place on <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> knowledge expressed in terms of life skills. To augment the study, teachers of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> were surveyed to establish the emphasis they place on processes during teaching, their perception of sources of students' skills and the value they place on life skills taught during <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> classes. The questions focused upon management and design skills and interpersonal interaction competence. Results indicated that students of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> perceived an enhanced level of competence in life skills at all stages of the design and management processes. <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> students also perceived competence in practices of caring and a significant number of behaviours implicit in interpersonal interaction when compared with non <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> students. Students of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> perceived the school, the home and their friends as positive sources for skill development in management, design and interpersonal interaction. Non <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> perceived the <b>home</b> as the only resource for management skills, but they do not perceive school, home or friends as resources for acquiring design skills. However, they target the school, their friends and home as sources for interpersonal skill development. Teachers of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> perceived the school, home and student's friends as a source of management and interpersonal skills but responded negatively to the home as a source of design skills. <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> students, non <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> students and teachers of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> placed a high value on <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> knowledge expressed as life skills.

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>economics</b> {{is one of}} the {{required}} subjects from elementary school to high school education in Japan. Especially, both boys and girls have begun to learn this subject since 1994 at high school. Nowadays, <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> education is expected for building a new society promising gender justice for both women and men. Thus, educational system changed more equitably than before.

40|$|Master of EducationThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the image of the subject <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> in relation to its market position within secondary schools. For the purposes of this research project, market position was measured by the number of students who proceeded with <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> as a senior course of study at the VCE level. With a predicted shortage of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> teachers, it was important to establish students' perception of the subject as they are the potential undergraduates for the teaching profession of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics.</b> Teacher views were also important to determine whether their perception of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> was the same as that of students. A mixed-method approach of data collection was selected. A survey was conducted amongst <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> teachers who were members of the Victorian <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> and Textiles Teachers' Association. Qualitative data were obtained from one teacher focus group and two student focus groups from independent schools. The most significant finding of the research was that the image of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> amongst students was positive but also depended on the promotion of the subject by the <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> teacher in that school. It was also found that it was not image of the subject that determined its market position but the lower scaling of the subject in relation to other VCE subjects, particularly those perceived as `academic'. Thus, the `academic' status of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> was found to be the critical factor determining whether or not students chose the subject at senior levels. This issue must be addressed in order to encourage more students to elect <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> so that the, potential pool of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> undergraduates increases.

Students responded to items concerning (1) their perceptions of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> and curriulum, (2) school activities, (3) demographic information, and (4) topics they would like to see taught in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes. Items were analyzed with gender, grade level, student enrollment in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes, parents'/ guardians' enrollment in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classes, and after-graduation plans as the independent variables using the Mann-Whitney U Test.

Of the 205 questionnaires mailed, 102 were returned, six of which were not usable. The sample of this study was therefore 96. The completed questionnaires were hand tabulated using tabulation sheets. Frequency distributions and percentages were derived from the data collected. Seven, or 7. 28 percent of the 96 universities in the sample offered a major in <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> rehabilitation/habilitation. They are: Colorado State University; The Pennsylvania State University; The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, The University of Missouri; Ohio State University; Southern Illinois University; and the University of Georgia. Sixty-four, or 66. 67 percent, of the sample returned questionnaires stating that no major in rehabilitation/habilitation was offered in their <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> units, but concepts were being taught as part of their <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> course instruction.

In the countries concerned, there is more attention devoted to <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> as it is believed that it is focused on an individual and the family as the cornerstone of the society and economy.

40|$|Two {{perceptions}} of the marginality of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> are widespread across educational and other contexts. One is that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> and those who engage in its pedagogy are inevitably marginalised within patriarchal relations in education and culture. This is because <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> is characterised as women's knowledge, for the private domain of the home. The other perception is that only orthodox epistemological frameworks of inquiry {{should be used to}} interrogate this state of affairs. These perceptions have prompted leading theorists in the field to call for non-essentialist approaches to research in order to re-think the thinking that has produced this cul-de-sac positioning of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> as a body of knowledge and a site of teacher practice. This thesis takes up the challenge of working to locate a space outside the frame of modernist research theory and methods, recognising that this shift in epistemology is necessary to unsettle the idea that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> is inevitably marginalised. The purpose of the study is to reconfigure how we have come to think about <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers and the profession of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> as a site of cultural practice, in order to think it otherwise (Lather, 1991). This is done by exploring how the culture of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> is being contested from within. To do so, the thesis uses a 'posthumanist' approach, which rejects the conception of the individual as a unitary and fixed entity, but instead as a subject in process, shaped by desires and language which are not necessarily consciously determined. This posthumanist project focuses attention on pedagogical body subjects as the 'unsaid' of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> research. It works to transcend the modernist dualism of mind/body, and other binaries central to modernist work, including private/public, male/female,paid/unpaid, and valued/unvalued. In so doing, it refuses the simple margin/centre geometry so characteristic of current {{perceptions of}} <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> itself. Three studies make up this work. Studies one and two serve to document the disciplined body of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> knowledge, the governance of which works towards normalisation of the 'proper' <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teacher. The analysis of these accounts of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers by <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers, reveals that <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers are 'skilled' yet they 'suffer' for their profession. Further,home economics knowledge is seen to be complicit in reinforcing the traditional roles of masculinity and femininity, thereby reinforcing heterosexual normativity which is central to patriarchal society. The third study looks to four 'atypical'subjects who defy the category of 'proper' and 'normal' <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teacher. These 'atypical' bodies are 'skilled' but fiercely reject the label of 'suffering'. The discussion of the studies is a feminist poststructural account, using Russo's (1994) notion of the grotesque body, which is emergent from Bakhtin's (1968) theory of the carnivalesque. It draws on the 'shreds' of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> pedagogy,scrutinising them for their subversive, transformative potential. In this analysis, the giving and taking of pleasure and fun in the <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> classroom presents moments of surprise and of carnival. Foucault's notion of the construction of the ethical individual shows these 'atypical' bodies to be 'immoderate' yet striving hard to be 'continent' body subjects. This research captures moments of transgression which suggest that transformative moments are already embodied in the pedagogical practices of <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers, and these can be 'seen' when re-looking through postmodemist lenses. Hence, the cultural practices ofhome economics as inevitably marginalised are being contested from within. Until now, <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> as a lived culture has failed to recognise possibilities for reconstructing its own field beyond the confines of modernity. This research {{is an example of how}} to think about <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> teachers and the profession as a reconfigured cultural practice. Future research about <b>home</b> <b>economics</b> as a body of knowledge and a site of teacher practice need not retell a simple story of oppression. Using postmodemist epistemologies is one way to provide opportunities for new ways of looking...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine how teacher perceive the <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subject - both those who have the appropriate formal education to teach <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subject as well as others. The research was conducted among 57 teachers with adequate and 32 teachers with inadequate formal education to teach the <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subject. The results showed that both, teachers with adequate and teacher with inadequate formal education perceived the <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subject as a less demanding subject.

With statement that <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subject is important for personal and also professional life more agreed teachers with adequate formal education (<b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> teachers). Awareness of the importance of teaching content for individual well-being is certainly an important factor for the quality of teaching.

40|$|This {{study on}} the {{evolution}} of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> has shown that the English Domestic Science framework was used as the foundation of the Malaysian Domestic Science. In addition, three phases of development on <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> took place in Malaysia, foundation, consolidation and expansion, were identified. <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> in Malaysia is identified as a multidisciplinary subject As for the impact of British colonisation, its effects have been far-reaching on the lives of those who had taken <b>Home</b> <b>Economics.</b> The findings from this study illustrate the esteem with which the subject was held. The legacy of the English influence on the Malaysian education policies and technology cannot be denied. Concerning the perceptions of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> in Malaysia, the finding had shown that <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> in Malaysia is also perceived as a multidisciplinary subject Two distinctive orientations of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> were elicited from the participants. The social orientation of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> includes the basic knowledge and skills of cooking, sewing, budgeting, physical resource management, family relationships, human development, nutritional knowledge and the impact of technology. The diminishing of basic skills in cooking and sewing among the younger generation is the most obvious trend. So long as human beings exist, the three basic physiological needs: food, clothing and shelter will remain fundamental, so these must also underlie the social aspect of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics.</b> This must be taught to all at school level in order to educate the future generation to be a wholesome person intellectually, spiritually, emotionally and physically as stated in the Malaysian Educational Philosophy. However, the economic aspect of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics,</b> which includes technical/vocational <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> subjects in school, and vocational <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> programmes at extension level as well as at university, has the edge over the social aspect of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics,</b> because of the current government policy on mainstreaming Technical and Vocational Education. Moreover, the cognitive skills include critical thinking, problem solving and creativity, and affective skills such as relationship skills, active listening and negotiation skills, are embedded in each area of the content of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics.</b> Some undergraduates from university had suggested renaming, but retaining the name 'Home Economics' is the way forward for Malaysia because many countries had experienced that renaming would not solve the issue of status or identity. In terms of the public's perception on gender roles and gender stereotyping, there still exists the unequal power relationship attributed to <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> and women in the Malaysian context This patriarchal society still marginalises and categorises <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> and women both as powerless and trivialises their input into society. This is despite a refocusing of <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> in Malaysia, partly due to a move towards western values and the cultivation of career perspectives, whilst in essence the education system continues to propagate patriarchal ideology through the hidden curriculum, By analysing society through the feminist lens and beginning the process of employing the technique of consciousness raising within education, would help to empower women in Malaysia to challenge inequality and unequal power relationships that currently exist in <b>Home</b> <b>Economics</b> careers and for women in Malaysia society.
