40|$|Background: Biomass {{refining}} into multiple products {{has gained}} considerable momentum {{due to its}} potential benefits for economic and environmental sustainability. However, the recalcitrance of biomass is a major challenge in bio-based product production. Multilevel composition fractionation processes should be beneficial in overcoming biomass recalcitrance and achieving effective conversion of multiple compositions of biomass. The present study concerns the fractionation of wheat straw using steam explosion, coupled with ethanol extraction, and that this facilitates the establishment of sugars and lignin platform and enables the production of regenerated cellulose films. Results: The {{results showed that the}} hemicellulose fractionation yield was 73 % under steam explosion at 1. 6 MPa for 5. 2 minutes, while the lignin fractionation yield was 90 % by ethanol extraction at 160 degrees C for 2 hours and with 60 % ethanol (v/v). The cellulose yield reached up to 93 % after steam explosion coupled with ethanol extraction. Therefore, cellulose sugar, hemicellulose sugar, and lignin platform were established effectively in the present study. Long fibers (retained by a 40 -mesh screening) accounted for 90 % of the total cellulose fibers, and the glucan conversion of short fibers was 90 % at 9. 0 hours with a cellulase loading of 25 filter paper units/g cellulose in enzymatic hydrolysis. <b>Regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> was prepared from long fibers using [bmim]CI, and the tensile strength and breaking elongation was 120 MPa and 4. 8 %, respectively. The cross-section of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> prepared by [bmim]CI displayed homogeneous structure, which indicated a dense architecture and a better mechanical performance. Conclusions: Multilevel composition fractionation process using steam explosion followed by ethanol extraction was shown to be an effective process by which wheat straw could be fractionated into different polymeric fractions with high yields. High-value utilization of wheat straw cellulose was achieved by preparing <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> using [bmim]CI.

40|$|Packaging {{films are}} an {{inevitable}} {{aspect of the}} modem societies. This is especially so in the food containment industry. These days most of the packaging films that {{are available in the}} market are made from polyolefmic materials. Although these materials perform superior package functions, they are riot biodegradable. This is a cause of concern for the environment. Unlike polyolefinic packaging, packaging made from <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> are biodegradable because of their cellulosic source. However, modification of these films to deliver suitable packaging functions could compromise the biodegradability of these films. The application of an impemieable thermoplastic coating,. of colorants and the use ofplasticizers are among the modifications that interfer~with the biodegradability of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> packaging. The influence of several factors on the biodegradation behaviour of different types of coated and uncoated cellophane films was studied in this research. Two general approaches were undertaken for this study. Firstly, the influence of a specific colour reducing bacterium, Shewanella strain JI 8 143, on coated <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films,</b> in the presence {{and in the absence of}} colorant materials, was investigated. Secondly, microorgamsms that are capable of degrading various coated and uncoated <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were enriched from landfill soil inocula. Degradation behaviour of each film was then studied using the cultivated culture. Several. analytical techniques were used to establish the changes that were induced into the treated <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose.</b> <b>films.</b> Techniques such as UV spectrophotometry, FTIR spectrop 40 tometry, contact angle measurement, SEM analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and gas chromatography were used. A number of molecular biology approaches such as the polymerase chain reaction (peR) procedure and restriction enzyme digestion were undertaken to an~lyse the community profile ofthe enriched culture. Evidence is given to show that the nitrocellulose coating underwent denitrification when treated with Shewqnella 118 143 culture in the presence of azo dye. However, poly(vinylidene chloride) coating incubated with Shewanella 118 143 culture did not undergo any significant chemical changes either in theÃ‚Â· presence or in the absence of azo dye. The enrichment study, based on the biodegradation of various <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films,</b> indicated that the biodegradation rate of cellulosic films was greater under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. The enrichment provides a number of cÃ‚Â·ultures that are capable of utilising cellophane films as a carbon source, under anaerobic conditions. Activities of both bacteria and methanogenic archaea were observed in all of the enriched cultures.

The matrices were prepared by coating γ-ferric oxide dispersed <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> by polypyrrole doped with sulfosalicylic acid as an anti-inflammatory drug.

The mechanism of drug release from the matrices under electric field includes expansion of conductive polymer chain and the electrostatic force between electron and drug. The drug release mechanism from the matrices under magnetic field is {{based on the fact that}} the heat produced locally by magnetic particles loosens the polymer (polypyrrole) chain surrounding the particles.

The quantum yield of fluorescence of the optical brighteners OB 15, OB 36 and OB 49 in water are 0. 11, 0. 08 and 0. 71 respectively. Their respective fluorescence natural lifetimes are 6700 ± 109, 5971 ± 712 and 1685 ± 22 ps. In solution, the excited state of OB 15 experiences more competing relaxation processes as the solvatochromic shift increases. OB 49 displays the opposite trend. A literature cellulose model surface is employed as a cotton mimic for evanescent wave fluorescence studies. Two model greases are similarly developed and used, and a third is presented for future work. These are based on surface-specific reactions with glass substrates, and the doping of a <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> with long chain alcohols. On doped cellulose surfaces, some low quantum yields occur compared to clean cellulose and bulk solution. Photobleaching behaviours are also observed.

In addition, the influence of drying procedure on the structure of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> was studied. Complete conversion of the starting material into <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> was seen regardless of the choice of coagulation medium. Coagulation in water predominantly formed cellulose II, whereas coagulation in alcohols mainly generated non-crystalline structures. Subsequent drying of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films,</b> induced hornification effects in the form of irreversible aggregation.

This phenomenon was observed for all used coagulants in this study, but to various degrees with regard to the polarity of the coagulant. From NMR cryoporometry, it was concluded that drying induced hornification generates an increase of nano-sized pores. A bimodal pore size distribution with pore radius maxima of a few nanometers was observed, and this pattern increased as a function of drying. Additionally, cyclic drying and rewetting generated a narrow monomodal pore size pattern.

Synergistic effects in mechanical properties were found for solution cast agar-konjac glucomannan-starch blend films. Blending ratio and preparation process were optimized. A recommended ratio was 1 : 1 : 2 for agar, konjac glucomannan, and starch. Fully cooking and mixing, casting on a warm surface, and drying from a gelled state were found desirable.

The resulting changes in the water repellence and barrier properties were studied. For this purpose, different grades of polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) were coated on <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> (“cellophane”) and paper and then grafted with fatty acid chlorides. The PVOH grades varied in their degree of hydrolysis and average molecular weight. The surface was esterified with two fatty acid chlorides, palmitoyl (C 16) and stearoyl chloride (C 18), by chemical grafting. The chemical grafting resulted in water-repellent surfaces and reduced water vapor transmission rates {{by a factor of}} almost 19. The impact of the surface modification was greater for a higher degree of hydrolysis of the polyvinyl alcohol and for shorter fatty acid chains. Although the water vapor barrier for palmitoyl-grafted PVOH was higher than for stearoyl-grafted PVOH, the contact angle with water was lower. Additionally, it was shown that a higher degree of hydrolysis led to higher water vapor barrier improvement factors after grafting. Furthermore, the oxygen permeability decreased after grafting significantly, {{due to the fact that}} the grafting protects the PVOH against humidity when the humidity is applied on the grafted side.

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> (RC) <b>films</b> and capsules was investigated for their applications in oral controlled drug delivery. <b>Regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were prepared by non-solvent-mediated, phase inversion of native and depolymerized cotton linter solutions (methylolcellulose; cellulose dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/ paraformaldehyde solvent system) in water {{as well as}} by phase inversion of native cotton linter solutions in organic non-solvents followed by thermal annealing. These films were monolithic in dry state and formed porous structures when hydrated. Irrespective of the degree of polymerization of the starting cellulose source or the use of organic non-solvents, the cellulose chain length was not significantly altered and cellulose was in an amorphous state. Flux analysis in diffusion cells, using ethanol-water mixtures as the solvent medium, indicated that the films take up solvent to form porous routes for transport of solute. The amount of solvent uptake required to form these routes was greater for films prepared from depolymerized cotton linter. Ionic and hydrophobic solutes traverse the films using the porous pathways following hydration of the film. Blended RC films were prepared by combining native and depolymerized cotton linter solutions in varying ratios and phase-inverting in water, followed by thermal annealing. Porosity, pore size and water uptake of the hydrated films decreased, while the length of the transport pathway (tortuosity) increased, as the fraction of depolymerized cellulose increased in the blended films. Differences in methylene blue dye adsorption on phase-inverted vs. phase-inverted and thermally annealed RC films indicated that the type of non-solvent utilized for phase-inversion does not affect the internal RC film structure during the phase-inversion process. However, as the boiling point of the non-solvent increased, the amount of irreversible polymer consolidation and formation non-swelling domains (hornification) increased during the thermal annealing process. This, in turn, led to reduced porosity and solute flux through these RC <b>films.</b> Two-piece <b>cellulose</b> capsules were fabricated by phase-inversion of methylolcellulose solutions in water using a dip-coating approach. Zero-order release rates for a number of drugs increased as their water solubility increased. The release of water soluble drugs occurred by osmotically-driven convection and diffusion through the pores in the capsule wall, while the release of moderate to poorly soluble drugs predominantly occurred by diffusion. Moreover, as the drug solubility increased, the apparent permeability of the drugs through the capsule wall decreased, which indicated that the inward osmotic flux of water reduced the diffusivity of the drug through the pores. The hydraulic permeability of the cellulose capsules was determined to be higher than for conventional ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate coated osmotic drug delivery systems, indicating that the cellulose-based capsules may be better suited for osmotic drug delivery...|$|R

The functionality of the aged IgG/IgM decreases faster if physisorbed on cellulose than on cellulose acetate and correlates to surface hydrophobicity. IgG physisorbed on RCF or CAF age better and remain functional longer than physisorbed IgM. We found a correlation between antibody stability and hydrogen bond formation ability of the system, evaluated from antibody carbonyl concentration and cellulosic surface hydroxyl concentration.

The elongation at break of RC biocomposite films decreased with increases of NF content. The modified NF with AA improved the tensile strength and Young's modulus but reduced the elongation at break of RC biocomposite films. The highest tensile strength and Young's modulus of RC biocomposite films was exhibited by 3 % AA content...|$|R

The increasing of OPEFB contents up to 2 wt% increased the tensile strength and {{modulus of elasticity}} of RC biocomposite films while the elongation at break decreased. However, at 3 and 4 wt% of OPEFB content, the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity decreased with increases OPEFB content, but elongation at break increased. The increment of tensile strength and modulus of elasticity at 2 wt% {{is due to the}} OPEFB fiber that partially dissolved and dispersed with the OPEFB matrix. The morphology studies illustrate that at 2 wt% of OPEFB content of biocomposite films surface consists less voids and agglomerations than at 4 wt%. This can be considered the RC filler was partially dispersed with the RC matrix in the biocomposite films...|$|R

The present work reports an initial engineering approach for fabricating lysozyme-bound <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> fiber and <b>film.</b> Glycine-esterified cotton was dissolved in an ionic liquid solvent 1 –Butyl– 3 –methylimidazolium Chloride (BMIMCl) in which lysozyme was activated and covalently attached to cotton cellulose through an enzymatic conjugation between its carboxyl groups and glycine cellulose’s amino groups. The resulting solution was extruded for fiber/film formation in a water bath. After performing a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, quantity of attached lysozyme to cellulose fiber/film was evaluated. The study exhibited that a synthesis of lysozyme conjugation on cellulose in BMIMCl could be completed in a control manor, resulting in a cellulose solution suitable for fiber/film production. It was also found that lysozyme could be successfully immobilized onto the <b>cellulose</b> fiber and <b>film</b> <b>regenerated</b> from solution spinning with a reasonable amount ranging from 197. 6 to 343. 7 μg/mL. mg...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} research is to extract cellulose from mahang (Macaranga gigantea) wood and convert the extracted cellulose (MCC) to nanocellulose using ionic liquid pretreatment. 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) was used to treat cellulose that has been extracted from mahang wood. Three different <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> were obtained from the different weight ratio of celluloses treated with BMIMCl (2 wt %, 5 wt % and 8 wt %). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the structural, morphological and thermal properties of celluloses and also the <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> samples. The results of characterizations indicated that 2 wt % of <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> with the highest amount of ionic liquid used obtained high crystallinity compared to 5 wt % and 8 wt % <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses.</b> Hence, from all of the characterizations of <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses,</b> only 2 wt % <b>regenerated</b> <b>celluloses</b> can be correlate to the real properties and characteristics of nanocellulose (NCCs) ...|$|R
