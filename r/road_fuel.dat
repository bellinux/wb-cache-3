5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current <b>road</b> <b>fuel</b> demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
2500|$|Taxation on SVO/PPO as a <b>road</b> <b>fuel</b> {{varies from}} country to country, and it is {{possible}} the revenue departments in many countries are even unaware of its use, or feel it too insignificant to legislate. [...] Germany used to have 0% taxation, resulting in it being a leader in most developments of the fuel use. However SVO/PPO as a <b>road</b> <b>fuel</b> began to be taxed at 0,09 €/liter from 1 January 2008 in Germany, with incremental rises up to 0,45 €/liter by 2012. However, in Australia it has become illegal to produce any fuel {{if it is to be}} sold unless a license to do so is granted by the federal government. This is a chargeable offense with a fine of up to 20,000 dollars but this bracket may alter circumstantially. Also a jail term may result if offenders are aware of the illegality of selling the fuel.|$|E
