25|$|Public sex of {{any kind}} is illegal {{in many parts of}} the world, and police {{undercover}} operations continue to be used in order to enforce such laws. Adverse personal consequences to participants in glory hole activity have included police surveillance, public humiliation in the press, often with marital and employment consequences, and imprisonment following a criminal conviction. Gay bashing, mugging, and bodily injury are further potential risks. For reasons of personal safety, as well as etiquette, men typically wait for a signal from the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner</b> to come through the hole before inserting any part of their genitals through a glory hole.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} anal sex among gay men and other {{men who have sex}} with men vary. A survey in The Advocate in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner.</b> Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms. A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being <b>receptive</b> <b>partners</b> during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|R
2500|$|In a male <b>receptive</b> <b>partner,</b> being anally {{penetrated}} {{can produce}} a pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis rubbing or brushing against the prostate (also known as the [...] "male G-spot") through the anal wall.

Prostate stimulation {{can produce a}} [...] "deeper" [...] orgasm, sometimes described by men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male homologue (variation) to the female Skene's glands.

2500|$|The two {{participants}} in a yaoi relationship (and {{to a lesser extent}} in yuri) are often referred to as seme ("top") and uke ("bottom").

Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes same-sex love between samurai and their companions.

2500|$|The HIV {{virus is}} more easily {{transmitted}} through unprotected anal intercourse than through unprotected vaginal intercourse [...] {{and men who}} report unprotected receptive anal intercourse {{are at increased risk}} of contracting the HIV virus. Generally, the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner</b> is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the urethra or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky. A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner [...] Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled alkyl nitrites (“poppers”). A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.|$|E
2500|$|In both sexes, {{pleasure}} can {{be derived}} from the nerve endings around the anus and the anus itself, such as during anal sex. It is possible for men to achieve orgasms through prostate stimulation alone. The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male homologue (variation) to the Skene's glands (which are believed to be connected to the female G-spot). Prostate stimulation can produce a [...] "deeper" [...] orgasm, described by some men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland. Sex toys designed for prostate stimulation are, according to Wibowo and Wassersug, one of the means that help men achieve multiple orgasms. The practice of pegging (consisting of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a strap-on dildo) stimulates the prostate. It is also common for men to not reach orgasm as <b>receptive</b> <b>partners</b> solely from anal sex, {{and it may be that}} it is typical that <b>receptive</b> male <b>partners</b> do not reach orgasm solely by this activity.|$|R
25|$|Stimulation from {{anal sex}} can {{additionally}} {{be affected by}} popular perception or portrayals of the activity, such as erotica or pornography. In pornography, anal sex is commonly portrayed as a desirable, painless routine that does not require personal lubricant; this can result in couples performing anal sex without care, and men and women believing that it is unusual for women, as <b>receptive</b> <b>partners,</b> to find discomfort or pain instead of pleasure from the activity. By contrast, each person's sphincter muscles react to penetration differently, the anal sphincters have tissues that {{are more prone to}} tearing, and the anus and rectum do not provide lubrication for sexual penetration like the vagina does. Researchers say adequate application of a personal lubricant, relaxation, and communication between sexual partners are crucial to avoid pain or damage to the anus or rectum. Additionally, ensuring that the anal area is clean and the bowel is empty, for both aesthetics and practicality, may be desired by participants.|$|R

We assessed {{risk factors for}} HSIL-AIN 2 and HSIL-AIN 3 in a cohort of homosexual men. MethodsAt the baseline visit in the Study for the Prevention of Anal Cancer (SPANC), all men completed a questionnaire and underwent anal swabbing for cytology and HPV genotyping, followed by high resolution anoscopy. ResultsComposite-HSIL prevalence was 47 % and 32 % among 220 HIV-positive and 396 HIV-negative men, respectively. HSIL-AIN 3 (37. 7 % versus 24. 7 %; p< 0. 001), but not HSIL-AIN 2 (9. 5 % versus 7. 6 %; p= 0. 395) was more common in HIV-positive men. Recent <b>receptive</b> anal <b>partners</b> (p-trend= 0. 045), and increasing number of high-risk (HR) -HPV types (p-trend< 0. 001) were associated with HSIL-AIN 2.

50|$|The {{most common}} sex swing {{is similar to}} a hammock and holds the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner</b> in a supine {{position}} (back down). A variant of the hammock style is a hanging platform of wood or metal, padded for comfort, on which the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner</b> reclines. The hanging platform differs from the hammock style in that, being rigid, the receptive partner's back is straight rather than bowed. Both the hammock and hanging platform designs are often equipped with loops or stirrups to support the ankles or calves up without the requiring exertion by the <b>receptive</b> <b>partner.</b> This allows the receptive partner's hips to be flexed without exertion, improving access to the areas of interest.|$|E
50|$|Reports {{pertaining}} to the prevalence of anal sex among MSM have varied over time, with some percentages higher than others. A large percentage of gay and bisexual men self-report lifetime participation in anal sex.

40|$|Aim: Pubic hair {{grooming}} is {{a common}} practice in the United States and coincides with prevalence of grooming-related injuries. Men {{who have sex with}} men (MSM) groom more frequently than men who have sex with women (MSW). We aim to characterize the influence of sexual orientation and sexual role on grooming behavior, injuries, and infections in men in the United States. Methods: We conducted a nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 - 65 residing in the United States. We examined the prevalence and risk factors of injuries and infections that occur as a result of personal grooming. Results: Of the 4, 062 men who completed the survey, 3, 176 (78. 2 %) report having sex with only women (MSW), 198 (4. 9 %) report sex with men (MSM), and 688 (16. 9 %) report not being sexually active. MSM are more likely to groom (42. 5 % vs. 29. 0 %, P< 0. 001) and groom more around the anus, scrotum, and penile shaft compared with MSW. MSM <b>receptive</b> <b>partners</b> groom more often (50. 9 % vs. 26. 9 %, P= 0. 005) and groom more for sex (85. 3 % vs. 51. 9 %, P< 0. 001) compared with MSM insertive partners. MSM report more injuries to the anus (7. 0 % vs. 1. 0 %, P< 0. 001), more grooming-related infections (7. 0 % vs. 1. 0 %, P< 0. 001) and abscesses (8. 8 % vs. 2. 5 %, P= 0. 010), as well as lifetime sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (1. 65 vs. 1. 45, P= 0. 038) compared with MSW. More <b>receptive</b> <b>partners</b> report grooming at the time of their STI infection (52. 2 % vs. 14. 3 %, P< 0. 001) compared with insertive partners. Conclusions: Sexual orientation, and in particular sexual role, may influence male grooming behavior and impact grooming-related injuries and infections. Anogenital grooming may put one at risk for an STI. Healthcare providers should be aware of different grooming practices in order to better educate safe depilatory practices (i. e., the use of electric razors for anogenital grooming) in patients of all sexual orientations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} sexual behaviors {{in a sample}} of 155 HIV-positive Latino gay and bi-sexual men. Nearly half the sample had engaged in unprotected anal intercourse in the past 12 months; unprotected anal intercourse was more likely when the partner was also HIV-positive.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{association}} between methamphetamine use and HIV seroconversion {{for men who}} have sex with men (MSM) was examined using longitudinal data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. METHODS: Seronegative (n = 4003) men enrolled in 1984 to 1985, 1987 to 1991, and 2001 to 2003 were identified. Recent methamphetamine and popper use was determined at the current or previous visit. Time to HIV seroconversion was the outcome of interest. Covariates included race/ethnicity, cohort, study site, educational level, number of sexual partners, number of unprotected insertive anal sexual partners, number of unprotected <b>receptive</b> anal sexual <b>partners,</b> insertive rimming, cocaine use at the current or last visit, ecstasy use at the current or last visit, any needle use since the last visit, Center for Epidemiologic Study of Depression symptom checklist score > 16 since the last visit, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, there was a 1. 46 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 12 to 1. 92) increased relative hazard of HIV seroconversion associated with methamphetamine use. The relative hazard associated with popper use was 2. 10 (95 % CI: 1. 63 to 2. 70). The relative hazard of HIV seroconversion increased with the number of unprotected <b>receptive</b> anal sexual <b>partners,</b> ranging from 1. 87 (95 % CI: 1. 40 to 2. 51) for 1 partner to 9. 32 (95 % CI: 6. 21 to 13. 98) for 5 + partners. The joint relative hazard for methamphetamine and popper use was 3. 05 (95 % CI: 2. 12 to 4. 37). There was a significant joint relative hazard for methamphetamine use and number of unprotected <b>receptive</b> anal sexual <b>partners</b> of 2. 71 (95 % CI: 1. 81 to 4. 04) for men with 1 unprotected <b>receptive</b> anal sexual <b>partner,</b> which increased in a dose-dependent manner for > 1 partners.

2500|$|In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on-male {{concepts}} of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, {{in the early}} times, also included adultery); vis, a physical assault for purpose of lust; and iniuria, a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned Lex Iulia specifically criminalized per vim stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, {{but only if the}} victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (ingenuus), and carried potential sentence of death or exile. [...] Iniuria was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than his/her owner.) [...] In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between [...] "active" [...] (penetrative) and [...] "passive" [...] (<b>receptive)</b> <b>partners,</b> and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these charges applied to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as Lex Scantinia covered at least some forms of male-on-male stuprum, and Quintillian mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces – about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay – as a normal penalty for stuprum upon an ingenuus. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{understand}} characteristics, perceptions, {{knowledge and}} {{behavior in the}} Qualitative Phase and to determine HIV/AIDS related knowledge, practices (including risk behaviors), HIV burden and its correlates in the quantitative phase among MSM population of Kolkata, West Bengal, IndiaMethodologyA mixed-method study with a qualitative phase followed by a quantitative cross-sectional component was conducted in Kolkata between August- 2015 to June- 2016. Focus group discussions and in-depth interview were conducted among 23 MSM. Time location sampling (TLS) with probability proportional to estimated attendance size was used to recruit MSM from 115 venues, corresponding to 3760 VDT complexes from which 584 subjects in randomly selected eligible VDT complexes were interviewed through an android based, tablet-PC assisted, pre-recorded questions-based, audio-integrated, color coded self-interview. ResultsMSM were uniformly treated with contempt in Indian society including by their parents. They {{were more likely to}} experience discrimination based on their sexual orientation compared to heterosexual counterpart. Most of them consciously did not disclose their orientation because of fear of rejection from families and society. Lack of support, protection and guidance from families and society influenced the overall well-being of this population. Almost all of them suffered from an impaired self-esteem and some degree of unhappiness because of widespread discrimination. The mechanism of coping varied and some were situational based on their anticipated emotional impact. In quantitative phase, the HIV burden was found to be 10. 46 %. 71 % reported to have multiple male sex partners in their lifetime. 66 % had multiple casual male sex partners. The significant predictors of HIV sero-positivity were higher age, acting as both as an anal insertive and <b>receptive,</b> irregular <b>partners</b> and unprotected sex. ConclusionsThe HIV burden among MSM was found to be substantially high in the current analysis. The significant predictors of HIV sero-positivity were higher age, acting as both as an anal insertive and <b>receptive,</b> irregular <b>partners</b> and unprotected sex. Majority of MSM in Kolkata were engaged in high risk activities that elevated their HIV risk. Targeted intervention for high-risk MSM seemed to be the need of the hour...|$|R
