While she didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> at the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{months into}} his loan spell, in early October, Rehman {{said of his}} move to play for Blackpool: [...] "I'm quite glad {{to get away from}} all the hustle and bustle of London. I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> up here in Blackpool; it's a good club with an ambitious young manager. Hopefully, {{over the next few months}} I can {{convince}} Simon Grayson I'm worthy of a long-term contract."

500|$|The {{episode was}} written under [...] "extreme pressure" [...] during the show's brief Christmas hiatus. Many critics have noted {{similarities}} between [...] "Monday" [...] and the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day. Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The funny thing about 'Monday' is people seemed to <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> a lot, but people always sorta [...] smiled and said you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

Creator Stephen Hillenburg, speaking by phone from Southern California, said [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it." [...] In an interview, Tom Kenny told that [...] "What I'm most proud of is that kids still <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> and care about it [...] They eagerly await new episodes. People who were young children when it started 10 years ago are still watching it and digging it and think it's funny. That's the loving cup for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{months after}} the release of Goodbye Lullaby (2011), Lavigne {{announced}} that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, having eight songs written. Lavigne stated that the album would musically be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby, with a release date rumoured for sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before. It kind of has a kind of glitchy, electronic feel to it and it's... the only one on the record that sounds like that. It's really different and a lot of my friends I've played it for <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> I'm having a lot of fun with that one." ...|$|E
500|$|When Leslie {{notes to}} the camera crew {{that they seem to}} be getting along just like when they made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when you serve me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get it out of my head after I played it, even though I didn't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{critics were}} positive, however. The French {{magazine}} Metallian said {{the album was}} [...] "boring and uneventful" [...] and gave it 1/10. Johan De Farfalla stated that [...] "from the death metal scene, they thought, 'Wow! This is cool!' From the educated musicians I knew, they said, 'This sucks. The sound is bad. You should re-record this.' But I think people <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> apart from the sound." ...|$|R
50|$|Amuro was a {{guest at}} the 2005 Kobe Collection, an {{important}} fashion event, and the song was unveiled {{for the first time}} at the latter.

500|$|Wenders filmed the {{recording}} sessions on the recently enhanced format Digital Video {{with the help}} of cinematographer Robert Müller, and then shot interviews with each [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ensemble member in different Havana locations. Wenders was also present to film the group's first performance with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in Carnegie Hall, New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to Sight & Sound magazine, these scenes of [...] "innocents abroad" [...] were the film's most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly anti consumerist, was shown describing the city as [...] "beautiful" [...] and finding the experience overwhelming. Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film [...] "didn't feel <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was a documentary anymore. It felt like it was a true character piece".|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when you serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether it matters at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E

5000|$|Sometime {{between the}} second and third session, Dylan {{approached}} Robbie Robertson and Garth Hudson of the Band to complete some overdub work on the basic tracks, but as Robertson recalled: [...] "We did talk about doing some overdubbing on <b>it,</b> but I <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> when I heard it and I couldn't really think right about overdubbing on it. So it ended up coming out the way he brought it back." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lanni {{also played}} the song to his bandmates in Sheriff. [...] "The band <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> {{so we started}} playing it live. That {{was one of the}} last songs we {{recorded}} when we did the record. The producer said, 'Is there anything else?' I said, 'There's this song we play, it's kind of a wimpy song.' So we played it for him and he said 'Yeah, that's kind of nice.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Jagger {{continues}} in the Rolling Stone interview {{when asked about the}} song's resonance thirty years on; [...] "I don't know if it [...] I don't know whether we should really play it. I was persuaded to put it [...] because it seemed to fit in, but I'm not sure if it really has any resonance for the present day. I don't <b>really</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> that much." [...] Despite this, the song has been performed on a majority of the Stones' tours since its introduction to their canon of work.|$|E

[...] I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. [...] There won't be any qualms about how hard I hit my teammates or how hard they hit me."

5000|$|We don't {{always do}} it by the book. We do it our way. Everybody does albums in the West, or travels {{from east to west}} to record their albums. We did it the other way around.

I visited Istanbul in 2009 and <b>really</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> It's very rock and roll and heavy metal, which people may not be aware of.
