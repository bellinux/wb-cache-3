50|$|As a {{relatively}} new procedure, more data {{is needed to determine}} potential adverse events related to prostatic artery embolization. One case series noted bladder wall ischemia as a complication, while another case series noted ischemic <b>rectitis</b> as a complication. The majority of adverse effects during PAE are likely due to non-target embolization, and are generally self-limited in nature. In addition, post-embolization syndrome, which consists of symptoms of pain, mild fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting and night sweats, is a commonly recorded postprocedural complication managed with NSAIDS and other forms of analgesia. One study found an overall complication rate of 20.6%, with minor complications including hematospermia, diarrhea, and urethral trauma from foley insertion, with one major complication of UTI requiring intravenous antibiotics.|$|E

One month after surgery, 6, 000 rads were delivered in 6 to 7 weeks. Five of these patients presented later a radiotherapy ileitis, colitis or <b>rectitis.</b> One of them developed a <b>rectitis</b> of the anastomotic area with important diarrheas treated by drugs only; a second presented bowel subobstructions induced by a radiotherapy ileitis and died in cachexy a few months later. The 3 other patients underwent surgery again: one of them for adhesions in the anastomotic area: a definite left colostomy was realized for a stenosic <b>rectitis</b> in the second patient; the last patient underwent surgery 4 times again and died from a rupture of the iliac artery.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{simultaneously}} evaluate the expression of Y-box binding protein- 1 (YB- 1) in non-neoplastic rectal tissue and rectal cancer tissue, and to collect clinical follow-up data for individual patients. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the developmental functions and prognostic value of YB- 1 in rectal cancer. We performed immunohistochemical studies to examine YB- 1 expression in tissue samples from 80 patients with rectal cancer, 30 patients with rectal tubular adenoma, and 30 patients with <b>rectitis.</b> The mean YB- 1 histological scores for rectal cancer, rectal tubular adenoma, and <b>rectitis</b> tissue specimens were 205. 5, 164. 3, and 137. 7, respectively. Shorter disease-free and overall survival times were found in patients with rectal cancer who had higher YB- 1 expression than in those with lower expression (38. 2 months vs. 52. 4 months, P = 0. 013; and 44. 4 months vs. 57. 3 months, P = 0. 008, respectively). Our results indicate that YB- 1 expression is higher in rectal cancer tissue than in rectal tubular adenoma and <b>rectitis</b> tissue and that it may be an independent prognostic factor for rectal cancer...|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{frequency}} of radiation damage in patients with prostate cancer who underwent combined hormonal and radiationtreatment after closing cystostomy. Materials and methods: in the study included 79 patients with prostate cancer with cystostomy that had been diagnosed concerningacute or chronic retention of urine. All patients {{were divided into two}} groups: I group was consisted of 47 patients with cystostomy that was closed before starting radiation therapy; II group was consisted of 32 patients who underwent radiation therapy without closure cystostomy. Results: the cystostomy closure significantly reduced the development risk of cystitis, <b>rectitis</b> and microcystis after radiotherapy (p< 0. 05). The risk of cystitis in patients, who received radiation therapy without closure of cystostomy increased in 11. 7 times (95 % CI 1. 5 - 89. 4). The risk of <b>rectitis</b> and microcystis in this group increased in 7. 3 times (95 % CI 0. 959. 9).

40|$|Objective: to {{make the}} {{language}} adaptation and testing of an EORTC QLQ PRT- 23 module, a method to assess quality of life, which has been elaborated {{in conjunction with the}} European organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire group (EORTC QLQ group), in clinical practice. Subjects and methods. An initiative study of the language adaptation of the EORTC QLQ PRT- 23 module was completed. The elaborated questionnaire was tested in clinical practice. The criteria for including patients (n = 176) in the study were successful radical antitumor therapy; at least three months’ duration of small pelvic radiotherapy (RT); clinical Stage 0 –IV according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and EORTC; and endoscopically verified signs of developed radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> (Stages 0 –IV after M. S. Bardychev); no recurrence of the underlying disease throughout the follow-up; patient compliance; availability of a patient to be followed. Results. The range of performed RT in the patients included in the study protocol was as follows: 61 (34. 6 %) patients had a total focal dose of RT, which was not higher than the tolerance values for the rectal mucosa (from 60 to 70 Gy); 115 (65. 4 %) patients had a radiation dose range of 70 to 80 Gy. At least 3 months passed from the completion of the given RT to the study inclusion.   With the EORTC QLQ PRT- 23 module, the differences between RTOG/EORTC 0 and RTOG/EORTC II–IV groups were as follows: p 0 –II < 0. 02, p 0 –III < 0. 0001, and p 0 –IV < 0. 0006. When the EORTC QLQ С- 30 and QLQ PRT- 23 in RTOG/EORTC III group (n = 7) and the RTOG/EORTC 0 group, this was p 0 –III < 0. 002. Assessment of the QLQ С- 30 and QLQ PRT- 23 modules and comparison of patients with RTOG/EORTC Stages I, II, and IV and those with RTOG/EORTC stage 0 revealed no statistically significant group difference: p 0 –I < 0. 81, p 0 –II < 0. 07, and p 0 –IV < 0. 07, respectively.   The use of the QLQ PRT- 23 module only yielded significantly different results between the patients without chronic radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> (Stage 0) and those with the endoscopic manifestations of Stages III and IV radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> (p 0 –III < 0. 0006; p 0 –IV < 0. 0004). The values of the EORTC QLQ С- 30 and QLQ PRT- 23 questionnaires were statistically significantly different in the patients with endoscopically verified radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> and in those without this condition (p 0 –I < 0. 03; p 0 –II < 0. 02; p 0 –III < 0. 0016; p 0 –IV < 0. 00009).   Conclusion. The EORTC QLQ С- 30 and QLQ PRT- 23 questionnaires may be used in the patients with chronic radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> for assessment of the quality-of-life index, for determination of the integral values over time (before, during, and after treatment), for informed involvement of a patient during treatment, for estimation of patient satisfaction with the therapy performed. The EORTC QLQ С- 30 questionnaire supplemented by the QLQ PRT- 23 module is a subjective method. Our study provided support {{for the fact that the}} QLQ С- 30 and QLQ PRT- 23 questionnaires for staging chronic radiation-induced <b>rectitis</b> must be used in combination with any third questionnaire.   </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{report the}} {{treatment}} of three female patients with severe actinic <b>rectitis,</b> with stenosis or perforation, submitted to anterior proctosigmoidectomy and transanal coloanal anastomosis. METHODS: In all cases surgery consisted of total proctosigmoidectomy, mucosectomy of the anal canal, lowering of the left colon through the pelvis and transanal anastomosis performed manually {{at the level of}} the pectineal line using separate absorbable sutures. A protective intestinal shunt was performed in all cases. RESULTS: The three patients did not present transoperative or immediate postoperative complications, but the first patient developed deep venous thrombosis of the leg that was submitted to successful clinical treatment. The intestinal shunts were later closed in all three cases. Sphincter function was considered very good in the first case and regular in the remaining two. CONCLUSION: The surgical technique utilized was considered to be adequate for the cases reported and is the first option for the maintenance of transit in patients with severe actinic <b>rectitis</b> since the anastomosis is performed using non-irradiated colon with the pectineal line, practically outside the pelvis...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Estimation of the {{effectiveness}} of low power brachytherapy sources I- 125 in the combined treatment in group of patients of intermediate risk of localized prostate cancer. Material and methods. The study included 126 patients with prostate cancer of intermediate risk. 104 patients (83, 9 %) were conducted low power brachytherapy I‑ 125 in combination with hormone therapy by analogues of LHWG.   22 patients (16. 1 %) received external beam irradiation in combination with brachytherapy I‑ 125 and hormonal treatment. Relapse-free survival of patients was evaluated in accordance with the criteria Phoenix (Nadir PSA + ng/ml). Evaluation of side effects of radiation treatment were carried out according to the RTOG criteria. Results. PSA relapse-free survival in the group of brachytherapy and hormone treatment at the time of observation 5 years amounted to 97. 1 %. In the group of combined radiation therapy with brachytherapy, and hormonal treatment PSA relapse-free survival rate was  95. 5 %. In both groups, relapse-free survival was noted in  96, 8 % of cases. Tumor-specific and overall survival in both groups was 100 %.  The major complications of treatment in both groups were radiation urethritis 1 to 2 degrees in 9. 5 % of cases (12 patients), urethral stricture in 5 patients (3. 9 % of cases), acute urinary retention in 1 patient (0. 8 % of cases)  and late radiation <b>rectitis</b> of 2 degree in 1. 58 % of cases (2 patients). Conclusions. It is possible to draw tentative conclusions about the high rate of survival without progression in both treatment groups on the background of the relatively low frequency of adverse reactions. It is necessary further follow-up for patients with estimating of survival for a longer period. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of beam radiotherapy (BRT) in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Subjects and methods. The data on 40 patients diagnosed as having stage T 1 NMIBC, who had been treated at the Medical Radiology Center in 1990 to 2009, were studied. Of them, 75 % were aged < 70 years. They all had verified transitional cell carcinoma: G 1 in 11 (27. 5 %) patients; G 2 in 12 (30 %), and G 3 in 17 (42. 5 %). Multifocal tumor growth (T 1 m) was found in 22 (55 %); the largest tumor exceeded 3 cm in 31 (77. 5 %). More than half (60 %) of the patients had clinically significant concomitant diseases. Three (7. 5 %) {{had a history of}} treated malignancy. The mean follow-up of the patients was 58. 6 months. Results. Survival at 60 months follow-up was 67. 9 ± 8. 0 %. Three (7. 5 %) patients died at 21 – 42 months follow-up. Five-year relapse-free survival was 50. 0 ± 8. 5 %. Seven (17. 5 %) patients were withdrawn at 5 to 99 months follow-up (mean 34. 7 months). Four (10 %) patients died from disease progression at 21 to 143 months follow-up. After radiotherapy to the bladder area, 17 (42. 5 %) patients were diagnosed as having more than 50 % tumor regression, which permitted transurethral resection of a residual tumor. The frequency and degree of radiation reactions were estimated. Acute radiation cystitis was diagnosed in 11 (27. 5 %) patients and <b>rectitis</b> was found in 6 (15. 0 %). Radiation reactions were not a reason for forced treatment discontinuation. Grade I-II late radiation cystitis (RTOG/EORTC) was diagnosed in 9 (22. 5 %) patients. Conclusion. The efficiency of BRT in patients with NMIBC who had refused surgical treatment or had contraindications to it was confirmed during the study. BRT could preserve the functioning bladder in 97. 5 % of cases and remove the residual tumor in 42. 5 %. Radiation reactions were not a reason for forced treatment interruption. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction.  One of the {{problems}} of urologic oncology is that patients with bladder cancer (BC) show up late for appointments, which leads to increased numbers of patients with advanced cancer stages accompanied by symptoms considerably reducing their quality of life. In most similar cases, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) may be given with palliative intent to lessen or relieve the local symptoms of disease and to deliver the highest possible dose of radiation to bladder tumor. Objective : to assess the efficacy and toxicity of palliative EBRT in patients with BC. Materials and methods. Outcomes of palliative EBRT that had been given to 103 patients with BC were analyzed. Poor somatic health status of these patients caused by underlying disease or accompanying pathology made radical treatment impossible. Results.  During EBRT treatment, hematuria was stopped in 56 (72. 7 %) and reduced in 21 (27. 3 %) patients. After completing EBRT, bladder pain syndrome was relieved in 13 (76. 5 %) of 17 patients, but in 1 patient the pain got worse, and in 3 (17. 6 %) patients no changes in this symptom occurred. Acute bladder reactions were observed in 37 (35. 9 %) patients: grade I–II (RTOG) in 32 (31. 1 %) patients and grade III–IV in 5 (4. 8 %) patients. Acute grade I–II <b>rectitis</b> was noted in 10 (9. 7 %) patients. Late grade I–II bladder complications (RTOG/EORTC) occurred in 16 (15. 5 %) patients, and late rectal complications in 2 (1. 9 %) patients. Due to relief of local symptoms and improvement of somatic health status in 16 (15. 5 %) patients, it was possible to perform radical treatment for BC. At 12 months after treatment, objective tumor response was achieved in 34 (33. 0 %) and stable disease in 14 (13. 6 %) BC patients. Conclusion. Radiation therapy is an effective method of palliative care of patients with advanced BC and marked local symptoms. In most cases, EBRT can help stop or reduce hematuria and pain as well as improve quality of patient life. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods of effective palliative care for patients with complicated advanced BC. A personalized approach to optimize programs palliative treatment of BC is a promising direction for further research. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Individual {{radiosensitivity}} is {{an inherent}} characteristic, {{associated with an}} increased reaction to ionizing radiation on the human body. Biological endpoints such as clonogenic survival, chromosome aberration formation and repair capacity of radiation-induced damage have been applied to evaluate individual radiosensitivity in vitro. 5 %- 7 % of cancer patients develop adverse side effects to radiation therapy in normal tissues within the treatment field, which are referred as 'clinical radiation reactions' and include acute effects, late effects and cancer induction. It has been hypothesized that the occurrence and severity of these reactions are mainly influenced by genetic susceptibility to radiation. Additionally, the nature of the genetic disorders associated with hypersensitivity to radiotherapy suggests that DNA repair mechanisms are involved. Consequently, the characterization of DNA repair in lymphocytes through cytokinesis blocked micronucleus (MN) and alkaline single-cell micro gel electrophoresis (comet) assays could be suitable approaches to evaluate individual radiosensitivity in vitro. The MN assay is an established cytogenetic technique to evaluate intrinsic cell radiosensitivity in tumor cells and lymphocytes; comet assay is a sensitive and rapid method for measuring DNA damage and repair in individual cells. The aims of this study were: 1) To assess the in vitro radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes from two groups of cancer patients (retrospectively and prospectively studied), using MN and comet assays, in comparison with the observed clinical response; and 2) To test the predictive potential of both techniques. Materials and methods: 38 cancer patients receiving radiation therapy were enrolled in this study. The tumor sites were: head and neck (n 25) and cervix (n = 13). Nineteen patients were evaluated about 6 - 18 month after radiotherapy (retrospective group) and 19 patients were evaluated prior, mid-way an of a treatment (prospective group). In the retrospective group, blood samples were irradiated in vitro with 0 (control) or 2 Gy and evaluated using MN test. Cytogenetic data were analyzed comparing expected MN frequencies (calibration curve from healthy donors) with values observed after in vitro irradiation. One over reactor was also evaluated trough comet assay. DNA damage and repair capacity were quantified by the tail moment. Lymphocytes of healthy individuals were used as reference sample. Cytogenetic data from the prospective group were analyzed using a mathematical model to evaluate the attenuation of the cytogenetic effect {{as a function of the}} time between a single exposure and blood sampling, estimating a cytogenetic recovery factor k. Results: In the retrospective evaluation, lymphocytes of 3 from 4 patients that had developed late reactions were significantly more radiosensitive than lymphocytes from the rest of the patients and normal donors. The individual cytogenetic response suggests a correlation with the maximum grade of late reaction (osteonecrosis, fibrosis and trismus). The patient additionally evaluated by comet assay showed reduced DNA repair capacity. In the prospective evaluation, factor k correlated with the individual radiosensitivity. Patients with low recovery from the cytogenetic effect (k tending to zero) developed late toxicity (fibrosis and actinic <b>rectitis).</b> Conclusions: MN and comet tests could be suitable predictive assays to evaluate individual radiosensitivity in vitro, contributing with the detection of patients that develop late adverse reactions. However, further studies are required to confirm the validity of these tests...|$|E
