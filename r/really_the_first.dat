This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, an inversion of the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie". Whedon wanted [...] "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero". He explained, [...] "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it".|$|E
500|$|Barker's The Indian Princess {{has been}} cited as the first American play {{featuring}} Native American characters to ever be staged, although Barker's play is predated by at least two offerings by Europeans featuring Native Americans, including Tammany in 1794 by British playwright Ann Kemble Hatton, and German writer Johann Wilhelm Rose's Pocahontas: Schauspiel mit Gesang, in fünf Akten (A Play with Songs, in five Acts) in 1784. At least one American play was also written before Barker's: Ponteach, published by Robert Rogers in 1766, though the piece was apparently never produced. However, more recently uncovered evidence shows a record of an anonymous melodrama entitled Captain Smith and the Princess Pocahontas produced at The Chestnut Street Theatre in 1806, calling into question whether Barker’s play was <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of its kind (though no further information {{is known about the}} earlier piece). [...] Barker's play has also been cited as the earliest surviving dramatized account of Smith and Pocahontas, although this idea is debunked by the availability of the aforementioned Johann Wilhelm Rose work.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Wilding joined the Royal Marines on advice of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines {{for just a few}} days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist. At the end of October he joined the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division in the battlefields of northern France where he had thirty men, three guns and armoured cars under his command. After a week's leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote [...] "For <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in seven and a half months I have a job on hand which is likely to end in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell. However if we succeed we will help our infantery no end.". [...] The next day, 9 May, he was killed in action at 4:45 in the afternoon during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France when a shell exploded {{on the roof of the}} dug-out he was sheltering in.|$|E

[...] Therefore, a case could be made for saying that for the many clerics in the audience, the underlying conflict was between traditional Anglicanism (Wilberforce) and liberal Anglicanism (Essays and Reviews).

2500|$|Carla Day {{writing for}} Collider.com gave The Flash episode 5 stars out of 5, calling the episode [...] "brilliant" [...] saying, [...] "With so many {{characters}} on the scene, {{it would have}} been easy for the show to get overwhelmed by them all and lose The Flash's unique look and tone. But the writers effectively incorporated the other DC series' characters into the episode while keeping the show's light-hearted and funny demeanor... the standard has been set high for the Arrow and Legends of Tomorrows [...] "Invasion!" [...] hours." [...] Day's one complaint was the fact the Dominators motivations were not very clear. Entertainment Weeklys Chancellor Agard awarded The Flash episode an [...] "A-", stating, [...] "Based on tonight's episode alone, this year's crossover is looking like it'll be the best one yet. The first crossovers were two relatively standalone episodes, and last year's was burdened with setting up Legends of Tomorrow. This is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time Berlanti and Co. can tell a cohesive story, and it seems like it's paying off... That being said, the episode did drag a bit whenever it focused too much on the ongoing Team Flash drama... my biggest problems were with the Wally stuff. However, I understand that was here for viewers who might only watch The Flash, and the episode does a good job of appeasing both kinds of fans. Luckily, though, the nonsense doesn't drag the episode too much: For every anxious scene, there was a funny aside to lighten the mood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Psalms {{are used}} {{throughout}} traditional Jewish worship. Many complete Psalms and verses from Psalms {{appear in the}} morning services (Shacharit). The pesukei dezimra component incorporates Psalms 30, 100 and 145–150. Psalm 145 (commonly referred to as [...] "Ashrei", which is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> word of 2 verses appended {{to the beginning of}} the Psalm), is read three times every day: once in shacharit as part of pesukei dezimrah, as mentioned, once, along with Psalm 20, as part of the morning's concluding prayers, and once at the start of the afternoon service. On Festival days and Sabbaths, instead of concluding the morning service, it precedes the Mussaf service. Psalms 95–99, 29, 92, and 93, along with some later readings, comprise the introduction (Kabbalat Shabbat) to the Friday night service. Traditionally, a different [...] "Psalm for the Day"—Shir shel yom—is read after the morning service each day of the week (starting Sunday, Psalms: 24, 48, 82, 94, 81, 93, 92). This is described in the Mishnah (the initial codification of the Jewish oral tradition) in the tractate Tamid. [...] According to the Talmud, these daily Psalms were originally recited on that day of the week by the Levites in the Temple in Jerusalem. From Rosh Chodesh Elul until Hoshanah Rabbah, Psalm 27 is recited twice daily following the morning and evening services. [...] There is a Minhag (custom) to recite Psalm 30 each morning of Chanukkah after Shacharit: some recite this in place of the regular [...] "Psalm for the Day", others recite this additionally.|$|E

The Great Harry was subsequently far surpassed by another of King Henry's ships, the Grace de Dieu, which was no less than one thousand tons burden, and carried seven hundred men and one hundred and twenty-two guns, (some writers mention only eighty guns) the largest of which were but eighteen-pounders.
