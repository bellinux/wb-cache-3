5|$|The South Hills {{crossbill}} is a finch {{endemic to}} the South Hills and Albion Mountains in the Minidoka District. It rarely interbreeds with similar crossbills that {{are present in}} its range, {{and it has been}} proposed as a separate species created via ecological speciation. The American Ornithologists' Union failed to find consensus on the issue so the South Hills crossbill is still considered a subspecies of the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, opportunists {{can have}} qualities of {{seasonal}} breeders. The <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, {{in order to}} breed. Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape or}} {{color of the}} culmen can also help with the {{identification}} of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot crossbill is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> is more moderately curved. The culmen of a juvenile common loon is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile yellow-billed loon is pale towards the tip.|$|E

25|$|Pinus strobus {{is found}} in the nearctic {{temperate}} broadleaf and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and small mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
500|$|Ganoga Lake {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau {{just north}} of the Allegheny Front; this region is known locally as North Mountain. Many bird species are found in the forests on North Mountain, {{including}} the state's only population of blackpoll warbler; other birds seen there include evening grosbeak, northern goshawk, <b>red</b> <b>crossbill,</b> and Swainson's thrush. Historically North Mountain was home to olive-sided flycatcher, and [...] "was {{one of the few places}} one could enjoy the songs of all of Pennsylvania's native thrushes"; today it is home to the state's largest yellow-bellied flycatcher population.|$|E
500|$|The dorsal {{ridge of}} the [...] Likened by ornithologist Elliott Coues to the ridge {{line of a}} roof, it is the [...] "highest middle {{lengthwise}} line of the bill" [...] and runs from {{the point where the}} upper mandible emerges from the forehead's feathers to its tip. The 's length along the culmen is one of the regular measurements made during bird ringing and is particularly useful in feeding studies. The shape or colour of the culmen can also help with the identification of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot crossbill is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar <b>red</b> <b>crossbill</b> is more moderately curved.|$|E

50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 2009, and identified as phylogenetically distinct in 2016.

40|$|Socially {{acquired}} information {{improves the}} accuracy {{and efficiency of}} environmental assessments and can increase fitness. Public information may be especially useful during unpredictable food conditions, or for species that depend on resources made less predictable by human disturbance. However, the physiological mechanisms by which direct foraging assessments and public information are integrated to affect behaviour remain largely unknown. We tested for potential effects of public information on the behavioural and hormonal response to food reduction by manipulating the social environment of captive <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> (Loxia curvirostra). Red crossbills are irruptive migrants that are considered sensitive to changes in food availability and use public information in decision making. Here, we show that public information can attenuate or intensify the release of glucocorticoids (i. e. stress hormones) during food shortage in <b>red</b> <b>crossbills.</b> The observed modulation of corticosterone may therefore be a physiological mechanism linking public information, direct environmental assessments and behavioural change. This mechanism would not only allow for public information to affect individual behaviour, but might also facilitate group decision making by bringing group members into more similar physiological states. The results further suggest that stressors affecting entire populations may be magnified in individual physiology through social interactions...|$|R
5000|$|Sewall {{explored}} {{the variation in}} learned bird songs in relation to social and genetic intermixing of families of <b>red</b> <b>crossbills</b> (Loxia curvirostra). [...] When given to foster parents, it was shown that fledgling crossbills will imitate the particular variations in their foster parents' calls. It was thus hypothesized that such idiosyncrasies in call could aid in creating familial cohesion and that when such call variants are passed down generations, those variants are direct signals of the crossbill's genetic and familial history.|$|R
