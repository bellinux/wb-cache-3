25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or <b>rectal</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E

The method is hierarchical, detecting parts of the tube in increasing order of complexity, from tube cross sections and tube segments to the whole flexible tube. To increase the speed of the algorithm, candidate parts are generated using a voting strategy. The detected tube segments are combined into a flexible tube using a dynamic programming algorithm. Testing the algorithm on 210 unseen datasets resulted in a tube detection rate of 94. 7 % and 0. 12 false alarms per volume. The method can be easily retrained to detect and segment other tubular 3 D structures. ...|$|R

However, {{the interpretation of}} lfCTC data {{is complicated by the}} presence of poorly tagged feces and partial-volume artifacts that imitate colorectal lesions.

A probabilistic model of colonic wall was developed, and virtual tagging was performed on artifacts that were identified by the model. The method was evaluated with 46 clinical lfCTC cases that were prepared with dietary fecal tagging only. Visual examples show that the method can label partial-volume artifacts, poorly tagged feces, nonadhering completely untagged feces, and artifacts such as <b>rectal</b> <b>tubes.</b> The effect of virtual tagging was evaluated by comparing the detection accuracy of a fully automated polyp detection scheme without and with the method. With virtual tagging, the per-lesion detection sensitivity was 100 % for lesions ⩾ 10 mm (n= 4) with 3. 8 false positives per patient (per two CT scan volumes) and 90 % for lesions ⩾ 6 mm (n= 10) with 5. 4 false positives per patient on average.

40|$|Background. Postcolonoscopy {{abdominal}} discomfort and bloating are common. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate whether rectal decompression improved distension-induced abdominal symptoms and influenced anorectal physiology. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, rectal distension was achieved by direct air inflation into the rectum by colonoscopy. Placement of rectal and sham tube was then performed in each subject on a separate occasion. The anorectal parameters and distension-induced abdominal symptoms were recorded. Results. Anorectal parameters were similar between placements of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube except for greater rectal compliance with <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> than with sham tube (P< 0. 05). Abdominal pain and bloating were significantly reduced by <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> and sham tube at 1 minute (both P< 0. 05) and 3 minutes (both P< 0. 05). After placement of <b>rectal</b> <b>tube,</b> abdominal pain at 3 minutes correlated positively with first sensation (r= 0. 53, P= 0. 04), and bloating at 3 minutes also correlated positively with urge sensation (r= 0. 55, P= 0. 03).

40|$|Purpose: A {{prospective}} {{comparative study}} of a subset of 10 consecutive patients was performed, to describe the effects of an air-inflated <b>rectal</b> balloon <b>tube</b> {{that has been used}} for prostate immobilization in 360 patients since 1994. In particular, influences on prostate motion, rectum filling variations, and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the rectum during a course of conformal radiotherapy were investigated. Methods and Materials: Computed tomographic (CT) examinations without and with rectal balloon (filled with 40 mL air) were performed at the start (t(0)), middle (t(mi)), and end of treatment (t(e)), resulting in 6 CT scans for each patient. Prostate displacement was measured from a lateral beam's-eye-view. DVHs of rectum as a solid organ, and anterior, posterior, and whole rectum wall were calculated at t(0), t(mi), and t(e), and variations during treatment were analyzed for both examinations, with and without balloon. Results: By use of the balloon, rectum filling variations (p = 0. 04) and maximum anterior-posterior displacements of the prostate (p = 0. 008) were reduced significantly, leading to a reduction in DVH variations during treatment. Maximum displacements of posterior prostate border (> 5 mm) were found in 8 / 10 patients without a rectum balloon and in only 2 / 10 patients with the balloon. The balloon led to a significant reduction in partial posterior rectal wall volumes included in the high-dose regions, without significant changes at the anterior rectum wall in cases of irradiation of the prostate only. However, when entirely irradiating the whole seminal vesicles, this advantage was lost. Conclusions: The rectal balloon catheter represents a simple technique to immobilize the prostate and to determine the position of the anterior rectal wall at daily treatment. This allows a reduction of margins, because of reduced prostate movement during treatment course. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> (RT) is {{a common}} source of false positives (FPs) in {{computer-aided}} detection (CAD) systems for CT colonography. A robust and efficient detection of RT can improve CAD performance by eliminating such “obvious” FPs and increase radiologists’ confidence in CAD.

Though there are several theories, researchers remain unsure as to the definitive cause of endometriosis. Our objective was to test the validity of the theory of müllerianosis for endometriosis, that is the misplacing of primitive endometrial tissue along the migratory pathway of foetal organogenesis Methods We have collected at autopsy 36 human female foetuses at different gestational age. We have performed a morphological and immunohistochemical study (expression of oestrogen receptor and CA 125) on the pelvic organs of the 36 foetuses included en-block and totally analyzed. Results In 4 out of 36 foetuses we found presence of misplaced endometrium in five different ectopic sites: in the recto-vaginal septum, in the proximity of the Douglas pouch, in the mesenchimal tissue close to the posterior wall of the uterus, in the <b>rectal</b> <b>tube</b> at the level of muscularis propria, and in the wall of the uterus.

Naranjo, Jones algoritms suggest a direct causal relationship. Our two cases, to our knowledge, represent the first published report of this particular intestinal toxicity of capecitabine. Pathophisiological explanation is difficult because no data are known about fluoropyrimidines effects on enteric motor functions (motor system, neural influences, hormonal factors) : Tegafur (UFT) also, another oral fluoropyrimidine, induces paralytic ileus. We hypothesize that some 5 -flourouracil metabolites (5 -fluorocitrate; fluoro-beta-alanine), seldom responsible for central and peripherical neurotoxicity from fluoropyrimidines, can sometimes cause a neuropathy, and so a paralytic ileus. Paralytic ileus is probably a rare complication of capecitabine, but the oncologist should take it into careful consideration, because of his possible seriousness and because a suitable management of early signs of abdominal distension (with nasogastric suction and/or <b>rectal</b> <b>tube,</b> i. v. infusion of fluids and electrolytes, etc.) can avoid a unnecessary operative treatment...|$|E
