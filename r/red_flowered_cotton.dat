5000|$|Red <b>cotton</b> <b>flower</b> is {{a species}} of flower common in Lingnan, and {{considered}} to symbolize Cantonese culture. It was said that in 200 BCE, Ziu To (Jyutping: Ziu6 to4; Traditional Chinese: 趙陀), {{the king of the}} Nanyue kingdom, once gave a red cotton tree to the Han Empire to express respect - meaning that at that time, the people of Lingnan already used <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>flowers</b> to represent their homeland. Nowadays, <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>flower</b> frequently appears in the poems and songs composed by Cantonese people. The folk song Nam Hoi Chiu, for instance, mentioned [...] "紅綿" [...] (Traditional Chinese for [...] "red cotton flower") to represent Cantonese people. Red <b>cotton</b> <b>flower</b> is currently the official symbol of Canton City, the cultural center of Lingnan.|$|R

25|$|Lingnan garden (Jyutping: Ling5 naam5 jyun4 lam4; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南園林), or Cantonese garden, is {{the style}} of garden design native to the Lingnan region. Geographically, Lingnan has very {{different}} climate from China's heartland (i.e., Zhongyuan), resulting in her developing a different style in designing gardens. The most frequently cited traits of Lingnan gardens are: (1) they tend to surround their plants with buildings to provide protection to the plants, due to the frequent rainfalls and storms in the region; (2) Lingnan gardens usually use plant species native to the region, such as <b>red</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>flowers</b> and lychee trees; and (3) due to Lingnan being {{far away from the}} center of power (i.e., Zhongyuan), gardens in the region have historically been less bounded by royal standards, resulting in a style that leans more towards the common people, e.g., Lingnan gardens are decorated with a large amount of folk arts, ranging from sculptures to porcelains, and also tend to use smaller buildings.|$|R

30|$|For GrabCut, we use {{the same}} initial curve for fair comparison. The results by the GrabCut-based method are shown in the fourth row in each image block of Figure 4. It is seen that GrabCut {{successfully}} segments the common objects from the original images, such as the ‘car’ in the first image of car. There are also unsuccessful segmentations, such as the ‘butterfly’ in the first image of butterfly where the <b>red</b> <b>flower</b> is also segmented as the foreground. The unsuccessful segmentations are caused {{by the fact that}} it is not enough to distinguish the objects from the background by only considering a single image. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>flower</b> is located inside the initial curve. Hence, GrabCut segments the <b>red</b> <b>flower</b> as the foreground. For MGrabCut, the <b>red</b> <b>flower</b> is segmented as the background since there are no similar regions in the next images.|$|R
