40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the effect of}} ethanol {{addition}} to gasoline on regulated and unregulated emissions is studied. A 4 -cylinder OPEL 1. 6 L internal combustion engine equipped with a hydraulic brake dynamometer was used in all the experiments. For exhaust emissions treatment a typical three-way catalyst was used. Among the various compounds detected in exhaust emissions, the following ones were monitored at engine and catalyst outlet: methane, hexane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, acetone, benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, toluene, acetic acid and ethanol. Addition of ethanol in the fuel up to 10 % w/w had as a result {{an increase in the}} <b>Reid</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of the fuel, which indicates indirectly increased evaporative emissions, while carbon monoxide tailpipe emissions were decreased. For ethanol-containing fuels, acetaldehyde emissions were appreciably increased (up to 100 %), especially for fuel containing 3 % w/w ethanol. In contrast, aromatics emissions were decreased by ethanol addition to gasoline. Methane and ethanol were the most resistant compounds to oxidation while ethylene was the most degradable compound over the catalyst. Ethylene, methane and acetaldehyde were the main compounds present at engine exhaust while methane, acetaldehyde and ethanol were the main compounds in tailpipe emissions for ethanol fuels after the catalyst operation.

40|$|Storage {{of crude}} oil and {{petroleum}} products inevitably leads to evaporative losses. Those losses are important for the industrial plants mass balances, {{as well as for}} the environmental protection. In this paper, estimation of evaporative losses was performed using software program TANKS 409 d which was developed by the Agency for Environmental Protection of the United States - US EPA. Emissions were estimated for the following types of storage tanks: fixed conical roof tank, fixed dome roof tank, external floating roof tank, internal floating roof tank and domed external floating roof tank. Obtained results show quantities of evaporated losses per tone of stored liquid. Crude oil fixed roof storage tank losses are cca 0. 5 kg per tone {{of crude oil}}. For floating roof, crude oil losses are 0. 001 kg/t. Fuel oil (diesel fuel and heating oil) have the smallest evaporation losses, which are in order of magnitude 10 - 3 kg/tone. Liquids with higher <b>Reid</b> <b>Vapour</b> <b>Pressure</b> have very high evaporative losses for tanks with fixed roof, up to 2. 07 kg/tone. In case of external floating roof tank, losses are 0. 32 kg/tone. The smallest losses are for internal floating roof tank and domed external floating roof tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in tanks with fixed roof. In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|E

40|$|Sasols {{synthetically}} derived gasoline {{blending components}} {{have traditionally been}} combined predominantly according to process economics to formulate commercial fuel blends that meet in-house fit-for-purpose requirements and the legislated fuel specifications in South Africa. In this study the potential for optimisation of a fuel blend using full boiling range synthetic blending components to enhance its performance in a modern charge boosted gasoline direct injection engine was investigated. An evaluation of detailed analytical fuel chemistry data was conducted followed by laminar ame speed experiments in a constant-volume combustion bomb apparatus in order to characterise the combustion behaviour of the blending components according to their characteristic chemical properties. A matrix of test fuels was established by splash blending the synthetic components with a commercial synthetic reference fuel. The performance of the fuels was subsequently evaluated using a modern, charge boosted, single cylinder GDI research engine. While the engine operation was verified {{to be in the}} negative-K region using model fuel components, anomalies in de fining the K-value using the synthetic blends were discovered. A fuel blending model was composed to allow prediction of linear and non-linear fuel properties of user de fined synthetic blend ratios. By integrating an engine performance test fuel scoring system, the model could be used to de fine optimal fuel blends through selection of a desired performance criterion while constraining the optimisation process to adhere to the national legislated gasoline specifications. Four final fuel blends were optimised according to best power output, gravimetric specific fuel consumption, volumetric specific fuel consumption and specific legislated emissions. A fifth blend was optimised for highest power output with no regard for fuel property specifications other than <b>Reid</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure.</b> The performance of the optimised blends was evaluated on the test engine and the results indicated the potential to positively affect the performance characteristics of a synthetic fuel blend for use in a modern spark ignition engine.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect of {{blending}} practice upon selected physical properties of crude oils, and of various base oils and petroleum products, using a range of binary mixtures. The crudes comprised light, medium and heavy Kuwait crude oils. The properties included kinematic viscosity, pour point, boiling point and <b>Reid</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure.</b> The literature related to the prediction of these properties, and the changes reported to occur on blending, was critically reviewed as a preliminary to the study. The kinematic viscosity of petroleum oils in general exhibited non-ideal behaviour upon blending. A mechanism was proposed for this behaviour which took into account the effect of asphaltenes content. A correlation was developed, as a modification of Grunberg's equation, to predict the viscosities of binary mixtures of petroleum oils. A correlation was also developed to predict the viscosities of ternary mixtures. This correlation showed better agreement with experimental data (< 6 % deviation for crude oils and 2. 0 % for base oils) than currently-used methods, i. e. ASTM and Refutas methods. An investigation {{was made of}} the effect of temperature on the viscosities of crude oils and petroleum products at atmospheric pressure. The effect of pressure on the viscosity of crude oil was also studied. A correlation was developed to predict the viscosity at high pressures (up to 8000 psi), which gave significantly better agreement with the experimental data than the current method due to Kouzel (5. 2 % and 6. 0 % deviation for the binary and ternary mixtures respectively). Eyring's theory of viscous flow was critically investigated, and a modification was proposed which extends its application to petroleum oils. The effect of blending on the pour points of selected petroleum oils was studied together with the effect of wax formation and asphaltenes content. Depression of the pour point was always obtained with crude oil binary mixtures. A mechanism was proposed to explain the pour point behaviour of the different binary mixtures. The effects of blending on the boiling point ranges and Reid vapour pressures of binary mixtures of petroleum oils were investigated. The boiling point range exhibited ideal behaviour but the R. V. P. showed negative deviations from it in all cases. Molecular weights of these mixtures were ideal, but the densities and molar volumes were not. The stability of the various crude oil binary mixtures, in terms of viscosity, was studied over a temperature range of 1 oC - 30 oC for up to 12 weeks. Good stability was found in most cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of alcohol fuels on spark ignition (SI) engine has recently become an attraction {{as an alternative}} to gasoline fuel. This is due to the concerns on environmental pollution, depletion of fossil fuels, and stringent regulation. Alcohol fuel is indeed an attractive alternative fuel as it had been found to improve octane number, enhance oxygen content, and reduce carbon monoxide emissions. One of the well-known alcohol fuels is methanol fuel that can be blended with gasoline to produce better engine operation in spark ignition engine. Blended methanol-gasoline fuels can be improved further by adding higher carbon number alcohol, such as isobutanol, as they have higher energy content and they are able to displace more gasoline fuels than methanol-gasoline fuels. However, studies concerning the addition of iso-butanol in lower ratio methanol-gasoline fuels, specifically on fuel properties and engine operation, have not been investigated thoroughly. Therefore, this research looked into the feasibility of the iso-butanol additive (5, 10, 15 %) into a lower ratio of 5 % methanol-gasoline blended fuel (M 5) on unmodified spark ignition engine. The performances of iso-butanol additive in methanol-gasoline blends were compared with base gasoline fuel. Experimental investigation on the characterization of the isobutanol additive on lower ratio methanol-gasoline blended fuel was first performed. The characterization of fuel involved was density, lower heating value, kinematic viscosity, latent heat of vaporization, Reid of vapour pressure and oxygen content. Other than that, engine testing was performed by using four-cylinder spark ignition engine to test all the blended fuel involved. The engine performance, such as brake power, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and exhaust gas temperature (EGT), had been determined. For exhaust emissions, the parameters, such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and unburned hydrocarbon (HC), were also measured. From the test results, improvement was recorded at kinematic viscosity, density, latent heat of vaporization, and oxygen content for iso-butanol additive of 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % with 5 % of the methanol-gasoline fuel blends. On the other hand, a reduction was recorded for both heating value and <b>Reid</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> for all blended fuel with iso-butanol additive in comparison to that of base fuel. Moreover, as for engine performance, M 5 B 15 displayed improvement in engine brake power, BTE, and EGT compared to other blended fuels. Nevertheless, higher fuel consumption was recorded for all methanolgasoline blended fuels with iso-butanol additive compared to base gasoline fuel. In terms of engine emissions, M 5 B 15 exhibited the lowest CO and HC emissions compared to base gasoline fuel. However, the increasing trend projected by NOx and CO 2 emissions had been recorded in all iso-butanol additive in methanol-gasoline fuels with M 5 B 15 exerting the highest emissions. Thus, it can be concluded that isobutanol additives are indeed a viable option to be blended with the existing lower ratio methanol-gasoline as an alternative fuel for the operation of spark ignition engine...|$|E

We examined the response of stomatal conductance to increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference, in the wet and dry seasons, of five tropical tree species. We also examined leaves of these species for anatomical differences to determine whether this could explain differences in stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Finally, we conducted a split-root experiment {{with one of those}} species to look for interactions between xylem abscisic acid concentration, predawn water potential, leaf area to root mass ratio and stomatal responses to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences. Stomatal conductance declined linearly with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in all species. Leaves that expanded in the ‘dry’ season were more sensitive to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences than those that had expanded in the ‘wet’ season. The value of leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference where 50 % of extrapolated maximum stomatal conductance would occur was 5. 5 kPa for wet season but only 3. 4 kPa for dry season leaves. In the wet season, transpiration rate increased with increasing leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> difference in most example species. However, in the dry season, transpiration was constant as leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences increased in most cases.

In the split-root experiment, a very mild water stress increased stomatal sensitivity to leaf-to-air <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> differences, and stomatal conductivity declined linearly with decreasing predawn water potential. However, levels of ABA in the xylem did not change, and stomatal sensitivity to exogenous ABA did not change.
