50|$|The {{health of}} the {{inhabitants}} of radioactive apartment buildings in Taiwan has received prominent attention in popular treatments of radiation hormesis. In 1982, more than 20,000 tons of steel was accidentally contaminated with cobalt-60, and much of this <b>radioactive</b> <b>steel</b> was used to build apartments and exposed thousands of Taiwanese to gamma radiation levels of up to >1000 times background (average 47.7 mSv, maximum 2360 mSv excess cumulative dose) - {{it was not until}} 1992 that the radioactive contamination was discovered. A medical study published in 2004 claimed the cancer mortality rates in the exposed population were much lower than expected. However, this initial study failed to control for age, comparing a much younger exposed population (mean age 17.2 years at initial exposure) with the much older general population of Taiwan (mean age approx. 34 years in 2004), a serious flaw. Older people have much higher cancer rates {{even in the absence of}} excess radiation exposure.|$|E
5000|$|... 1982 - In {{northern}} Taiwan, <b>radioactive</b> <b>steel</b> scavenged from {{a nuclear}} reactor was recycled into rebar and used {{in the construction of}} apartment buildings, principally in Taipei from 1982 through 1984. Over 2,000 apartment units and shops were suspected as having been built using the material. About 10,000 people are believed to have been exposed to long-term low-level irradiation as a result. In the summer of 1992, a utility worker for the Taiwanese state-run electric utility Taipower brought a Geiger counter to his apartment {{to learn more about the}} device, and discovered that his apartment was contaminated. Despite awareness of the problem, owners of some of the buildings known to be contaminated have continued to rent apartments to tenants (in part because selling the units is illegal). Some research has shown that the radiation has had a [...] "beneficial" [...] effect upon the health of the tenants based on the death rate from cancers, Another study looking at the incidence of cancer found that although the overall risk of cancer was sharply reduced (SIR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.5 - 0.7), the incidence of certain leukemias in men (n = 6, SIR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.2 - 7.4) and thyroid cancer in women (n = 6, SIR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 - 5.7) were more prevalent.|$|E

SwRI was contracted to investigate failed <b>radioactive</b> stainless <b>steel</b> troxler gauges. SwRI`s task {{was to determine the}} cause of failure of the rods and the extent of the problem. SwRI concluded that the broken rod failed in a brittle manner due to a hard zone in the heat affected zone...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{feasibility}} of recycling and/or reuse of non-releasable components and materials arising from nuclear operations within the European Community has been undertaken. This review has comprised of {{an estimate of the}} amounts of low-level waste concrete, steel, copper and aluminium which may arise from routine operations and decommissioning of nuclear facilities around the EC and the timescales on which this material would arise. Detailed studies of twelve possible scenarios for utilisation of this material have been carried out and from the results of these analyses a strategic evaluation of the feasibility of controlled release recycling within the nuclear sector has been made. The study concludes that the recycling of <b>radioactive</b> <b>steels</b> (carbon and stainless) is an already well researched area which requires no further development as regards the melting and refining of steel arising from nuclear facilities. Work within the nuclear sector has been driven by efforts to allow unrestricted release of this material into the conventional market-place and in general any restricted release into the nuclear sector is carried out according to legislation in the country concerned preventing its sale as scrap. Further development of controlled release recycling of steels into products from plate will be likely driven by market forces sinc...|$|R
40|$|During {{long-term}} {{storage of}} <b>radioactive</b> waste, <b>steel</b> containers will be corroded. This process leads to hydrogen production. A {{boundary value problem}} has been proposed to study the numerical modelling of the gas migration and its coupling with the mechanical strains and stresses, under isothermal conditions. Biphasic fluid transfer model (considering water, vapour, gaseous hydrogen and dissolved hydrogen) is defined. A 2 D axisymmetric case with simplified geometry close to waste disposal in clay is modelled. Fluid transport problem is first resolved. Then, coupled mechanics and fluid transfers are modelled to determine the coupling effects. Peer reviewe...|$|R

TPandsX-II reuses the shield, outer vessel, cryogenics, purification hardware, and general infrastructure from the first version, but uses a much larger time projection chamber, inner vessel of higher purity (much less <b>radioactive</b> 60Co) stainless <b>steel,</b> and cryostat ...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{companies}} are confronted each {{day by the}} possible presence of <b>radioactive</b> materials in <b>steel</b> scrap. Many steel plants have already been equipped with radiation detectors, often installed at the entrance point for the scrap. Mittal Steel Zenica- steel producer will concentrate its efforts on improving radiation detection. The large scrap of Mittal Steel factory also uses radiation detectors to check loads of incoming scrap for signs of radioactivity. Results should allow elimination {{of the risk of}} emitting harmful radiation in the workplace or into the environment...|$|R
2500|$|Additionally, {{the choice}} of {{materials}} used in a fusion reactor is less constrained than in a fission design, where many materials are required for their specific neutron cross-sections. This allows a fusion reactor to be designed using materials that are selected specifically to be [...] "low activation", materials that do not easily become radioactive. Vanadium, for example, would become much less <b>radioactive</b> than stainless <b>steel.</b> Carbon fiber materials are also low-activation, {{as well as being}} strong and light, and are a promising area of study for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required.|$|R
40|$|Decontamination of <b>radioactive</b> {{contaminated}} stainless <b>steel</b> {{using the}} ESR process is investigated by conducting thermophysical and thermochemical laboratory {{studies on the}} slag. The ESR base slag investigated in this research project is 60 wt%CaF{sub 2 }- 20 wt%CaO- 20 wt%Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }. In this report, we present the data obtained to date on relevant slag properties, capacity to incorporate the radioactive contaminant (using CeO{sub 3 }) as surrogate, simulant for PUO{sub 2 } and UO{sub 2 }, slag-metal partition coefficient, volatilization rate and volatile species, viscosity, electrical conductivity and surface tension {{as a function of}} temperature. The impact of these properties on the ESR decontamination process is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{involves the}} measurement of the electrical conductivity (K) for the ESR (electroslag remelting) slag (60 wt. % CaF{sub 2 } - 20 wt. % CaO - 20 wt. % Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) used in the decontamination of <b>radioactive</b> stainless <b>steel.</b> The electrical conductivity is measured with an improved high-accuracy-height-differential technique that requires no calibration. This method consists of making continuous AC impedance measurements over several successive depth increments of the coaxial cylindrical electrodes in the ESR slag. The electrical conductivity is then calculated from {{the slope of the}} plot of inverse impedance versus the depth of the electrodes in the slag. The improvements on the existing technique include an increased electrochemical cell geometry and the capability of measuring high precision depth increments and the associated impedances. These improvements allow this technique to be used for measuring the electrical conductivity of highly conductive slags such as the ESR slag. The volatilization rate and the volatile species of the ESR slag measured through thermogravimetric (TG) and mass spectroscopy analysis, respectively, reveal that the ESR slag composition essentially remains the same throughout the electrical conductivity experiments...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the SRS Beneficial Reuse Program, {{stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>radioactive</b> {{scrap metal}} is melted, pour into ingots, and roll into sheets. The sheets are then fabricated into boxes and barrels for beneficial reuse. The melting activity is a partial decontamination process. Certain isotopes separate from the melted steel, while others stay in solution. Cobalt- 60 is the primary constituent, which remains in solution, and becomes the major contributor to the volumetric radioactivity of the finished products (boxes and barrels). There is currently no ``de minimis`` free release level for volumetrically radioactive material. However, under certain circumstances, pathway analysis can be used (and have been used) to free release volumetrically radioactive material. This paper presents an analysis using empirical data derived from over sixty ``melts``, to demonstrate that the implied surface radioactivity for specific beneficial reuse products is within free release limit. The approach can be applied to other recycled metal products...|$|R
40|$|The Stainless Steel Beneficial Reuse Program {{began in}} 1994 as a {{demonstration}} funded by the DOE Office of Science and Technology. The purpose {{was to assess the}} practicality of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>radioactive</b> scrap metal (RSM) recycle. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated through the production of a number of products made from recycled RSM. A solid business foundation is yet to be achieved. However, a business environment is beginning to develop as multiple markets and applications for RSM are surfacing around the Complex. The criteria for a successful business reality includes: - affordable programs, - a continuing production base from which to expand, - real products needs, - adequate RSM supply, and - a multi-year program This program currently sponsored by SRS and DOE-ORO to fabricate Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) canisters from RSM provides an activity that satisfies these criteria. The program status is discussed. A comparison of the cost of DWPF canisters fabricated from recycled RSM and virgin metal is presented. The comparison is a function of several factors: disposal costs, the fabrication cost of virgin metal canisters, the fabrication cost of recycled RSM canisters, free release decontamination costs, and the cost to accumulate the RSM. These variables are analyzed and the relationship established to show the break-even point for various values of each parameter...|$|R
40|$|The Research Objectives of {{this project}} are to {{characterize}} and optimize the use of molten slags to melt decontaminate <b>radioactive</b> stainless <b>steel</b> scrap metal. The major focus is on optimizing the electroslag remelting (ESR) process, a widely used industrial process for stainless steels and other alloys, which can produce high quality ingots directly suitable for forging, rolling, and parts fabrication. It is our goal to have a melting process ready for a DOE D and D demonstration {{at the end of}} the third year of EMSP sponsorship, and this technology could be applied to effective stainless steel scrap recycle for internal DOE applications. It also has potential international applications. The technical approach has several elements: (1) characterize the thermodynamics and kinetics of slag/metal/contaminate reactions by models and experiments, (2) determine the capacity of slags for radioactive containment, (3) characterize the minimum levels of residual slags and contaminates in processed metal, and (4) create an experimental and model-based database on achievable levels of decontamination to support recycle applications. Much of the experimental work on this project is necessarily focused on reactions of slags with surrogate compounds which behave similar to radioactive transuranic and actinide species. This work is being conducted at three locations. At Boston University, Prof. Uday Pal's group conducts fundamental studies on electrochemical and thermochemical reactions among slags, metal, and surrogate contaminate compounds. The purpose of this work is to develop a detailed understanding of reactions in slags through small laboratory scale experiments and modeling. At Sandia, this fundamental information is applied to the design of electroslag melting experiments with surrogates to produce and characterize metal ingots. In addition, ESR furnace conditions are characterized, and both thermodynamic and ESR process models are utilized to optimize the process. To complete the process development, ESR melting experiments, which include actual radioactive contaminates as well as surrogates, are being conducted at the Mining and Chemical Combine in Zheleznogorsk, Russia. These experiments measure decontamination efficiencies in ingots for uranium and plutonium in stainless steel, as well as correlate removal of radioactive and surrogate compounds in the same melts. This will ''close the loop'' and allow us to use measured surrogate behaviors to model removal of radioactive species...|$|R
40|$|Low-carbon <b>steel,</b> <b>radioactive</b> waste {{containers}} (55 -gallon drums) {{are experiencing}} degradation due to moisture and temperature fluctuations. With {{thousands of these}} containers currently in use; drum refurbishment becomes a significant issue for the taxpayer and stockholders. This drum refurbishment is a non-intrusive, portable process costing between 1 / 2 and 1 / 25 the cost of repackaging, depending on the severity of degradation. At the INEL alone, {{there are an estimated}} 9, 000 drums earmarked for repackaging. Refurbishing drums rather than repackaging can save up to $ 45, 000, 000 at the INEL. Based on current but ever changing WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC), this drum refurbishment process will restore drums to a WIPP acceptable condition plus; drums with up to 40 % thinning o the wall can be refurbished to meet performance test requirements for DOT 7 A Type A packaging. A refurbished drum provides a tough, corrosion resistant, waterproof container with longer storage life and an additional containment barrier. Drums are coated with a high-pressure spray copolymer material approximately. 045 inches thick. Increase in internal drum temperature can be held to less than 15 F. Application can be performed hands-on or the equipment is readily adaptable and controllable for remote operations. The material dries to touch in seconds, is fully cured in 48 hours and has a service temperature of {minus} 60 to 500 F. Drums can be coated with little or no surface preparation. This research was performed on drums however research results indicate the coating is very versatile and compatible with most any material and geometry. It could be used to provide abrasion resistance, corrosion protection and waterproofing to almost anything...|$|R
40|$|The Kori No. 1, {{which began}} {{operation}} in 1978, replaced its cask handling crane in 2000. To prove {{the safety of}} recycling and reuse of crane scrap, a particular calculation method for surface contamination was used. Because surface <b>radioactive</b> contamination of <b>steel</b> {{is limited to a}} few-microns-thick layer, we can calculate the total(removable and fixed contamination) activity of the sample conservatively by this surface removal sampling means. If we multiply the ratio of total surface and the area of the selected surface by its activity, total activity of the scrap can be estimated. Conservatively, the sampled portion {{can be used as a}} representative sample of the scrap. Both the inner and outer part of the scrap was sampled separately, and gamma spectra were analyzed to check whether activation had occurred. Before sampling, the entire surface of the steel is scan surveyed by several kinds of GM and GP detectors. Contaminated parts were segregated, or decontaminated to the background. Almost one sample per one ton of steel was collected. Gamma spectra of 62 samples were analyzed by 100 % efficiency HP Ge detector. Only 60 Co was detected, and its highest activity was 0. 01 Bq/g,. This level of activity is much lower than the ''clearance levels'' outlined in IAEA TecDoc- 855. (4). The total alpha and total beta for 6 samples were measured in the laboratory by low background alpha, using a beta gas proportional counter. Activities were much lower than 0. 005 Bq/g. A representative sample was taken from the complete mixture of 62 samples. Gamma activities of nuclides were measured to estimate the dose to the public. This study revealed that activities of nuclides were lower than 'clearance levels' if decontaminated until the lower limit of detection level of the portable field instrument. New surface removal sampling method was tested. This method allows us to easily calculate the specific activity for the solid material...|$|R
