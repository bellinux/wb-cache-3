5|$|Congressional {{candidate}} and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)—whose campaign platform includes {{the elimination of}} funding for school arts programs—editorializes on television to rescind {{the budget of the}} school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>congress</b> against Sue.|$|E
5|$|William Petit, {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of the home invasion, is an endocrinologist in Cheshire. He survived when he escaped via a direct external exit from the basement despite his injuries. He has not returned to his medical practice since the murders, stating his desire to be active in the foundations set up to honor {{the memory of his}} deceased family. He contemplated <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> as a Republican, but later decided against it. In the following election cycle, he successfully completed a Congressional run and now serves as a state representative.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress,</b> opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{new year}} at McKinley High. New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, {{has no idea what}} to do about his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a nose ring and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made friends with a group of outcast girls called the Skanks. She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions.|$|E
5|$|Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—Rachel's {{biological}} mother, {{the adoptive}} mother of Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Puck's daughter Beth, {{and the former}} coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline—is headhunted to coach a second glee club at McKinley High financed by Sugar Motta's (Vanessa Lengies) wealthy and doting father. Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's desire to do likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who is <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress,</b> convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her {{in the past and}} tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody.|$|E
25|$|Djou {{ran for the}} 1st {{district}} {{again in}} 2014. Although Djou garnered {{a greater percentage of}} the vote in a general election than any other Republican <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in Hawaii since 1988, he still narrowly lost to Democratic state representative Mark Takai, who garnered 51.2% of the vote.|$|E

50|$|As was {{the case}} for many rank-and-file party members of the day, Wagenknecht was a regular {{candidate}} for public office on the Socialist ticket, <b>running</b> <b>for</b> US <b>Congress</b> in 1906, <b>for</b> Seattle Comptroller in 1908, and <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> again in 1912 when the party's first choice, John Wanhope, stepped aside.|$|R
25|$|Mazzocchi {{was also}} {{influential}} in Democratic politics. He campaigned {{on behalf of}} Adlai Stevenson in 1956, {{and became one of}} Long Island's most politically influential labor leaders. In 1964, Mazzocchi considered <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> But, after being advised by party leaders that he was too radical for the electorate and would endanger the candidacies of other Democrats, he never undertook a campaign.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, in {{addition}} to serving {{as an adviser to}} Mitch McConnell's reelection campaign, Jennings served as the General Consultant to Brett Guthrie, the Republican <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in the open seat in Kentucky's second congressional district. While Guthrie was a little known state Senator to begin the race, he wound up winning despite being outspent by Democratic forces, which included his opponent David Boswell and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.|$|E
25|$|Gerlach {{had been}} {{mentioned}} as a potential candidate for the United States Senate seat held by Arlen Specter after John Cornyn, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, contacted him following Specter's May 2009 party-switch. Gerlach, however, ultimately decided not to run. Gerlach subsequently {{announced that he would}} once again be <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in 2010.

25|$|Gold's {{adherence}} to Communism and trade unionism intertwined to shape {{much of his}} career as a labor leader. He was an occasional political candidate of the Communist movement, <b>running</b> <b>for</b> U.S. <b>Congress</b> in the 23rd Congressional District of New York in 1928.|$|R
5000|$|Comstock {{embarked}} upon a facetious {{political campaign}} in 1964, <b>running</b> <b>for</b> U.S. <b>Congress</b> as the Republican candidate from the Third District in West Virginia, then an impossibly Democratic stronghold. He opposed “motherhood” among other things, {{and lost to}} incumbent John M. Slack Jr., failing even to carry his home precinct.|$|R
25|$|At {{one point}} in the 1970s, Zindler {{considered}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> as a Republican, and the local GOP commissioned surveys that predicted he would win. However, Gertrude was hesitant to leave Houston, and the plans were dropped. Also, Zindler described himself as a social liberal who supported universal health care and the feminist movement. He had initially been a Democrat and a Lyndon B. Johnson supporter. Zindler's father was a four-term mayor of suburban Bellaire and was also a liberal; he was a card-carrying member of the NAACP and opponent of the Ku Klux Klan and his clothing store was among a handful of Houston businesses that advertised in African-American newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Baucus {{came under}} fire from critics calling him a beltway insider who no longer really lives in Montana and only {{occasionally}} comes to visit. Until 1991, Baucus owned a house in Missoula, where he practiced law for three years before <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1974. He didn't own a home again in Montana until February 2002, when he bought half of his mother's house from the Sieben Ranch Company, the ranch started by Baucus's great-grandfather in 1897. The ranch company, and Baucus's mother, still own {{the other half of}} the house. Baucus lives in Washington, D.C.'s Capitol Hill district. As of November 2007, the Missoulian newspaper reported he owned no other property in Montana.|$|E
25|$|Gutknecht {{had always}} chosen to submit filing {{petitions}} when <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> {{instead of paying}} the $300 election filing fee, calling this a more fiscally conservative approach. Gutknecht was the only major party candidate in Minnesota to submit filing petitions in 2006. In August 2006, Louis Reiter of Elgin, Minnesota filed papers with the Minnesota Supreme Court seeking to disqualify Gutknecht from having his name appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot. The filing was prepared by DFL election attorney Alan Weinblatt, and argued that all candidates are subject to a time limit for petitions, and {{that most of the}} petition signatures were gathered before the July 4–18, 2006 period which the lawsuit claimed was applicable. Gutknecht filed the petitions on July 5, 2006, the first day possible for such filings. He had never previously been challenged on this point. The state Supreme Court heard the case on August 22, 2006 and denied the attempt to disqualify Gutknecht the same day.|$|E

Also, John Luke Panell, <b>running</b> <b>for</b> U.S. <b>Congress</b> in the 3rd congressional district, received 58,605 votes, or 19.98%.

500|$|While {{serving in}} the army in early 1862, Garfield was {{approached}} by friends about <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> from Ohio's newly redrawn, heavily Republican 19th district. [...] He was worried that he and other state-appointed generals would get obscure assignments, and <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress</b> {{would allow him to}} resume his political career. [...] The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 would allow him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862, on the eighth ballot. In October, he defeated D.B. Woods by a two-to-one margin in the general election for a seat in the 38th Congress.|$|E
500|$|From May to October 1879, Hay {{set out to}} reconfirm his {{credentials}} as a loyal Republican, giving speeches in support of candidates and attacking the Democrats.

Seward resigned later that month, Hay was offered his place [...] and accepted, after some hesitancy because he was considering <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his engagement, Ford was campaigning for what would be his first of {{thirteen}} terms {{as a member of the}} United States House of Representatives.

50|$|He {{started by}} handing out {{sandwiches}} at Grand Central Terminal while <b>running</b> <b>for</b> United States <b>Congress.</b> Though his three runs were unsuccessful, the visibility he gained from campaigning provided him a platform {{from which to}} advocate for the homeless.|$|R
50|$|Utter {{was elected}} as a Republican to the Sixty-second Congress and served from March 4, 1911, {{until his death}} from liver cancer in Westerly, Rhode Island, November 3, 1912. At {{the time of his}} death, Utter was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> {{re-election}} to <b>Congress.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Elected with Governor Hugh Carey, Krupsak became {{upset with}} how Carey treated her {{in office and}} felt she was not given enough to do.

500|$|McGovern left Moakley's {{office in}} 1996 and {{moved back to}} Worcester, again <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>Congress.</b> Unopposed in the Democratic primary, he ran against Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Blute in the general election. His campaign slogan focused on unseating House Speaker Newt Gingrich: [...] "To dump Newt you have to dump Blute." [...] Blute was endorsed by The Boston Globe and five other local papers, but McGovern won the election with 53 percent of the vote. He has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been re-elected seven times. [...] He ran unopposed in 2000 and 2002.|$|E
