40|$|Stent {{thrombosis}} {{remains the}} primary cause of death after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Despite modern concepts of PCI, stent thrombosis occurs in 0. 5 % - 2 % of elective procedures and even 6 % of patients with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Stent thrombosis most often develops within the first 48 hours after the PCI, and rarely after a week of stent implantation. Angiographically documented late (> 6 months) thrombosis of coronary bare-metal stent (BMS) is rare, because the stent endothelialization is considered to be completed after four weeks of the intervention. Our patient is a 41 year old male and he had BMS thrombosis 345 days after the implantation, which was clinically manifested as an acute myocardial infarction in the inferoposterolateral localization. Stent Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade thrombosis occurred despite a long term dual antiplatelet therapy and control of known risk factors. Thrombolytic therapy (Streptokinase in a dose of 1 500 000 IU) was not successful in reopening the occluded vessel, so the flow through the coronary artery was achieved by <b>rescue</b> <b>balloon</b> angioplasty, followed by implantation of drug eluting stent in order to prevent restenosis...|$|E
