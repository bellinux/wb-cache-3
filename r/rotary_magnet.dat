As differential pressure increases, a magnet attached to either a piston or rubber diaphragm moves. A <b>rotary</b> <b>magnet</b> that {{is attached to a}} pointer then moves in unison.

40|$|Common models {{describing}} initial tooth movement mostly rest on {{the assumption}} of viscoelastic behaviour of the tooth. The periodontium is regarded as an elastic isotropic material following Hooke’s law for small displacements. These assumptions have been examined in vivo. The study is based on 22 cases with natural spacing between the teeth. An experimental device was designed for measuring small mesial and distal rotations of the crown following time-dependent torques. They were optically recorded with high accuracy (< 0. 001 deg resolution). The torques were produced by a digitally-controlled <b>rotary</b> <b>magnet</b> motor and applied to the buccal side of mandibular premolars {{by means of a}} flexible Cardan shaft. Thresholds were found which had to be overcome by the applied torque to rotate the tooth about its centre of resistance. The data provided strong hints that the periodontium was a thixotropic substance and showed also shear thinning. These properties seemed to have a large interindividual variety. Key words: initial tooth movement, in vivo measurement, thixotropic periodontium 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{mixing of}} powders {{and the quality}} control of the {{obtained}} mixtures are critical operations involved in the processing of granular materials in chemical, metallurgical, food and pharmaceutical industries. Studies on mixing efficiency and the time needed for achieving homogeneity in the powder mashes production have significant importance. Depending on the characteristic of the materials, a number of methods {{have been used for}} the homogeneity tests. Very often, the degree of mixing has been determined by analyzing images of particle arrays in the sample using microscopy, photography and/or video tools. In this paper, a new PC-based method for determining the number of particles in the powder homogeneity tests has been developed. Microtracers®, red iron particles, were used as external tracer added before mixing. Iron particles in the samples of the mixtures were separated by <b>rotary</b> <b>magnet</b> and spread onto a filter paper. The filter paper was sprayed with 50 % solution of ethanol for color development and the particles counted where the number of spots presented the concentration of added tracer. The number of spots was counted manually, {{as well as by the}} developed PC program. The program which analyzes scanned filter papers with spots is based on digital image analyses, where red spots were converted through few filters into a black and white, and counted. Results obtained by manual and PC counting were compared. A high correlation was established between the two counting methods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the numerical modeling and the experimental verification of a <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> driver excited by an electromagnetic field. As the electromagnetic torque {{of the permanent}} magnetic rotor is a nonlinear function of external electromagnetic field and its rotation angle, {{it is difficult to}} compute it directly by using common electromagnetic analysis methods. Based on the concept of equivalent surface magnetic charge, the research explores a numerical method for calculating the drive torque of the <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> submitted to an electromagnetic field, and meanwhile, establishes the theoretical model for the electromagnetic torque due to the combined magnetic fields versus the excitation current and the rotation angle of the permanent magnet. This model may present the quasi-static and dynamic vibration drive process of the <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> under the electromagnetic field excitation. The research finally validates the theoretical analysis and the numerical modeling by experimental tests in terms of accuracy and feasibility of the driving system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel <b>Rotary</b> Permanent <b>Magnet</b> Magnetic Refrigerator (RPMMR) is described. The {{principle}} of {{operation of the}} presented magnetic refrigerator {{is based on the}} AMR thermodynamic cycle. Gadolinium is selected as magnetic refrigerant and demineralized water is employed as regenerating fluid. The total mass of gadolinium (1. 20 kg), shaped as packed bed spheres, is housed in 8 regenerators. A magnetic system, based on a double U configuration of permanent magnets, provides a magnetic flux density of 1. 25 T with an air gap of 43 mm, while a rotary vane pump forces the regenerating fluid trough the regenerators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} decoupling control of a linear and <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> actuator (LRPMA) with linear, rotary and helical movements. Since both linear and rotary motions of the actuator are dependent on both current and voltage, a novel two-directional d-q transformation is proposed to decouple the inter-relationship between the current and voltage in each coil. The expressions of input power, magnetic field energy, rotary torque, linear force and copper loss are all derived. A MATLAB/Simulink model for helical movement is then setup with hysteresis current control. A practical LRPMA prototype is manufactured and its control system is implemented with a dual digital signal processor.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{of the scientific community}} regarding magnetic refrigeration at room temperature is constantly growing. In recent years, there has been an increase in the experimental work relating to both new prototypes and new magnetocaloric materials. The magnetic refrigerators built to date still have some limitations that make them uncompetitive when compared with conventional vapour compression systems. However, among the different configurations realized, one can recognize that rotary devices, having rotating magnets and static regenerators, are of particular interest because of their good energy performances. In this paper, we report an experimental investigation on the identification of the energy performances of a <b>Rotary</b> Permanent <b>Magnet</b> Magnetic Refrigerator. Employing 1. 20 kg of gadolinium and operating at a temperature of heat rejection equal to 296 K, the system was subjected to different operating conditions obtained by varying the thermal load, volumetric flow rate of the regenerating fluid and cycle frequency...|$|R
40|$|This paper treats {{a control}} {{technique}} designed to maximise the working of a <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> magnetic refrigerator (RPMMR). The method, named ANNTEO, {{is based on}} the use of the artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have demonstrated to predict well the energy performances of an actual RPMMR obtaining a good agreement with the experimental tests. The ANN gives the possibility to carry out a working map, and then, applying an optimisation process, it is possible to catch the optimal working point regarding the number of revolution of the magnets per minute and the volumetric flow rate of the regenerating fluid. In particular, the optimisation can be processed with the aim to maximise the COP (energy saving) or the cooling capacity (time-saving). As a proof of the concept, this paper reports an example of an application of the ANNTEO. Also, new perspectives {{on the use of the}} ANNs in the magnetic refrigeration field are proposed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} model is proposed {{to analyze and}} predict {{the characteristics of a}} double stator linear and <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> machine (DSLRPMM). In order to simplify the magnetic field calculation, the DSLRPMM is cut along the axial direction (z direction) and transferred into a planar one. Hence, {{an analytical}} model of the machine considered the orthogonal effect (OE) is proposed based on the combined solution of Maxwell’s equation, conformal mapping, and equivalent magnetic circuit model (EMCM). The magnetic field distributions of the DSLRPMM are calculated with and without considering the OE, and some important electromagnetic parameters, including the back electromotive force (EMF), detent force, cogging torque, and output torque and thrust, are also predicted and compared to the 3 D finite element analysis (FEA). The results show that the errors between the proposed analytical model and the 3 D FEA results are less than 0. 2 % and even less than 0. 1 % for certain parameters, that is, the results obtained from the proposed analytical model agree well with that of the FEA. Moreover, the analyzed and predicted results are also verified by the experimental results on the prototype of the DSLRPMM...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} is an ecofriendly {{solid state}} technology employing magnetocaloric materials in an Active Magnetic Regenerating refrigerant cycle (AMR), a Brayton-based thermodynamical cycle. Magnetic refrigeration {{is based on}} magnetocaloric effect (MCE), a physical phenomenon that couples an external magnetic field with the magnetic moments of magnetocaloric materials. In the case of ferromagnetic materials, MCE is a warming as the magnetic moments of the atom are aligned by {{the application of a}} magnetic field, and the corresponding cooling upon removal of the magnetic field. Gadolinium is the benchmark material for magnetic refrigeration in room temperature range, thanks to its marked magnetocaloric effect which is maximum at 294 K. In this paper the results of numerical investigations on magnetocaloric materials are presented: the energetic performances of different magnetocaloric materials have been investigated through a two-dimensional model of an AMR regenerator. The model has been previously experimentally validated with a <b>Rotary</b> Permanent <b>Magnet</b> Magnetic Refrigerator. Exploring the behavior of the regenerator under variable working condition, a performance map has been obtained for gadolinium. The results, collected in terms of temperature span, coefficient of performance and mechanical power associated to circulation pump, lead to formulize viewpoints on employing magnetocaloric materials under optimized AMR working conditions...|$|R
40|$|A new {{self-powered}} magnetorheological (MR) {{damper control}} system {{was developed to}} mitigate cable vibration. The power source of the MR damper is directly harvested from vibration energy through a <b>rotary</b> permanent <b>magnet</b> direct current (DC) generator. The generator itself can also serve as an electromagnetic damper. The proposed smart passive system also incorporates a roller chain and sprocket, transforming the linear motion of the cable into the rotational motion of the DC generator. The vibration mitigation performance of the presented self-powered MR damper system was evaluated by model tests with a 21. 6 m long cable. A series of free vibration tests of the cable with a passively operated MR damper with constant voltage, an electromagnetic damper alone, and a self-powered MR damper system were performed. Finally, the vibration control mechanisms of the self-powered MR damper system were investigated. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} supplemental modal damping ratios of the cable in the first four modes can be significantly enhanced by the self-powered MR damper system, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the new smart passive system. The results also show that both the self-powered MR damper and the generator are quite similar to a combination of a traditional linear viscous damper and a negative stiffness device, and the negative stiffness can enhance the mitigation efficiency against cable vibration...|$|R

40|$|Most {{advanced}} manufacturing processes require linear motion for material transfer, packaging, assembly and electrical wiring. To achieve precise linear motion, {{most of these}} high-performance manufacturing machines use X-Y sliding tables with permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>rotary</b> motors and rotary-to-linear couplers. Though this method is the most widely used, it has disadvantages of low accuracy, complex mechanical adjustments, high cost, and low reliability.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, {{wire bonding}} of chips and {{surface mount technology}} process require precise robotic linear motion. Traditionally, X-Y sliding tables driven by permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>rotary</b> motors, ball-screw and belt are used. However, they have position accuracy problem due to ball-screw backlash. Since motors and high precision grade ball-screws are expensive, high manufacturing cost is another disadvantage. Low reliability results from complex mechanical alignment and low ball-screw lifetime. This paper presents {{the basic structure of}} Linear Switched Reluctance Motor for high performance motions in manufacturing automation. No magnet is used and the traveling distance has no limitation. Consequently, this motor is extensively robust and applicable in hostile environment. A two-dimensional motor is introduced to replace the conventional X-Y table. Based on switched reluctance driving method, the proposed actuator has a very simple and robust structure with very few mechanical parts for easier manufacturing. 3 designs are compared on their mechanical structure and efficiency.
