5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of <b>red</b> <b>fir,</b> western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} is an ecologically versatile species {{living in a}} variety of habitats, ranging from temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian, sagebrush plains, <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> forest, semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, to alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. Adults can be located in forested understory, hiding under coarse woody debris, rocks, and in small mammal burrows. During the spring breeding season, adults can be found under debris or in the shoreline shallows of rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. Ephemeral waters are often frequented.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the trailhead}} at lower elevations, alder {{thickets}} are present, {{as well as}} incense cedar, <b>red</b> <b>firs,</b> and western white pine. At higher elevations, groups of mountain hemlock and lupines prevail. Eagles and hawks can be frequently noted on high crags, and squirrels and pika live about the mountain.|$|R
5000|$|The botanical {{diversity}} of the Trinity Alps is quite unique. The region has intrigued botanists for many years because of the predominance of the Sierran flora only 60 mi from the Pacific Ocean. Conifers common in the Sierra Nevada such as foxtail pines, lodgepole pines, western white pines, whitebark pines, ponderosa pines, <b>red</b> <b>firs,</b> and white firs are also common in the Alps alongside the endemic Brewer spruce. [...] Large wildfires swept through the western forests in recent years.|$|R

25|$|Vegetation in {{the basin}} is {{dominated}} by a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), white fir (Abies concolor), and <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> (A. magnifica). The basin also contains significant areas of wet meadows and riparian areas, dry meadows, brush fields (with Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus) and rock outcrop areas, especially at higher elevations. Ceanothus is capable of fixing nitrogen, but mountain alder (Alnus tenuifolia), which grows along many of the basin’s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations in some small streams. The beaches of Lake Tahoe are the only known habitat for the rare Lake Tahoe yellowcress (Rorippa subumbellata), a plant which grows in the wet sand between low- and high-water marks.|$|E

500|$|Most of the Rogue River {{watershed}} {{is in the}} Klamath Mountains ecoregion {{designated by}} the EPA, although part of the upper basin is in the Cascades ecoregion, {{and part of the}} lower basin is in the Coast Range ecoregion. Temperate coniferous forests dominate much of the basin. The upper basin, in the High Cascades and Western Cascades, is in places [...] "identified as containing extremely high species richness within many groups of plants and animals". Common tree species in the forests along the upper Rogue include incense cedar, white fir, and Shasta <b>red</b> <b>fir.</b>|$|E
500|$|At and in {{the area}} below the lake, mixed forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), <b>red</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies Magnifica), white fir (Abies Concolor), {{lodgepole}} pine (Pinus Contorda), incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) and alder can be found. [...] Alders play a particularly important role, as alders establish symbioses with the nitrogen-fixing Actinobacteria (Frankiella alni). This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble nitrates which can be utilised by the alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally. Alders benefit other plants growing near them by taking nitrogen {{out of the air}} and depositing it in the soil in usable form; fallen alder leaves make very rich compost. Picea breweriana exists in a few small locations on the igneous slopes behind the lake. Other deciduous trees at lower elevations in the area may include such species as bigleaf maple, vine maple, black oak and Pacific dogwood.|$|E
500|$|The flora in the Little Butte Creek {{watershed}} is predominately temperate coniferous forest, {{which makes}} up approximately 65 {{percent of the}} total area. The lower regions are covered with chaparral, and the upper regions by fir forests. The chaparral region is inhabited by oaks such as garry oak and California black oak, with an understory of buckbrush and manzanita. Coast douglas-fir, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, California incense-cedar, and white fir are the most common trees found in the mixed coniferous forest. Shasta <b>red</b> <b>fir,</b> white fir, and the noble fir grow in the higher elevations of the watershed. Mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, Sitka mountain-ash, and squashberry also grow in this region. Chinquapin can be found around Fish Lake.
