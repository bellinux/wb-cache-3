40|$|The highly conserved SR family {{contains}} {{a growing number}} of phosphoproteins acting as both essential and alternative splicing factors. In this study, we have cloned human genomic and cDNA sequences encoding a novel SR protein designated SRp 46. Nucleotide sequence analyses have revealed that the SRp 46 gene corresponds to an expressed PR 264 /SC 35 <b>retropseudogene.</b> As a result of mutations and amplifications, the SRp 46 protein significantly differs from the PR 264 /SC 35 factor, mainly at the level of its RS domain. Northern and Western blot analyses have established that SRp 46 sequences are expressed at different levels in several human cell lines and normal tissues, as well as in simian cells. In contrast, sequences homologous to SRp 46 are not present in mice. In vitro splicing studies indicate that the human SRp 46 recombinant protein functions as an essential splicing factor in complementing a HeLa cell S 100 extract deficient in SR proteins. In addition, complementation analyses performed with β-globin or adenovirus E 1 A transcripts and different splicing-deficient extracts have revealed that SRp 46 does not display the same activity as PR 264 /SC 35. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that an SR splicing factor, which represents a novel member of the SR family, is encoded by a functional <b>retropseudogene...</b>|$|E

The first two properties probably {{reflect the fact that}} genes giving rise to <b>retropseudogenes</b> have to be expressed in the germ-line. The two latter points suggest that reverse-transcription and transposition is more efficient for short GC-poor mRNAs. In addition, this analysis allowed us to reject previous hypotheses that widely expressed genes are GC rich. Rather, globally, genes with a wide tissue distribution are GC poor. <b>Retropseudogenes</b> arise in evolution by reverse tran-scription of processed mRNAs and incorporation of the resulting cDNAs back into the genome (Vanin 1985).

40|$|Spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} tarda (SEDL) is an X-linked recessive {{disorder of}} endochondral bone formation caused by mutations in the SEDL gene. Here we present the structural analysis and subcellular localization of human SEDL. The SEDL gene {{is composed of}} six exons and spans a genomic region of ~ 20 kb in Xp 22. It contains four Alu sequences in its 3 ′ UTR and an alternatively spliced MER 20 sequence in its 5 ′ UTR (exon 2). Complex alternative splicing was detected for exon 4. Altogether seven SEDL pseudogenes were detected in the human genome: SEDLP 1, a transcribed <b>retropseudogene</b> (or retro-xaptonuon) on chromosome 19 q 13. 4 with potential to encode a protein identical {{to that of the}} SEDL gene; SEDLP 2, another <b>retropseudogene</b> (not transcribed) on chromosome 8; and five truncated pseudogenes, SEDLP 3 –SEDLP 7, on chromosome Yq 11. 23. Based on the knowledge of the yeast SEDL ortholog we speculated that the SEDL protein may participate along the ER-to-Golgi transport compartments. To test this hypothesis we performed transient transfection studies with tagged recombinant mammalian SEDL proteins in Cos- 7 cells. The tagged SEDL proteins localized to perinuclear structures that partly overlapped with the intermediate ER–Golgi compartment (ERGIC; or vesicular tubular complex, VTC). Two human SEDL mutations (157 – 158 delAT and C 271 T(STOP)) introduced into SEDL FLAG and GFP constructs led to the misplacement of the SEDL protein primarily to the cell nucleus and partially to the cytoplasm. Based on these experiments we suggest that the COOH end of the SEDL protein might be responsible for proper targeting of SEDL along the ER–Golgi membrane compartments (including Golgi and ERGIC/VTC).

These include the Hmg 1 gene family in mice and the Hmgn 2 family in humans. We investigated orthologous loci of several strains and species of Mus for presence or absence of apparently young Hmg 1 <b>retropseudogenes.</b> Three of four analysed elements were specific to Mus musculus, two of which were not fixed, indicative of recent evolutionary origins. Additionally, we datamined a presumptive subfamily (Hmgz) of mouse Hmg 1, but only identified one true element in the GenBank database, which is not consistent with a separate subfamily status. Two of four analysed Hmgn 2 retropseudo-genes were specific for the human genome, whereas a third was identified in human, chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, and a fourth additionally found in orangutan but absent in African green monkey. Flanking target-site duplications were consistent with LINE integration sites supporting LINE machinery for their mechanism of amplification. The human Hmgn 2 retropseu-dogenes were full length, whereas the mouse Hmg 1 elements were either full length or 3 ′-truncated at specific positions, most plausibly the result of use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The nature of their recent amplification success in relation to other <b>retropseudogenes</b> is unclear, although availability of a large number of transcripts during gametogenesis may be a reason.

We assessed the variability of CpG substitution rates in nonrepetitive DNA and in various TE and <b>retropseudogene</b> families. We show that, unlike other substitution rates, the rate of transition at CpG sites is significantly (37 %) higher in repetitive DNA than in nonrepetitive DNA. Moreover, this rate of CpG transition varies according to the number of repeats, their length, and their level of divergence from the ancestral sequence (up to 2. 7 times higher in long, lowly divergent TEs compared with unique sequences). This observation strongly suggests the existence of a homology-dependent methylation (HDM) mechanism in mammalian genomes.

40|$|In {{addition}} to their central function in protein biosynthesis, tRNAs also play a pervasive role in genome evolution and architecture because of their extensive ability to serve as templates for retroposition. Close to half {{of the human genome}} consists of discernible transposable elements, a vast majority of which are derived from RNA via reverse transcription and genomic integration. Apart from the presence of direct repeats (DRs) that flank the integrated sequence of retroposons, genomic integrations are usually marked by an oligo(A) tail. Here, we describe a novel class of retroposons that lack A-tails and are therefore termed tailless retropseudogenes. Analysis of ∼ 2500 tRNA-related young tailless <b>retropseudogene</b> sequences revealed that they comprise processed and unprocessed (pre-) tRNAs, 3 ′-truncated in their loop regions, or truncated tRNA-derived SINE RNAs. Surprisingly, their mostly nonrandom integration is dependent on the priming of reverse transcription at sites determined by their 3 ′-terminal 2 - 18 nucleotides and completely independent from oligoadenylation of the template RNA. Thus, tailless retropseudogenes point to a novel, variant mechanism for the biogenesis of retrosequences...|$|E

A survey of 138 functional source genes in the human genome has revealed more than three hundred retropseudogenes. Analysis of the characteristics of the source genes shows that, on average, their size, G/C content, and expression patterns fit the canonical features of source genes reported elsewhere. Details of insertion site duplications for these loci are consistent with a model of <b>retropseudogene</b> formation involving endogenous retrotranscription and enzymatic mobilization and retroposition.

Articular cartilage from an adult who had SEDL and carried this mutation contained chondrocytes with abundant Golgi complexes and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RT-PCR experiments using mouse/human cell hybrids revealed that the SEDL gene escapes X inactivation. Homologues of the SEDL gene include a transcribed <b>retropseudogene</b> on chromosome 19, as well as expressed genes in mouse, rat, Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Their components are copies of a non protein-coding highly expressed RNA of unknown function termed WEIRD and of two fungal retrotransposons: MGL and Mg-SINE. Many of these chimeras are transcribed in various M. grisea tissues and during plant infection. Chimeric retroelements with a similar structure were recently found in three mammalian genomes. All these chimeras are likely formed by RNA template switches during the reverse transcription of diverse LINE elements. Results We have shown that in M. grisea template switching occurs at specific sites within the initial template RNA which contains a characteristic consensus sequence. We also provide evidence that both single and double template switches may occur during LINE retrotransposition, resulting in the fusion of three different transcript copies. In addition to the 33 bipartite elements, one tripartite chimera corresponding to the fusion of three retrotranscripts (WEIRD, Mg-SINE, MGL-LINE) was identified in the M. grisea genome. Unlike the previously reported two human tripartite elements, this fungal retroelement is flanked by identical 14 bp-long direct repeats.

We found > 50 PRs in both human and mouse formed since divergence from dog, that are under pressure to maintain the integrity of their coding sequences. For different subsets of PRs formed at different stages of mammalian evolution, we find some evidence for non-neutral evolution, despite significantly less expression evidence for these sequences. Conclusion These results indicate that retrotranspositions are a significant source of novel coding sequences in mammalian gene evolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{elements}} comprise {{close to}} {{one half of the}} mass of the human genome. Only LINE- 1 (L 1), an autonomous non-Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, and its non-autonomous partners-such as the <b>retropseudogenes,</b> SVA, and the SINE, Alu-are currently active human retroelements. Experimental evidence shows that Alu retrotransposition depends on L 1 ORF 2 protein, which has led to the presumption that LINEs and SINEs share the same basic insertional mechanism. Our data demonstrate clear differences in the time required to generate insertions between marked Alu and L 1 elements. In our tissue culture system, the process of L 1 insertion requires close to 48 hours. In contrast to the RNA pol II-driven L 1, we find that pol III transcribed elements (Alu, the rodent SINE B 2, and the 7 SL, U 6 and hY sequences) can generate inserts within 24 hours or less. Our analyses demonstrate that the observed retrotransposition timing does not dictate insertion rate and is independent of the type of reporter cassette utilized. The additional time requirement by L 1 cannot be directly attributed to differences in transcription, transcript length, splicing processes, ORF 2 protein production, or the ability of functional ORF 2 p to reach the nucleus. However, the insertion rate of a marked Alu transcript drastically drops when driven by an RNA pol II promoter (CMV) and the retrotransposition timing parallels that of L 1. Furthermore, the "pol II Alu transcript" behaves like the processed pseudogenes in our retrotransposition assay, requiring supplementation with L 1 ORF 1 p in addition to ORF 2 p. We postulate that the observed differences in retrotransposition kinetics of these elements are dictated by the type of RNA polymerase generating the transcript. We present a model that highlights the critical differences of LINE and SINE transcripts that likely define their retrotransposition timing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pseudogenes, the {{nonfunctional}} homologues {{of functional}} genes are now coming to light as important resources regarding {{the study of}} human protein evolution. Processed pseudogenes arising by reverse transcription and reinsertion can provide molecular record on the dynamics and evolution of genomes. Researches on the progenitors of human processed pseudogenes delved out their highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved characters. They are reported to be short and GC-poor indicating their high efficiency for retrotransposition. In this article we focused on their high expressivity and explored the factors contributing for that and their relevance in the milieu of protein sequence evolution. Results We here, analyzed the high expressivity of these genes configuring processed or retropseudogenes by their immense connectivity in protein-protein interaction network, an inclination towards alternative splicing mechanism, a lower rate of mRNA disintegration and a slower evolutionary rate. While the unusual trend of the upraised disorder {{in contrast with the}} high expressivity of the proteins encoded by processed pseudogene ancestors is accredited by a predominance of hub-protein encoding genes, a high propensity of repeat sequence containing genes, elevated protein stability and the functional constraint to perform the transcription regulatory jobs. Linear regression analysis demonstrates mRNA decay rate and protein intrinsic disorder as the influential factors controlling the expressivity of these <b>retropseudogene</b> ancestors while the latter one is found to have the most significant regulatory power. Conclusions Our findings imply that, the affluence of disordered regions elevating the network attachment to be involved in important cellular assignments and the stability in transcriptional level are acting as the prevailing forces behind the high expressivity of the human genes configuring processed pseudogenes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Retrosequences of protein-coding {{genes are}} {{generated}} by retrotransposition, i. e. reverse transcription of the genes´ mRNAs followed by {{integration into the}} genome. More than 8. 000 genomic cDNA copies from an estimated total of 20. 000 have been identified so far in human. Their biological relevance depends on the function of their respective (retrotranscribed) gene, on their own transcriptional status (active: retrogene / inactive: <b>retropseudogene),</b> but also on their integration site. The high mobility group protein (HMG) gene family is {{regarded as one of}} the largest retrosequence families in human. This thesis represents the first detailed study of retrosequences of a complete HMG group, i. e. HMGA. HMGA proteins play an important role in cell differentiation and tumorigenesis making possible active retrosequences of their genes interesting subjects. During the study 7 retrosequences of HMGA 1 located on different chromosomes could be identified and characterised in detail concerning their formation, integration, transcriptional status and their possible role in tumorigenesis. They were derived from 5 different mRNA splice variants from which 2 have not been cloned yet. Their retrotransposition appeared to have been catalysed by the L 1 endonuclease/reverse transcriptase (2 ̆ 2 target primed reverse transcription 2 ̆ 2). In silico analyses revealed 3 transcriptionally active retrosequences in normal and pathogenic tissues. At least one of them represents a new exon of an unknown gene. Concerning a possile relevance of the retrosequences for tumor initiation and / or progression 2 hypotheses were tested by analyzing chromosomal aberrations in cases of several solid benign tumor entities. The first hypothesis implied an own tumor-inducing potential of the retrosequences as proto-oncogenes. Whereas the second one suggested a mutational influence on the tumor-related HMGA genes by homologous recombination as aberration partners. Statistical analyses supported both hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain an}} {{inventory}} of all human genes that code for alpha-crystallin-related small heat shock proteins (sHsps), the databases available from the public International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) and the private Celera human genome project were exhaustively searched. Using the human Hsp 27 protein sequence as a query in the protein databases, which are derived from the predicted genes in the human genome, 10 sHsp-like proteins were retrieved, including Hsp 27 itself. Repeating the search procedure with all 10 proteins and {{with a variety of}} more distantly related animal sHsps, no further human sHsps were detected, as was the case when searches were performed at deoxyribonucleic acid level. The 10 retrieved proteins comprised the 9 earlier recognized human sHsps (Hsp 27 /HspB 1, HspB 2, HspB 3, alphaA-crystallin/HspB 4, alphaB-crystallin/HspB 5, Hsp 20 /HspB 6, cvHsp/HspB 7, H 11 /HspB 8, and HspB 9) and a sperm tail protein known since 1993 as outer dense fiber protein 1 (ODF 1). Although this latter protein probably serves a structural role and has a high cysteine content (14 %), it clearly contains an alpha-crystallin domain that is characteristic for sHsps. ODF 1 can as such be designated as HspB 10. The expression of all 10 human sHsp genes was confirmed by expressed sequence tag (EST) searches. For Hsp 27 /HspB 1, 2 <b>retropseudogenes</b> were detected. The HspB 1 - 10 genes are dispersed over 9 chromosomes, reflecting their ancient origin. Two of the genes (HspB 3 and HspB 9) are intronless, and the others have 1 or 2 introns at various positions. The transcripts of several sHsp genes, notably HspB 7, display low levels of alternative splicing, as supported by EST evidence, which may result in minor amounts of isoforms at the protein level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract : Gene {{duplication}} is {{an essential}} source of material for the origin of genetic novelties. The reverse transcription of source gene mRNA followed by the genomic insertion of the resulting cDNA - retroposition - has provided the human genome with at least ~ 3600 detectable retrocopies. We find that ~ 30 % of these retrocopies are transcribed, generally in testes. Their transcription often relies on preexisting regulatory elements (or open chromatin) close to their insertion site, which is illustrated by mRNA molecules containing retrocopies fused to their neighboring genes. Retrocopies {{appear to have been}} profoundly shaped by selection. Consistently, human retrocopies with an intact open reading (ORF) are more often transcribed than <b>retropseudogenes,</b> which leads to a minimal estimate of 120 functional retrogenes present in our genome. We also performed an analysis of Ka/Ks for human retrocopies. This analysis demonstrates that several intact retrocopies evolved under purifying selection and yields an estimated formation rate of ~ 1 retrogene per million year in the primate lineage. Using DNA sequencing and evolutionary simulations, we have identified 7 such primate-specific retrogenes that emerged on the lineage leading to humans In therian genomes, we found an excess of retrogenes with X-linked parents. Expression analyses support the idea that this "out of X" movement was driven by natural selection to produce autosomal functional counterparts for X-linked genes, which are silenced during male meiosis. Phylogenetic dating of this "out of X" movement suggests that our sex chromosomes arose about 180 MYA ago and are thus much younger than previously thought. Finally, we have also analyzed young gene duplications (and deletions) that arose by non allelic-homologous recombination and are not fixed in species. Using wild-caught and laboratory animals, we detected thousands of DNA segments that are polymorphic in copy number in mice. These copy number variants were found to profoundly alter the transcriptome of several mouse tissues. Strikingly, their influence on gene expression {{is not limited to the}} gene they contain but seems to extend to genes located up to 1. 5 million bases away...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vps 25 p is {{the product}} of yeast gene VPS 25 and is found in an endosomal sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) -II, along with Vps 22 p and Vps 36 p. This complex is essential for sorting of ubiquitinated biosynthetic and endosomal cargoes into endosomes. Results We found that VPS 25 is a highly conserved and widely expressed eukaryotic gene, with single orthologs in chromalveolate, excavate, amoebozoan, plant, fungal and metazoan species. Two paralogs were found in Trichomonas vaginalis. An ortholog was strikingly absent from the Encephalitozoon cuniculi genome. Intron positions were analyzed in VPS 25 from 36 species. We found evidence for five ancestral VPS 25 introns, intron loss, and single instances of intron gain (a Paramecium species) and intron slippage (Theileria species). Processed pseudogenes were identified in four mammalian genomes, with a notable absence in the mouse genome. Two <b>retropseudogenes</b> were found in the chimpanzee genome, one more recently inserted, and one evolving from a common primate ancestor. The amino acid sequences of 119 Vps 25 orthologs are aligned, compared with the known secondary structure of yeast Vps 25 p, and used to carry out phylogenetic analysis. Residues in two amino-terminal PPXY motifs (motif I and II), involved in dimerization of Vps 25 p and interaction with Vps 22 p and Vps 36 p, were closely, but not absolutely conserved. Specifically, motif I was absent in Vps 25 homologs of chromalveolates, euglenozoa, and diplomonads. A highly conserved carboxy-terminal lysine was identified, which suggests Vps 25 is ubiquitinated. Arginine- 83 of yeast Vps 25 p involved in Vps 22 p interaction was highly, but not absolutely, conserved. Human tissue expression analysis showed universal expression. Conclusion We have identified 119 orthologs of yeast Vps 25 p. Expression of mammalian VPS 25 {{in a wide range of}} tissues, and the presence in a broad range of eukaryotic species, indicates a basic role in eukaryotic cell function. Intron splice site positions were highly conserved across all major eukaryotic species, suggesting an ancestral origin. Amino acid sequence analysis showed the consensus for the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs is P- [WP]-X-[YF] for motif I (when present) and P-P-[FYL]-[FY] for motif II, and that Vps 25 may be ubiquitinated. </p...|$|R
