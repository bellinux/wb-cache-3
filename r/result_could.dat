5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{lasted for}} more than 15 hours, in an increasing gale and the constant presence of the rocky Breton coast. The seas were so rough that the French ship was unable to open the lower gun ports during the action and as a <b>result</b> <b>could</b> only fire the upper deck guns, significantly reducing the advantage that a ship of the line would normally have over the smaller frigates. The damage the more manoeuvrable British vessels inflicted on the French ship was so severe that as the winds increased, the French crew lost control and the Droits de l'Homme was swept onto a sandbar and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a <b>result</b> <b>could</b> not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E

5|$|The results {{indicated}} that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70MeV) excitation energy which underwent fission with measurable half-lives just over 10−18 s. Although very short (indeed, insufficient for the element to be considered by IUPAC to exist, because a compound nucleus has no internal structure and its nucleons have not been arranged into shells until it has survived for 10−14s, upon which it forms an electronic cloud), the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower excitation energy (see neutron evaporation), {{the effect of the}} shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei can be expected to have relatively long half-lives. This <b>result</b> <b>could</b> partially explain the relatively long half-life of 294Og measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at element 124 but not for flerovium, suggesting that the next proton shell does in fact lie beyond element 120. In September 2007, the team at RIKEN began a program utilizing 248Cm targets and have indicated future experiments to probe the possibility of 120 being the next proton magic number (and 184 being the next neutron magic number) using the aforementioned nuclear reactions to form 302Ubn, as well as 248Cm+54Cr. They also planned to further chart the region by investigating the nearby compound nuclei 296Og, 298Og, 306Ubb, and 308Ubb.|$|E

25|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device. This <b>result</b> <b>could</b> have been expected because during each full rotation, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into {{and away from the}} wind giving identical readings) and perpendicular to the wind twice.

25|$|Although it was {{originally}} developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa {{has led to a}} qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry. In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.|$|E
25|$|It had {{previously}} been proposed, by George FitzGerald in 1889 and by Lorentz in 1892, independently of each other, that the Michelson-Morley <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be accounted for if moving bodies were contracted {{in the direction of}} their motion. Some of the paper's core equations, the Lorentz transforms, had been published by Joseph Larmor (1897, 1900), Hendrik Lorentz (1895, 1899, 1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), in a development of Lorentz's 1904 paper. Einstein's presentation differed from the explanations given by FitzGerald, Larmor, and Lorentz, but was similar in many respects to the formulation by Poincaré (1905).|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The <b>result</b> <b>could</b> be cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E

25|$|Reform {{had also}} failed in 1997 to {{establish}} {{itself as the}} clear right-wing alternative to the Liberal Party. The Progressive Conservative Party, which had been steadily rebuilt under Charest, enjoyed a modest revival in the 1997 election. It won 20 seats, up from the dismal two it had won during in the 1993 election. The split in the right-wing vote between Reform and the PCs possibly aided the Liberals to win a second majority government. Some political pundits claimed {{that it was a}} divided right which allowed the Liberals to gain a second majority government, and claimed that if the two parties did not put away their differences, the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> repeat itself.|$|E
25|$|Running {{alongside}} this look, interlude {{films were}} {{often used in}} the lengthy breaks between programmes. Due {{to the nature of}} television at the time, which was mainly based on live performances rather than pre-recorded material, programmes had an unknown length and as a <b>result</b> <b>could</b> easily finish several minutes before the beginning of the next advertised programme. The interlude films were used to fill the gaps and consisted of films of ideological settings or old industries, such as a farmer using a traditional plough. These films had no beginning or end and so could be of any specified length. With the subsequent rise of video tape and pre-recorded programmes, the interludes were less and less necessary.|$|E
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that <b>result</b> <b>could</b> come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic {{testing is}} used to {{diagnose}} or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing {{is used to}} confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed {{at any time during}} a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about health care and the management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> confirm the diagnosis of PKD.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{mycorrhizal}} inhibition of decomposition was in 1971 and came from ectomycorrhizal Pinus radiatia plantations in New Zealand. Authors show that excluding roots and mycorrhizal fungi resulted in net carbon loss, {{and that the}} <b>result</b> <b>could</b> not be explained by soil disturbance effects. The mechanism presented is that ectomycorrhizal fungi can compete with free-living decomposers for nutrients, and thereby limit the rate of total decomposition. Since then {{there have been several}} other reports of ectomycorrhizal fungi reducing activity and decomposition rates of free-living decomposers and thereby increasing soil carbon storage. A theoretical ecosystem model recently demonstrated that greater access to organic nitrogen by mycorrhizal fungi should slow decomposition of soil carbon by free-living decomposers by inducing nutrient limitation. It should be noted however, that Koide and Wu (2003) made a strong case that the effect of ectomycorrhizal fungi on reducing decomposition may {{have more to do with}} competition for soil water than soil nutrients.|$|E
25|$|February: The {{new manager}} {{continued}} attempting {{to strengthen the}} squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with {{only a handful of}} appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former Shots goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club. On the pitch, Aldershot went on a run of five consecutive draws, the first away to league leaders Chesterfield who required a later equaliser to rescue a point. An away stalemate at Morecambe was followed by consecutive home draws against Macclesfield and Lincoln. After a further draw against Northampton the Shots were finally beaten by a strong Port Vale side pushing for promotion, though the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> have been different if Anthony Charles hadn't missed a penalty. Aldershot ended the month in 18th position in the league, 8 points clear of the relegation zone.|$|E
