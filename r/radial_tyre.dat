40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the finite element modelling of a steel belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> under static contact load using ABAQUS code. The model combines the 3 D {{parts of the}} complex tread patterns and the quasi axisymmetric part of the tyre in which the tread blocks are not included. These two sections were meshed separately and linked together using a tying algorithm implemented in the code. The fibber reinforced parts of the tyre including ply, belts, and cap ply were modelled using rebar layer embedded in the surface elements. A hyperelastic material model was {{used in conjunction with}} a linear elastic one to describe the stress-strain behaviour of rubber and reinforcing fibres, respectively. The developed model was used to simulate the 175 / 70 R 14 steel-belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyre</b> subjected to inflation and contact loads. Three belts angles were selected to examine the effect of belt angle variations on the mechanical behaviour of the tyre. In addition, the results were also compared with a similar tyre model in which a simply ribbed tread was used instead of complex tread pattern. The friction between tread surface and contact road surface was simulated using the Coulomb’s friction law. The numerical results and also the comparison of experimentally measured tyre deflection under concentrated vertical load revealed that neglecting the details of the tread blocks has very minor effect on the predicted tyre deformation. However, differences can be large enough when considering secondary or higher variables such as contact pressure, stress, and strain energies. It is also shown that a belt angle of 20 o is the best comprised value among the selected design parameters...|$|E
50|$|The first <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> {{for cars}} {{appeared}} in 1943, but motorcyclists waited forty more years for this technology {{to come to}} motorcycles. These were the 1983 Pirelli MP7 radials, introduced on the European version of the 1984 Honda VF1000R, a limited edition exotic motorcycle that showcased {{a number of new}} technologies including carbon fibre reinforced bodywork and air-adjustable anti-dive front forks. The new <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> had to provide race-replica handling for the very heavy 524 lb dry weight chassis, up to a top speed of 150 mph, making it the fastest production motorcycle of its day. The MP7 radials came to the US market in 1985. Radial construction uses textile or steel belts arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, along with a layer of belts running around the tyre's circumference, with motorcycle radials deviating from the true radial design by adding belts running at angles to the radial belts, in the manner of bias-ply tyres, allowing the grip, durability, feel, and other characteristics to be adjusted to suit the tyre's design. The benefit of <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> is that the tyres run cooler yet maintain great flexibility, allowing engineers to coax significant increases in both grip and tread life, without compromise, under a broader range of conditions than bias-ply tyres.|$|R
5000|$|Dunlop Rubber, {{founded in}} 1889, was a British {{multinational}} {{involved in the}} manufacture of various rubber products. By the end of the Second World War, around 1946, starting with Fort Dunlop, Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham in Britain, Dunlop had manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Ireland, South Africa and India. It had sales outlets in nearly every country in the world. Then the Monopolies and Restrictive Prices Commission forced some pricing changes. In the early sixties Dunlop opted for the cheaper textile <b>radial</b> <b>tyres</b> rather than the steel belted <b>radial</b> <b>tyres.</b> The British car industry declined and the 1973 oil crisis compounded matters. Dunlop started losing markets. As its business declined it started selling off many of its companies, including that in India.|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} of the in-plane behaviour of a <b>radial</b> <b>tyre,</b> suitable {{to be employed}} within the simulation of aircraft braking. The model is developed {{on the basis of}} an energy-balance approach that allows the determination of the effects of braking on rolling friction and on the lever-arm of vertical load. The model is tuned and validated through the correlation between simulated and experimental results relevant to a large aircraft tyre. The method proposed is tuneable on a specific tyre using a limited number of parameters, that are those usually recorded during standard braking tests and it is extendible to the braking tests of an aircraft. This would overcome the limitations intrinsic of current tyre dynamometer facilities that are able to test large aircraft tyres over a modest range of vertical loads compared with those experienced under service conditions...|$|E
40|$|PMC Harvesters Ltd is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for the pea {{and bean}} market. Their primary product {{line is a}} self {{propelled}} harvester known as the 979 CT harvester. The 979 CT is of considerable proportions being 4 m x 4 m x 12 m in overall dimensions, six wheel drive and weighs 29, 620 kg GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) when fully laden. The aim of this work was to identify and outline possible solutions for the support system (tyre or track and undercarriage), quantify the performance of each system, produce a design and evaluation method to determine an optimal structural specification and to produce a design recommendation for the application. Analysis of the current 979 CT harvester wheel configuration highlighted many constraining factors in tyre choice. The most pertinent of these was that the wheels have a very limited operating space and following {{a study of the}} possible tyre options it became apparent only two manufactures, Michelin and Trelleborg, could provide tyres which met the vehicle parameters. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the three chosen tyre options. From the findings of these tests {{it was clear that the}} optimal tyre for the PMC configuration was the Trelleborg Twin <b>Radial</b> <b>tyre,</b> operating at minimum road inflation pressure (1. 6 bar) as designated by Trelleborg. When operating the harvester in its normal working environment the tyre pressure should be set at minimum road inflation for in-field conditions with a DBD (Dry Bulk Density) of > 1. 3 g/cm 3, as excess damage caused by operating above minimum field operating pressure is superficial. The use of low compaction equipment such as CTIS (Central Tyre Inflation System) or tracks would not be beneficial to the PMC application. The track tested created a hardened track pan, thus requiring more effort to rectify post harvest. A CTIS increases the consumption of diesel and offered no reduction in soil compaction below plough depth as shown by the findings from operating the optimal tyre at minimum field inflation pressure (1. 2 bar). The primary objective of this project was to offer solutions to reduce the effects of the PMC harvester’s weight on its operating medium. The first natural step was to assess the vehicles main structure in order to improve its performance to weight ratio. The initial phase of this process was to validate the modelling and analyses techniques used to assess the structure. This was done within a controlled test environment at CU@S and from this work a factor of safety of 10 % was designated to be applied to all analysis in order to authenticate results and generate a “worst case” answer. Revisions of the main chassis, main pivot and rear axle assemblies were created and analysed. Test metrics were defined which represented operating patterns of the harvester. The findings from these tests saw a 22. 6 % weight reduction, 43. 1 % increase in life expectancy and 10. 2 % reduction in peak stress in the main chassis and main pivot. Unlike the other two key assemblies, the rear axle was deemed fit for purpose and would not benefit from any further design changes...|$|E
