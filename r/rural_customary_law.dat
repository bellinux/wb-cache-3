40|$|Rural women‘s {{land rights}} in South Africa remain {{secondary}} {{in spite of}} laws founded on a constitution that promotes gender equality. Patriarchal <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> prevail and women‘s land rights and use security are inextricably linked to their relationships with their male relatives. Rural women are key producers of agricultural products due to historical and continued male outward migration, {{which has led to}} a feminisation of agriculture. Although women farm the land, their land use security is poor and can be further threatened by divorce or widowhood. Given that most vulnerable women are based in rural communal South Africa, how can their land rights be secured under the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> framework? While the statutory law framework seems to provide a solution, it is less applicable in <b>rural</b> areas where <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> and traditional practices prevail. If statutory law cannot be superimposed on the existing <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> framework, how can women‘s land use be further secured to support their household food security efforts?

40|$|The {{compatibility}} of African <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> {{and human}} rights has been widely debated.

40|$|This article {{challenges}} the colonial delegitimization of Nigeria's <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> The author describes <b>customary</b> <b>law's</b> fundamental bases, {{and argues that}} these bases are what ensured <b>customary</b> <b>law's</b> survival during colonial rule, and also what provide for <b>customary</b> <b>law's</b> contemporary relevance. Globalization, increased international interaction, and the eclipse of tribal insularity necessitate a permanent form of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> that is decipherable to foreigners and non-Indigenous people of Nigeria. However, the author opines that if rigidification of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is to be avoided, then the present practice of proving it as a fact ought to be retained. Factual proof is defended as an incident of the primordial nature and primary source of <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> rather than any weakness in the comparison of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> with the received English law. Under Nigerian law, after a rule of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is proved to exist, the court must consider whether it is judicially enforceable, {{or whether it is}} repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience. The author argues that the 'repugnancy doctrine' was routinely employed in a legal 'cleansing' mission, and was the engine for the imposition of hegemonic, foreign culture. The author suggests caution in the uncritical and contemporary use of the repugnancy doctrine and its precedents. Other instances of non-judicial enforcement of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> are also considered, such as the contractual exclusion of <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> and the exclusion of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> based on the uncustomary nature of the subject matter of litigation. Finally, the author addresses the specific question of the constitutionality of <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> <b>Customary</b> <b>law's</b> patriarchal foundation and general discrimination against women and female children are problematic issues that require sensitive and imaginative judicial use of <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> The author argues that the Nigerian judiciary should undertake careful constitutional and sociological analysis before striking down any rule of <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> The court should make reference to South Africa's constitutional experience, which has comparative similarities to Nigeria. The article concludes with a call for an interpretive approach to <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> that ensures its survival and adaptation to the dictates of equality in an egalitarian society...|$|R

40|$|In this Note, {{the author}} {{examines}} {{the process of}} international human rights norm internalization into areas traditionally governed exclusively by <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> and the resulting evolution of <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> Assuming, arguendo, that <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is to be modified, I argue that a societal norm internalization approach {{is the most effective}} means to bring <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> into conformity with international human rights law. After a brief discussion of the fieldwork on which I rely, this Note describes the historical influence of colonialism on the development of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> in Africa, with a particular focus on the repugnancy clauses of the colonial era. Next, it explores the societal norm internalization approach and how it has taken advantage of the openings provided by the contestation of cultural norms on the local level in rural Africa. The author then explains the evolution of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> in independent, post-colonial Sierra Leone. In particular, the Note examines norm internalization in Sierra Leone in the context of child custody and maintenance by exploring the interplay between international human rights <b>law,</b> <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> and the formal legal system. These cases implicate both women 2 ̆ 7 s and children 2 ̆ 7 s rights issues and illustrate the internalization or acceptance of human rights principles in <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> Finally, the author contrasts this <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> context with that in contemporary South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The study aims at {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} harmonizing Dayak <b>Customary</b> <b>law</b> with the state law within the unity of national legal order in Indonesia, as an attempt of preventing conflicts due to putting the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> into effect by the indigenous community of Dayak in West Kalimantan, within the perspective of legal politic. Even though the location and the subjects of the study are <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> of Dayak, {{it does not necessarily}} mean that the study is merely on the the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of Dayak, locality in nature and in dimension; however, the study is national in its dimension. Within the local dimension, marriage between two legal entities within the same social domain territory may pose some possibilities, namely conflict, mutual adaptation and mutual avoidance, as well as harmony. With the national dimension, the existence of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> constitutes a crucial problem in the development of national <b>law.</b> The <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of Dayak is one of the entry points to figure out how the state elaborates the ideas on the existence of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> within the national legal development that has been underlined in the national constitutions and in the national legal politic. The recent study attempts to bring up the issues on the legal harmonization, exactly, the harmonization between <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> and state law within the unity of national legal order. This is a part of state’s recognition of the existence of <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> as an implementation of Article 18 B of National Constitution of Indonesia. The issues on legal harmonization are brought onto surface with many reasons. Firstly, within the constitutional domain, there is a necessity of creating a harmony between the indigenous communities along with their <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> that becomes the foundation of their traditional customary rights in accordance with the societal development and the unitary principle of Indonesia. Secondly, constitution demands the national governing authority to establish law as an attempt of recognizing the existence of <b>customary</b> <b>laws.</b> Thirdly, within the social domain, there is a judicial extension in the implementation of <b>customary</b> <b>law,</b> both in territorial dimension and in personal dimension; or in other words, the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> has been in effect outside its habitat. In the study attempts to answer some central issues, including in what way the legal recognition and harmonization model is established so that the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is not in contradiction with the principle of unitary state and with the national legal structure, and how to harmonize the legal system of Dayak community in West Kalimantan with the state law. The study finds some critical points. Firstly, Dayak <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> has formed itself as a separate legal system in addition to the state law. Legal system of Dayak community consists of legal constitutional elements, substances of legal norms and legal culture of the indigenous community. Secondly, the politic of state law on the existence of <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is continuously changing, from a governmental regime to the other. The legal politic of the New Order regime did not accommodate the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> within the national legal structures. After the ruin of the New Order regime, national legal politic recognizes the existence of customary law; however, under the subsequent governmental regime, exactly under the governance of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the national legal politic does not explicitly recognize the existence of the <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> It is also found that within national constitution, accommodation provided to the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> is highly partial, scattered over some sector constitutions. Based on the result of the study, it is recommended that the recognition of the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> be performed as a separated system and be regulated in a separate law. By regulating the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> with a separate law, it may be harmonized with the state law, within various sectors, both in judicial sector and in some other sectors.

There is the obvious exception in property law with native title and at times in criminal law in relation to defences and punishment. For Torres Strait Island people, parts of the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> have been recognised within the legal system and with some effect. The example of Mabo v State of Queens/and [No 2] (1992) 175 CLR 1 relates to the legal recognition of <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> related to land and sea - 'property' law. Until recently the Family Court of Australia had a set of Practice Directions relating to the traditional adoption of Torres Strait Island children and sat as a Court in the Torres Strait to make consent orders {{to give effect to}} an agreement made according to <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> - 'family' law.

40|$|This study {{looks into}} {{the ways in which}} {{official}} <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> addresses succession complexities and legitimacy in woman-to-woman marriages. The social, political, cultural and legal background against which these marriages are concluded show the history of succession in woman-to-woman marriages and the position of women and children. The thesis highlights provisions of <b>customary</b> succession <b>laws</b> legislators sought to redress through the Reform of <b>Customary</b> <b>Law</b> of Succession and Related Matters Act 11 of 2009 and the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 120 of 1998, which affect widowed spouses and certain children in customary marriages. The study uses literature review, case analysis and interviews to investigate the operation and legitimacy of woman-to-woman marriages, the benefits or harmful effects thereof, the background, context and history of the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of succession and acceptance of children in Bolobedu, and the application of living <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> The study finds that woman-to-woman marriages are legitimate customary marriages under Lobedu <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> It also finds that <b>customary</b> succession <b>laws</b> in such marriages have traces of patriarchy, although the community is under a matriarchal system of governance. It finds that the rule of male primogeniture is still applicable, and that women do not have a right to inherit from their deceased parents except at the discretion of the male heir. It finds that the acceptance of children in woman-to-woman marriages includes the performance of ceremonies symbolising the female husband's acceptance, and the child's use of her surname. It further finds that the application of official <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> in Bolobedu is negligible, with the living <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> being the applicable law for all succession disputes. A further finding is the general lack of knowledge and understanding of succession rights under official <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> by the community and their traditional leaders, who are aware only of provisions of the Lobedu living <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> which they readily provide. The study concludes that the legislators, judiciary and policy makers' lack of knowledge and understanding of woman-to-woman marriages and its accompanying succession laws inhibits and limits the adequacy of official <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> to regulate succession complexities. Rural communities' perceptions of their rights and knowledge of <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> of succession, the practicality of provisions of official <b>customary</b> <b>laws</b> of succession, and their relatability to lived realities of rural communities further add to the inadequacy of official <b>customary</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

The African <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> {{relating}} to intestate succession has always been known to discriminate against women. The thesis therefore focuses on the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of intestate succession in the countries of South Africa, Ghana and Swaziland and the inroads they have made in improving {{the rights of women}} in this discriminatory field of African <b>customary</b> <b>law.</b> This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the reader to the topic of the research. It highlights the organisation of the intended research which comprises: a statement of the problem, the legal framework, research methodology and a summary of the chapter. Chapter 2 defines the general terms and concepts used in the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of intestate succession. This facilitates an understanding of the general principles comprising the body of law known as the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of intestate succession and lays the foundation for the country specific issues that are investigated in the following chapters. Chapter 3 discusses the recognition, application and development of the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of intestate succession in the country of South Africa. Chapter 4 considers the rules and <b>laws</b> of the <b>customary</b> <b>law</b> of intestate succession in the West African country of Ghana.
