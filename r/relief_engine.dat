5000|$|Parade of the Volunteer Firemen of Westchester County and Vicinity is a {{documentary}} film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. Filmed on October 6, 1910, during a parade of volunteer firemen in New Rochelle, New York. The parade included horses, fire equipment and the firemen from the surrounding area. According to The New Rochelle Pioneer the <b>Relief</b> <b>Engine</b> Company arranged to have the film shown on October 27 and October 28, 1910 at Germania Hall in New Rochelle. According to the newspaper, in a later edition, {{the cost of the}} parade was $6,438.16 or [...]|$|E
50|$|On 4 October 1850 the {{locomotive}} due {{to work the}} 0800 departure from Bury had to be withdrawn from service due to a technical failure. The station master at Bury knew an engine would be sent from Ipswich to investigate the situation (this being normal practice {{in the days before}} telegraph communication between stations). To save time four horses were connected to the two-coach train to pull it along the line to meet the loco coming from Ipswich. To enable them to see the relief train at the earliest opportunity Bury Stationmaster Hartwell and a porter William Baldwin climbed on to the roof of the first carriage and they were joined at Thurston by stationmaster James Wolton. Just east of Thurston station the horse drawn train met the <b>relief</b> <b>engine</b> and the horses ere removed. The three men remained sitting on the carriage roof and a little further east the two stationmasters who had been facing Bury were hit by the bridge as the train passed under it. Wolton and Hartwell were killed whilst Baldwin survived.|$|E
50|$|In November 1908, the {{railroad}} {{changed the name}} to Vista, {{because there was no}} longer a need for <b>relief</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{was established in}} 1889 and was named Relief by the Northern Pacific Railway Company because the location was used for adding <b>relief</b> <b>engines</b> to heavy trains.|$|R
5000|$|James {{is based}} on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway [...] "Class 28", an 0-6-0 mixed-traffic tender engine of 1912/13, {{designed}} by George Hughes and based on the earlier Class 27 designed by John Aspinall. According to Awdry, the Class 28s were powerful goods engines but had a tendency to be nose-heavy, especially when used as <b>relief</b> <b>engines</b> on excursion trains, as they often were, and driven at speed.|$|R
40|$|Work in {{dynamic image}} based {{rendering}} {{has been presented}} by Kanade et al. [4] and Matusik et al. [5] previously. We present an alternative implementation {{that allows us to}} have a very inexpensive process of creating dynamic image-based renderings of digitally recorded photo realistic, real-life objects. Together with computer vision algorithms, the image-based objects are visualized using the Relief Texture Mapping algorithm presented by Oliveira et al [6]. As the <b>relief</b> <b>engine</b> requires depth information for all Texels representing the recorded object in an arbitrary view, a recording solution making depth extraction possible is required. Our eyes use binocular vision to produce disparities in depth, which also is the most effortless technique of producing stereovision. By using two digital video cameras, the dynamic object is recorded in stereo in different views to cover its whole volume. As the depth information from all views are generated, the different views from the image-based object are textured on a pre-defined bounding box and relief textured into a three dimensional representation by applying the known depth disparities. 1 System Prototype The first step in the process is to record a dynamic object in stereo, which gives us the photo textures for the image-based object and th...|$|E

50|$|The Calvinia and Sakrivier {{branches}} {{had been}} worked almost exclusively by Class 19C locomotives from about 1950, but from 1951 two Class 24s were also allocated to Beaufort West and sub-shedded at Hutchinson. After February 1963, this {{was reduced to}} one Class 24 locomotive until long after the branch was dieselised c. 1960, using Class 32-000 locomotives based at De Aar. For some six months {{in the latter half}} of 1969, the Calvinia and Sakrivier branches reverted to steam-only operation when there was a huge surge in ore traffic that required the drafting in of more Class 32-000 locomotives to the Port Elizabeth mainline. A pair of Class 24 locomotives temporarily worked those branches in 1969 and 1970 as <b>relief</b> <b>engines</b> during the diesel-electric locomotive shortage.|$|R
50|$|Placing engines on {{the wing}} {{provides}} beneficial wing bending relief in flight. The further the engines are away from the fuselage the greater the wing bending <b>relief</b> so <b>engines</b> buried in the wing root provide little relief. Almost all modern large jet airplanes use engines in pods located a significant distance from the wing root for substantial wing bending relief. The pods are {{in front of the}} wing to help avoid flutter of the wing which, in turn, allows a much lighter wing structure. Locating the pod below the wing provides each engine with air undisturbed by the fuselage or wing.|$|R
50|$|In 1932 Locomotive 1210 was {{declared}} obsolete and withdrawn from service but not scrapped {{due to a}} shortage of engines and in 1935 assigned to Moree to haul local branch line trains. In 1943 the engine was again withdrawn from service but due to war-time pressure on the railways returned to service. In 1947 the engine was returned to Parkes {{for use as a}} <b>relief</b> or emergency <b>engine.</b> It continued in use until 1958 when it was finally withdrawn from service.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the whistle}} sounded. The page was done. We sprang to our feet and strung out {{alongside}} the track. There she came, coughing and spluttering up the grade, the headlight turning night into day and silhouetting us in sharp <b>relief.</b> The <b>engine</b> passed {{us, and we}} were all running with the train, some boarding on the side-ladders, others [...] "springing" [...] the side-doors of empty box-cars and climbing in. I caught a flat-car loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a comfortable nook. I lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for a pillow. Above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves, and watching them I fell asleep. The day was done--one day of all my days. To-morrow would be another day, and I was young.|$|R
