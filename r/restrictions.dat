50|$|A <b>restriction</b> {{fragment}} is a DNA fragment {{resulting from}} the cutting of a DNA strand by a <b>restriction</b> enzyme (<b>restriction</b> endonucleases), a process called <b>restriction.</b> Each <b>restriction</b> enzyme is highly specific, recognising a particular short DNA sequence, or <b>restriction</b> site, and cutting both DNA strands at specific points within this site. Most <b>restriction</b> sites are palindromic, (the sequence of nucleotides is the same on both strands when read in the 5' to 3' direction), and are four to eight nucleotides long. Many cuts are made by one <b>restriction</b> enzyme because of the chance repetition of these sequences in a long DNA molecule, yielding a set of <b>restriction</b> fragments. A particular DNA molecule will always yield {{the same set of}} <b>restriction</b> fragments when exposed to the same <b>restriction</b> enzyme. <b>Restriction</b> fragments can be analyzed using techniques such as gel electrophoresis or used in recombinant DNA technology.|$|R

40|$|Background/aim: Fluid <b>restriction</b> {{has long}} been {{considered}} one of the cornerstones in self-care management of patients with heart failure. The aim of this discussion paper is to discuss fluid <b>restriction</b> in heart failure and propose advice about fluid intake in heart failure patients. Results: Although there have been seven randomised studies on fluid <b>restriction</b> in heart failure patients, the effect of fluid <b>restriction</b> on its own were only evaluated in two studies. In both studies, a stringent fluid <b>restriction</b> compared to a liberal fluid intake was not more beneficial with regard to clinical stability or body weight. In the other studies fluid <b>restriction</b> {{was part of a larger}} study intervention including, for example, individualised dietary recommendations and follow-up by telephone. Thus, the effect of fluid <b>restriction</b> on its own has been poorly evaluated. Conclusion: Fluid <b>restriction</b> should not be recommended to all heart failure patients. However, temporary fluid <b>restriction</b> can be considered in decompensated heart failure and/or patients with hyponatremia. Tailored fluid <b>restriction</b> based on body weight (30 ml/kg per day) seems to be most reasonable.
