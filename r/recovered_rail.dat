50|$|Aside from {{a handful}} of {{locomotives}} placed on public display, little thought up to this time had been given to any serious notion of rail preservation. The catalyst proved to be the wholesale scrapping of steam traction which began in the mid 1950s and continued until 1971 when the last JA class locomotives were withdrawn from the Main South Line. In addition at this time, a large number of branch lines were closed and ripped up, and some of the earliest preservation efforts were based on these closed lines, while others took advantage of the opportunity to obtain cheap supplies of <b>recovered</b> <b>rail</b> materials for use elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOn July 11, 2012 an {{eastbound}} Norfolk Southern train derailed 17 cars {{within the}} city limits of Columbus, OH. Three of the cars that derailed were carrying over 86, 000 gallons of denatured ethanol. Once breached, the ethanol in the tank cars ignited, fueling a large fire. The derailment led to the evacuation of over 100 people and cost over $ 1. 2 million. This paper will detail the on-scene response and failure analysis performed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory, focusing on the <b>recovered</b> <b>rail</b> that contained 25 transverse detail fractures...|$|E

25|$|Eritrea won its {{independence}} from Ethiopia in 1993, and in 1994 the Eritrean president declared that rebuilding the railway was a priority for the new nation. During the war years a spirit of self-reliance had been built up, and the Eritreans refused foreign loans and expensive rework. Instead, the Eritreans decided, they would rebuild what they had left with their own efforts. Rebuilding the line started, some work going into rebuilding the workshops and station in Asmara while others set to reconstructing the Massawa end. Renovation of the main line began from Massawa westbound, <b>recovering</b> <b>rails</b> and steel ties.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June, it was {{reported}} that a 1,000-tonne crane would be brought in by road from Carlisle to remove the derailed carriages on 10 June. The A85 at Falls of Cruachan was in effect on a bridge along the shore of Loch Awe and the engineers were looking at a number of methods to alleviate the problems with using such a large vehicle on the road. The carriage left overhanging the embankment was to be recovered by road, whilst the other was to be <b>recovered</b> by <b>rail.</b> A road crane had to be used as there was insufficient room available to use a rail-mounted crane. An option to use a helicopter to remove the carriages was ruled out due to the weight of the carriages at 35 tonnes each. If the crane was unable to recover the carriages, it was planned to winch them back onto the track and <b>recover</b> them by <b>rail.</b> The operation to recover the carriages was estimated to cost £100,000. On 11 June the crane removed the carriage that had fallen down the embankment.|$|R
50|$|The index case, a mare called Drama Series, {{was housed}} with 19 other horses after falling ill, and died two days later. Subsequently, {{all of the}} horses became ill, with 13 dying. The {{remaining}} six animals were subsequently euthanised {{as a way of}} preventing relapsing infection and possible further transmission. The trainer, Victory ('Vic') Rail, and the stable foreman, Ray Unwin, were involved in nursing the index case, and both fell ill with an influenza-like illness within one week of the first horse’s death. The stable hand <b>recovered</b> while <b>Rail</b> died of respiratory and renal failure. The source of the virus was most likely frothy nasal discharge from the index case.|$|R
50|$|The GWR {{signal box}} stood {{slightly}} {{to the east of}} Codsall station. It was taken out of use and control of the area passed to Madeley Junction {{as a result of the}} 2006 resignalling scheme. The lever and locking frame from the signal box were <b>recovered</b> by Network <b>Rail</b> for re-use in the south-west of England. The remaining re-usable parts of the signal box have been relocated to the Dean Forest Railway.|$|R
50|$|The east wall of {{the park}} {{includes}} an art installation called Artwall, primarily composed of <b>rail</b> tracks <b>recovered</b> from the area placed vertically along the east wall. Portland Terminal Railroad donated the <b>rails,</b> <b>recovered</b> from the region. Some rails date back to 1898. Bullseye Glass, a local glass art company, supplied 99 translucent blue pieces of glass, which are interspersed in the rails. They were painted by Herbert Dreiseitl with scenes of indigenous animals.|$|R
60|$|The two vessels {{were not}} fifty feet apart. With all my {{strength}} I hurled the coil of rope. The steamer's stern was above me, and I aimed high. The flying coil {{went over the}} deck of La Fidélité, but in my excitement I forgot to grasp tightly {{the other end of}} it, and the whole rope flew from me and disappeared beyond the steamer. Stupefied by this deplorable accident, I staggered backward and a heave of the vessel threw me against the <b>rail.</b> <b>Recovering</b> myself, I glared about for another rope, but of course there was none.|$|R
5000|$|The Diamond Valley Miniature Railway Club {{was founded}} in 1960 with {{equipment}} relocated from the closed Chelsworth Park Railway (located in Ivanhoe, Melbourne). [...] The original mainline at Eltham was completed on August 17, 1961 at 0.52 km (0.32 miles) long. Numerous developments, extensions and improvements {{took place in the}} years that followed. Importantly starting the in mid-1960s the original 1" [...] x 1/2" [...] steel 'rail' was replaced with 14 lb/yard <b>rail</b> <b>recovered</b> from disused quarries, railways and tramways. (From 2001 the mainline is being progressively relaid with 6 kg/m (12 lb/yd) flat bottomed rail.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} of the Museum also comprises ancient and modern miners’ tools, together with lead “turtles” - produced for commercialization - their moulds and other products derived from the smelting process. The visitor can also admire silver coins of ancient Athens (5th-4th c. b.C.) known as the “Lavrion owls”, according to Aristophanes. Huge rocks of slag, used as blocks in the port of the city, are {{on display in the}} surrounding grounds, together with loading barrels for vessels affected to the transportation of metals or coal, as well as a wagonette on <b>rails</b> <b>recovered</b> from a semi-destroyed mining gallery (Adami) in the nearby region of Plaka.|$|R
5000|$|In 1851 the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was {{completing}} its Alston branch, {{running from}} Haltwhistle; {{the primary purpose}} of the line was to serve the lead mines in the hills between Alston and Nenthead. The line passed near Lambley and had a short branch to the colliery there, a little west of the new line. The colliery was not operated by Thompson and Sons, but the firm decided to extend their line from Midgeholme to Lambley, and join the N&CR there. As well as serving the colliery output, the connection with the N&CR was valuable. The Thompson and Sons extension and the N&CR branch opened on 5 January 1852. <b>Rails</b> <b>recovered</b> from the by-passed waggonway at Milton were used for this construction.|$|R
2500|$|The {{line from}} Saint-Valery Ville to Cayeux was relaid with [...] <b>rails</b> <b>recovered</b> from the {{standard}} gauge Woincourt-Orival line, which closed to passengers in May 1939 and completely from 1 January 1947. [...] In 1949 the CFBS acquired some second hand steam locomotives after {{the closure of the}} Réseau Albert. [...] Three second-hand railcars were acquired in 1955 and a new railcar was acquired in 1957, along with two second hand diesel locomotives. [...] A third diesel locomotive was acquired in 1960. [...] In 1971 a pair of De Dion-Bouton type OC1 bogie railcars (X157 and X158) were acquired from the Réseau Breton (RB), having been previously used on the Chemin de Fer des Côtes-du-Nord (CdN).

A trailing railcar was also acquired from the RB in 1971, having previously been built as a powered railcar.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} an action research study into the systemic success factors which help frontline staff react to and <b>recover</b> from a <b>rail</b> service disruption. This study focuses on the effective use of information during a disruption to improve customer service, as this is a priority area for train-operating companies (TOCs) in Great Britain. A novel type of systems thinking, known as Process-Oriented Holonic Modelling (PrOH), {{has been used to}} investigate and model the ‘Passenger Information During Disruption’ (PIDD) system. This paper presents conceptual requirements for a gamified learning environment; it describes ‘what’; ‘how’ and ‘when’ these systemic success factors could be gamified using a popular disruption management reference framework known as the Mitigate, Prepare, React and Recover (MPRR) framework. This paper will interest managers of and researchers into customer service system disruptions, as well as those wishing to develop new gamified learning environments to improve customer service systems...|$|R

50|$|Many of {{the dangers}} posed by this journey result from the train itself {{and the process of}} {{climbing}} aboard and getting off moving trains. Because migrants board between 10 and 15 trains during their 1450-mile journey, which typically begins in Arriaga, Chiapas, the chances of sustaining a major injury are high before they even arrive at Lechería station in Mexico City, which serves as a sort of halfway point before the train route scatters into various directions that head closer to different points on the U.S. border. It is not uncommon to visit rest homes and volunteer clinics where migrants with missing limbs are <b>recovering</b> from <b>rail</b> accidents. Often, migrants fall asleep while riding atop trains and are jolted off and onto the tracks where many are killed instantly by decapitation, blood loss, and shock. Because accidents often occur {{in the darkness of the}} night and in rural areas, victims are often not found immediately. If they do survive the fall, they must then wait for help because trains do not stop. After losing limbs to freight train accidents, survivors often feel ashamed to return to their home countries because they can no longer support their families and are in more severe circumstances than they originally began with. Apart from enduring moving trains, physical tiredness, and the extreme weather conditions that come with this journey, migrants must also cope with emotional stress. That is, being separated from family, traveling alone, and having a limited support system is also detrimental to the health and mental well-being of migrants.|$|R
5000|$|A {{meditation}} in {{vision and}} {{sound on the}} geography and history of Chile, structured around the water which permeates the country and gives life to its inhabitants, looking in particular at the fate of two persecuted groups: the indigenous people and the victims of Pinochet. Topics covered include: the far north of Chile, the most waterless place on earth, where radio telescopes in the desert discover more about the cosmos each day; a schoolfriend washed away by the sea; the lost culture of the native tribes in the far south and how their primitive way of life was destroyed; the story of Jemmy Button, taken from Tierra del Fuego to England; the efforts under Allende to rehabilitate the surviving tribespeople; the concentration camps set up under Pinochet; how inmates were tortured and how their bodies, weighted with lengths of rail, were dropped from helicopters into the Pacific; how one corpse was washed ashore; and finally how one of the lengths of <b>rail</b> <b>recovered</b> from the sea had a mother-of-pearl shirt button encrusted to it.|$|R
5000|$|A third example, NIR 106/CIÉ 227 was {{preserved}} privately {{and displayed}} at Cahirciveen, County Kerry http://users.chariot.net.au/~nldoncas/nicspages/images/train%206.JPG http://users.chariot.net.au/~nldoncas/nicspages/the_irish_crossleys.htm and carries the number C202, which was supposedly {{the number of}} the locomotive hauling the last train from Cahirciveen in 1960 but it was in fact both 227 and 201 which worked the last up and down trains. Irish <b>Rail</b> <b>recovered</b> the engine for reuse in its 141/181 class locomotives. This locomotive and its three remaining siblings were stored in a unprotected site on NIR. Metal theft at this stage rendered it and its sisters a write off as far as ever running again was concerned. Whilst scrapping of its sisters was taking place this locomotive was further stripped of almost all internal equipment (compressor, exhauster, air tanks, cooler fan, etc) before being moved to Cahirsiveen in 1997. The locomotive was cosmetically restored and repainted in silver and renumbered C202. The almost empty engine room was floored with plywood. While in Cahirsiveen the body suffered extensive corrosion from 7 years of open air display near the sea and its windows were smashed again.http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Q7YRTZ1pgDkJ:www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3%3Fca%3D9%26si%3D1443335%26issue_id%3D12810+c202+acard&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5 An arson attack on the locomotive as well as its [...] "eye sore" [...] appearance on the landscape meant that scrapping was becoming very likely. In around 2004, the locomotive was saved from scrapping {{by a member of the}} now defunct [...] "A15r sic Group and moved from Caherciveen to a site used by a heritage railway, the Waterford and Suir Valley Railway, at Bilberry, Waterford with the intention of being restored as part of a scheme to reopen the New Ross railway. However, during her time in Bilberry the locomotive was further vandalised. The plywood floor was ripped up and any remaining traction motor cable was cut out by metal thieves. The locomotive also suffered further deterioration due to being stored in the open with rainwater entering through broken windows and rotten roof panels. In 2010, the locomotive was relocated to a more secure site near Kilmacow village, and traveled the 10 km journey to this premises in Kilmacow by road on a low loader. It is believed that the wish of the current owners is still that 227 will be restored at least cosmetically, but this seems unlikey. As of July 2016, the locomotive remained in its derelict state at the Kilmacow site along with several other Bord na Mona locomotives and a Wickham inspection car.|$|R
