500|$|The video {{begins with}} footage of Frankie Sandford {{sitting in a}} tree; Mollie King is show <b>riding</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> along a dustry road; while Vanessa White is leaning against {{the walls of a}} {{crumbling}} building; the camera flies past Rochelle Wiseman, who stands on the beach by the water's edge and Una Healy drives a convertible car along a dusty road. As the chorus plays for the first time, the cameras follow the girls as they respectively walk around their surroundings, bar Sandford who remains in the tree and White who does not move from her spot. In the verse following, King is sitting by the road side with her bike and Wiseman is seen sitting on the rocks near the water's edge. Then as the chorus breaks for the second time the girls are seen dancing a choreographed routine on a sandy beach. Each is wearing a flowing maxi dress (see image alongside). The interspliced scenes of Sandford walking through trees gained a mention in The Daily Mail. [...] "Sandford is seen wearing a cropped white top and white shorts, Frankie walks casually through a field in the video, seemingly unaware of the attention her astonishing six pack is receiving." [...] The song's bridge mainly focusses on footage of the girls at a beach party dancing to the DJ, while the final run of the chorus sees the camera rotate around the girls as they dance on the beach. There is a brief view of the seaside villas in the background. It ends by showing the footage from the scenes {{at the start of the}} video, showing each of the girls in turn.|$|E
2500|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the recent [...] rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycle. A rider from Stockholm interviewed for {{an article about the}} phenomenon notes that <b>riding</b> <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> imparts a feeling of freedom to the rider. [...] One is free to go wherever one wants, whenever one wants. A sense of belonging is also important; as the rider says, [...] "all who cycle are my friends". Riders unknown to each other commonly greet each other when on bikes. As in many subcultures, this feeling of belonging is a key factor in recruiting and retaining participants.|$|E
