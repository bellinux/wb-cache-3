50|$|The GEBIK and GEBIF {{equations}} are {{the most}} generalized approach to describe isotopic effects in any chemical, catalytic reaction and biochemical reactions because they can describe isotopic effects in equilibrium reactions, kinetic chemical reactions and kinetic biochemical reactions. In the latter two cases, they can describe both stationary and non-stationary fractionation (i.e., variable and inverse fractionation). In general, isotopic effects depend {{on the number of}} reactants and on the number of combinations resulting from the number of substitutions in all reactants and products. Describing with accuracy isotopic effects, however, depends also on the specific rate law used to describe the chemical or biochemical reaction that produces isotopic effects. Normally, regardless of whether a reaction is purely chemical or whether it involves some enzyme of biological nature, the equations used to describe isotopic effects base on first-order kinetics. This approach systematically leads to isotopic effects that can be described by means of the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation.</b> In this case, isotopic effects will always be expressed as a constant, hence {{will not be able to}} describe isotopic effects in reactions where fractionation and enrichment are variable or inverse during the course of a reaction. Most chemical reactions do not follow first-order kinetics; neither biochemical reactions can normally be described with first-order kinetics. To properly describe isotopic effects in chemical or biochemical reactions, different approaches must be employed such as the use of Michaelis-Menten reaction order (for chemical reactions) or coupled Michaelis-Menten and Monod reaction orders (for biochemical reactions). However, conversely to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, GEBIK and GEBIF equations are solved under the hypothesis of non-steady state. This characteristic allows GEBIK and GEBIF to capture transient isotopic effects.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> is {{commonly}} applied {{to evaluate the}} extent of degradation at contaminated sites for which compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) data are available. However, it was shown recently that (i) the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> systematically underestimates the extent of biodegradation in physically heterogeneous systems, while (ii) it overestimates biodegradation if sorption-based carbon isotope fractionation is relevant. This paper further explores these two isotope effects not captured by the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> {{by means of a}} numerical modeling approach. The reactive multicomponent transport simulations show that the systematic underestimation is considerably larger for fringe-controlled and Monod-type degradation reactions than for previously assumed redox-insensitivefirst-orderdegradation kinetics, while forthe nonsteady state front portion of plumes, the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> may falsely indicate the occurrence of and/or overestimate biodegradation. The latter anomaly results from carbon isotope fractionation during sorption. It occurs for both supply-controlled degradation at the plume fringe and slow, reaction-controlled degradation inside the plume core.

40|$|Compound {{specific}} {{stable isotope}} analysis (CSIA) {{has been established}} as a viable tool for proving, characterizing and assessing degradation of organic pollutants within contaminated aquifers. The fractionation of stable isotopes during contaminant degradation leads to observable shifts in stable isotope ratios which can serve as an indicator for in situ pollutant degradation and allow for a quantitative assessment {{by means of the}} so-called Rayleigh (distillation) equation.

40|$|International audienceIn isotope geochemistry, the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} isotope ratios in a parent compound {{as a function of}} reaction progress, and associated equations describe isotope ratios in an instantaneous product and an accumulated product. The <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> is commonly used for fitting fractionation factors of processes undergoing kinetic isotope fractionation such as biochemical reactions. This work extends the equations associated with the <b>Rayleigh</b> <b>equation</b> for describing the isotope ratios in intermediate products in a chain of reacting species degrading with first-order kinetics. A general solution is presented for decay chains of any length, and explicit examples are presented for the biodegradation of a substrate or a mixture of substrates through 3 intermediate products to a final product. Applications of these analytical solutions for the fitting of enrichment factors for intermediate compounds in laboratory experiments are demonstrated with a spread-sheet. This avoids separate experiments to measure each intermediate product. The utility of the equations for the assessment of slopes in dual isotope plots is furthermore illustrated, and limitations of its use are critically discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
