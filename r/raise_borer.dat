25|$|The {{rescue effort}} by {{drilling}} was put off on Monday 1 May {{because of the}} danger of another collapse. It was decided to use a <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> anchored in concrete, with the last load of the concrete being delivered before dawn on Wednesday, 3 May 2006. The machine cut a horizontal tunnel one metre round. Later that day it was announced that the drilling to go the final 12 metres would commence within hours. At about 6:45 p.m., drilling of a 20cm pilot hole for the <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> commenced. Using the normal procedure for this machinery, a pilot hole was drilled, for the larger diameter borer to follow. This took more than three days to complete. According to Beaconsfield mine manager Matthew Gill, the quartz rock which was drilled through was 5 times harder than concrete. The drill was capable of drilling through it at 1 metre per hour, but it was going much more slowly because {{of the danger of}} further rock falls, at a rate of around 460 millimetres per hour.|$|E
25|$|As at 7 a.m. on Saturday 6 May the <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> had drilled about 11 metres of the 14.5 metre rescue tunnel. The mine {{decided on}} the {{shortened}} route late on Friday night. The major drilling operation was completed by 6 p.m. on Saturday, {{with only a few}} metres remaining to reach the trapped miners. Several hours work dismantling and removing the boring machine from the escape tunnel were required before the final phase of the rescue commenced.|$|E
25|$|Used an Australian built Strata 950 model <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> type {{drilling}} rig {{often used to}} create circular shafts between two levels of a mine without using explosives. Provided by South African mining company Murray & Roberts, the drill had recently finished creating a shaft for Codelco's Andina copper mine in Chile and was immediately transferred to the San José Mine. Since it weighed , the drill had to be shipped in pieces on a large truck convoy. The Strata 950 {{was the first of}} the three drills to begin boring an escape shaft. If the pilot hole had been completed, further drilling would have caused rock debris to fall down the hole, requiring the miners to remove several tons of debris.|$|E

50|$|The boxhole borer (or machine roger) is {{a variant}} of a <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> that is used when {{there is not enough}} space on the higher of the two levels to be connected. The boxhole borer is set up on the lower level, drills a pilot hole as a guide, then drives the reamer bit along the pilot hole from the lower level to the upper. Precautions have to be taken to {{redirect}} falling drill cuttings away from the machine, and to reinforce the drill string.|$|E
50|$|Plan A used an Australian built Strata 950 model <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> type {{drilling}} rig {{often used to}} create circular shafts between two levels of a mine {{without the use of}} explosives. The drill was provided by South African mining company Murray & Roberts, who had a recently idled machine in Chile for a separate mining contract. The drill had just finished a shaft for Codelco's Andina copper mine in Chile and was immediately transferred to San José. Since it weighed 31 ST, it needed to be shipped in pieces. The Strata 950 {{was the first of the}} three drills to begin boring an escape shaft.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> {{is set up}} on {{the upper}} level of the two levels to be connected, on an evenly laid {{platform}} (typically a concrete pad). A small-diameter hole (pilot hole) is drilled to the level required; the diameter of this hole is typically 230mm - 445mm (9" [...] - 17.5"), large enough to accommodate the drill string. Once the drill has broken into the opening on the target level, the bit is removed and a reamer head, of the required diameter of the excavation, is attached to the drill string and raised back towards the machine. The drill cuttings from the reamer head fall {{to the floor of the}} lower level. The finished raise has smooth walls and may not require rock bolting or other forms of ground support. The one of impressive use of raise boring is a 7.1 m diameter shafts for Sasol's Middelbult and Bosjesspruit Mines in South Africa. Masterdrilling is currently the world's biggest raise boring firm with operations throughout all 7 continents.|$|E
5000|$|Mining {{has always}} been done by {{underground}} methods. The exception was a small exploration in mixed method (glory holes) for tin in Vale de Ermida in the 50s. The extraction galleries are horizontal and since the junction of the two main historical exploration areas (Panasqueira and Barroca Grande) with the Main Gallery of Barroca Grande; that it is called Level 0. Level 1 was then traced and then Level 2 and Level 3. The distance between these levels is 60m as previously the opening systems of the chimneys (raises) were complex and dangerous. With the acquisition in 1974 of a <b>Raise</b> <b>Borer</b> the distance between levels (Level 3) increased to 90m. There is a drainage level at the mine (Level 530), 30m below Level 2 where in past mining was also done. All the drainage from the mine leaves through this gallery. Upper-level water runs by gravity while runoff waters below the drainage level are routed to a pumping station installed below Level 3 of the mine. Horizontally the galleries of the various levels form an orthogonal mesh in which galleries roughly N-S are called [...] "pannels" [...] and galleries roughly E-W are called [...] "drives".|$|E
40|$|SAIPEM {{has been}} awarded the engineering, {{procurement}} and construction of "El Encino - Topolobampo" Natural Gas Pipeline Project in Mexico. The 30 " pipeline begins in El Encino, {{in the state of}} Chihuahua, and terminates in Topolobampo, in the state of Sinaloa. It runs in a West-South West direction perpendicularly crossing the "Sierra Madre Occidental", a mountain range characterized by uneven morphology with deep and narrow valleys and steep slopes. Near the village of Santa Matilde, before reaching the Chinipas River, the pipeline route has to overcome a 150 meters high steep slope {{on the left side of}} the valley of Chinipas. This slope features a sub vertical rocky cliff with a 55 meters drop in the upper section. A trenchless crossing of the slope was designed and executed to safely cross the steep slope by means of <b>raise</b> <b>borer</b> and tunnel. Since the area was nearly inaccessible, SAIPEM, for the first time in the design of a trenchless crossing of slopes, has performed the geomechanical study using a remote sensing process based on the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the outcrop of the cliff. The activity has been carried out in collaboration with the Department of Earth, Life and Environmental Science of the University of Urbino. The results of the study led to the optimization of the trenchless geometry maintaining the raise bore into the competent rock avoiding frequent lithological variations critical during the drilling and identifying a suitable tunnel entrance location...|$|E
