The study was conducted in a multispecialty tertiary care clinic. All 18 patients had a unilateral intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma, without serviceable hearing in the affected ear and severely handicapped by attacks of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> and constant dizziness. Despite an initial conservative treatment, extensive vestibular rehabilitation exercises, translabyrinthine surgery was performed because of the disabling character of the vertigo, which considerably continued to affect the patients' quality of life. Preoperative and postoperative quality of life using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (Short Form- 36) scores and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores. A total of 17 patients (94 %) completed the questionnaire preoperatively and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. All Short Form- 36 scales of the studied patients scored significantly lower when compared with the healthy Dutch control sample (P < 0. 05). There was a significant improvement of DHI total scores and Short Form- 36 scales on physical and social functioning, role-physical functioning, role-emotional functioning, mental health and general health at 12 months after surgery when compared with preoperative scores (P < 0. 05). Vestibular schwannoma patients with disabling vertigo, experience significant reduced quality of life when compared with a healthy Dutch population. Translabyrinthine tumour removal significantly improved the patients' quality of life.

40|$|Hypothesis: Triple {{semicircular canal}} {{occlusion}} will eliminate rotatory stimulation to the vestibular peripheral system (as it blocks endolymphatic fluid movement) and therefore release <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> attack.

Background: Semicircular canal occlusion {{has been used}} as an alternative treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with varied success. Triple semicircular canal occlusion in animal models blocks the responses of the semicircular canals to rotation and spares cochleae and the otolithic apparatus. This result suggests that triple semicircular canal occlusion is a prospective method in vertigo management for patients with Ménière’s disease.

The link between the vibratory energy and the vestibular response takes place in the saccule which is located between choclea and utriculus on one side and semicircular canals on the other side.

40|$|A 34 -year-old man had {{a history}} of short-lasting episodes of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> {{followed}} by severe headache, provoked by sudden movements of the head and body.

Colloid cysts are rare, benign tumours accounting for 0. 5 - 1. 0 % of all primary brain tumours. They are attached by a stalklike appendage to the roof of the third ventricle between the fornices. Typical symptoms include intermittent headache, vomiting, occasional dizziness and blurred vision. These symptoms may be secondary to intermittent obstruction of cerebrospinal-fluid outflow through the foramen of Monro. The results of clinical and neurological examination are usually normal. In any patient with short-lasting episodes of severe headache, provoked by changes in position, an MRI of the brain should be done to exclude a colloid cyst.

40|$|Dizziness can be {{classified}} mainly into 4 types: vertigo, disequilibrium, presyncope, and lightheadedness. Among these types, vertigo is a sensation of movement or motion due to various causes. The main causes of peripheral vertigo are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), acute vestibular neuritis (AVN), and Meniere’s disease. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes of peripheral vertigo. It is characterized by brief episodes of mild to intense vertigo, which are triggered by specific changes in the position of the head. BPPV is diagnosed from the characteristic symptoms and by observing the nystagmus such as in the Dix-Hallpike test. BPPV is treated with several canalith repositioning procedures. AVN is the second most common cause of peripheral vertigo. Its key symptom is the acute onset of sustained <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> without hearing loss. It is treated with symptomatic therapy with antihistamines, anticholinergic agents, anti-dopaminergic agents, and gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing agents that are used for symptoms of acute vertigo. Meniere’s disease is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus. It is traditionally relieved with life-style modification, a low-salt diet, and prescription of diuretics. However, diag-nosis and treatment of the peripheral vertigo can be difficult without knowledge of BPPV, AVN, and Meniere’s disease.

Because infarcts in the {{territory of}} the 1 PICA have rarely been studied specifically, 10 patients with this type of infarct are reported. An 1 PICA infarct was isolated in only three patients, whereas it was associated with brainstem infarct in four, with occipital infarct in one, and with multiple infarcts in two patients. The most common symptom at onset was acute unsteadiness and gait ataxia without <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> (six patients). Unilateral cerebellar dysfunction was found in all patients, with limb ataxia (nine patients), dysdiadochokinesia (five patients), and ipsilateral body sway (four patients), but dysarthria and primary position nystagmus were notably absent.

Unlike other infarcts in the PICA territory, 1 PICA territory infarcts were mainly associated with vertebral artery atherosclerosis (six patients), whereas cardiac embolism was less common (three patients).

40|$|Introduction and objective: Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{is the most}} common peripheral vertigo, characterized by brief attacks of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> associated with nystagmus, which are elicited by specific changes in head position relative to gravity. The observation of positional nystagmus is essential for the diagnosis of BPPV. The treatment consists in maneuvers of canalith repositioning procedure to move otoconial debris from the affected semicircular canal to the utricle. These guidelines are intended for all who treat the BPPV in their work, with an intention to assist in the diagnosis and application of an appropriate therapeutic method. Method: The experience and analysis of different national and international consensus on BPPV, has allowed to a large group of ENT specialists of the Communities of Castilla y León, Cantabria and La Rioja (Spain), carry out this guide. Results: The different clinical entities are reviewed. BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal, horizontal canal and anterior canal, BPPV affecting several canals, atypical and central BPPV, subjective BPPV and the characteristics of this process in the elderly. Canalith repositioning procedures have been illustrated with explanatory drawings. Discussion and conclusions: Although the pathophysiology of BPPV is canalolithiasis comprising free-floating otoconial debris within the endolymph of a semicircular canal, or cupulolithiasis comprising otoconial debris adherent to the cupula, there are still many issues to be resolved. We think {{that the best way to}} find answers is part of using a common methodology in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Lindsay–Hemenway syndrome, {{also known}} as {{ischaemia}} of the anterior vestibular artery, was described in 1956 by J. R. Lindsay and W. G. Hemenway, although it was H. F. Schucknecht who discovered its vascular origin. It is a vertiginous syndrome associated with occlusion of the anterior vestibular artery. Ischaemic necrosis causes an acute long-lasting episode of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Subsequently, degeneration of the otolithic macula and the accumulation of disperse otoconia in the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal cause benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Material and methods: A comparative, prospective, multicentre clinical study was conducted from October 2013 to July 2014 at the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of Hospital Regional Dr. Valentín Gómez Farías, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, and Hospital General de Zapopan. Patients with Lindsay–Hemenway syndrome were identified and initially treated with vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Patients who did not improve after one month were treated using Semont's liberatory manoeuvre. The clinical outcome of the manoeuvre was classified as total cure, partial cure or no improvement.

40|$|Summary: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors {{include a}} diverse group of lesions {{characterized}} by inflammatory cell infiltration and variable fibrotic responses. Occurrence in the temporal bone is unusual. We present CT and MR imaging findings of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tu-mor of the temporal bone in a 26 -year-old patient with repeated paroxystic episodes of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> that oc-curred over a few days. CT and MR imaging revealed a homogeneously enhancing soft-tissue mass of the right mastoid with bone erosion of the tegmen and extensive dural thickening. The mass resembled a malignant tumor, and the patient underwent an extended mastoidectomy through a retroauricular approach. Microscopic examina-tion showed myofibroblastic spindle cells with mixed in-flammatory infiltrate, and the pathologic diagnosis was inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Earlier reports of inflammatory myofibroblastic tu-mor, also known as inflammatory pseudotumor, were confined to cases involving the lung or pleura (or both), until examples were described in the abdomen, skin and soft tissues, spleen, heart, bladder, upper respiratory tract, mediastinum, and kidney (1). In-flammatory myofibroblastic tumors {{of the head and neck}} occur most commonly in the orbits and rarely in the skull base. Other areas of involvement include the larynx, the paranasal sinuses, the cervical esophagus, and the soft tissues of the neck. They include a het-erogeneous group of lesions characterized by inflam-matory cell infiltration and variable fibrotic reaction. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are now a widely recognized entity with a generally favorable prognosis, although rare examples of malignant trans-formation and even distant metastases have occurred (2).

40|$|Transient {{ischemia}} due to {{a decrease}} in vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) induces the hypoxia of vestibular nucleus (VN) and frequently cause vertigo. Furthermore, it is occasionally experienced that dizziness continues {{in the long term}} after strong <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> in VBI. Since glutamate is thought {{to play an important role}} in the neurotransmission of VN, this study was undertaken to examine the effect of hypoxia on the VN neuron and the role of the glutamate in the hypoxia induced neuronal activities using electrophysiological and microiontophoretic technique. Cats anesthetized with α-chloralose were ventilated with a respirator. A silver recording microelectrode was inserted into the VN and the spontaneous firing of the neurons was continuously recorded on an ink-writing recorder through a spike counter. Micropipettes attached along the microelectrode were used for microiontophoretic application of 6, 7 -Dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX), non-NMDA receptor antagonist and (+) 5 -methyl-l 0,l 1 -dihydro- 5 H-dibenzo(a,d) cyclohepten- 5, 10 -imine (MK 801), NMDA receptor antagonist. The spontaneous firing in VN neurons increased transiently and then decreased, resulting in the disappearance in firings during 3 minutes inhalation of 5 %O 2. However, the firings appeared again and persistently increased after the cessation of 5 %O 2. Transient increase of the firing during hypoxia and persistent increase after the cessation of hypoxia were herein termed Hypoxic Depolarization (HD) and Post Hypoxic Potentiation (PHP), respectively. HD was significantly (P< 0. 01) suppressed by DNQX and MK 801. Since HD was suppressed by glutamate receptor antagonist, HD was assumed to be caused by excessive glutamate released from presynaptic terminals in the VN neurons. HD correlated significantly with PHP (R= 0. 609, p< 0. 01). We indicate that enhancement of PHP was the change of glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity caused by HD in the VN neurons. In conclusion, it is suggested that HD and PHP shown in this electrophysiological study might imply possible mechanism underlying the onset of acute vertigo and persistent dizziness in VBI. 博士（医学）・乙 1332 号・平成 26 年 3 月 17...|$|R

MethodsA prospective population-based study with a representative sample of older adults aged 65 years and over. A multidimensional questionnaire and a battery of measures were used for assessing physical function. ResultsThe prevalence of dizziness was 45 %. Vertigo was found in 70. 4 % of older adults with dizziness and 43. 8 % of them referred <b>vertigo</b> <b>crises</b> along life. A significant association was found between dizziness and female gender (p= 0. 004), memory difficulties complaints (p= 0. 015), bad health perception (p= 0. 001), depression (p< 0. 0001), five or more comorbidities (p= 0. 021), self-reported fatigue (p< 0. 0001), recurrent falls (p= 0. 001), excessive sleepiness (p= 0. 003), fear of falling (p< 0. 0001), left leg unipedal stance (p= 0. 002) and Short Performance Physical Battery score (p= 0. 009).

40|$|A 58 -year-old man is {{described}} who suffered transient cerebral ischaemic attacks when {{on a diet}} containing {{a large number of}} eggs. When the egg content and, therefore, the cholesterol content of the diet was reduced the attacks stopped. It was concluded that the variations in his cholesterol intake and in his serum cholesterol, which remained normal or near normal throughout, are relevant to the aetiology of his episodes of cerebral ischaemia and that further study of techniques designed to alter the cholesterol intake and the cholesterol level in patients with such attacks may be useful. Case report A 58 -year-old man gave a 4 -year history of recurrent and increasingly frequent attacks of transient left homonymous hemianopia, with occasional associated <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo,</b> occipital headache and partial amnesia. Each attack lasted for approximately 15 min and recovery was always complete. With the exception of intermittent claudi-cation, he was otherwise well and, in particular, did not suffer from migraine or any allergic disorders. Before consulting the authors, he had observed that his attacks did not occur if he refrained from eating eggs. An analysis of his diet revealed that his average daily energy intake was 18 - 5 kJ (4 4 kcal) and that he had a marked predeliction for cream cakes, fried foods and eggs. The diet was rich in carbohydrate, saturated fatty acids and cholesterol; indeed the average daily intake of the latter was 1035 mg, which is double the national average (Thompson, 1978). Eggs provided 65 % of the cholesterol intake, for each week he consumed 17 cooked eggs as well as a further 5 in cakes and prepared foods. Physical examination revealed a stable BP of 130 / 70 mmHg in both arms, with no variation on change of posture; a regular pulse of 65 /min and a normal heart. A soft right carotid bruit was audible.

40|$|Introduction: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a {{very common}} {{vestibular}} disorder characterized by brief but intense attacks of <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> triggered by simple rapid movement of the head. The integrity of the vestibular pathways can be assessed using tests such as digital vectoelectronystagmography (VENG) and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP). Aim: This study aimed to determine the VEMP findings with respect to latency, amplitude, and waveform peak to peak {{and the results of}} the oculomotor and vestibular components of VENG in patients with BPPV. Method: Although this otoneurological condition is quite common, little is known of the associated VEMP and VENG changes, making it important to research and describe these results. Results: We examined the records of 4438 patients and selected 35 charts after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 26 patients were women and 9 men. The average age at diagnosis was 52. 7 years, and the most prevalent physiological cause, accounting for 97. 3 % of cases, was ductolithiasis. There was a statistically significant association between normal hearing and mild contralateral sensorineural hearing loss. The results of the oculomotor tests were within the normal reference ranges for all subjects. Patients with BPPV exhibited symmetrical function of the semicircular canals in their synergistic pairs (p < 0. 001). The caloric test showed statistically normal responses from the lateral canals. The waveforms of all patients were adequate, but the VEMP results for the data-crossing maneuver with positive positioning showed a trend toward a relationship for the left ear Lp 13. There was also a trend towards an association between normal reflexes in the caloric test and the inter-peak VEMP of the left ear. It can be concluded that although there are some differences between the average levels of the VENG and VEMP results, these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of audiologic assessment, hearing thresholds, positioning maneuvers, and caloric tests have no effect on the quantitative results of VEMP. Additional research is warranted to establish the relationships among VENG, VEMP, and BPPV, especially as concerns the oculomotor tests...|$|R
40|$|Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are {{characterized}} by seizures involving a complex epileptogenic network including the temporal lobe and the closed neighboured structures such as the orbito-frontal cortex, the insula, the frontal and parietal operculum and the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are currently identified by means of intracerebral electrodes but whether their diagnosis can be suspected non-invasively has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this retrospective study was {{to address this issue}} in 80 consecutive patients who were thought to suffer from non-lesional temporal lobe seizures which finally proved, on the basis of stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG) recordings, to be 'purely' temporal (TL group, n = 58) or temporal 'plus' (T+ group, n = 22). Our results showed that the two groups of patients were difficult to differentiate on the basis of general clinical features or MRI data. Even the presence of hippocampal sclerosis did not distinguish the two groups. Conversely, both ictal clinical symptoms and scalp-EEG findings significantly differentiated TL from T+ patients. Patients with TL epilepsies more frequently presented an ability to warn at seizure onset (P = 0. 003), an abdominal aura (P = 0. 05), gestural automatisms (P = 0. 04) and a post-ictal amnesia (P = 0. 02). Patients suffering from T+ epilepsies more frequently had gustatory hallucinations (P = 0. 02), <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> (P = 0. 02) and auditory illusions (P = 0. 02) at seizure onset; they exhibited more frequently contraversive manifestations of the eyes and/or head (P = 0. 001), piloerection (P = 0. 03) and ipsilateral tonic motor signs (P = 0. 05), and they were more often dysphoric in the post-ictal phase (P = 0. 0001). Cluster analysis mainly indicated that some associations of symptoms were relevant for differentiating TL cases from T+ cases. Interictal EEG of T+ patients more frequently exhibited bilateral or precentral abnormalities, while ictal EEG more frequently pointed over the anterior frontal, temporo-parietal and precentral regions. Neither TL interictal spikes, nor TL ictal EEG onset, allowed us definitely to rule out the possibility of T+ epilepsies. Our findings may be useful for identifying, among patients suffering from 'atypical' non-lesional TL epilepsies, those who should undergo invasive recordings before surgery...|$|R
40|$|Vertigo of {{peripheral}} {{or central}} vestibular origin cannot yet fully be distinguished using neurotological diagnostics alone, as pathological test results can indicate different sites-of-origin. Therefore, comprehensive diagnostics should include neuroimaging. Peripheral vestibular disorders include the superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and Menière’s disease (MM) among others. In SCDS, a bony defect {{of the superior}} semicircular canal lining the middle cranial fossa influences the dynamics of inner ear fluids resulting in variable audiovestibular changes. MM is characterized by attacks of low frequency hearing loss, <b>rotatory</b> <b>vertigo</b> and tinnitus. Microvascular compression syndrome of the vestibulocochlear nerve (MVCS) is a central vestibular disorder. Due to the contact of the eighth cranial nerve to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), this neurovascular conflict can induce a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and vertigo. It was therefore the aim to ascertain possible criteria in neurotological diagnostics to better differentiate between those types of disorders. The PTA results of 64 patients, TEOAE results of 58 patients, cVEMP results of 38 patients as well as oVEMP results of 16 SCDS patients were analyzed. In addition, the clinical history of 123 patients at first consultation was recorded {{and the degree of}} the subjective complaints of 18 SCDS patients was perioperatively analyzed by means of a standardized questionnaire. Results showed in SCDS a SNHL in the mid-frequency range, whereas in MM a SNHL occurred in the high- and low-frequency range. Furthermore, SCDS patients showed an oVEMP deficit. MVCS patients showed normal hearing compared to their age group. Statistically significant differences in hearing loss were seen in MM compared to SCDS and to MVCS. TEOAE deficits were found significantly more often in MM patients due to the extent of SNHL compared to SCDS. No statistically significant differences in cVEMP results were found between the groups, but a higher variance in the amplitudes was seen in MM compared to SCDS and MVCS. 55 % of the SCDS patients who had undergone an occlusion of the superior semicircular canal, showed a moderate degree of subjective vertigo shortly after the operation. Three months postoperatively, there was a statistically significant improvement compared to the baseline. The hearing threshold remained unchanged after surgery. The cVEMP-Amplitudes were significantly reduced postoperatively compared to the baseline. 64 % of the SCDS patients showed an additional dehiscence of the roof of the tympanic cavity (“tegmen dehiscence”, TD). However, there was neither {{a significant difference in the}} degree of subjective experience of disease nor in the size of the dehiscence compared to SCDS patients without an additional TD...|$|R

AIM: To identify the prevalence of dizziness and its related factors {{in a sample of}} community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: A prospective population-based study with a representative sample of older adults aged 65 years and over. A multidimensional questionnaire and a battery of measures were used for assessing physical function. RESULTS: The prevalence of dizziness was 45 %. Vertigo was found in 70. 4 % of older adults with dizziness and 43. 8 % of them referred <b>vertigo</b> <b>crises</b> along life. A significant association was found between dizziness and female gender (p= 0. 004), memory difficulties complaints (p= 0. 015), bad health perception (p= 0. 001), depression (p< 0. 0001), five or more comorbidities (p= 0. 021), self-reported fatigue (p< 0. 0001), recurrent falls (p= 0. 001), excessive sleepiness (p= 0. 003), fear of falling (p< 0. 0001), left leg unipedal stance (p= 0. 002) and Short Performance Physical Battery score (p= 0. 009). CONCLUSION: Dizziness {{is a common}} complaint among older adults and it is associated with limiting clinical conditions, such as depression, fatigue, excessive sleepiness and impaired memory. It is highlighted the association between dizziness and recurrent falls, fear of falling and lower performance in physical function tests, which can restrict independence. These data suggest the importance of a multifactorial approach to dizziness in older adults...|$|R
