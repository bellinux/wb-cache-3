25|$|The north east {{area of the}} zoo {{is where}} many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the chimpanzees, okapis, jaguars, condors and Tropical Realm, there are {{enclosures}} for Congo buffalo, red river hogs and Lowland anoa. Nearby is a large paddock and house for the zoo's Rothschild's giraffe herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native sand lizards, and a mixed enclosure for <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassows</b> and Inca Jays.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Long-term {{monitoring}} of reintroduced individuals {{is a central}} component of many endangered species reintro-duction programs. Radio-telemetry techniques are rarely used to monitor reintroduced captive-bred Cracids and few data exist regarding possible adverse effects of radio-tagging Cracids. In this study, we identify an appropriate radio transmitter design and develop a suitable attachment method that minimizes anthropogenic influence and enables long-term, post-release monitoring (2 – 3 years) of reintroduced captive-bred <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Curassows</b> in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. We also review studies {{about the effects of}} different VHF radio transmitter models on survival, repro-duction, behavior, and physiology of Galliformes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present paper reports blood gas analysis, hematologic and micro bacteriologic {{information}} on four female <b>Red-billed</b> <b>curassows,</b> rescued from illegal wild animal trading, that were undergoing habilitation for reintroduction {{into the wild}} through Projeto Centrofauna/Botucatu-SP. There {{is a lack of}} physiological data on this species, endemic to the region of Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica), now under threat of extinction. This lack of information makes the clinical evaluation of these birds very difficult and has a direct and adverse effect on any of these birds received for medical treatment in hospitals, veterinary clinics and centers for research and conservation, as well as in reintroduction centers...|$|R
50|$|According to {{cladistic}} {{analysis of}} multisequence mtDNA data, the wattled curassow {{is the most}} ancient lineage of the southern Crax curassows. Its origins date back some 6-5.5 mya ago (Messinian, Late Miocene) when its ancestors became isolated in the western Amazon rainforest. Although a close relationship to the <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (C. blumenbachii) has been proposed, the wattled curassow {{seems to be a}} quite basal lineage without particularly close relatives. The similarity with the <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> seems to be mostly {{due to the fact that}} these are the most ancient species of the southern lineage, retaining more plesiomorphies. Though externally still fairly alike, the two species have vastly different calls and probably evolved, at about the same time, at opposite ends of the original southern Crax curassow's range.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{a largely}} ground-dwelling bird. It feeds on seeds, fruits, buds and small invertebrates. Males {{can be heard}} issuing their loud [...] "booms" [...] in September and October. Females lay a clutch of one to four eggs and the young are fledged {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
50|$|Protected {{birds in}} the reserve include red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus), ringed {{woodpecker}} (Celeus torquatus), black-headed berryeater (Carpornis melanocephala), <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax blumenbachii), banded cotinga (Cotinga maculata), band-tailed antwren (Myrmotherula urosticta) and the ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata).Other protected species include the jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), the fish Mimagoniates sylvicola and the ant Dinoponera lucida.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTReintroduction can be {{enhanced}} by data from long-term post-release monitoring, which allows for modeling opportunities such as population viability analysis (PVA). PVA-relevant data were gathered via long-term monitoring of reintroduced <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassows</b> at the Guapiaçu Ecological Reserve (REGUA), located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, over 25 months. In the present article, we (1) assess the robustness of the reintroduction plan, (2) evaluate {{the viability of the}} current reintroduced population, and (3) examine mitigation options to increase the viability of this population. VORTEX indicates that the initial plan, fully implemented, was likely to establish a viable population at REGUA. The current population is unviable; the best mitigation strategies are to eliminate hunting altogether, or at least reduce it by half, and to supplement ten immature pairs in 2015. A positive long-term outcome at REGUA is still possible; we encourage the Brazilian government and private stakeholders to consider population supplementation, both to achieve success at REGUA and to improve the evidence base for future reintroductions...|$|R

50|$|The Descobrimento National Park {{is in the}} Atlantic Forest biome.It {{holds an}} {{important}} fragment of Atlantic Forest of the northeast plateau of Brazil, {{and the most important}} wildlife refuge of the south of Bahia.Protected species in the park include the cougar (Puma concolor), the characid fish Mimagoniates sylvicola and the bird species ringed woodpecker (Celeus torquatus), black-headed berryeater (Carpornis melanocephala), <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax blumenbachii), banded cotinga (Cotinga maculata), band-tailed antwren (Myrmotherula urosticta), ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata) and striated softtail (Thripophaga macroura).|$|E
50|$|The park is classed as IUCN {{protected}} area category II (national park).The park's basic objective is preservation of natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty and enabling scientific research, environmental education, outdoor recreation and ecological tourism.Protected {{species in the}} park include jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax blumenbachii), Atlantic black-breasted woodpecker (Celeus tinnunculus), black-headed berryeater (Carpornis melanocephala), ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata), the fish Mimagoniates sylvicola and Rachoviscus graciliceps and the Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> has a {{very limited}} range in eastern Brazil and populations there are declining because of habitat loss and hunting. The virgin forest in which it lives has largely been {{converted}} to agricultural land and plantations, and the bird is only present now in reserves, and even here it is illegally hunted and captured for the bird trade. There has been a successful captive breeding programme but the International Union for Conservation of Nature rates its conservation status in the wild as [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> or red-knobbed curassow (Crax blumenbachii) is an {{endangered}} species of Cracid that is endemic to lowland Atlantic Forest in the states of Espírito Santo, Bahia and Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil. Its population is decreasing due to hunting and deforestation, and it has possibly been extirpated from Minas Gerais. It is currently being reintroduced to Rio de Janeiro by means of individuals bred in captivity. As suggested by its common name, the male has a largely red bill, but this is lacking in the female.|$|E
5000|$|... 175 {{bird species}} have been identified, {{including}} 27 that are endemic and six that are threatened.They include <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (Crax blumenbachii), red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha) and ochre-marked parakeet (Pyrrhura cruentata).9 species of small mammals have been recorded and 30 species of medium or large mammals. These include golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), golden-bellied capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and coastal black-handed titi (Callicebus melanochir).At least 45 species of endemic amphibians with limited distribution have been identified, including Hylomantis áspera,Eleutherodactylus bilineatus, Cycloramphus migueli and Hyla sibilata.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} a length of 82 to 92 cm. The male has pure black upper parts with a large black crest, and white underparts. There are bright red wattles and knobs {{at the base of}} the bill. The male can be distinguished from the wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) by being less bluish-black and from the black curassow (Crax alector) by being less purplish-black. The female lacks the wattles and has black upper parts, a black and white barred crest, reddish-brown wings barred and mottled with black, and reddish-brown or ochre underparts.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{look very}} much {{like those of the}} <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> (C. blumenbachii), whose males have only an indistinct maxilla knob. Its females have a blackish cere, rather pale legs and feet, and their wings - {{particularly}} the remiges - usually have distinct chestnut brown marbling. The black curassow subspecies C. alector erythrognatha, found north of the Solimões, has a cere like the wattled curassow female, but its bill is lighter and the crissum is white in both sexes. Young C. globulosa males are easily confused with those of the yellow-knobbed curassows (C. daubentoni), but the latter has a white tail-margin and yellow (not orange) bill wattle. All these similar species are allopatric however, with only C. a. erythrognatha occurring adjacent to the range of C. globulosa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6-5.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled curassow became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and black curassow lineages apparently took place around the Uquian - Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004) ...|$|E
40|$|Conflicts in {{conservation}} may arise if {{two or more}} threatened species are involved in prey-predator interaction. Predators may {{have a profound effect}} on small prey populations, thus conservation actions must consider inter-specific interactions involving threatened species. Here we report nest predation events on a wild population of the Endangered <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> Crax blumenbachii Spix, 1825 by a group of the Critically Endangered yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys Sapajus xanthosternosWied-Neuwied, 1820 in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This is the first study to report egg predation of an threatened gamebird by an threatened primate. We recommend that systematic conservation planning for these threatened species consider interactions, especially considering upcoming reintroduction programs indicated in the National Action Plans for these species conservation...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} Red-billed Currasow (Cray blumenbachii) in Vale Natural Reserve, Linhares, Espirito Santo State, Brazil, using camera traps. We found the <b>Red-billed</b> <b>Curassow</b> {{present in the}} entire area of the reserve (similar to 22, 000 ha) during 40 months of camera {{trapping}} (2005 - 2008). Most records were of single individuals, especially males, but pairs and even groups of individuals were also recorded. Males were paired with one and two females, suggesting polygyny in the species. The species was recorded throughout the day with one peak from 0500 to 0600 hrs and another after 1600 hrs. The daily activity pattern was similar for males and females. The number and widespread nature of the records suggests the local population of this species may be higher than previously thought. Received 10 March 2011. Accepted 5 December 2011. Vale S.

40|$|The Endangered <b>red-billed</b> <b>curassow</b> Crax blumenbachii is {{endemic to}} the lowland Atlantic Forest of Brazil and is extinct across {{most of its}} range {{as a result of}} habitat loss and hunting pressure. Global {{population}} estimates are unreliable as the species has never been surveyed systematically. During March 2012 –February 2013 we used line transects to estimate the density and size {{of one of the most}} important populations, in the Vale Nature Reserve. Using Distance we estimated a density of 1. 3 individuals per km 2; results stratified by sex indicated a male-skewed sex ratio. Data collected from motion-activated cameras confirmed that the population was male skewed but to a lesser degree than suggested by transect data. Sex-specific behavioural responses to the presence of an observer probably contributed to the difference between camera and transect data. Using the camera-derived sex ratios we corrected transect estimates to 1. 6 individuals per km 2 and a population of 325 individuals. Our systematic survey approach has revealed that Vale Nature Reserve has a larger population than previous estimates of the global population. We show that behavioural differences between the sexes in cryptic species can mislead population estimates, and we highlight the importance of motion-activated cameras as a tool for studying cryptic forest species.
