The micro EDM process can deliver small diameter bores of high accuracy, but due to its process principle the resulting bore edges are sharp. For fluidic applications, a round bore edge is advantageous, whereas the <b>rough</b> <b>bore</b> wall structure is ideally to be preserved. Conventional, e. g. fluidic grinding processes, can not separate the both.

40|$|AbstractDrilling Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) induces {{different}} material defects like delamination, burnt matrix material, <b>rough</b> <b>bore</b> channel surfaces, fibre pull-out and uncut fibres. Intensive {{research has}} been conducted to analyse the amount of defects caused, describing the surface and subsurface defects introduced by machining operations [1, 2]. Additionally, the mechanical strength of rivet joints has been analysed intensively [3]. However, the mechanical performance of rivet joints includes many influencing factors as different materials prepared with various machining processes are being joined. The presented study introduces five newly developed test rigs to analyse the mechanical performance of single bores in relation to different drilling and loading conditions. The setups are designed to focus either on the mechanical strength of the bore channel or the drill entrance or exit. The developed test rigs expand the capability to describe the workpiece quality after a drilling operation. The test rigs facilitate an efficient quality evaluation of drilling processes as well as the development of adapted drilling tools...|$|E

However, the way flow in <b>rough</b> <b>bore</b> flexible pipes differs from smooth pipe flow has not been widely investigated. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of flexible pipe roughness through both experimentation and modelling in order to determine if the current industry practice is valid for wall friction on a partially full liquid flow. The driver for this study is for better understanding of co-current gas-liquid flow regimes. Experiments were conducted in open channel flows of water. The flow rate and angle of inclination of the channel were modified to induce different flow regimes. The difference in depth of flow, a manifestation of the roughness, was measured and scrutinised. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed to compare with experimental observations. Both experiments and modelling results confirm the flow is affected by wall roughness and show that the roughness value which is currently assigned is not valid for low Reynolds number flows in partially filled pipelines. ...|$|E

2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for <b>rough</b> <b>boring</b> in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to realize a simple {{simulation}} tool, in order to predict the form defect of cylinder block bore liners in the moment of <b>rough</b> <b>boring</b> process. In this study a simple static FEM model, based on the cylinder block geometry, is proposed to predict the form defect of the bore liners in the moment of process. The simulation results put forward that the clamping condition plays an import role in the bore distortion. Consequently, optimizing the clamping pressure and its localization is critical, before cutting parameters adjustment, in line boring process. Experimental validation is performed in parallel with the simulation. The first correlation between experimentation and simulation results shows that the first influent factor which disturbs the correlation is the initial form defect of rough part due to the casting process. Integration of casting form defect in the simulation is crucial and should be taken into account in the next studies.

At nineteen, he made his first trip west, going to Montana, at first to buy a cattle operation then a mining interest but realized he did not have sufficient capital for either. In the American West of 1881, he saw the vast prairies, the quickly shrinking buffalo herds, the still unfenced cattle, and the last major confrontations of U.S. Cavalry and Native American tribes, scenes he had imagined since his childhood. He also hunted grizzly bears with Montague Stevens in New Mexico in 1895. Though the trip was undertaken as a lark, it gave Remington a more authentic view of the West than some of the later artists and writers who followed in his footsteps, such as N. C.

From that first trip, Harper's Weekly printed Remington's first published commercial effort, a re-drawing of a quick sketch on wrapping paper that he had mailed back East.

5000|$|Most metal {{produced}} by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is pasta-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The {{same is true of}} metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and hexagonal bar (usually called hex bar for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called [...] "bar" [...] in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and <b>rough</b> <b>boring.)</b> Also similar in concept, but not called [...] "bar", are the common structural shapes such as angle stock and channel stock.

5000|$|The {{family moved}} to Ogdensburg, New York when Remington was eleven and he {{attended}} Vermont Episcopal Institute, a church-run military school, where his father hoped discipline would rein in his son's lack of focus, and perhaps lead to a military career. Remington took his first drawing lessons at the Institute. He then transferred to another military school where his classmates found the young Remington to be a pleasant fellow, a bit careless and lazy, good-humored, and generous of spirit, but definitely not soldier material. He enjoyed making caricatures and silhouettes of his classmates. At sixteen, {{he wrote to his}} uncle of his modest ambitions, [...] "I never intend to do any great amount of labor. I have but one short life and do not aspire to wealth or fame in a degree which could only be obtained by an extraordinary effort on my part". He imagined a career for himself as a journalist, with art as a sideline.Remington attended the art school at Yale University, studying under John Henry Niemeyer. Remington was the only student in the first year. He found that football and boxing were more interesting than the formal art training, particularly drawing from casts and still life objects. He preferred action drawing and his first published illustration was a cartoon of a [...] "bandaged football player" [...] for the student newspaper Yale Courant. Though he was not a star player, his participation on the strong Yale football team was a great source of pride for Remington and his family. He left Yale in 1879 to tend to his ailing father who had tuberculosis. His father died a year later, at age fifty, receiving respectful recognition from the citizens of Ogdensburg. Remington's Uncle Mart secured a good paying clerical job for his nephew in Albany, New York and Remington would return home on weekends to see his girlfriend Eva Caten. After the rejection of his engagement proposal to Eva by her father, Remington became a reporter for his Uncle Mart's newspaper, then went on to other short-lived jobs.Living off his inheritance and modest work income, Remington refused to go back to art school and instead spent time camping and enjoying himself.

6000|$|Art was not demanded; {{and when}} used by Jonson, he {{complains}} {{it was not}} duly appreciated. Men of a middle rank were then probably worse educated than our mere vulgar. But the good old time <b>bore</b> <b>rough</b> and manly spirits, who came prepared with a tribute of tears and laughter, to bursts of pathos, or effusions of humour, although incapable of receiving the delights which a cultivated mind derives from the gradual developement of a story, the just dependence of its parts upon each other, the minute beauties of language, {{and the absence of}} every thing incongruous or indecorous. Dryden, on the other hand, wrote for a stage patronized by a monarch and his courtiers, who were professed judges of dramatic composition; while the rigour of religious prejudice, and perhaps a just abhorrence of the licentious turn of the drama, banished from the theatres a great proportion of the middle classes, always the most valuable part of an audience; because, with a certain degree of cultivation, they unite an unhacknied energy of feeling. Art, therefore, became, in the days of Dryden, not only a requisite qualification, but even the principal attribute of the dramatic poet. He was to address himself to the heads and judgments of his audience, on the acuteness of which they piqued themselves; not to their feelings, stupified, probably, by selfish dissipation. Even the acquisition and exercise of critical knowledge tends to blunt the sense of natural beauties, as a refined harmonist becomes indifferent to the strains of simple melody. Hence the sacrifices which Shakespeare made, without being aware, to the taste of his age, were amply compensated by his being called upon, and, as it were, compelled, by the nature of his audience, to rouse them with his thunder, and to melt them with his dew. I question much if the age of Charles II. would have borne the introduction of Othello or Falstaff. We may find something like Dryden's self-complacent opinion expressed by the editor of Corneille, where he civilly admits, [...] "Corneille etoit inegal comme Shakespeare, et plein de genie comme lui: mais le genie de Corneille etoit a celui de Shakespeare ce qu' un seigneur est a l'egard d'un homme de peuple, nÃ© avec le meme esprit que lui." [...] In other words, the works of the one retain the rough, bold tints of nature and originality, while those of the other are qualified by the artificial restraints which fashion imposes upon the homme de condition. It is, therefore, unjustly, that Dryden dwells so long on Shakespeare's irregularities, amongst which I cannot help suspecting he includes some of his greatest beauties. While we do not defend his quibbles and carwitchets, as Bibber would have termed them, we may rejoice that he purchased, at so slight a sacrifice, the power and privilege of launching into every subject with a liberty as unbounded as his genius; ...|$|R
