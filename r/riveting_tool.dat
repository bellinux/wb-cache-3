Future joining and assembling technologies are absolutely necessary to handle the multi-material combinations that occur. The paper focuses {{on the development of}} a new riveting technology. An innovative robot guided <b>riveting</b> <b>tool</b> has also been designed. Several further applications seem to be possible, e. g., clinching, blind riveting, screwing and friction-stir spot welding. Design matters are discussed as well as real test results.

40|$|The form {{drilling}} riveting is {{an advanced}} joining process of aluminum alloys. The {{purpose of this}} work is to made new type of form drilling – <b>riveting</b> <b>tool.</b> In addition, the effect of speed rate, feed rate and cone radius ratio on thrust, torque and heat generated were investigated. The significance of influence parameters on their quality characteristics were examined by ANOVA. The optimal combination of parameters for speed and feed were determined based on Signal to Noise ratio. Since the process has multiple performance characteristics, the grey relational analysis is used. The grey relational grade normalizes the contradicting performance indices. From eighteen experiments based on the orthogonal array of L 18 the best combination of parameters were found. Compared with Taguchi’s method the proposed method is more scientific. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method in this study effectively improves the machining performance of Form Riveting process...|$|E

Solid rivets consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or rivet gun. A rivet compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of <b>rivet.</b> This <b>tool</b> is mainly used on rivets close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The ESN 50 Self Piercing <b>Rivet</b> <b>Tool</b> is a {{wonderful}} replacement for 'drill and rivet' fastening, spot-welding and other means of fastening two sections of metal together. The main goal was to improve upon an existing design that is currently offered by the Textron Corporation. Textron is seeking an alternative energy source and an overall mild redesign of the ESN 50 device. The two most prominent faults are the ESN 50 's heavy design and a very slow cycle time. When this group was set up it was agreed upon that I would be the group leader and this would recreate the setting of a project manager in a real world situation. This paper covers topics about the changes required on this tool and additional topics such as project management, design theories and advice to future students that wish tackle a general design problem such as this one.

To this end, we introduce <b>RIVET,</b> a software <b>tool</b> for the visualization of 2 -D persistence modules, and present mathematical foundations for this <b>tool.</b> <b>RIVET</b> provides an interactive visualization of the barcodes of 1 -D affine slices of a 2 -D persistence module $M$. It also computes and visualizes the dimension of each vector space in $M$ and the bigraded Betti numbers of $M$.

We present an efficient algorithm for constructing this data structure and establish bounds on its complexity. Comment: 75 page...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} formal {{definition}} of design problem using the axiomatic theory of design modeling. Based {{on the concept}} of product system and an informal description of design problem, a design problem is formulated into three parts: environment, structural requirements, as well as performance requirements. On the basis of this formulation, both structural requirements and performance requirements are related to product environment, which is divided into natural, built, and human environments. As a result, product environment is identified as the source of product requirements. An environment-based formulation of design problem is thus developed. This formulation implies that both design problem and design solutions are included in a product system. The design governing equation is formulated to capture the interdependence relation between product problem and product descriptions along the design process. An example of <b>rivet</b> setting <b>tool</b> design is used to illustrate the mathematical formulations throughout the paper...|$|R

40|$|Clinching {{processes}} distinguish {{themselves by}} high economic flexibility and easy operation monitoring. These techniques allow the joining {{of different kinds}} of metal and newly developed aluminium and steel types without a thermal influence on the base material. Clinching in particular does not require any additional parts such as <b>rivets.</b> Moreover, one <b>tool</b> set is suitable for different kinds of materials and thicknesses. For these reasons, joining by clinching is used in many different areas of sheet metal processing industries. There is, however, at least one disadvantage concerning clinch connections: the protrusion on the die-sided sheet metal, which is basically process-induced. Therefore, this kind of connection is not applicable for exposed surfaces and functional areas. This paper deals with the simulation based development of a one-sided completely flat connection joined by a one-step forming process. With this newly investigated flatclinch connection it is possible to expand the application range of joining by forming processes, especially for lightweight construction materials...|$|R
40|$|As {{computer}} systems {{continue to grow}} rapidly in both complexity and scale, developers need tools {{to help them understand}} the behavior and performance of these systems. While information visualization is a promising technique, most existing {{computer systems}} visualizations have focused on very specific problems and data sources, limiting their applicability. This dissertation introduces Rivet, a general-purpose environment for the development of computer systems visualizations. Rivet can be used for both real-time and post-mortem analyses of data {{from a wide variety of}} sources. The modular architecture of Rivet enables sophisticated visualizations to be assembled using simple building blocks representing the data, the visual representations, and the mappings between them. The implementation of Rivet enables the rapid prototyping of visualizations through a scripting language interface while still providing high-performance graphics and data management. The effectiveness of <b>Rivet</b> as a <b>tool</b> for computer systems analysis is demonstrated through a collection of case studies. Visualizations created using Rivet have been used to display: (a) line-by-line execution data from the SUIF Explorer interactive parallelizing compiler, enabling programmers to maximize the parallel speedups of their applications; (b) detailed memory system utilization data from the FlashPoint memory profiler, providing insights on both sequential and parallel program bottlenecks; (c) the behavior of applications running on superscalar processors, allowing developers to take full advantage of these complex CPUs; and (d) the real-time performance of computer systems and clusters, drawing attention to interesting or anomalous behavior. In addition to these focused examples, Rivet has been also used in co [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sheet metal workers {{operating}} rivet {{bucking bars}} {{are at risk}} of developing hand and wrist musculoskeletal disorders associated with exposures to hand-transmitted vibrations and forceful exertions required to operate these hand tools. New bucking bar technologies have been introduced in efforts to reduce workplace vibration exposures to these workers. However, the efficacy of these new bucking bar designs has not been well documented. While there are standardized laboratory-based methodologies for assessing the vibration emissions of many types of powered hand tools, no such standard exists for rivet bucking bars. Therefore, this study included the development of a laboratory-based method for assessing bucking bar vibrations which utilizes a simulated riveting task. With this method, this study evaluated three traditional steel bucking bars, three similarly shaped tungsten alloy bars, and three bars featuring spring-dampeners. For comparison the bucking bar vibrations were also assessed during three typical riveting tasks at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The bucking bars were rank-ordered in terms of unweighted and frequency-weighted acceleration measured at the hand-tool interface. The results suggest that the developed laboratory method is a reasonable technique for ranking bucking bar vibration emissions; the lab-based riveting simulations produced similar rankings to the workplace rankings. However, the laboratory-based acceleration averages were considerably lower than the workplace measurements. These observations suggest that the laboratory test results are acceptable for comparing and screening bucking bars, but the laboratory measurements should not be directly used for assessing the risk of workplace bucking bar vibration exposures. The newer bucking bar technologies exhibited significantly reduced vibrations compared to the traditional steel bars. The results of this study, together with other information such as <b>rivet</b> quality, productivity, <b>tool</b> weight, comfort, worker acceptance, and initial cost {{can be used to make}} informed bucking bar selections.
