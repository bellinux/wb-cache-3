She had lit the <b>room</b> <b>lamp,</b> turning {{the crack in the}} globe to the wall. The {{sheepskin}} hearthrug, which was generally carefully packed away beneath the bed, had been spread out before the empty fireplace, and Jess was on the arm-chair hurriedly putting on her grand black mutch with the pink flowers.|$|E

3000|$|In Hochparterre (Mezzanine) {{we see a}} {{sofa and}} a living <b>room</b> <b>lamp.</b> They are angled towards a {{mezzanine}} floor window hung with curtains conspicuously installed not inside but outside. In this semi-public domain that plays with interior and exterior, a young blonde woman appears at the window. As soon as she has pushed the curtains aside, she starts moving her lips and reenacting each resident’s identity through an edited collection of interviews with {{people living in the}} neighborhood heard from the loudspeakers. There are young Turks sighing about disadvantaged Germans, followed by longtime residents complaining of the lack of proper beer bars where one can ‘still smack the waitress on the butt, if she lets you’. The actress Joanna Praml does not miss a second within this nine minute-long performance of lip syncing and acting all these roles, switching between brash and insolent, shy and forward, male and female, young and old. She lip syncs different languages while leaning out of an open window on the elevated ground floor, unifying the diverse views expressed by the neighborhood, from the Turkish migrant who says, ‘It’s not that nice here, but we got used to it. Of course, it’s not like your home country, but we got used to it,’ to statements such as ‘They are all Turks, but very very nice.’ [...]...|$|E

50|$|Emerald Station is {{situated}} on the Puffing Billy Railway in Victoria, Australia. It was opened with the Railway on 18 December 1900 and comprised a platform track and a loop siding. A passing loop was added between the two a few years later. There was also a spur siding off the Down end of No. 3 Road. Two standard 12 ft by 20 ft timber portable station buildings with a Van Goods Shed between (all adjoining) were provided on the platform and a Goods Shed on the No. 3 Road loop siding. Other buildings included Tea <b>Rooms,</b> <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> and toilets along with a cattle race and loading bank. The station building was later reduced in length {{by one of the}} portables which housed the General and Ladies' waiting rooms.|$|R
50|$|Women of the {{community}} volunteered and raised money for any extra help the hospital may need, along {{with the needs of}} the patients. This started in 1949, when local women stopped raising money for the Red Cross and instead devoted their time and attention to helping and giving back to their own community. Fundraising from the women provided the hospital with many comforts, including sterilizers, clothes, operating tables, bookcases, <b>room</b> <b>lamps,</b> and many more items. This group of women have had many names throughout the years, but are currently known as the Ladies Auxiliary. Their dedication is still present in Montmartre today.|$|R

60|$|The Fordyces {{had thought}} of a prosecution, but the Winslows had {{powerful}} interest at Court in those corrupt times, and contrived to hush up the matter, {{as well as to}} win the suit in which the Fordyces attempted to prove that there was no right to will the property away. Bitter enmity remained between the families; they were always opposed in politics, and their animosity was fed by the belief which arose that at the anniversaries of her death the poor lady haunted the <b>rooms,</b> <b>lamp</b> in hand, wailing and lamenting. A duel had been fought on the subject between the heirs of the two families, resulting in the death of the young Winslow.|$|R

5000|$|Similar {{in style}} {{to the other}} Imperial Towers {{lighthouse}}s on Chantry Island, at Point Clark and on Griffith Island, the Cove Island lighthouse has 5 sets of stairs with 15 steps each, one set with 11 steps and the final curved iron stairway to the <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> has 9 steps (total: 95 steps). An iron door leads into the <b>lamp</b> <b>room.</b> The stone lightkeeper's cottage adjacent to the tower was built at the same time.

Keeping close to the house, he sauntered along until he reached the grated windows of the prison <b>room.</b> Three <b>lamps</b> were burning within, to enable the guard outside to watch the prisoners. He passed the two first windows; at the third a figure was standing. She shrank back as Bathurst stopped before it.|$|R
25|$|The theory {{behind its}} {{destruction}} {{was that the}} fire {{was caused by the}} spontaneous combustion of some rags soaked with a floor-cleaning compound containing turpentine and oil, which had been left in the <b>lamp</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A 1910 report had {{recommended}} a new station building at Kuranda {{on an island}} platform {{that could be made}} ornamental by planting trees. Vincent Price {{was in charge of the}} architectural section of the Railway Department's Chief Engineer's Office when the passenger station block, described by the Chief Engineer as [...] "after the style of a Swiss Chalet, the idea being to make Kuranda a show station", was designed in 1911. Modified plans were drawn in 1913-14, and included the main station building (with booking lobby, booking office, waiting shed, ladies' toilets, passage, refreshment room, kitchen, pantry, scullery and kitchen yard); a signal cabin; and a utilities block (with men's toilet, porter's room, store <b>room,</b> and <b>lamp</b> <b>room).</b> Each of these three buildings was constructed of precast concrete units, in a Federation style with a Marseilles terracotta tile roof.|$|R
50|$|On {{the third}} floor were the {{reception}} areas and private rooms for its royal inhabitants. The structural configuration {{is thought to have}} not changed since it was first built in the 7th century. Excavations have shown that the interior of the castle and rooms were quite lavish with elegantly carved decorations in the <b>rooms,</b> oil <b>lamps,</b> incense holders, and walls decorated with silks and brocades, and with bronze, gold and silver ornamentation.|$|R
