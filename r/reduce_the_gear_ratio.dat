50|$|<b>The</b> {{interior}} <b>reduced</b> button clutter {{by adding}} a 7-inch touchscreen with haptic feedback, an additional 8-inch screen is also standard. To reduce interior noise an acoustic (PVB layered) windshield, acoustic front door glass and thicker rear glass are used as well as triple sealed door openings. Advance package models include further noise reduction using a thicker carpet base layer and front fender liners. The seating H-point has been <b>reduced</b> and <b>the</b> steering <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 9% quicker for a more sporty feel. The MDX rides lower reducing its center of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{active safety}} {{features}} also include electronically controlled braking (ECB), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control (TRAC). The stability/traction control system, Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) (with disable button), incorporates Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB), Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS), Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Traction Control (TRC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) {{active safety systems}} with the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), Electric Power Steering (EPS) and Variable <b>Gear</b> <b>Ratio</b> Steering (VGRS) systems. VDIM integrates these systems to improve vehicle responsiveness to driver input and prevent loss of control. An Emergency Steering Assist system acts to minimize body roll and improve vehicle responsiveness in sudden maneuvers. This system <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> steering <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> and prompts <b>the</b> suspension to adopt stiffer settings, helping make emergency maneuvers more stable and controlled. Passive safety features include eight to ten standard airbags (depending on model, up to eleven with upgraded rear seats), passenger detection systems, front and rear crumple zones, three-point seatbelts with pretensioners and force limiters, and a reinforced steel body. Dual-stage driver and twin-chambered front passenger airbags, front knee airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, and Thorax-Abdomen-Pelvis (TAP) airbags are also installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a spring-loaded stack of thin disks on a central shaft. Around this are arranged other stacked disk packs {{on a number of}} planetary shafts, usually three. These shafts are mounted on swinging arms, so that they may be moved in and out together. The central disks are thin, with a thickened rim. The planet disks are tapered across their radius, at an included angle of around 3°. When the disks are intermeshed, they thus only contact at the rim of the central pack, no matter what the spacing of the shafts. These planetary disk packs have a gear meshing with a <b>gear</b> on <b>the</b> swing arms' fulcrum shafts, which in turn meshes with a central <b>gear,</b> used for <b>the</b> input drive. The central shaft is the output shaft and <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> is used as a reduction <b>gear.</b> When <b>the</b> disks are moved outwards, the central rim drives on the outside radius of the similar-sized tapered disks and the overall ratio is around 1:1. As the swing arms are moved inwards, the tapered disks are forced between the central rims against their spring-loading. The effective radius of the tapered disks is thus <b>reduced</b> and <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> is made in a variety of ratio ranges, typically from 3:1 to 10:1. Overall efficiency is good, greater than 90%.|$|R
40|$|One highly {{desirable}} characteristic of electrostatically driven microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) {{is that they}} consume very little power. The corresponding drawback is that the force they produce may be inadequate for many applications. It has previously been demonstrated that gear reduction units or microtransmissions can substantially increase the torque generated by microengines. Operating speed, however, is also <b>reduced</b> by <b>the</b> transmission <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Some applications require both high speed and high force. If this output is only required for a limited period of time, then energy could be stored in a mechanical system and rapidly released upon demand. We have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a high-density energy storage/rapid release system that accomplishes this task. Built using a 5 -level surface micromachining technology, the assembly closely resembles a medieval crossbow. Energy releases {{on the order of}} tens of nanojoules have already been demonstrated, and significantly higher energy systems are under development...|$|R
2500|$|A cyclist's legs produce power optimally {{within a}} narrow {{pedalling}} speed range, or cadence. Gearing can be optimized {{to use this}} narrow range as efficiently as possible. As in other types of transmissions, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is closely related to}} the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain of the bicycle. On single-speed bicycles and multi-speed bicycles using derailleur <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on <b>the</b> ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring to the number of teeth on the rear sprocket (cog). [...] For bicycles equipped with hub <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> also depends on <b>the</b> internal planetary <b>gears</b> within <b>the</b> hub. For a shaft-driven bicycle <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on <b>the</b> bevel <b>gears</b> used {{at each end of the}} shaft.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{transmission}} called a torque converter, or CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). The torque converter is essentially an automatic transmission that changes <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> according to <b>the</b> speed of the engine. When the engine is at low RPMs, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is at 1:x, depending on the ratio the torque converter has (This allows for more lower end torque). As the speed rises, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> changes to 1:1. As the higher end RPMs are reached, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> reaches X:1, which allows for a higher top speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the series}} transmission, <b>the</b> 1st <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 4.73 {{times that of}} <b>the</b> 5th <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> while in <b>the</b> {{close-ratio}} transmission <b>the</b> 1st <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 3.76 times that of <b>the</b> 5th <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Given that both transmissions have 5 gears, this {{is indicative of the}} latter transmission having <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> spaced closer together; hence, its being a close-ratio transmission.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> input <b>gear</b> in this {{gear train}} has 13 teeth and <b>the</b> idler <b>gear</b> has 21 teeth. Considering only these <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between <b>the</b> idler and <b>the</b> input <b>gear</b> can be {{calculated}} as if <b>the</b> idler <b>gear</b> was <b>the</b> output <b>gear.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> {{was lowered}} to 1:4.88.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> {{were also}} revised {{to match the}} engine upgrade.|$|R

30|$|We sampled all 5  mm cores at <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 : 24. For 12  mm cores, {{we started}} the bit at <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 : 24 and {{continued}} until the bit became stuck in the wood, which usually happened at the depth of about 22  cm at conifer sampling. Then we shifted <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> down to 1 : 118 and continued coring to the pith. The torque generated at this <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> was sufficient even when taking 12 -mm-thick 80 -cm-long cores from large Q. crispula. We could save significant amount of battery power by this gearshift because one battery could sample 7.0 and 4.7 C. deodara cores of 33 -cm length with and without the gearshift, respectively.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> third <b>gear</b> in <b>the</b> {{picture has}} 42 teeth. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between <b>the</b> idler and third gear is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence <b>the</b> final <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of <b>the</b> smallest <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>gear</b> turns one revolution, or {{for every one}} revolution of <b>the</b> smallest <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>gear</b> turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (<b>Gear</b> Reduction <b>Ratio</b> (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|R
50|$|A single-speed bicycle {{is a type}} of bicycle with {{a single}} <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> These {{bicycles}} are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>the</b> bicycle.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> ring <b>gear</b> is held {{stationary}} and <b>the</b> sun <b>gear</b> {{is used as}} the input, {{the planet}} carrier will be <b>the</b> output. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> {{in this case will}} be 1/(1 + N/N). This is <b>the</b> lowest <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> attainable with an epicyclic gear train. This type of gearing is sometimes used in tractors and construction equipment to provide high torque to the drive wheels.|$|R
50|$|A 1:10 {{dual speed}} focuser has a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 and R=4.5r. Thus the angular {{velocity}} ratio is actually 11. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> and velocity ratio {{should not be}} confused with each other.|$|R
25|$|Many modern {{bicycles}} have removable chainrings, {{to allow}} for replacement when worn, or to change <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> provided (although <b>the</b> change is limited).|$|R
50|$|In other words, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio,</b> or speed ratio, is {{inversely}} proportional to the radius of the pitch circle {{and the number of}} teeth of <b>the</b> input <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} this {{arrangement}} was that <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving <b>the</b> transmission. <b>Gear</b> <b>ratio</b> selection was accomplished not by [...] "changing gear" [...] in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or disconnect the engines from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil {{and the other three}} engines disconnected and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the one-way clutches, the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4:1. With two engines driving, <b>the</b> effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, <b>the</b> effective <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>the</b> transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it.|$|R

50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> between <b>the</b> input and output shafts. Note that in a {{sequence}} of <b>gears</b> chained together, <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> depends only {{on the number of}} teeth on the first and last <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> intermediate <b>gears,</b> regardless of their size, do not alter <b>the</b> overall <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>the</b> chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate <b>gear</b> reverses <b>the</b> direction of rotation of <b>the</b> final <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{means the}} input torque ΤA applied to <b>the</b> input <b>gear</b> GA and <b>the</b> output torque ΤB on <b>the</b> output <b>gear</b> GB are related by the ratiowhere R is <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> train.|$|R
25|$|The Song Shi {{description}} of <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> in Yan Su's chariot, {{and the numbers}} of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to <b>the</b> large horizontal <b>gear</b> wheel, and <b>the</b> track-width of the chariot equalled {{the diameter of the}} road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of <b>the</b> wheels. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> were appropriate for these dimensions.|$|R

2500|$|On some bicycles, {{there is}} only one <b>gear</b> and <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> is fixed.

5000|$|Chains {{are often}} {{narrower}} than belts, {{and this can}} {{make it easier to}} shift them to larger or smaller gears in order to vary <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Multi-speed bicycles with derailleurs make use of this.
