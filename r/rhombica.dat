Evidence from cultures suggests that cell size is {{a key factor in}} determining the extent of arsenic (III) & (V) stress of diatom, with relatively lesser effects of As (V) than As (III) on small cells. Cent percent growth inhibition was observed for large size group (Coscinodiscus radiatus, Surirella, Amphipleura, Thalassiothrix, Cyclotella and Thalassiosira decipiens) relative to smaller size group (Skeletonema cf. costatum, Navicula <b>rhombica,</b> Amphora hyaline, Nitzschia longissima except Thalassisira. Interspecies differences in As tolerance by diatom in the mangrove ecosystem indicates cell size could be only one factor contributing to these differences. The results show that 81. 7 % of total arsenic was uptaken from culture media originally amended with arsenic. Looking to the extreme tolerance and arsenic removal efficiency, application of the species with smaller cell size relative to the other tested diatom for bioremediation purpose can be envisaged...|$|E
40|$|Pennate diatoms are {{important}} contributors to primary production in freshwater and marine habitats. But {{the extent of}} their diversity, ecology, and evolution is still largely unknown. This is particularly evident among the clades of pennate diatoms without raphe slits, whose diversity is likely underestimated due to their small size and features that can be difficult to discern under light microscopy. In this study, we described five new araphid genera with eight new species based on morphological observations (light and electron microscopy) and molecular data (nuclear-encoded small subunit ribosomal RNA and chloroplast-encoded rbcL and psbC) : Serratifera varisterna, Hendeyella <b>rhombica,</b> H. dimeregrammopsis, H. lineata, Psammotaenia lanceolata, Castoridens striata, C. hyalina, and Cratericulifera shandongensis. We also transferred Dimeregramma dubium to Hendeyella dubia. Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular data revealed that all the newly established taxa fell into a monophyletic group, with Fragilariforma virescens located at the base. The group was composed by two subclades: one comprising Castoridens, Cratericulifera, and Plagiostriata, and the larger including also the rest of the new genera plus some of the smallest known diatoms, such as Nanofrustulum, Opephora, Pseudostaurosira, Staurosirella, and Staurosira {{with a high level of}} support.

40|$|The author {{investigated}} the diatoms in inland waters around Molodezhnaya Station and Mirny Station. Seven {{materials from the}} former station were collected by the 7 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition on February 4, 1966, and five materials from the latter station were collected by Dr T MATSUDA, Department of Polar Research, National Science Museum, in February 1965. Seven taxa of diatoms were found from two lakes around Molodezhnaya Station, and five {{of them could be}} identified. Of these five diatoms, Fragilanopsis antarctica and F. obhquecostata are Antarctic Ocean endemic species, and Navicula muticopsis is antarctic endemic species. From this fact, we can say that inland water diatoms around Molodezhnaya Station have a stronger cosmopolitan factor than an Antarctic factor. Ten taxa of diatoms were found in the five materials from around Mirny Station. Of them, Fragilanopsis curta, F. obhquecostata and F <b>rhombica</b> are Antarctic Ocean endemic species, and Navicula muticopsis v. muticopsis f muhcopsis and N. m v m f. munayi are Antarctic inland water endemic species. N. muticopsis v. muticopsis f. muticopsis, mentioned above, was dominant in two of the five materials, and Pinnulana boreahs which is a cosmopolitan species, was dominant in one material This fact suggests that the inland water diatom flora around Mirny Station has a strong Antarctic endemic factor as well as a strong cosmopolitan factor...|$|E

A total of 274 infrageneric taxa in 48 genera were recorded. The taxonomic composition observed was dominated by taxa from the genera Nitzschia, Gomphonema, Pinnularia, Navicula, Sellaphora and Eunotia. About a third of the taxa found could not be identified to the species level. From those unidentified morphodemes, two are described as new species, namely Brachysira altepetlensis and Sellaphora queretana. Furthermore, Eolimna <b>rhombica</b> is transferred to Sellaphora. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that specific conductivity and pH were the main environmental factors driving the community composition observed.

40|$|Saprotrophic fungi have a {{wide range}} of {{important}} ecological functions associated with nutrients and carbon cycling processes in leaf litter and soil. Functional diversity of some strains of filamentous fungi associated to leaf litter decay in the Mediterranean maquis was analysed and compared by means of BiologTM FF microplates. The aim of the study is the evaluation {{of the relationship between the}} potential activity showed by pure fungal isolates (in vitro) and their actual ecological role in the field. Fungal frequencies and occurrence during the trophic succession on the natural resource were studied and used as key for understanding the metabolic profiles obtained in vitro. This approach can clarify the role of some key fungal species in the decomposition process within natural ecosystems. The study was carried out in the Natural Reserve of Castel Volturno (Southern Italy) where litter bags of pure and mixed leaves of low maquis plant species were incubated in one-year field experiment. Fungal species were isolated from decaying leaves and identified. Many species were not easy to be isolated in fact their reproductive structures have a close physical relationship with the natural substrate. Thirteen of these fungal isolates (including Beltrania querna Harkn, B. <b>rhombica</b> Penz. and Circinotrichum maculiforme Nees.) were selected being representative of the relevant fungal community. Three categories of occurrence frequencies were used to group the fungal species. Moreover, three different sampling times were considered. Assemblages of fungal species based on their natural occurrence in the field were compared with their potential metabolic abilities by means of multivariate statistical analysis (Discriminant Analysis and ANOVA). Results showed that fungi, during the trophic successions, occurred on the natural resource with a frequency that was strongly related to their metabolic profile as expressed in vitro with Biolog FF plates. Fungi replaced one another on the natural substrate in space and time, and the relative abundances of each species changed together with the potential ability of utilising particular clusters of substrates. The possibility of utilizing different spatial and temporal trophic niches driven by succession give a likely explanation of the positive effects that an apparent redundance of fungal species can have on leaf litter decomposition...|$|E

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of diatom assemblages preserved in 52 {{samples from the}} Bellingshausen and the Amundsen Seas provides the first comprehensive view {{on the distribution of}} diatoms in surface sediments of the eastern and central Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. On a latitudinal transect along 120 °W, diatom valve accumulation rates (AR) reach maximum values (8 - 10 × 10 ** 8 valves m**- 2 yr**- 1) in a zone extending over ca. 900 km between the Antarctic Polar Front and the maximum average winter sea ice extent and exceed those ARs obtained from an eastern transect along 90 °W by one order of magnitude. Lowest diatom concentrations (1 - 3 × 10 ** 6 valves g**- 1) were encountered in sediments of the Sea Ice Zone, affected by winter and summer sea ice. The accumulation rate pattern of the most abundant diatom Fragilariopsis kerguelensis (> 50 % abundance in 47 samples) mirrors the pattern of the total diatom valve AR and the biogenic silica (BSi) AR, making F. kerguelensis the major contributor to the BSi preserved at the sea floor. Relative abundances of diatom species and species groups were statistically compared with a selection of environmental variables, such as the mean summer sea surface temperature and salinity, mean annual surface nutrient concentration (nitrate, phosphate, silicon), mean annual water column stratification, mixed layer depth in summer, and mean summer and winter sea ice concentrations. Polynomial canonical redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed the biogeographic distribution of diatom species had the strongest relationship with summer sea surface temperature (SSST) out of the nine tested environmental variables. This relationship accounted for 69. 6 % of the total variance of the diatom distribution, with 29. 7 % explained by the first gradient (significantly correlated to SSST with r** 2 = 0. 941) and 15. 6 % explained by the second gradient (correlated to both summer and winter sea ice and silicon concentration). Azpeitia tabularis, Hemidiscus cuneiformis and Roperia tesselata were associated with warmer water conditions (> 4 °C), whereas Fragilariopsis curta, F. separanda, F. <b>rhombica</b> and Thalassiosira gracilis were correlated with cold SSST (< 1. 5 °C). Under the second gradient relationship, Actinocyclus actinochilus and F. curta were the most important diatoms representative of the diatom distribution in relation to the observed mean summer and winter sea ice concentrations. Confirming these environmental relationships is crucial for the development of reference data sets used in quantitative estimations of palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic conditions with statistical methods. This new data set represents the first modernised treatment of diatom remains from the SE Pacific Ocean and generally supports the use of a circum-polar database for the determination of summer SST, sea ice and potentially biogenic silica distribution of the Southern Ocean back into the Late Quaternary...|$|E
