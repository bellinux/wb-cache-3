40|$|ABSTRACT: A general, {{asymmetric}} synthesis of amino acid derivatives is <b>reported.</b> <b>Masked</b> acyl cyanide (MAC) reagents are {{shown to be}} effective umpolung synthons for enantioselective additions to N-Boc-aldimines. The re-actions are catalyzed by a modified cinchona alkaloid, which can function as a bifunctional, hydrogen bonding catalyst, and afford adducts in excellent yields (90 − 98 %) and high enantioselectivities (up to 97. 5 : 2. 5 er). Unmasking the addition products gives acyl cyanide intermediates that are intercepted {{by a variety of}} nucleophiles to afford α-amino acid derivatives. Notably, the methodology provides an alternative method for peptide bond formation. Constituting the structural basis of peptides and proteins,α-amino acids continue to be at the forefront of chemical synthesis research. 1 The prevalence of natural and unnatura...|$|R

Lütjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the Scharnhorst captain {{was not able to}} communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which Lütjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now Lütjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, Lütjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since Hipper was known to be at sea, it was assumed she was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the Naiad <b>report</b> <b>masked</b> the German ships' presence.

30|$|Part of our {{interest}} in hyper-realistic masks stems from their use in security settings. At first sight, {{it is difficult to}} credit that a person wearing a full mask could board a plane unchallenged. How are we to make sense of such incidents? Do they reflect inattention {{on the part of the}} observer, or perhaps an unwillingness to confront the mask wearer? Or could it be that, in these situations, hyper-realistic masks are indistinguishable from real faces? In our experiments, almost no one <b>reported</b> noticing the <b>mask,</b> despite attending to the mask and answering several questions about its appearance. This was true for photographic images presented onscreen. It was also true for live confederates presented outdoors. The numbers are sobering. Of the 280 participants who viewed hyper-realistic masks in these studies (60 in Experiment 1; 60 in Experiment 2; 160 in Experiment 3), only two spontaneously <b>reported</b> the <b>mask</b> and only three more <b>reported</b> the <b>mask</b> following further prompting. Interestingly, all five of these participants viewed the mask live (Experiment 3) and at the closer viewing distance of 5  m. These are low detection rates. Evidently, the information available even in near-distance, live viewing (visual detail, 3 D form, motion) did not allow viewers to distinguish hyper-realistic masks from real faces with any generality. Nevertheless, the clustering of these few participants by viewing condition suggests that the available information may have some diagnostic value, above and beyond that which is available at longer viewing distances or in photographic presentations.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe used {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to visualize the cerebral processing of unseen masked words. Within the areas associated with conscious reading, masked words activated left extrastriate, fusiform and precentral areas. Furthermore, masked words reduced the amount of activation evoked by a subsequent conscious presentation of the same word. In the left fusiform gyrus, this repetition suppression phenomenon was independent of whether the prime and target shared the same case, indicating that case-independent information about letter strings was extracted unconsciously. In comparison to an unmasked situation, however, the activation evoked by masked words was drastically reduced and was undetectable in prefrontal and parietal areas, correlating with participants' inability to <b>report</b> the <b>masked</b> words...|$|R

40|$|This paper <b>reports</b> three <b>masked</b> priming {{experiments}} examining morphological priming with nonword primes, using {{targets that}} were incompletely {{represented in the}} primes due to a missing "e'' at the morpheme boundary (e. g., adorage-adore).

Priming was observed in both experiments relative to an orthographic control condition. Experiment 3 was a control experiment designed to show that targets in the morphological and orthographic form conditions {{of the first two}} experiments were equally susceptible to priming. Overall, our findings provide support for a form of morphemic decomposition that is based on the mere appearance of morphological complexity (e. g., Rastle, Davis, & New, 2004), and demonstrate that this form of morphemic decomposition is robust to regular orthographic alterations that occur in morphologically complex words...|$|R
