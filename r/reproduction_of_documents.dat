50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard character set, a rich set of graphic symbols and a comprehensive set of control characters were supported in teletex. The set of control characters helped in preparation and <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents.</b> In particular, they permitted the positioning of the printing element, specification of page orientation, left and right margins, vertical spacing {{and the use of}} underlining. The page control feature allowed standard A4 size papers to be used for receiving messages instead of the continuous stationery used in conventional telex systems.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> {{by and for}} {{libraries}} {{using new}} technologies naturally involved questions of copyright. The Joint Committee negotiated a [...] "gentlemen's agreement" [...] with the publishers covering what constituted fair use. Although it had no legal standing, the agreement guided library practice for the next 40 years and influenced the Copyright Act of 1976. The agreement (which was actually negotiated by Harry M. Lydenberg for the Joint Committee) fell short of Binkley's hope for coverage of teaching and research uses of materials: {{he said that it}} [...] "protects what libraries have done in the past, but not what they might do in the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{blueprint}} is {{a reproduction}} of a technical drawing, documenting an architecture or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> used in construction and industry. The blue-print process was characterized by light-colored lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey. [...] Various base materials {{have been used for}} blueprints. Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly. To combat this problem, printing on imitation vellum and, later, polyester film (Mylar) was implemented.|$|E

40|$|Digital text {{watermarking}} {{has been}} a popular way to discourage illicit <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> by embedding copyright information into them. This study presents two robust watermarking algorithms for the Chinese text image. One embeds watermark by modulating the character spacings {{and the other is}} based on the relative heights of characters in the same text line. In the embedding process, the characters are segmented firstly by projecting the image horizontally and then vertically. And the rough segmentation is refined according to the peculiarity of Chinese characters. Then on the basis of character segmentation algorithm, watermark embedding is achieved by shifting characters up or down (left or right). In the extracting process, pre-process operations such as the binarization and image deskewing algorithm are done first to reduce the impact caused by print-scan operation. Then the messages are extracted by comparing the character spacings or relative heights of characters. Experimental results show that the proposed methods possess high extraction accuracy under the tampering of print-scan operations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores user {{preference}} {{in the presentation}} and content of online archives in small, local institutions. To obtain data for this study, a collection from the Plumas County Museum in northern California was digitized, and three versions were presented on a custom-built test website: 1) a straightforward <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> in the collection; 2) a pairing of reproductions and typed transcripts; and 3) a selective, interpretive reproduction with supporting secondary material. Users {{with a variety of}} research backgrounds viewed the website and provided feedback through an anonymous, online survey. Google Analytics was also used to measure site traffic. During the five-week testing period, 25 complete surveys, five partial surveys, and traffic information from 183 unique users were gathered. Survey findings indicate that 46 percent of users found version 3 —the highly processed, highly contextualized presentation—most useful. When controlling for research experience, scholarly and professional users preferred the straightforward reproduction (version 1), while students and teachers preferred an enhanced presentation (versions 2 and 3). Avocational researchers did not show a clear preference. Site traffic showed a heavy concentration of users (68 %) from California, as well as users from 15 other states. These findings suggest that while local archives may be most relevant within their geographical range, digitization of collections can extend an archives’ usership more broadl...|$|E
40|$|The {{efforts of}} {{libraries}} and archival institutions in collecting and curating dispersed collections of original letters, journals, pictorial sources, and realia/artefacts are essential contributions towards research and scholarship. Recent technological advances in digitization offer important new possibilities in the <b>reproduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and images {{as well as}} enhanced access to dispersed institutional holdings. The Lachlan & Elizabeth Macquarie Archive (LEMA) is a co-operative inter-institutional website project based at Macquarie University Library, in partnership with key Australian and UK institutions. The aim of the LEMA Project {{is to create a}} digital research gateway to the writings of the Lachlan Macquarie (1761 - 1824), governor of New South Wales from 1810 - 1821 and his wife Elizabeth (1778 - 1835), and thereby assist in the study and analysis of their place in Australian and imperial history. The LEMA framework is designed to explore the personal and global contexts of the Macquaries through the use of full-text transcriptions of documentary sources, as well as contributing towards the identification and digital repatriation of personal objects associated with their lives. Pixels & Partnerships will discuss the history and infrastructure of the LEMA Project and examine how inter-institutional partnerships can be developed through reciprocity and resource sharing. It will assess the sustainability of such projects and discuss the viability and application of recent technologies in the development of digital research projects. 11 page(s...|$|E
