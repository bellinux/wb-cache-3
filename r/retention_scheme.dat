30|$|Worldwide, {{there are}} very few {{examples}} of effectively sealed barrages or water <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> in karst areas. Following the experience, conventional injection strategies may fail to seal the flow paths sustainably without a systematic pre-treatment. Such pre-treatment may be the systematic flushing of karst voids using water jets in a close-spaced grid of boreholes. Its aim must be that the grout encounters an “empty” pore system rather than a system partially filled with highly mobile constituents. An alternative is the construction of continuous sealing walls (like diaphragm panels) down from the ground surface. Compared with the present design, both alternatives would require a much higher effort in terms of time and costs. For the existing Gua Bribin barrage, the residual amount of bypassing water (6 – 10  l/min) roughly equals 0.4  % of the HPP’s design output and can, thus, be accepted. Compared to the amount of water used for energy generation by the PAT, this ratio is even distinctly smaller.|$|R

40|$|The book is {{an outcome}} of a {{symposium}} at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University intended to illustrate the range of approaches and disciplines that attend questions of water sensitive design. Contributors include landscape architects such as Diana Balmori of Balmori Associates New York, Glenn Allen of Hargreaves Associates in Massachusetts and the geographer Dr Michael W. Binford of the University of Florida. The chapter addresses watershed scale problems and how the concept of ‘restorative redevelopment’ was proposed and developed on the “Nine Mile Run Greenway project. ” Continuing his interest in interdisciplinary approaches to art and design, Collins engaged Pinkham, a water policy expert at Rocky Mountain Institute. They worked on the “Nine Mile Run” watershed to examine the potential for alternative approaches to land use and stormwater management. They assembled a national team of interdisciplinary experts with recognized expertise in art, stormwater, ecology, landscape design and public policy. The chapter describes the subsequent interdisciplinary design charrette that revealed new approaches to surface water and the policy issues that constrained such designs. Informed by stormwater regulations the project specified collaborative teams to work together developing innovative design, detention and <b>retention</b> <b>schemes.</b> Working from a specific construction budget, GIS maps, and onsite analysis the teams had to manage a ‘two year, 24 -hour storm’.

40|$|In an {{industry}} of {{many opportunities for}} carrier growth and diversity, an employee would focus on one organization because of various aspects based on his own perceptions. The behavior of an employee is influenced greatly by the culture. This can be the organizational culture {{as well as the}} National Culture. The more positively related these cultural aspects are against employee retention the stronger the impact on intention to stay. Previous studies have focused on national culture and organizational culture into greater extents and have identified key points on turnover strategies. This research fills the gap by incorporating both national and organizational culture and researching on a relationship with employee retention decisions focusing on the IT industry of Sri Lanka. The main objectives of the research were to identify if there exists a relationship between national culture and employee retention and Organizational culture and employee retention and to provide a list of strategic approaches to retain employees within the organization. An online questionnaire was distributed among a random sample of IT professionals working for multinational IT companies within Sri Lanka. The questionnaire consisted of items targeting at national and organizational dimensions retrieved from existing literature. After acquiring sufficient data, the data was analyzed using quantitative methods such as correlation analysis and regression analysis. The contribution of the research to theory is the study of the relationship between both national and organizational culture and employee retention in the context of Sri Lankan IT industry. It also provides strategies to improve employee retention within the IT firms applying them to Sri Lankan context. The results of the data analysis revealed that organizational cultural dimensions such as level of involvement and adaptability and national cultural dimensions such as individualism and collectivism and uncertainty avoidance have a relationship with employee retention. Therefore the employee <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> in IT firms need to focus on improving adaptability and allowing the employees to be involved in company activities.

40|$|MPH, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandPoor {{retention}} {{rates and}} a lack of human resource management capacity have led to a critical shortage of nurses and serious disparities in their distribution between urban and rural areas in Zambia. The Zambian government is faced with the challenge of developing <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> that address the most pressing needs of nurses in rural service. The aim of the study is to contribute to the body of work in Zambia that looks at the influence of non-financial incentives on the retention of nurses in rural areas. The study also aims to show what factors nurses think would keep them in rural posting. The objectives of this study are to determine the perceptions of nurses in two rural hospitals in the Copperbelt province of Zambia about non-financial incentives that could influence retention in rural areas and to determine which factors nurses perceive {{to be the most important}} for retention. The study design was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Forty nurses were conveniently sampled. Data was collected by means of structured interviews using a questionnaire and was analysed using stata 10. The majority of nurses strongly agreed that individual, institutional and local environmental factors play a significant role in retention. Factors identified as the most important for retention were motivation to work (n= 26), appreciation from the community (n= 33), ability to make decisions about work (n= 17), satisfactory accommodation (n= 32), availability of schools for children (n= 26), managable distance to work (n= 13), access to continuing education and iv professional development (n= 26), having good relationships with colleagues (n= 15) and, availability of essential equipment, tools and supplies (n= 14). Factors ranked first choice according to level of importance by the majority of nurses were satisfactory accommodation (n= 25), access to continuing education and professional development (n= 20) and motivation to work (n= 18). There are no straight forward answers to the problem of retention in rural areas. The development of appropriate strategies requires an understanding of the interaction of factors which influence nurses’ decisions to work in a rural and remote post. Successful retention strategies will require strengthening and upgrading of human resource management capacity.

40|$|Abstract Background The Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia is {{implementing}} {{an ambitious}} and rapid scale-up {{of health care}} services for the prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in public facilities. With support from the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, 38 830 service providers were trained, from early 2005 until December 2007, in HIV-related topics. Anecdotal evidence suggested high attrition rates of providers, but reliable quantitative data have been limited. Methods With that funding, Jhpiego supports a Training Information Monitoring System, which stores training information for all HIV/AIDS training events supported by the same funding source. Data forms were developed to capture information on providers' working status and were given to eight partners who collected data during routine site visits on individual providers about working status; if not working at the facility, date of and reason for leaving; and source of information. Results Data were collected on 1744 providers (59 % males) in 53 hospitals and 45 health centres in 10 regional and administrative states. The project found that 32. 6 % of the providers were no longer at the site, 57. 6 % are still working on HIV/AIDS services at the same facility where they were trained and 10. 4 % are at the facility, but not providing HIV/AIDS services. Of the providers not at the facility, the two largest groups were those who had left for further study (27. 6 %) {{and those who had}} gone to another public facility (17. 6 %). Of all physicians trained, 49. 2 % had left the facility. Regional and cadre variation was found, for example Gambella had the highest percent of providers no longer at the site (53. 7 %) while Harari had the highest percentage of providers still working on HIV/AIDS (71. 6 %). Conclusion Overall, the project found that the information in the Training Information Monitoring System can be used to track the working status of trained providers. Data generated from the project are being shared with key stakeholders and used for planning and monitoring the workforce, and partners have agreed to continue collecting data. The attrition rates found in this project imply an increased need to continue to conduct in-service training for HIV/AIDS in the short term. For long-term solutions, retention strategies should be developed and implemented, and opportunities to accelerate the incorporation of HIV/AIDS training in pre-service institutions should be explored. Further study on reasons why providers leave sites and why providers are not working on HIV at the sites where they were trained, in addition to our project findings, can provide valuable data for development of national and regional strategies and <b>retention</b> <b>schemes.</b> Project findings suggest that the development of national and region-specific human resources for health strategy and policies could address important human resources issues found in the project. </p...|$|R
40|$|Administrative {{exchange}} allocation {{has been}} common in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Steps to dismantle or modify these control mechanisms {{have been carried}} out through traditional schemes. The authors draw lessons from sub-Saharan Africa's historical experience useful both to African former socialist economies. Exchange regime reform should be given highest priority for its role in reducing anti-export bias. Although many sub-Saharan countries have attempted to reform their allocation mechanisms, only a few have made the transition to market allocation (virtually convertible currency, at least on the current account.) Failure to do so is the major shortcoming of most adjustment packages. Both gradual and rapid approaches have succeeded. On purely economic grounds (given the problems of such intermediate steps as auctions), speed is preferable but it is not always politically or institutionally feasible. The transition must be accompanied by a coherent set of fiscal and monetary policies and a willingness to allow the exchange rate to seek a true market-clearing level. Some lessons regarding the specific mechanisms, discussed in approximate order of their proximity to convertibility, are as follows. The most rudimentary transition mechanism is the own-funds scheme, which {{is no more than a}} beginning of reform. Own-funds schemes should be accompanied by liberalization of the rules governing exports, or illegal exports and the black market premium may increase. Export <b>retention</b> <b>schemes</b> can minimize the adverse effects on exporters of foreign exchange shortages, reduce the implicit export tax, and fund a legal private exchange market. But the retained funds must be saleable, the retention rates substantial, and traditional exports must be included to adequately fund the legal private exchange market. Open general licensing (OGL) and similar schemes can be a useful intermediate step in liberalizing import and exchange allocation regimes. But in practice the benefits are limited by two features. First, consumer goods competing with local production, whose imports were restricted the most, have usually been excluded, at least initially. Moreover, OGL has no endogenous price-setting mechanism for the exchange rate. The OGL rate should generally be connected to, but lower than, the parallel rate. An auction incorporates a pricing mechanism, which is an important advantage. But the pricing mechanism must be allowed to work, which has not always been the case. Auction rules should be clear (should not allow discretionary disqualification of bids, for example), should minimize participation costs, and allow wide participation. Marginal, rather than the more common Dutch, pricing system is preferred. The use of a reservation price may reduce volatility but may also impede the full disbursement of funds. The shortcomings of transitional schemes to dismantle or modify foreign exchange controls become more important the longer they are in place. A strong case can be made for avoiding delay in moving to full currency convertibility.
