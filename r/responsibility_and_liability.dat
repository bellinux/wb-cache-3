5000|$|Manufacturing {{regulations}} in the Treaty of Versailles (June 28, 1919) forbade Germany from developing heavy machine guns, but permitted machine pistols or submachine guns as a suitable weapon for police. This signaled {{the end of}} a 30-year cooperation between the Schmeissers and Bergmann as production was licensed to foreign weapons manufacturers. Schmeisser decided to continue work in weapons development. Together with his brother Hans Schmeisser, he created the [...] "Industriewerk Auhammer Koch und Co" [...] (Industrial Auhammer Koch and Company) in Suhl. Being at the end of World War I, he saw little business, and encumbered by the Treaty of Versailles, the future of the company was unclear. Schmeisser defied the treaty, working to continue development of automatic weapons. It was at this time that the company began cooperating with: C. G. Haenel Waffen- u. Fahrradfabrik Suhl (page in German at German WIKI), beginning a 20-year partnership. For the safety of his patents, Schmeisser created a second company under the name of [...] "Brothers Schmeisser" [...] in the summer of 1922. This shrewd tactic was to prevent the loss of his patents if Auhammer went bankrupt. In order to prevent bankruptcy on both sides, Auhammer and Haenel merged, with Haenel taking full <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> for Auhammer business affairs. Schmeisser's attorneys who settled the deal became active shareholders in the company. Before long, it was obvious that development of many types of automatic weapons was unaffected or even accelerated by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1928 Schmeisser released the MP-28, which was used extensively by the German police. Bayard signed an agreement with Schmeisser to manufacture and sell weapons to South Africa, China, Spain, and Japan. It is notable that these same weapons were used during the Spanish Civil War only 10 years later. Despite Schmeisser's success, the company often came within inches of bankruptcy.|$|E

40|$|The {{legal concept}} and the doctrinal theory of state <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> {{have been in}} the focus of public {{international}} law for a long while. By means of domestic legislation, national law-regardless of the relevance of the international legal framework-governs the system of civil liability within the area of civil law of each state. Whereas, as opposed to the framework of civil liability governed by diverse domestic rules, exclusively a standard regulation framed at an inter-state level can secure a uniform system of state liability. The issue of state responsibility for nuclear damages raises specific questions to be examined in the framework of general international regulations (e. g., Conventions adopted within the area of nuclear law) related to <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability.</b> Thus, answering or the clarification of these specific pivotal questions within the scope of public international law shall be our starting point, which may also entail the modification of the matter of state <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> (not only in the concerned branch of law) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a way to}} elaborate the ethical implications of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) as decided at COP 19 {{from the perspective of}} justice.

First, in order to fully understand the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> implied in the WIM, adaptation needs to be distinguished from loss and damage (L&D) {{on the basis of the}} different goals which should be attributed to adaptation and to L&D approaches. Second, the primary concern of the WIM should be compensatory justice. In case of climate L&D, three aspects of compensatory justice should be kept separate: corrective <b>liability,</b> remedial <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and</b> with regard to the resources available, fair remedy. Third, it is crucial to distinguish between recov-erable damage and irrecoverable or at least not fully recoverable loss. This distinction is crucial because it informs the principles of fair remedy and because damage and loss may differ in their relevance for the stability and functioning of a human system...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 93 - 98) Through mid- 1985, {{state and}} federal courts have not defined satisfactorily {{the application of the}} First and Fourteenth Constitutional Amendments to public school student newspaper publishing. The resulting gray area has created controversy and legal action which has inhibited the central educational purpose of teaching journalism production. This project attempts to address those problems by creating a well-defined lesson plan and syllabus for teaching student newspaper production at San Diego City College, a public community college in southern California. The plan proposes a teaching method which attempts to meet two seemingly diverse goals: 1) to satisfy to whatever extent possible both student and administrative concerns regarding Constitutionally guaranteed press freedoms, <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> 2) to create a positive educational experience which enables students to prepare for success in professional journalism careers. The project contains a daily lesson plan for an entire 16 -week semester; a syllabus which addresses legal issues and contains well-defined expectations, deadlines and measurements; an evaluation of the current college Course Outline with suggestions for improvement; lists of facilities, equipment and supplies aimed at meeting current and future technology; and an extensive bibliography including texts and references for classroom use...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{registered}} migrant labours (more than 2. 3 million in year 2013) send to Malaysia are being employed in various work sectors including construction, manufacturing, plantation, agriculture and services. While the source countries are from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, India, China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Vietnam. The fundamental concern is on migrant labours status because they remain {{the employees of}} those outsourcing companies and not the factories where they work. This is because work contract are made between the out sourcing companies and the factories owners (the employers) and not between the employees and the employers. This leaves great consequences on the employees.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the subject of}} {{analysis}} is semantic links of the concepts <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> to other categories of ethics. When analysing semantic links of the concepts <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>liability</b> to other categories of ethics, {{the aim is to}} ascertain the synonymy of the abovementioned concepts. The concept responsibility is most frequently used when a certain human feature is under discussion, and the concept liability – when the observance of legal requirements, a legal norm is under discussion. The conception of responsibility is the underlying category of ethics and law. It is close to concepts ”conscience”, “obligation”, “diligence”, „dignity“, and is related to the emotional reaction to do one’s duty. Responsibility manifests when a human being takes responsibility for own independent and sovereign actions. The concept liability made of the adverb liable is more often found in different texts than the concept responsibility, which describes a feature. It is the most general moral feature of a personality, which stimulates a careful action when doing own duties. Liability manifests as selfcontrol mechanism of a person. It implies a person‘s relationship to moral obligation...|$|E
