40|$|This study {{attempts}} to partially explain {{the characteristics of}} the human perceptual <b>remnant,</b> following Levison’s representation of the <b>remnant</b> as an equivalent observation noise. Eye activity parameters are recorded using an eye tracker in two compensatory tracking tasks in which the visual information is presented using either a first or second-order visual stimulus. Differences in the two conditions between <b>remnant</b> characteristics, eye activity measures and human operator model parameters are analyzed, using preliminary data from three subjects. Preliminary results show that the second-order visual stimulus introduces changes in both eye activity and <b>remnant</b> model parameters. Although high correlations are observed between <b>remnant</b> gain and blink frequency, between <b>remnant</b> break frequency and eye opening amplitude, and between <b>remnant</b> power and pupil diameter, a definitive conclusion about the perceptual <b>remnant</b> - eye activity characteristics relation cannot be drawn due to the small sample size of the obtained data. This preliminary study is a first step in identifying possible physiological parameters that affect the perceptual human <b>remnant.</b> Control & SimulationControl & Operation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the best}} objects for study of the structure, kinematics, and {{evolutionary}} status of a middle-aged supernova <b>remnant</b> (SNR) is the VELA SNR, due to its proximity, extensive optical filamentary structure, and an abundance of hot background stars for absorption line research. The VELA <b>remnant</b> is 7. 3 degrees in diameter, based on x-ray imagery with ROSAT, with the pulsar nearly centered in the <b>remnant.</b> The western region of the <b>remnant</b> has much lower x-ray surface brightness than {{the remainder of the}} <b>remnant</b> and in fact escaped earlier detection with previous instrumentation.

5000|$|Others have {{interpreted}} the <b>remnant</b> concept along sociological and political lines. For example, see <b>Remnant</b> and Republic: Adventist Themes for Personal and Social Ethics, edited by Charles W. Teel, Jr. It {{is argued that}} the <b>remnant</b> {{has a duty to}} work towards social and political reform. Some who espouse these views deny that the <b>remnant</b> is a religious body to be identified with any particular church. Rodriguez rejects such interpretations, asserting that they set aside [...] "the biblical understanding of the <b>remnant</b> as fundamentally a religious entity".|$|R
40|$|<b>Remnant</b> trees, spared from cutting when {{tropical}} forests are cleared for agriculture or grazing, act as nuclei of forest regeneration following field abandonment. Previous studies on <b>remnant</b> trees were primarily conducted in active pasture or old fields {{abandoned in the}} previous 2 - 3 years, and focused on structure and species richness of regenerating forest, but not species composition. Our study is {{among the first to}} investigate the effects of <b>remnant</b> trees on neighborhood forest structure, biodiversity, and species composition 20 years post-abandonment. We compared the woody vegetation around individual <b>remnant</b> trees to nearby plots without <b>remnant</b> trees in the same second-growth forests ("control plots"). Forest structure beneath <b>remnant</b> trees did not differ significantly from control plots. Species richness and species diversity were significantly higher around <b>remnant</b> trees. The species composition around <b>remnant</b> trees differed significantly from control plots and more closely resembled the species composition of nearby old-growth forest. The proportion of old-growth specialists and generalists around <b>remnant</b> trees was significantly greater than in control plots. Although previous studies show that <b>remnant</b> trees may initially accelerate secondary forest growth, we found no evidence that they locally affect stem density, basal area, and seedling density at later stages of regrowth. <b>Remnant</b> trees do, however, have a clear effect on the species diversity, composition, and ecological groups of the surrounding woody vegetation, even after 20 years of forest regeneration. To accelerate the return of diversity and old-growth forest species into regrowing forest on abandoned land, landowners should be encouraged to retain <b>remnant</b> trees in agricultural or pastoral fields. © 2014 Sandor, Chazdon...|$|R
