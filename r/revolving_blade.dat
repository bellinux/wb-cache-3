50|$|<b>Revolving</b> <b>blade</b> {{fans are}} made {{in a wide range}} of designs. They are used on the floor, table, desk, or hung from the ceiling. They can also be built into a window, wall, roof, chimney, etc. Most {{electronic}} systems such as computers include fans to cool circuits inside, and in appliances such as hair dryers and portable space heaters and mounted/installed wall heaters. They are also used for moving air in air-conditioning systems, and in automotive engines, where they are driven by belts or by direct motor. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient, but do not lower temperatures directly. Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by forcing hot air into the cooler environment outside the machine.|$|E

30|$|A {{vertical}} mixer of <b>revolving</b> <b>blades</b> type {{was used in}} mixing. Materials of the specified mix were weighed first and then mixed in the following procedures. Mixing different fiber types in hybrid combinations was really a challenge. The used fibers with widely varied aspect ratios are hard to blend together due to their different behavior during mixing. Polypropylene fibers representing high aspect ratio fiber (L/d =  167) should be mixed with the fine dry components.|$|R
40|$|The wake of {{wind energy}} rotors is modeled as a tip vortex helix with a vortex {{strength}} estimated from its rotor thrust. A fixed-wing sail plane and a helicopter whose rotor is {{represented as a}} fixed-wing circular disk (instead of rotating blades) are subjected to the wake. In both cases the roll moment induced by the wake is compared to the maximum roll control moment of the aircraft. For comparison with <b>revolving</b> <b>blades,</b> the blade element momentum theory {{is applied to the}} isolated rotor and a simulation of an entire helicopter is used also. It is found that typical on-shore power plants could be a hazard for sailplanes, but not for helicopters. Large off-shore wind energy converters, however, could even be a danger for small helicopters that may be used for maintenance...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{electric}} food processors was the Starmix, introduced by German company Electrostar in 1946. Although the basic unit resembled a simple blender, numerous accessories were available, including attachments for slicing bread, milk centrifuges and ice cream bowls. In a time when electric motors were expensive, they also developed the piccolo, where the food processor's base unit could drive a vacuum cleaner. In the 1960s, Albrecht von Goertz designed the Starmix MX3 food processor. Although the entire company was rebranded as Starmix in 1968 following {{the success of the}} processors, they later focused on vacuum cleaners and electric hand-dryers and the last mixer was produced around the year 2000. In France, the concept of a machine to process food began when a catering company salesman, Pierre Verdun, observed the large amount of time his clients spent in the kitchen chopping, shredding and mixing. He produced a simple but effective solution, a bowl with a <b>revolving</b> <b>blade</b> in the base. In 1960, this evolved into Robot-Coupe, a company established to manufacture commercial [...] "food processors" [...] for the catering industry. In the late 1960s, a commercial food processor driven by a powerful commercial induction motor was produced. The Magimix food processor arrived from France in the UK in 1974, beginning with the Model 1800. Then, a UK company Kenwood Limited started their own first Kenwood Food Processor, 'processor de- luxe,' in 1979.|$|E

Comparison is made between the test results for a two-blade arrangement and the theory. The comparison is made for sound pressures in {{the plane of the}} <b>revolving</b> <b>blades</b> for varying values of tip velocity. Comparison is also made at constant tip velocity for all values of azimuth angle B.

5000|$|A {{lawn mower}} (mower) is a machine {{utilizing}} {{one or more}} <b>revolving</b> <b>blades</b> to cut a grass surface to an even height. The height of the cut grass may be fixed by {{the design of the}} mower, but generally is adjustable by the operator, typically by a single master lever, or by a lever or nut and bolt on each of the machine's wheels. The blades may be powered by muscle, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades so that when the mower is pushed forward, the blades spin, or the machine may have a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common power source for lawn mowers is a small (typically one cylinder) internal combustion engine. Smaller mowers often lack any form of propulsion, requiring human power to move over a surface; [...] "walk-behind" [...] mowers are self-propelled, requiring a human only to walk behind and guide them. Larger lawn mowers are usually either self-propelled [...] "walk-behind" [...] types, or more often, are [...] "ride-on" [...] mowers, equipped so the operator can ride on the mower and control it. A robotic lawn mower ("lawn-mowing bot", [...] "mowbot", etc.) is designed to operate either entirely on its own, or less commonly by an operator by remote control.|$|R

The blade deformation measurement by itself was already a good target, but in order to give more value to such an activity an attempt to evaluate the installed propeller performance has been done. The idea was to relate the deformation with the thrust provided by the blade. So the load distribution on the blade was evaluated by means of CFD and hence a representative load was applied to the blade during a static test in order to validate the FEM model of the blade which was then used to relate the deformation with the thrust. One more step forward was also planned consisting in the evaluation of the possibility to investigate the effects of the exhaust investing the blade in terms of performance lost...|$|R

With the game's [...] "Body Damage System," [...] opponents are able to physically disable each other in increments with hits from an equipped weapon, slowing their attacking and running speed, or crippling their legs forcing them to crawl. Notably, the North American release of Bushido Blade had one minor graphical change: blood was added, replacing the yellow flash that appears during a fatal blow.|$|R
500|$|A {{large part}} of Archimedes' work in {{engineering}} arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks of the AIM project was to measure the deformation of a fast <b>revolving</b> propeller <b>blade</b> during flight by using the QVT (Quantitative Video Technique) and the IPCT (Image Pattern Correlation Technique). In {{order to be able to}} perform such a measurement, Piaggio and DLR worked together closely to solve the major problems to record images of the blade in a high quality to be processed with IPCT. Where to install the camera(s), how to illuminate the blade and how to trigger the camera and consequently the illumination device, were important questions to be answered before the test. The blade deformation measurement by itself was already a demanding target, but in order to give more value to such an activity one more step forward was also planned consisting in the evaluation of the possibility to investigate the effects of the exhaust impinging on the blade in terms of performance lost. Therefore, the recording system was designed so that it was possible to take recordings with a freely adjustable phase angle. Due to present problems with the triggering system it was not possible to make this evaluation. Nevertheless, in-flight propeller blade deformation measurements have been performed for one phase angle and for different flight conditions. In this contribution, the measurement task and the measurement setup are described briefly followed by the results of the performed ground tests and the executed flight tests...|$|R

After Kongo is very reluctant to not join under Dearth Voyd and has begun a new journey with Sanzoh, Voyd becomes rather uneasy. At the end of the series, Dearth Voyd noted that he will take out Kongo himself, in which he will finally be physically seen for the first time.

40|$|Abstract. During {{helicopter}} forward flight, {{the retreating}} <b>blade</b> <b>revolves</b> at high {{angle of attack}} compared to advancing blade in order to balance the lift and also to stabilise the helicopter. However, due to the aerodynamics limitations of the retreating blade at forward flight, stall may occur at high angle of attack compared with the advancing blade. This phenomenon is dangerous for pilot when controlling and balancing the helicopter while flying against strong wind. This paper investigates the capabilities of introducing multiple vortex traps on the upper surface of the helicopter airfoil in order to delay the stall angle of retreating helicopter blade. Blade Element Theory (BET) was applied to scrutinize the lift force along the helicopter blade. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyses using the Shear-Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was carried out to investigate the effect of groove on delaying the stall and to predict the separation of flow over the airfoil. Based on the CFD analyses, the optimization of the groove was done by analyzing the numbers and locations of the grooves. Finally, the results from both BET and the CFD analyses were utilised to obtain the lift force achieved by the vortex trap. The study showed {{that the presence of}} multiple vortex traps has successfully increased the lift coefficient and most importantly, delaying the stall angle...|$|R
40|$|A {{new twist}} on an age-old {{approach}} spells trouble for weeds in lowland rice fields. IRRI researchers have now combined the basic uprooting and burying action of a traditional, pronged lowland paddy-puddlerwith a completely reconfigured design utilizing pairs of <b>bladed,</b> <b>revolving</b> cones {{to produce a}} new family of light-weight, effective, and easily fabricated rolling weeders. The range of machines (including one- and two-row models that are pushed, animal drawn or mounted on power tiller mounted units) was introduced by IRRI in 1986. Because the blades on their conical rotors penetrate only the top 3 cm of soil, the 'cono-weeders' are 'two to four times more efficient' than conventional rotary weeders. The basic one-row cono weeder mounts two conical rotors in tandem, but with opposite orientation. The two opposite rotors cause significant horizontal soil movement and deliver uniform action across their 12 cm width {{in a single pass}} of steady forward movement. A single-row, all steel weeder weighs 3. 7 kg. By offsetting the rotors, the machine can effectively weed crops in row spacings between 15 and 22. 5 cm. Because of only shallow soil disturbance, power requirements are also low. IRRI tests showed that a farmer using a two-row model can weed a hectare in 25 - 35 hours compared to 90 hours for a conventional push-pull. One row rotary weeder. The cono-weeder was consciously designed {{so that it can be}} cheap to produce and made locally by rural manufacturers using tubular frames and sheet rollers.
