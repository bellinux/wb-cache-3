25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and <b>renal</b> <b>diseases,</b> including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying cause, if any.|$|E

However, other morbidities {{appear to be}} more common among PLHIV than in the general population. This study aimed to estimate the relative risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> among people living with HIV (PLHIV) compared to the HIV-uninfected population. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relative risks of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> among populations of PLHIV reported in studies from the peer-reviewed literature. We searched Medline for relevant journal articles published before September 2010, yielding papers published during or after 2002. We also searched conference proceedings of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) prior to and including 2010. Eligible studies were observational studies reporting <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> defined as acute or chronic reduced renal function with glomerular filtration rate {{less than or equal to}} 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 among HIV-positive adults. Pooled relative risks were calculated for various groupings, including class of ART drugs administered. Results The overall relative risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> was 3. 87 (95 % CI: 2. 85 - 6. 85) among HIV-infected people compared to HIV-uninfected people. The relative risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> among people with late-stage HIV infection (AIDS) was 3. 32 (1. 86 - 5. 93) compared to other PLHIV. The relative risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> among PLHIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) was 0. 54 (0. 29 - 0. 99) compared to treatment-naïve PLHIV; the relative risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> among PLHIV who were treated with tenofovir was 1. 56 (0. 83 - 2. 93) compared to PLHIV who were treated with non-tenofovir therapy. The risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> was also found to significantly increase with age. Conclusion PLHIV are at increased risk of <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> with greater risk at later stages of infection and at older ages.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundComplement {{is a key}} {{component}} of the innate immune system, and variation in genes that regulate its activation is associated with <b>renal</b> and other <b>disease.</b> We aimed to establish the genetic basis for a familial disorder of complement regulation associated with persistent microscopic haematuria, recurrent macroscopic haematuria, glomerulonephritis, and progressive renal failure. MethodsWe sought patients from the West London Renal and Transplant Centre (London, UK) with unusual <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> and affected family members as a method of identification of new genetic causes of kidney disease. Two families of Cypriot origin were identified in which <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission and renal biopsy of at least one individual showed C 3 glomerulonephritis. A mutation was identified via a genome-wide linkage study and candidate gene analysis. A PCR-based diagnostic test was then developed and used to screen for the mutation in population-based samples and in individuals and families with <b>renal</b> <b>disease.</b> FindingsOccurrence of familial <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> cosegregated with the same mutation in the complement factor H-related protein 5 gene (CFHR 5). In a cohort of 84 Cypriots with unexplained <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> four had mutation in CFHR 5. Overall, we identified 26 individuals with the mutation and evidence of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> from 11 ostensibly unrelated kindreds, including the original two families. A mutant CFHR 5 protein present in patient serum had reduced affinity for surface-bound complement. We term this <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> CFHR 5 nephropathy. InterpretationCFHR 5 nephropathy accounts for a substantial burden of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> in patients of Cypriot origin and can be diagnosed with a specific molecular test. The high risk of progressive <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> in carriers of the CFHR 5 mutation implies that isolated microscopic haematuria or recurrent macroscopic haematuria should not be regarded as a benign finding in individuals of Cypriot descent.

40|$|Background. Kidney {{disease is}} a growing public health {{phenomenon}} in the U. S. and in the world. Downstream interventions, dialysis and renal transplants covered by Medicare 2 ̆ 7 s <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> entitlement policy in those who are 65 years and over have been expensive treatments that have been not foolproof. The shortage of kidney donors in the U. S. has grown {{in the last two}} decades. Therefore study of upstream events in kidney disease development and progression is justified to prevent the rising prevalence of kidney disease. Previous studies have documented the biological route by which obesity can progress and accelerate kidney disease, but health services literature on quantifying the effects of overweight and obesity on economic outcomes in the context of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> were lacking. Objectives. The specific aims of this study were (1) to determine the likelihood of overweight and obesity in <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> and in three specific adult <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> sub-populations, hypertensive, diabetic and both hypertensive and diabetic (2) to determine the incremental health service use and spending in overweight and obese <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> populations and (3) to determine who financed the cost of healthcare for <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> in overweight and obese adult populations less than 65 years of age. Methods. This study was a retrospective cross-sectional study of <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> cases pooled for years 2002 to 2009 from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The likelihood of overweight and obesity was estimated using chi-square test. Negative binomial regression and generalized gamma model with log link were used to estimate healthcare utilization and healthcare expenditures for six health event categories. Payments by self/family, public and private insurance were described for overweight and obese kidney disease sub-populations. Results.

We undertook this study {{to test the hypothesis}} that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often severe long before diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> progresses to ESRD. MethodsA total of 32 nondialyzed individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> (albumin excretion rate> 30 μg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49. 8 ± 6. 1 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2] were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric diabetics. We used 3 : 1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls without <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the presence/absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD). ResultsUsing electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of coronary artery calcification was significantly greater among diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> individuals (prevalence, 94 % vs. 59 %, P < 0. 001; median score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0. 001) than the nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification scores were significantly more severe among diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> individuals than either the diabetic or nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease,</b> the coronary artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were several-fold greater among those with known CAD than among those without. There was also a significantly greater prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification among diabetic <b>renal</b> <b>disease</b> individuals than nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23 % vs. 6 %, P = 0. 03; mitral, 25 % vs. 2 %, P < 0. 001).
