5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream {{of the open}} reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase,</b> its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, although there are many introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> which make new copies of DNA and RNA.

5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> that copies the {{sequence}} of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a convenient colorimetric assay for monitoring RNA synthesis from DNA-dependent <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> (DdRp) and viral RNA-dependent <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> (RdRp). ATP and GTP with a p-nitrophenyl moiety {{attached to the}} γ-phosphate were synthesized (PNP–NTPs). These PNP–NTPs {{can be used for}} RNA synthesis by several <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> including the RdRps from brome mosaic virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus and the DdRps from bacteriophage T 7 and SP 6. When the polymerase reactions were performed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which digests the p-nitrophenylpyrophosphate side-product of phosphoryl transfer to the chromogenic p-nitrophenylate, an increase in absorbence at 405 nm was observed. These nucleotide analogues were used in continuous colorimetric monitoring of polymerase activity. Furthermore, the PNP–NTPs were found to be stable and utilized by <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> in the presence of human plasma. This simple colorimetric polymerase assay can be performed in a standard laboratory spectrophotometer and will be useful in screens for inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel autoantibody reactive with all three classes of <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases,</b> well-characterized nuclear enzymes, in sera from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). After incubation with [35 S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell extracts, 14 of 275 SSc sera immunoprecipitated 12 or 14 proteins with similar molecular weights as those of several subunit proteins of eukaryotic <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> I, II, and III. Purified IgG from {{these two types of}} sera inhibited RNA transcription catalyzed by <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> I, II, and III in vitro. Immunoblot analysis using RNA polymerase-enriched fraction showed that the majority of these sera reacted with 42 - or 25 -kD protein. Anti-RNA polymerase antibody was highly specific to SSc, especially to diffuse cutaneous SSc. Clinical features associated with this antibody included a high frequency of heart and kidney involvement and a poor survival rate at 5 yr after first visit. These findings indicate that the autoantibody to three classes of <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerases</b> is a new marker for a unique subset of diffuse cutaneous SSc...|$|R
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E

5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase.</b> This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids.

There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, subplate, layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with <b>RNA</b> <b>polymerase</b> II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E
