25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> get some sleep and some respite from the dust.|$|E

25|$|Oysters {{have been}} cultured {{for well over}} a century. The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) is {{presently}} the most widely grown bivalve around the world. Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form 'seed oysters'. In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the cultivator putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|E
500|$|The H-5 series {{followed}} in February 1941, with heavier defensive armament. Like the H-4, it retained a PVC 1006 L bomb <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> {{enable it to}} carry heavy bombs under the fuselage. The first ten He 111H-5s were pathfinders, and selected for special missions. The aircraft sometimes carried 25kg flashlight bombs which acted as flares. The H-5 could also carry heavy fire bombs, either heavy containers or smaller incendiary devices attached to parachutes. The H-5 also carried LM A and LM B aerial mines for anti-shipping operations. After the 80th production aircraft, the PVC 1006 L bomb rack was removed and replaced with a heavy-duty ETC 2000 rack, enabling the H-5 to carry the SC 2500 [...] "Max" [...] bomb, on the external ETC 2000 rack, which enabled it to support the [...] bomb.|$|E

Larger vessels, particularly live-aboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.|$|R

2500|$|For a {{tooth profile}} {{which is a}} {{theoretical}} involute, the fundamental rack is straight-sided, with sides inclined at the pressure angle of the tooth form, with flat top and bottom. The necessary addendum correction to allow the use of small-numbered pinions can either be obtained by suitable modification of this <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> a cycloidal form at the tips, or by hobbing at other than the theoretical pitch circle diameter. [...] Since the gear ratio between hob and blank is fixed, the resulting gear will have the correct pitch on the pitch circle, but the tooth thickness will not be equal to the space width.|$|E
