5|$|Red foxes {{dominate}} <b>raccoon</b> dogs, sometimes {{killing their}} kits or biting adults to death. Cases are known of foxes killing <b>raccoon</b> dogs entering their dens. Both species compete for mouse-like prey. This competition reaches a peak during early spring, when food is scarce. In Tartaria, red fox predation accounted for 11.1% of deaths among 54 <b>raccoon</b> dogs, and amounted to 14.3% of 186 <b>raccoon</b> dog deaths in north-western Russia.|$|E
5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the <b>raccoon</b> {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is to}} demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the <b>raccoon</b> will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the <b>raccoon,</b> which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Raccoons</b> and the Lost Star is a {{precursor}} TV Special to the animated series The <b>Raccoons</b> and debuted on December 13, 1983.

50|$|<b>Raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor) are {{omnivorous}} mammals {{that can}} subsist {{on a diet}} of seabird eggs and chicks where they are introduced. <b>Raccoons</b> decrease seabird breeding success; for example, in 2004 <b>raccoons</b> were introduced to gull breeding colonies in the Isles of Shoals, Maine. Islands without <b>raccoons</b> were 17 {{times more likely to}} hatch and fledge chicks than islands with introduced <b>raccoons</b> present. In another example, <b>raccoons</b> introduced to the Scott Islands, British Columbia in the 1930s devastated what was the largest aggregation of breeding seabirds in the eastern Pacific south of Alaska.|$|R

On her way to the <b>Raccoon</b> City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new enemy. This creature, named Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef.

40|$|Tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis {{infection}} is endemic in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{in the northeastern}} portion of the lower Michigan peninsula (USA). Various wild carnivores and omnivores, including <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor), are infected with M. bovis within the endemic area. To investigate the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in <b>raccoons</b> {{and the likelihood of}} M. bovis transmission from infected <b>raccoons</b> to other susceptible hosts, we experimentally inoculated <b>raccoons</b> with single oral doses of M. bovis (ranging from 30 to 1. 7 x 105 colony forming units [CFU]), five daily oral doses of M. bovis (ranging from 10 to 1 x 105 CFU), or a single intravenous (IV) dose of 1 x 105 CFU of M. bovis, from November 1998 through December 2000. Granulomatous lesions consistent with tuberculosis, or tissue colonization with M. bovis, were seen in one of five <b>raccoons</b> in the single low oral dose group, one of five <b>raccoons</b> in the multiple low oral dose group, two of five <b>raccoons</b> in the multiple medium oral dose group, five of five <b>raccoons</b> in the multiple high oral dose group, and five of five <b>raccoons</b> in the IV inoculated group. In orally inoculated <b>raccoons,</b> lesions were most common in the tracheobronchial and mesenteric lymph nodes and lung. Excretion of M. bovis in saliva or nasal secretions was noted in all IV inoculated <b>raccoons</b> and two of five multiple low oral dose <b>raccoons.</b> Mycobacterium bovis was not isolated from urine or feces from any experimentally inoculated <b>raccoons.</b> The need for multiple large oral doses to establish infection, and the low number of orally inoculated <b>raccoons</b> that excreted M. bovis in nasal secretions or saliva, suggest that widespread tuberculosis among <b>raccoons</b> is unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{testes and}} the spermatic cord of <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon lotor, kits to adult breeders; n 5 48) were examined. Segmental {{arteritis}} {{confined to the}} extratesticular portions of the testicular artery was present in <b>raccoons</b> of all ages. The arterial changes were seen in laboratory-confined experimental and control animals {{as well as in}} wild-caught <b>raccoons.</b> The lesions consisted of proliferative endarteritis with presence of inflammatory cells within the intima, media, and the adventitial regions of most affected vessels. Some aspects of the proliferative arterial lesions were reminiscent of systemic necrotizing vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa), an immunologically mediated condition of animals and humans. Etiologic agents were not identified at the affected sites. Arteritis was not attributed to the administration of infectious agents because it was present in <b>raccoons</b> of all age and origin.

Habitat alterations associated with strip-mining and reclamation may reduce the suitability of an area for wildlife by redistributing requirements for survival and reproduction. I evaluated several predictions regarding the impacts of habitat alterations on wildlife by comparing patterns of landscape use and behavior of <b>raccoons</b> (Procyon rotor) in unmined and reclaimed habitats on the Big Brown Mine in Freestone County, Texas. I hypothesized that changes in vegetation composition and structure and the spatial distribution of habitat types would influence diel activity and movements, habitat use, resting site use, home range size, and ultimately the demography of <b>raccoons.</b> I captured and radio-collared 12 and 4 adult <b>raccoons</b> in unmined and reclaimed areas, respectively, and observed patterns of habitat use, and annual and seasonal home range sizes. During each season, I monitored continuous 24 -hr activity and movement patterns of 4 radio-collared <b>raccoons</b> in unmined and reclaimed areas. I relocated inactive radio-collared <b>raccoons</b> to evaluate resting site use in unmined and reclaimed areas. Estimates of population demographics were based on live-trapped <b>raccoons.</b> <b>Raccoons</b> inhabiting reclaimed areas had larger annual home ranges and their movement patterns within and across the reclaimed landscape suggested those areas offered less abundant and/or more isolated resources for <b>raccoons.</b> <b>Raccoons</b> in unmined habitats used trees more often as resting sites than did <b>raccoons</b> in reclaimed areas; brushpiles were used more often than trees by <b>raccoons</b> in reclaimed areas. Improved pasture was the most abundant habitat type in reclaimed areas and was underutilized by <b>raccoons.</b> Analyses of trapping success and population sex-age structure suggest that reclaimed areas may be incapable of supporting population densities found in unmined habitats. Collectively, these findings support the conclusion that reclaimed habitats may not be mitigating the loss of unmined woodlands. Although {{it was not possible to}} test the validity of all aspects of the conceptual model, results from this study provided support for the processes it identified and its predictions regarding the potential impacts of strip-mining on <b>raccoons.</b> Based on these results, I discussed 5 recommendations to improve reclamation efforts...|$|R
