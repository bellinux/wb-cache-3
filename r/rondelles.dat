50|$|After a {{screening}} at the United Nations Pavilion at Expo 1967 in Montreal, Canada, To Be Alive was only available for public screening at the Golden <b>Rondelle</b> Theater at the S.C.

50|$|The {{entrance}} to the building is in a projecting central bay. The door is flanked by wooden pilasters and sidelights under a large arch with stained glass windows.

[...] Carena {{was the owner of}} the National Hockey League Montreal Canadiens, the manager of the Montreal Forum, with assets that included the Bell Centre and Gillett Entertainment Group.

5000|$|The Golden <b>Rondelle</b> Theater is a {{historic}} theater currently located in the administration complex of S. C. Johnson & Son in Racine, Wisconsin. Featuring a radical design, the theater was originally part of the 1964-65 World's Fair before being moved to Racine. At the World's Fair the theater was used to show the award-winning film [...] "To Be Alive!". After the fair, the theater was dismantled, shipped to Racine, and {{used as the basis}} of a re-designed theater. The design work was by Taliesin Associated Architects, the successor firm to that of Frank Lloyd Wright.|$|R
50|$|Used in this sense, {{classical}} fencing is a {{style of}} historical fencing focusing on the 19th- and early 20th-century national fencing schools, especially in Italy and France, i.e. the schools out of which the styles of contemporary sports fencing have developed. Masters and legendary fencing figures such as Giuseppe Radaelli, Louis <b>Rondelle,</b> Masaniello Parise, the Greco brothers, Aldo Nadi and his rival Lucien Gaudin are today considered typical practitioners of this period. Classical fencing weapons included the standard foil, épée (using pointes d'arret), and sabre (including both blunted dueling sabres and, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, modern sporting sabres).|$|R
5000|$|A plaque by LaPalme and Georges Lauda, {{commemorating the}} inauguration of the Metro, {{is located at the}} centre of the mezzanine. It is {{enclosed}} in a black circular bench, a popular meeting site, referred to as la <b>rondelle</b> (the hockey puck) or la pilule (the pill) or [...] "le banc des fous" [...] (the crazy bench).There is also a piece of work located in the newer Sainte-Catherine entrance pavilion, by architect Gaétan Pelletier. The work is a statue of Mother Émilie Gamelin by Raoul Hunter, commemorating Place Émilie-Gamelin (also called Berri Square) in which the entrance is located. The statue is owned by the City of Montreal.|$|R
5000|$|Racine {{has several}} {{examples}} of Frank Lloyd Wright's work, including the Johnson Wax Headquarters, Wingspread, the Thomas P. Hardy House and the Keland House. S.C. Johnson offers free tours of its corporate campus, and receives about 9,000 visitors per year. The Research Tower, {{which is located}} on the SC Johnson campus, is one of only 2 existing high rise buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. [...] Fortaleza Hall, designed by Norman Foster, houses the [...] "SC Johnson Gallery: Frank Lloyd Wright At Home" [...] and a Frank Lloyd Wright library. The Johnson Wax disc-shaped Golden <b>Rondelle</b> Theater was originally constructed as the Johnson Wax pavilion for the 1964 New York World's Fair and then relocated to Racine.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the head varied greatly {{with a variety of}} {{interchangeable}} parts and rivets. Generally, the head bore an axe or hammer upon the damaging 'face', with a spike, hammer, or fluke on the reverse. In addition, there was a projection from the top (often square in cross section) built somewhat like a dagger. The head was attached to the squared-off wooden pole by long flat strips of metal, called langets, which were riveted in place on either two or four of its sides. Also, a round hilt-like disc called a <b>rondelle</b> was placed just below the head. They also appear to have borne one or two rings along the pole's length as places to prevent hands from slipping. Also of note is that the butt end of the staff, opposite the weapon's head, bore a spike.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opposition}} is typically classified as an {{action in the}} French style of fencing, and it is similar to what the Italian school calls a glide. However, some doctrines teach that the opposition and the glide are separate actions, but the glide can be done using an opposition. William Gaugler defines the opposition as an action completed during a thrust in which the hand is shifted against the opponent's blade {{in an attempt to}} close the line, while the glide slides along the opponent's blade onto target. Louis <b>Rondelle</b> instructs that a glide should be kept in opposition and that it is [...] "in reality a feint of direct thrust." [...] Julio Martinez Castello refers to the glide as a [...] "sliding thrust" [...] that will dominate the opponent's blade by forcing it to the side.|$|R
