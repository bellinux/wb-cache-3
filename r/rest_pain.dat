40|$|This study {{determined}} preoperative {{predictors of}} movement and <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> following total knee replacement (TKR). We hypothesized that younger patients with higher preoperative pain intensity, pain sensitivity, trait anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and depression {{would be more likely}} to experience higher postoperative movement pain than older patients with lower scores on these variables prior to surgery, and that predictors would be similar for <b>resting</b> <b>pain.</b> Demographics, analgesic intake, anxiety, depression, <b>pain</b> catastrophizing, <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> movement pain (ie, during active knee range of motion), and quantitative sensory tests were performed preoperatively on 215 participants scheduled for a unilateral TKR. On postoperative day 2, analgesic intake, <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> and movement pain were again assessed. Significant predictors of moderate or severe movement pain were higher preoperative movement pain, von Frey pain intensity, and heat pain threshold. People with severe movement pain preoperatively were 20 times more likely to have severe movement pain postoperatively. When the influence of preoperative movement pain was removed, depression became a predictor. Significant predictors of moderate to severe <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> were higher preoperative <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> depression, and younger age. These results suggest that patients with higher preoperative pain and depression are more likely to have higher pain following TKR, and younger patients may have higher <b>resting</b> <b>pain.</b> Cutaneous pain sensitivity predicted movement <b>pain</b> but not <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> suggesting that mechanisms underlying movement pain are different from <b>resting</b> <b>pain.</b> Aggressive management of preoperative pain, pain sensitivity, and depression prior to surgery may facilitate postoperative recovery...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{meta-analysis}} was {{to assess}} the postoperative analgesic efficacy of sciatic nerve block when combined with femoral nerve block after total knee arthroplasty. Outcomes included <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> scores (analogue scale, 0 - 100), intravenous morphine consumption at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, and functional outcomes comprising knee flexion, distance walked, and length of stay. Twelve randomised controlled trials were included, with a total of 600 patients. When combined with femoral nerve block, sciatic nerve block significantly reduced <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> scores at 12 h postoperatively with a mean difference of 10 (95 % CI: - 15 to - 5; p < 0. 00001). <b>Resting</b> <b>pain</b> scores at 24 h, and intravenous morphine consumption at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively were also significantly reduced, but without clinical significance beyond 12 h and without affecting functional outcomes.

DesignUsing a chronic-illness panel in the United Kingdom, patients 45  years or older with a self-reported diagnosis of OA were eligible to participate in the study. Patient preferences were assessed using a discrete-choice experiment that compared hypothetical treatment profiles of benefits and risks consistent with NSAID use. Benefit outcomes (ambulatory <b>pain,</b> <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> stiffness, and difficulty doing daily activities) were presented on a 0 -to- 100  mm scale.

40|$|The aim of {{the five}} studies {{reported}} in this thesis is to explore factors that are associated with, and efficacy of intervention for, proximal phalangeal fracture following surgical fixation. Study 1 examined whether baseline characteristics are predictive of total active range of motion six weeks following surgical repair of proximal phalangeal fracture. Studies 2 and 3 compared efficacy of two exercise intervention protocols on short and medium-term outcome following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of proximal phalangeal fracture. Study 4 investigated the pattern of recovery following proximal phalangeal ORIF and whether this recovery is related to adherence to rehabilitation. Study 5 examined whether baseline characteristics predict outcome twelve weeks after ORIF of proximal phalangeal fracture. Study 1 found that earlier commencement of active finger exercises following fixation of proximal phalangeal fracture independently predicts greater range of motion six weeks post-operatively, and should be encouraged. Studies 2 and 3 found that within the broader setting of intensive rehabilitation with early commencement of active finger exercise and close monitoring, type of exercise performed made no difference to outcome in either the short or medium-term following proximal phalangeal ORIF. Study 4 found that prior to commencement of rehabilitation, range of motion was poor, and few were {{able to return to}} their full employment duties, but pain on average was mild. Most of the recovery following fixation occurred in the first six weeks, with progressively smaller gains beyond that time, with excellent recovery achieved by six months.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} {{the relative importance}} that UK physicians attach to the benefits and risks of current drugs when making treatment decisions for patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Physicians treating at least 10 patients with OA per month completed an online discrete-choice experiment survey and answered 12 treatment-choice questions comparing medication profiles. Medication profiles were defined by 4 benefits (reduction in ambulatory <b>pain,</b> <b>resting</b> <b>pain,</b> stiffness, and difficulty doing daily activities) and 3 treatment-related risks [bleeding ulcer, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) ]. Each physician made medication choices for 3 of 9 hypothetical patients (varied by age, history of MI, hypertension, and history of gastrointestinal bleeding). Importance weights were estimated using a random-parameters logit model. Treatment-related risks physicians were willing to accept in exchange for various reductions in ambulatory and <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> also were calculated. RESULTS: The final sample was 475. A reduction in ambulatory pain from 75 mm to 25 mm (1. 6 units) was 1. 1 times as important as an increase in MI risk from 0 % to 1. 5 % (1. 5 units). The greatest importance was for eliminating a 3 % treatment-related risk of MI or stroke. On average, physicians were willing to accept an increase in bleeding ulcer risk of 0. 7 % (95 % CI 0. 4 %- 1. 7 %) for a reduction in ambulatory pain of 75 mm to 50 mm. CONCLUSION: When presented with well-known benefits and risks of OA treatments, physicians placed greater importance on the risks than on the analgesic properties of the drug.

40|$|Pain is {{the oldest}} medical {{condition}} and has been referenced through the ages. TENS is a non-invasive treatment for pain. Despite conflicting reports of treatment outcomes, TENS has enjoyed widespread clinical utilization. Seminal work by Sluka and colleagues reported low frequency TENS produces anti-hyperalgesia through µ-opioid receptors and high frequency TENS produces anti-hyperalgesia through ä-opioid receptors in an animal model of inflammation. The experimental results suggested that pain can be reduced by both high and low frequency TENS but by differing opioid receptors. These important findings require translational experiments to be conducted in humans. Providing an adequate placebo for experimental investigation of any physical intervention presents as a challenge. An improvement in the placebo intervention is critical to ascertain the true effects of TENS on painful conditions. Clinical TENS experiments often only examine a single outcome - <b>resting</b> <b>pain.</b> Recent work suggests TENS is less effective on <b>resting</b> <b>pain</b> as compared to movement pain. Investigation to determine which outcome measures (<b>pain</b> at <b>rest,</b> movement <b>pain,</b> pain sensitivity, and function) {{are most likely to}} be affected by TENS in human subjects with pain are critical to inform the design of future studies.

To date, no literature exists to determine the effectiveness of this clinical practice and speculation has existed for decades regarding the existence of distinct electrical properties associated with specific points on the body. This series of experiments accomplishes the goals of improving the TENS placebo, testing established parameters from basic science experiments in a patient population, testing multiple outcome measures to direct future investigation; and examined the effect of electrode site selection in TENS analgesia. These experiments were the first to establish a placebo that can 100 % blind the TENS examiner, to test this placebo in a patient population, and to show that although there are differences in impedance between optimal and sham sites, that this difference had no effect in the amount of analgesia produced by TENS...|$|R
