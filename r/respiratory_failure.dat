5|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>failure</b> {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

Early goal directed management in those patients may offer opportunities for improvement.|$|R
30|$|Introduction The sublingual microcirculation is {{impaired}} {{in states}} of severe sepsis and septic shocks. The microcirculatory dysfunctions are prognostic markers of survival and organ failures in critically ill adult patients. In children, the sublingual microcirculation is also impaired in septic shock [1] and severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>failures</b> [2]. We {{hypothesized that the}} microcirculation impairments related to the severity of <b>respiratory</b> and circulatory <b>failures</b> could be reversible under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The aims of the study are (1) assess the feasibility of the sublingual microcirculation monitoring in pediatric ECMO, (2) compare the microcirculation parameters under ECMO between J 1 and J 3.|$|R

5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure,</b> the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|If left untreated, DPB {{progresses}} to bronchiectasis, an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves {{enlargement of the}} bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure</b> and heart problems.|$|E

30|$|Discussion In this {{preliminary}} study {{the children had}} severe hemodynamic <b>failures</b> or severe <b>respiratory</b> <b>failures</b> with pulmonary hypertension which needed of catecholamines and ECMO support. The alteration of the sublingual microcirculation was confirmed at day 1 under ECMO. The microvascular perfusion parameters were reduced compared to the normal value of healthy subjects (MFI =  3). The partial MFI restoration confirmed the microcirculation recruitment in these patients. Now, further {{studies are needed to}} confirm this microcirculation’s recruitment in a larger pediatric ECMO cohort and to investigate the impact of this recruitment on the prognosis.|$|R

5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks.

5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure</b> have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure</b> or {{ventricular}} fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Influenza A (H 1 N 1)pdm 09 {{pandemic}} was a determinant {{event for}} development of modern extracorporeal life support techniques.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive <b>respiratory</b> <b>failure</b> and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E

30|$|Discussion This study {{reports the}} largest {{prospective}} multicentric international cohort of pediatric skin infections needing PICU admission to date. Surgery {{was the first}} risk factor reported in our cohort, before varicella. Severe circulatory and <b>respiratory</b> <b>failures</b> on admission {{in a context of}} deep biological inflammatory syndrome required aggressive treatments during the first 3  days. Lower part of the body was more frequently involved than reported before in childhood. The diagnosis was quickly suspected and confirmed mainly by ultrasound and CT scan, with the use of MRI still very rare. More than a half of patients have been operated after classical treatments associating immunoglobulins and antitoxin-antibiotics. Infection appeared mainly monobacterial as usually described in children but gram-negative strains are emerging. Mortality was still low and sequella were rare.|$|R
