2500|$|The final Australian-made Caprice V of September 2015 left {{equipment}} levels largely unchanged, but {{dropped the}} V6 engine and replaced the L77 with the , LS3 V8. Minor external changes included 19" [...] wheels {{shared with the}} VF Series II Calais V, the standard fitment of the formerly optional <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler and a single exhaust pipe on each side replacing the quad exhaust tips of previous V8 models.|$|R
2500|$|The new German {{garrison}} of the [...] Redoubt was doubled {{for several}} days and {{a high level of}} alert maintained {{until the end of the}} month, when the possibility of another British attack was considered to have ended. The 37th Brigade commander, Brigadier-General Cator, reported that the interiors of craters were mantraps. The craters attracted artillery and mortar fire but gave no protection, being confined spaces with a morass of liquid chalk and black mud at the bottom, which was unusable as a material for fortification. Building up crater lips with a parados (the embanked <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the trench) or hurdles and boards failed, because shellfire soon dislodged them and the inner sides collapsed into the crater. Defending the forward lip had proved difficult, due to its breadth and the presence of clay mounds [...] high, which obstructed the field of fire. Cator recommended that the near lips of craters or a line beyond them were better positions and the interiors of craters left empty, with positions maintained on the <b>rear</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many Germans were entombed {{in a large}} dugout, {{all four}} entrances of which were blocked, but they were rescued later in the day. Others were crushed or blown to pieces. Despite the shock and {{disorientation}} caused by the detonation of the mine, German troops immediately occupied the <b>rear</b> of <b>lip</b> of the crater. The Germans also immediately brought down a heavy artillery barrage onto the British trenches. The 2nd Royal Fusiliers, crossing no man's land to occupy the crater, came under heavy German rifle and machine-gun fire from either flank and the <b>rear</b> <b>lip.</b> A few of 2nd Royal Fusiliers managed to reach the closest lip of the crater and held on until noon when they were forced out by a German counter-attack. The failure to take the Redoubt had a serious effect on the VIII Corps' operations north of the River Ancre.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota Camry Solara is {{also the}} first vehicle in the Toyota lineup, after their 1997 {{partnership}} agreement to feature a JBL premium stereo option, which all models came with a single-slot in-dash CD player and cassette deck. The SE models come standard with 15-inch steel wheels and hubcaps, upgradable to 15-inch alloy wheels. The Sports Package also adds a retuned suspension, perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel, perforated eight-way power-adjustable leather seats, an upgrade to 16-inch alloy wheels, retuned steering, minor trim changes and a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler.|$|R
50|$|The banked earth {{on the lip}} of {{the trench}} facing the enemy was called the parapet and had a fire step. The embanked <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the trench was called the parados. The parados {{protected}} the soldier's back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with sandbags, wooden frames and wire mesh. The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden duckboards. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Proton {{introduced}} the Iswara Aeroback Special Edition. It features {{a large number}} of cosmetic enhancements, including a new front grille, headlights, 'Altezza lights', body kit, <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoilers and 14-inch alloy rims among others. It was only offered with the 1.3-litre engine paired to the 5-speed manual. The interior was left largely unchanged over the previous iteration. Nonetheless, the Iswara Aeroback S.E. is the first in its lineage to receive ride & handling input from Lotus. The modifications were later adopted for use in the Proton Saga LMST.|$|R
2500|$|The chassis {{and rear}} {{suspension}} were redesigned, with an upper link added {{at the rear}} to alleviate strain on the half-shafts. The brakes were also improved. Giugiaro designed an aerodynamic body kit for the car, with a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler, prominent louvered rear hatch, more substantial bumpers, a deeper front airdam, and air ducts in the sills {{just ahead of the}} new three-piece 15" [...] Compomotive rear wheels. Inside scarlet leather combined with a roof-mounted Panasonic stereo for a dramatic environment. 45 Essex Esprits were built, interspersed and followed by a number of non-Essex-liveried but otherwise identical specification dry sump turbo cars.|$|R
500|$|The {{bodywork}} of the BT19 is glass-reinforced plastic, {{finished in}} Brabham's usual racing colours of green with gold trimming around the nose. Although {{the science of}} aerodynamics would not greatly affect Formula One racing until the 1968 season, Tauranac had been making use of the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel since 1963 to refine {{the shape of his}} cars. Brabham has attributed the car's [...] "swept-down nose and the upswept <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the engine cowl" [...] to Tauranac's [...] "attention to aerodynamic detail". During the 1967 season, the car appeared with small winglets on the nose, to further reduce lift acting {{at the front of the}} car.|$|R
5000|$|The {{above all}} {{included}} 'high-spec' bumpers with foglights (Optional on the Si model), alloy wheels from 1996 onwards (Different size and design between Si/SRi 14" [...] and GTi 15"), and <b>rear</b> roof <b>lip</b> spoilers (GTi models sported an integrated brake light, also spoilers were optional on the Si).|$|R
500|$|Z Series: {{released}} on 5 September 2012 {{as a special}} edition Commodore. It was released to help boot the slowing sales of the VE range and to help send off the last model VE's before the current model VF was released. The Z Series combined luxury and sports features for great value. The models that had the Z badging were the Omega, SV6, SS and SS V. Features included leather seat trim (Omega and SSV), Bluetooth connect, rear parking sensors, rear parking camera, 18" [...] WM Caprice alloys (Omega), <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler, 19' alloys (SV6 and SS). The Sedan and Sportwagon came as Z Series, SV6 Z Series, SS Z Series and SS V Z Series. The Ute came with all except for the Omega-based Z Series model.|$|R
40|$|A {{retractable}} {{tool bit}} assembly for a tool {{such as an}} allen key is presented. The assembly includes one or more spring loaded nestable or telescoping tubular sections together with a catch mechanism for capturing and holding the tool in its retracted position. The catch mechanism consists of a latch mechanism located in a base section and which engages a conically shaped tool head located at the inner end of the tool. The tool head adjoins an eccentric oval type neck portion which extends to a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the tool head. The latch mechanism releases when the ovular neck portion rotates about the catch members upon actuation of a rotary tool drive motor. When released, all the telescoping sections and the tool extends fully outward to a use position...|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the same}} chassis and {{underpinnings}} as the D4 S8, the D4 S8 Plus became the sole option for ordering the S8-variant of the Audi A8 line, in the 2016 and 2017 model years. The S8 Plus was dialed up to 605 HP {{out of the same}} powerplant as the previous S8, by remapping the turbo boost and fuel delivery of the engine. Additionally, the Carbon Ceramic braking system is standard on the S8 Plus. The vast majority of options on the S8 Plus were identical to the previous S8; however, had darkened tail lights standard, and the option for adding carbon fiber styling elements such as the mirror caps, <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler, <b>rear</b> diffuser, and front lip. With a high-optioned build, the S8 Plus would outprice the A8 W12; which terminated in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Since the Bugatti EB 112 was {{a concept}} {{car and a}} {{stillborn}} project, it never reached actual production by the company. There {{are at least two}} built, one red and one black, however images of a third blue one have appeared. Each of the concepts are slightly different, as the red car has bumper integrated taillights opposed to the black and the blue's taillights which are placed above the rear bumper. The blue one differs from the black one because it has more aerodynamic enhancements, such as a subtle front splitter and a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler just below the rear window. Unfortunately due to the company's bankruptcy in 1995, the production-ready car was never officially released to the public, and the 4-door Bugatti concept remains a stillborn project.|$|R
5000|$|The MB6 VTi-S five-door {{was made}} in a limited run of 500 of each body type, and only sold in the Honda colour 'Pirates Black', with body {{coloured}} bumpers. The VTI-S improved on {{the appearance of the}} standard Civic VTi five-door with a more pronounced front lip and also a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> on the bumpers, and different side skirts. The VTi-S specification also included chrome/aluminium gear-knob(silver/black plastic on later VTiS models), VTI-S floor-mats and tailgate badging. It also came fitted with lightweight 15" [...] Speedline Chrono alloy wheels, with a split spoke design. The later VTi-S models came fitted with the lightweight Speedline [...] "fan" [...] alloy wheels. Other than this, the it is identical to the regular VTi. The instrument dials on later VTi-S models changed slightly, now with italic numbering.|$|R

5|$|Saratoga {{received}} a RCA CXAM-1 {{early warning radar}} in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The second-generation was {{available}} in touring and premium trim levels. The latter added leather seats, heated front seats and a power sunroof. Automatic climate control was added for the premium trim in 2003, and for the touring trim as well in 2004. All second generation EL models came with ABS anti-lock braking, but in 2003 an electronic brakeforce distribution system was made standard. For 2003 and 2004 a special dealer-installed 'aero package' was made available for both trims levels which added unique front and <b>rear</b> <b>lips,</b> side stills and a rear spoiler. In 2004, the EL underwent a slight exterior makeover with restyled headlamps, front bumper and grille, taillights, trunk lid, and rear bumper. The new look came with standard fog lights, a restyled steering wheel, new woodgrain trim patterns, and two additional tweeters powered by two amplifiers to complete the 6-speaker audio system.|$|R
5000|$|The Proton Exora {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} on 15 April 2009, becoming Malaysia's first indigenously designed MPV. It was offered in two trim variants upon its initial launch, the M-Line and H-Line respectively. Both variants were {{powered by the}} 1.6 litre CamPro CPS engine and limited to a four-speed automatic transmission. The new Exora came standard with twin airbags, an Anti-lock braking system (ABS) with Electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and a Back-up EBD (BEBD) system. The M-Line trim offered a built-in radio with CD, MP3, WMA and Bluetooth compatibility, whereas the H-Line trim offered an additional roof-mounted LCD infotainment system with DVD playback, SD/MMC and USB compatibility. The H-Line variant also came with other exclusive kit, namely front fog lamps, a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler, leather seats, cruise control and an Atmel GPS touchscreen unit. The new Exora was priced between RM69,998 and RM75,998 at launch.|$|R
50|$|On July 16, 1984, the Leone saw {{its second}} major redesign. This {{generation}} was released with a three-door hatchback, four-door sedan and {{a continuation of}} the popular station wagon body style. This generation Leone made its way to the United States in 1985. The hatchback was hamstrung by a very high <b>rear</b> cargo <b>lip,</b> but did receive a split folding rear seat.|$|R
2500|$|At [...] on 1 July 1916, the British fired a huge mine {{beneath the}} Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Sprung {{ten minutes before}} zero hour, {{it was one of}} 19 Mines {{on the first day of}} the Somme and was filmed by Geoffrey Malins. The attack on the redoubt by part of the 29th Division of VIII Corps was a costly failure. The corps {{commander}} had ordered the mine to be sprung early, to protect the advancing infantry from falling debris but this also gave the Germans time to occupy the <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> of the mine crater. When British parties crossed no man's land to occupy the crater, they met German machine-gun and rifle fire. A few British soldiers reached the crater but at noon, a German counter-attack forced them out. The success of the German defence of the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt crater contributed to the failure of the British attack on the rest of the VIII Corps front.|$|R
2500|$|VSC was not {{available}} across the range until August 2007, where it became standard on all variants. In May 2008, the Grande variant received a change in specification to {{the same set of}} alloy wheels as the [...] "Sportivo" [...] variant, as opposed to the previous style shared with the [...] "Ateva" [...] grade. Toyota released the [...] "Ateva L" [...] {{at the same time as}} this running change. The limited edition [...] "Ateva L" [...] added a <b>rear</b> <b>lip</b> spoiler, [...] "Sportivo" [...] alloy wheels, and leather trim.
