40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) {{are mainly}} present in plants and function to inhibit protein synthesis through {{the removal of}} adenine residues from eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA). They are broadly classified into two groups: type I and type II. Type I RIPs are a diverse family of proteins comprising a single polypeptide chain, whereas type II RIPs are heterodimeric glycoproteins comprising an A-chain (functionally equivalent to a type I <b>RIP)</b> <b>linked</b> via a disulphide bond to a B chain, mediating cell entry.

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) are {{a family}} of plant toxins that permanently damage ribosomes and possibly other cellular substrates, thus causing cell death. RIPs are mostly divided in two types: Type 1 RIPs that are single-chain enzymatic proteins, and type 2 RIPs that consist of an active A chain (similar to a type 1 <b>RIP)</b> <b>linked</b> to a B chain with lectin properties. RIP-containing conjugates {{have been used in}} many experimental strategies against cancer cells, often showing great efficacy in clinical trials. Saporin-S 6, a type 1 RIP extracted from Saponaria officinalis L. seeds, has been extensively utilized to construct anti-cancer conjugates because of its high enzymatic activity, stability and resistance to conjugation procedures, resulting in the efficient killing of target cells. This review summarizes saporin-S 6 -containing conjugates and their application in cancer therapy, considering in-vitro and in-vivo studies both in animal models and in clinical trials. The review is structured {{on the basis of the}} targeting of hematological versus solid tumors and on the antigen recognized on the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{atypical}} {{protein kinase}} C (aPKC) -interacting protein, p 62, {{has previously been}} shown to interact with <b>RIP,</b> <b>linking</b> these kinases to NF–κB activation by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The aPKCs have been implicated in the activation of IKKβ in TNFα-stimulated cells and {{have been shown to}} be activated in response to interleukin– 1 (IL– 1). Here we demon– strate that the inhibition of the aPKCs or the down-regulation of p 62 severely abrogates NF–κB activation by IL– 1 and TRAF 6, suggesting that both proteins are critical intermediaries in this pathway. Consistent with this we show that p 62 selectively interacts with the TRAF domain of TRAF 6 but not that of TRAF 5 or TRAF 2 in co-transfection experiments. The binding of endogenous p 62 to TRAF 6 is stimulus dependent, reinforcing the notion that this is a physiologically relevant interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the N–terminal domain of TRAF 6, which is required for signaling, interacts with ζPKC in a dimerization-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that p 62 is an important intermediary not only in TNFα but also in IL– 1 signaling to NF–κB through the specific adapters RIP and TRAF 6...|$|R

40|$|Duplicated DNA {{sequences}} in Neurospora crassa are efficiently detected and mutated {{during the}} sexual cycle {{by a process}} named repeat-induced point mutation (<b>RIP).</b> <b>Linked,</b> direct duplications have previously been shown to undergo both RIP and deletion at high frequency during premeiosis, suggesting a relationship between RIP and homologous recombination. We have investigated the relationship between RIP and recombination for an unlinked duplication and for both inverted and direct, <b>linked</b> duplications. <b>RIP</b> occurred at high frequency (42 - 100 %) with all three types of duplications used in this study, yet recombination was infrequent. For both inverted and direct, linked duplications, recombination was observed, but at frequencies one to two orders of magnitude lower than RIP. For the unlinked duplication, no recombinants were seen in 900 progeny, indicating, at most, a recombination frequency nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the frequency of RIP. In a direct duplication, RIP and recombination were correlated, suggesting that these two processes are mechanistically associated or that one process provokes the other. Mutations due to RIP have previously been shown to occur outside the boundary of a linked, direct duplication, indicating that RIP {{might be able to}} inactivate genes located in single-copy sequences adjacent to a duplicated sequence. In this study, a single-copy gene located between elements of linked duplications was inactivated at moderate frequencies (12 - 14 %). Sequence analysis demonstrated that RIP mutations had spread into these single-copy sequences at least 930 base pairs from the boundary of the duplication, and Southern analysis indicated that mutations had occurred at least 4 kilobases from the duplication boundary...|$|R
40|$|Ribosome Inactivating Proteins (RIPs) are protein or {{glycoprotein}} toxins {{that bring}} about the arrest of protein synthesis by directly interacting with and inactivating the ribosomes. Such toxins are in general, of plant origin and differ from bacterial toxins that inhibit protein synthesis by mechanisms other than ribosome inactivation. After the toxins {{had been in the}} centre of interest in biomedical research for a couple of decades in the end of 19 th century, the scientific community largely lost interest in the plant toxins. Interest in these toxins was revived when it was found that they are more toxic to tumor cells when compared to normal cells. Based on their structure RIPs can be classified into three types: Type I RIPs – They consist exclusively of a single RNA-N-glycosidase chain of ~ 30 kDa. Type II RIPs – They consists of chain-A comparable to type I <b>RIPs</b> <b>linked</b> by a disulfide bridge to an unrelated chain-B, which has carbohydrate binding activity. The molecular weight of the type II RIPs is ~ 60 kDa. Type III RIPs – Besides the classical type II RIPs a 60 kDa RIP (called JIP 60) has been identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare) that consists of chain-A resembling type I <b>RIPs</b> <b>linked</b> to an unrelated chain-B with unknown function. In addition to these classes of RIPs there is another group of toxins called four subunit toxins, whose structure is almost similar to type II RIPs, but are made up of two such subunits linked by non-covalent interactions forming tetramers having two A- and two B-chains. The definition and classification of these toxins is not so clear as they are frequently referred to as agglutinins or lectins (e. g Abrus precatorius agglutinins I and II, Ricinus communis agglutinin etc.), having red blood cell (RBC) agglutinating activity. However they {{have been found to be}} less toxic and better agglutinins when compared with type II RIPs. The present thesis reports the crystal structure of a type II RIP, Abrus precatorius agglutinin-I (APA-I) from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant. The protein was purified from the plant seed and crystallized. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement method. Preliminary crystals of abrus agglutinin were obtained almost thirty years ago and unsuccessful attempts to solve the crystal Structure of APA-I were made almost five years ago by other groups. The structure solution of API-I was obtained at 3. 5 Å using synchrotron data set collected at room temperature from a single crystal. Crystal structure is already known for Abrin, another type II RIP isolated from the same seeds. Abrin and APA-I have similar therapeutic indices for the treatment of experimental mice with tumors, but APA-I has much lower toxicity, with lethal dose (LD 50) being 5 mg/kg of body weight when compared with Abrin-a (LD 50 = 20 μg/kg of body weight). The striking difference in the toxicity shown by Abrin and its agglutinin (APA-I) encouraged us to look at the structure function relationship of these proteins, which might prove to be useful in the design and construction of immunotoxins. As apparent from the comparative study, the reduced toxicity of APA-I can be attributed to fewer interactions it can possibly have with the substrate due to the presence of Pro 199 at the binding site and not due to any kink formed in the helix due to the presence of praline as reported by other groups. In recent years, these plant RIPs which inhibit protein synthesis have become a subject of intense investigation not only because of the possible role played by them in synthesizing immunotoxins that are used in cancer therapy but also because they serve as model system for studying the molecular mechanism of transmembrane translocation of proteins. In silico docking studies were carried out in search of inhibitors that could modulate the toxicity of RIPs. Many adenine like ringed compounds were studied in order to identify them as novel inhibitors of Abrin-a molecule and facilitate detailed analyis of protein ligand complex in various ways to ascertain their potential as ligands. In addition, the structural analysis of conformationally constrained, α β-dehydrophenylalanine containing dipeptides is carried out. While there are several studies of molecular self assembly of peptides containing coded amino acids, not much work has been done on molecular assembly formation utilizing non-coded amino acids. The non-coded amino acid used in the analysis is a member of α β-dehydroamino acids. These are the derivatives of protein amino acids with a double bond between Cα And Cβ atoms and are represented by a prefix symbol ‘Δ’. They are frequently found in natural peptides of microbial and fungal origins. The presence of α, β-dehydroamino acid residues in bioactive peptides confers altered bioactivity as well as an increased resistance to enzymatic degradation. Thus, α, β-dehydroamino acid residues, in particular α, β-dehydrophenylalaine(ΔPhe) has become one of the most promising residues in the study of structure-activity relationships of biologically important peptides. The utilization of in the molecular self assembly ΔPhe in the molecular self assembly offers in added benfit in terms of variey and stability. Taking advantage of the conformation constraining property of the ΔPhe residue, its incorporation in three dipeptide molecules has been probed. In this thesis the crystal structures of the following designed dipeptide are reported. (I). +H 3 N-Phe-ΔPhe-COO˙ (FΔF); (II). +H 3 N-Val-ΔPhe- COO˙ (VΔF); +H 3 N-Ala-ΔPhe-COO˙ (AΔF). The peptides were found to be in the zwitterionic conformation and two (I, II) of the three dipeptides have resulted in tubular structures of dimensions in the nanoscale range. Chapter 1 starts with a brief introduction of RIPs, their classification and overall fold, with Abrin-a as example. A brief mention is made about how the protein is translocated in the cell and the depurination mechanism. Chapter 2 presents the purification of APA-I from the seeds of Abrus precatorius plant, the crystallization of APA-I, X-ray intensity data collection on these crystals and processing of data sets for APA-I. Chapter 3 details the structure determination of tetramer Abrus precatorius agglutinin-I,(APA-I), using the molecular replacement method, iterative model building and refinement and the quality of final protein structure model. Chapter 4 details the crystal structure of Abrus precatorius agglutinin-I (APA-I), the comparison of primary and secondary structure of APA-I with Abrin-a and the structural insights into the reduced toxicity in relation to Abrin-a and future prospects. Chapter 5 deals with the in-silico modeling of Abrin-a inhibitors using the docking method. Abrin-a is being tested extensively for the design of therapeutic immunotoxins.

40|$|The {{cytokine}} tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) {{stimulates the}} NF-kappaB, SAPK/JNK, and p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways by recruiting RIP 1 and TRAF 2 proteins to the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR 1). Genetic studies {{have revealed that}} <b>RIP</b> 1 <b>links</b> the TNFR 1 to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, whereas TRAF 2 couples the TNFR 1 to the SAPK/JNK cascade. In transfection studies, RIP 1 and TRAF 2 stimulate p 38 MAP kinase activation, and dominant-negative forms of RIP 1 and TRAF 2 inhibit TNF-alpha-induced p 38 MAP kinase activation. We found TNF-alpha-induced p 38 MAP kinase activation and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) production impaired in rip 1 (-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) but unaffected in traf 2 (-/-) MEF. Yet, both rip 1 (-/-) and traf 2 (-/-) MEF exhibit a normal p 38 MAP kinase response to inducers of osmotic shock or IL- 1 alpha. Thus, RIP 1 is a specific mediator of the p 38 MAP kinase response to TNF-alpha. These studies suggest that TNF-alpha-induced activation of p 38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK pathways bifurcate {{at the level of}} RIP 1 and TRAF 2. Moreover, endogenous RIP 1 associates with the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP 3 K) MEKK 3 in TNF-alpha-treated cells, and decreased TNF-alpha-induced p 38 MAP kinase activation is observed in Mekk 3 (-/-) cells. Taken together, these studies suggest a mechanism whereby RIP 1 may mediate the p 38 MAP kinase response to TNF-alpha, by recruiting the MAP 3 K MEKK 3...|$|R

Genetic studies {{have revealed that}} <b>Rip</b> 1 <b>links</b> the TNFR 1 to the IкB kinase (IKK) complex, whereas Traf 2 couples the TNFR 1 to the SAPK/JNK cascade. We found TNFα-induced p 38 MAP kinase activation and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) production is impaired in rip 1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) but unaffected in traj 2 -/- MEF, demonstrating that Rip 1 is also a specific mediator of the p 38 MAP kinase response to TNFα. Moreover, we demonstrate that endogenous Rip 1 associates with the MAP 3 K, Mekk 3 in response to TNFα and that TNFα-induced p 38 MAP kinase activation is impaired in mekk 3 -/- cells, indicating that Rip 1 may mediate the p 38 MAP kinase response to TNFα by recruiting Mekk 3. We also demonstrate that Rip 1 is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in response to Tnfα and that Rip 1 phosphorylation is not required for ubiquitination of Rip 1. Furthermore, TNFα-induced ubiquitination of Rip 1 is impaired in Traf 2 -/- cells, suggesting that Traf 2 is the E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the TNFα-dependent ubiquitination of Rip 1. Finally, recruitment of the ubiquitinated Tak 1 complex {{is dependent on the}} presence of Rip 1, suggesting that Rip 1 ubiquitination rather than its phosphorylation is critical in TNFR 1 signaling...|$|R
40|$|Necroptosis is a {{regulated}} form of necrotic {{cell death}} {{that has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including intestinal inflammation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In this work, we investigated the signaling mechanisms controlled by the necroptosis mediator receptor interacting protein- 1 (RIP 1) kinase. We show that Akt kinase activity is critical for necroptosis in L 929 cells and {{plays a key role}} in TNFa production. During necroptosis, Akt is activated in a RIP 1 dependent fashion through its phosphorylation on Thr 308. In L 929 cells, this activation requires independent signaling inputs from both growth factors and RIP 1. Akt controls necroptosis through downstream targeting of mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1). Akt activity, mediated in part through mTORC 1, <b>links</b> <b>RIP</b> 1 to JNK activation and autocrine production of TNFa. In other cell types, such as mouse lung fibroblasts and macrophages, Akt exhibited control over necroptosis-associated TNFa production without contributing to cell death.

40|$|The {{two members}} of the {{atypical}} protein kinase C (aPKC) subfamily of isozymes (zetaPKC and lambda/iotaPKC) are involved in the control of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IKKbeta activation. Here we show that the previously described aPKC-binding protein, p 62, selectively interacts with RIP but not with TRAF 2 in vitro and in vivo. p 62 bridges the aPKCs to RIP, whereas the aPKCs link IKKbeta to p 62. In this way, a signaling cascade of interactions is established from the TNF-R 1 involving TRADD/RIP/p 62 /aPKCs/IKKbeta. These observations define a novel pathway for the activation of NF-kappaB involving the aPKCs and p 62. Consistent with this model, the expression of a dominant-negative mutant lambda/iotaPKC impairs RIP-stimulated NF-kappaB activation. In addition, the expression of either an N-terminal aPKC-binding domain of p 62, or its C-terminal RIP-binding region are sufficient to block NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, transfection of an antisense construct of p 62 severely abrogates NF-kappaB activation. Together, these results demonstrate that the interaction of p 62 with <b>RIP</b> serves to <b>link</b> the atypical PKCs to the activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFalpha signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Repeated DNA {{sequences}} {{are frequently}} mutated during the sexual cycle in Neurospora crassa {{by a process}} named repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). RIP {{is often associated with}} methylation of cytosine residues in and around the mutated sequences. Here we demonstrate that this methylation can silence a gene located in nearby, unique sequences. A large proportion of strains that had undergone <b>RIP</b> of a <b>linked</b> duplication flanking a single-copy transgene, hph (hygromycin B phosphotransferase), showed partial silencing of hph. These strains were all heavily methylated throughout the single-copy hph sequences and the flanking sequences. Silencing was alleviated by preventing methylation, either by 5 -azacytidine (5 AC) treatment or by introduction of a mutation (eth- 1) known to reduce intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine. Silenced strains exhibited spontaneous reactivation of hph at frequencies of 10 (- 4) to 0. 5. Reactivated strains, as well as cells that were treated with 5 AC, gave rise to cultures that were hypomethylated and partially hygromycin resistant, indicating that some of the original methylation was propagated by a maintenance mechanism. Gene expression levels were found to be variable within a population of clonally related cells, and this variation was correlated with epigenetically propagated differences in methylation patterns...|$|R
40|$|A disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} 10 (ADAM 10) is a zinc protease that mediates ectodomain shedding {{of numerous}} receptors including Notch {{and members of}} the amyloid precursor protein family (APP, APLP 1, and APLP 2). Ectodomain shedding frequently activates a process called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (<b>RIP)</b> that <b>links</b> cellular events with gene regulation. To characterize ADAM 10 in kidney and in opossum kidney proximal tubule (OKP) cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting of renal membrane fractions using specific antibodies. These studies show that ADAM 10 and APLP 2 are coexpressed in the proximal tubule and in OKP cells. To study the role of ADAM 10 activity in the proximal tubule, we stably overexpressed wild-type ADAM 10 or an inactive mutant ADAM 10 in OKP cells. We found a direct correlation between the amount of active ADAM 10 expressed and 1) the amount of APLP 2 ectodomain shed into the culture supernatant and 2) the amount of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE 3) and megalin mRNA and protein expressed compared with control proteins. To establish a link between ADAM 10 -mediated shedding of APLP 2 and the effect on NHE 3 and megalin mRNA expression we performed RNA interference experiments using APLP 2 -specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in OKP cells. Cells expressing the APLP 2 shRNA showed > 80 % knock down of APLP 2 protein and mRNA as well as 60 – 70 % reduction in NHE 3 protein and mRNA. Levels of megalin and Na-K-ATPase protein and mRNA were not changed. These studies show 1) ADAM 10 and APLP 2 are expressed in proximal tubule cells and, 2) ADAM 10 activity has a pronounced effect on expression of specific brush-border proteins. We postulate that ADAM 10 and APLP 2 may represent elements of a here-to-fore unknown signaling pathway in proximal tubule that link events at the brush border with control of gene expression...|$|R

This paper describes the extraction and purification of the lectin found in tubers of the winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis), with the aim of improving and modernising the existing extraction protocol. The Eranthis hyemalis lectin (EHL) is a member of the type- 2 Ribosome Inactivating Proteins (RIP) family, proteins which have the ability to inhibit in vitro protein synthesis. <b>RIPs</b> have been <b>linked</b> to plant defence by their antiviral, antifungal and insecticidal properties, and some have been found to be potent inhibitors of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus- 1 (HIV- 1) virus. EHL was purified using affinity column chromatography and ammonium sulphate precipitation; thiourea was used as antioxidant in order to prevent EHL denaturing during the extraction process. The presence of EHL in the extract was verified using a blood agglutination test with rabbit erythrocytes. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis was employed to determine the lectin size; EHL was found to be formed of two chains with molecular weights of approximately 31 kDa; the size of the whole protein was estimated as approximately 60 kDa. The concentration of the EHL in the post-column eluent, determined using the Bradford Assay, was 380. 1 μg. cm- 3. This improved extraction protocol is the first step which will enable future research on the potential use of EHL in crop protection, by studying its insecticidal, fungicidal and bactericidal properties...|$|R

Additionally, monthly sediment samples were collected from various locations throughout the rip profile, alongside RTKGPS surveys of the intertidal morphology. A total of 3103 images of the first 1, 400 m of Perranporth beach were analysed, {{to test the hypothesis}} that rip dynamics were strongly modulated by variations in wave height, tidal elevation and the pre-existing bathymetry. A sum of 1315 individual rips channels were noted at a maximum of 3 per image and an average of 1. 03, with <b>rip</b> occurrence strongly <b>linked</b> to the significant wave height and tidal elevation. Rip suppression occurred with wave heights less than 0. 49 m and greater than 3. 4 m, and tidal elevations less than 0. 7 m Above Chart Datum (ACD) and greater than 5. 8 m ACD. Occurrence statistics show that one preferred location for rip development is present off the central headland, where 19. 7 % were found irrespective of small variations in the incident wave climate. Channels were considered stable and persistent with a wave height less than 2. 1 m with an average lifetime of 26 days and a mean migration rate to the south of 0. 56 m, although short-lived storm events were found to ‘reset’ the rip system and alter the underlying beach morphology. The dimensionless fall velocity was used to predict beach state using a weighted average wave climate, which was then compared to a visual observation of the beach and bar morphology with an average 74. 6 % accuracy.
