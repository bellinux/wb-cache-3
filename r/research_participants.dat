25|$|Physicians {{began to}} take more {{interest}} in paramedics from a research perspective as well. By about 1990, the fluctuating trends began to diminish, being replaced by outcomes-based research. This research then drove further evolution {{of the practice of}} both paramedics and the emergency physicians who oversaw their work, with changes to procedures and protocols occurring only after significant research demonstrated their need and effectiveness (an example being ALS). Such changes affected everything from simple procedures such as CPR, to changes in drug protocols. As the profession grew, some paramedics went on to become not just <b>research</b> <b>participants,</b> but researchers in their own right, with their own projects and journal publications.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{reviewing the}} relationship between the optimistic bias and perceived control found that a number of moderators contribute to this relationship. In previous <b>research,</b> <b>participants</b> from the United States generally had higher levels of optimistic bias relating to perceived control than those of other nationalities. Students also showed larger levels of the optimistic bias than non-students. The format of the study also demonstrated differences in {{the relationship between}} perceived control and the optimistic bias: direct methods of measurement suggested greater perceived control and greater optimistic bias as compared to indirect measures of the bias. The optimistic bias is strongest in situations where an individual needs to rely heavily on direct action and responsibility of situations.|$|E

25|$|It takes just {{one-tenth of}} a second for us to judge someone and make a first impression. Research finds that the more time {{participants}} are afforded to form the impression, the more confidence in impressions they report. Not only are people quick to form first impressions, they are also fairly accurate when the target presents him or herself genuinely. People are generally not good at perceiving feigned emotions or detecting lies. <b>Research</b> <b>participants</b> who reported forming accurate impressions of specific targets did {{tend to have more}} accurate perceptions of specific targets that aligned with others' reports of the target. Individuals are also fairly reliable at understanding the first impression that he/she will project to others.|$|E

For the empirical analyses, the natural logarithm (ln) of the number of family members of a <b>research</b> <b>participant</b> was calculated. Larger family size can lead to conflict about the distribution of assets if the asset holder dies intestate. In addition, Indian society is collectivistic and promotes social cohesion and interdependence (Chadda and Deb 2013); therefore, family size influences the estate planning decisions of individuals in India.|$|R

2500|$|A {{more direct}} {{test of the}} {{relationship}} between the Bereitschaftspotential and the [...] "awareness of the intention to move" [...] was conducted by Banks and Isham (2009). In their study, participants performed a variant of the Libet's paradigm in which a delayed tone followed the button press. Subsequently, <b>research</b> <b>participants</b> reported the time of their intention to act (e.g., Libet's [...] "W"). [...] If W were time-locked to the Bereitschaftspotential, W would remain uninfluenced by any post-action information. [...] However, findings from this study show that W in fact shifts systematically with the time of the tone presentation, implicating that W is, at least in part, retrospectively reconstructed rather than pre-determined by the Bereitschaftspotential.|$|E
2500|$|Online {{profiles}} {{and communication}} channels such as email provide fewer cues than in-person interactions, which makes targets {{more difficult to}} understand. [...] When <b>research</b> <b>participants</b> were asked to evaluate a person's facial attractiveness and perceived ambition based on an online dating profile, amount of time permitted for processing and reporting {{an evaluation of the}} target produced a difference in impression formation. Spontaneous evaluations relied on physical attractiveness almost exclusively, whereas deliberate evaluations weighed both types of information. Although deliberate evaluations used the information provided on both physical attractiveness and ambition of each target, the particular impact of each kind of information appeared to depend on the consistency between the two. A significant effect of attractiveness on deliberate evaluations was found only when perceived ambition was consistent with the perceived level of attractiveness. The consistency found in profiles seemed to particularly influence deliberate evaluations.|$|E
2500|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and <b>research</b> <b>participants</b> realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the <b>research</b> <b>participants.</b> The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E

This research began to drive the evolution of the practice of both paramedics and the emergency physicians who oversaw their work; changes to procedures and protocols began to occur only after significant outcome-based research demonstrated their need.

40|$|William James (1950 / 1890) insisted {{repeatedly}} {{that it was}} fallacious {{to assume that the}} <b>research</b> <b>participant's</b> experience was to be understood in terms of the readily-available categories of the researcher. The psychologist's fallacy (of which all researchers concerned with experience may fall foul, not only psychologists) involves a confusion of the standpoints of the researcher and the researched. The “subjective world” of the <b>research</b> <b>participant</b> must be understood in its own terms. In this paper, I review debates in the history of phenomenology which show the diffi culty of thoroughly incorporating James's insight, and outline some tendencies in contemporary qualitative research which seem to make the error James pointed out: ? Impoverished account of experience, neglecting the horizon of the lifeworld. ? Emphasiz on the noesis—the mental orientation of the person—and neglect of the noema—the thing that is experienced. ? Treating a feature which is found in the subjective world of a <b>research</b> <b>participant</b> as an outcome of an “objective situation”. The strongest line of phenomenological thinking which illuminates the issue is Merleau-Ponty's treatment of our embodied membership of the world: “fl esh”. This brings out the radicality of the notion of intentionality: collapsing the objective/subjective divide. The world is one's lifeworld; “fl esh of my fl esh”...|$|R
