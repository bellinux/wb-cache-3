Even among educators, favorable attitudes toward the use of CP are prevalent. We measured education majors beliefs about CP before and after they read about CP research on its effectiveness and side effects. Students who changed their behavioral intent regarding whether they would use CP as a parent increased their knowledge about its ineffectiveness, resulting in greater consistency between their moral and informational beliefs (Wainryb, 1998).

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out some sectors that cause exceptional dissimilarity among the production {{structures of the}} countries. Sector # 2 “Mining and quarrying” in Japan is located at a very higher position as compared to China and the U.S., since the mining and quarrying sector in Japan operates on a much smaller scale than in China and the U.S. Moreover, the positions of service-producing sectors such as sector # 26 “Other supporting and auxiliary transport activities; activities of travel agencies,” sector # 27 “Post and telecommunications,” and sector # 34 “Other community, social, and personal services” are relatively high in China (13 th, 14 th, and 15 th position, respectively), while they are lower in Japan (17 th, 18 th, and 22 nd position, respectively), and further lower in the U.S. (26 th, 27 th, and 28 th position, respectively). This may indicate {{that the importance of}} these sectors as infrastructural service industries is the highest in the U.S., followed by Japan, and least in China.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} the long-standing discussion whether clitics in clitic doubling constructions should be <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>similar</b> to affixes expressing subject-verb agreement or rather as reflexes of movement. A crosslinguistic comparison of clitics {{will show that}} although clitics come in different flavors either as phi-features or as determiners, they are all {{the result of an}} overt feature movement to repair violations of the Minimal Link Constraint (Anagnostopoulou 2005). Long Distance Agree constructions in Greek, Romanian and Spanish use clitic doubling as a strategy to avoid minimality effects. On the basis of a parallel between clitic doubling and Long Distance Agree, I conclude that they are the outcome of two different operations Move vs. Agree but both are sensitive to Minimal Link Constraint and are regulated by a phase-based locality condition (the Phase Impenetrability Condition) ...|$|E
30|$|The GMM is {{essentially}} a shallow architecture of neural network which contains at most one layer of nonlinear feature transformation and is shown to offer good performance in source separation for anechoic mixtures [10] or mixtures with a relatively low level of reverberation. The shallow architecture, however, has a limited representation ability, which may cause performance degradation when applied in the complex real-world problems, such as speech separation in highly reverberant environments. Recent studies in speech recognition have shown that a deep architecture with more hidden layers can increase the representation abilities of a neural network, {{and it can be}} used to build internal representation for rich sensory data [11 – 14]. The deep architecture is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>similar</b> to the hierarchical structures within human visual and auditory systems, where the raw image or speech waveforms are transformed to a high-order linguistic level by these hierarchical structures [15 – 18]. The deep structure has the potential to reduce the performance gap between the human auditory system and machine listening system, as shown in recent works in the area of natural language processing and speech recognition systems [19 – 22]. The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in these applications inspires us to investigate its potential for improving the performance of stereo speech source separation algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Corporate limited {{liability}} {{has a long}} and contentious history, stretching back to the mid- 19 th century and beyond. Initially being hailed {{as one of the}} decisive legal invention of our age, recently scholars have highlighted the negative effects of curtailing liability. This in turn has inspired research in the historical origins of liability. While the debate on the adoption of {{limited liability}} for joint stock companies in Britain and the United States in the 19 th century is comparatively well documented, {{little is known about the}} contemporary German debate. Thus, this paper aims to shed light on the debate within the Prussian Government which surrounded the Stock Corporation Act of 1843. Drawing on primary sources of the debate within the Prussian administration in the course of the legislative process, it tries to examine whether limited liability was indeed seen as a prerequisite for the existence of joint-stock companies as its supporters claim. I find that in line with British and American experience limited liability was not universally seen as a necessary condition for incorporated joint-stock companies. In fact, the course of the debate suggests that limited liability was finally introduced because the administration wrongly assumed that joint stock companies always comprised a large number of shareholders with little equity each, being obviously unaware of the possibility of joint stock companies being dominated by large shareholders and institutional investors. Moreover, limited liability for shareholders was <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>similar</b> to that of passive sleeping partners, a justification that seems problematic in the light of today's virtually all powerful institutional investors.

40|$|An {{orphan drug}} is a {{medicinal}} product {{intended for the}} treatment of a rare disease that affects {{only a small number of}} patients, e. g., five in ten thousand. According to the current European orphan drug legislation, the European Union shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another orphan medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. Thus far, the European Medicines Agency has used human judgments of similarity when assessing new medicines for rare diseases. The project reported here seeks to develop quantitative methods for this purpose. The project began with an analysis of the correlation between human and computed judgments of similarity for 100 pairs of molecules chosen from the Drug Bank 3. 0 database. The human similarity assessments for these pairs of molecules were obtained from a total of 143 experts from Europe, Asia and the US, with the experts being asked to state whether each pair was, or was not, similar. The percentage of the experts judging a pair to be similar was then compared to the Tanimoto coefficient computed using a range of different types of descriptors (1 D, 2 D and 3 D), with the aim of identifying those descriptors that correlated most closely with the human judgments. The following types of fingerprint were studied: ECFP 4, ECFC 4, Daylight, Unity, BCI, MDL as implemented in the Pipeline Pilot system; and CDK Extended, CDK Standard, Estate, PubChem, MACCS, Morgan, Feat Morgan, Atom Pair, Torsion, RDKit, Avalon, Layers, FP:TGD and FP:TGT as implemented in the KNIME system. The 3 D fingerprints studied were the following: FP:TAD and FP:TAT as implemented in the KNIME protocol. 1 D molecular property descriptors were also studied but these proved to be of only limited effectiveness for this application. Logistic regression models were developed for each type of descriptor, relating the Tanimoto similarity for a pair of molecules computed with the probability of the human experts <b>regarding</b> that pair <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>similar.</b> The resulting regression models were then validated using a separate test-set containing 100 pairs of molecules that had previously been evaluated by the European Medicines Agency in the context of the authorisation of medicines for rare diseases. The best models were able to reproduce over 95...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, {{a forest}} bathing trip, called “Shinrinyoku” in Japanese, is a short, leisurely {{visit to a}} forest; it is <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>similar</b> to natural aromatherapy. This review focuses {{on the effects of}} forest bathing trips on human immune function. Beginning in 2005, adult Japanese individuals, both male and female, participated in a series of studies aimed at {{investigating}} the effect of forest bathing trips on human immune function. The subjects experienced a 3 -day/ 2 -night trip to forest areas, and blood and urine were sampled on days 2 (the first sampling during each trip) and 3 (the second sampling during each trip), and on days 7 and 30 after the trips. Natural killer (NK) activity, the numbers of NK, granulysin-, perforin-, and granzymes A/B-expressing lymphocytes in the blood, and the concentration of urinary adrenaline were measured. The same measurements were made before the trips on a normal working day as a control. The mean values of NK activity and the numbers of NK, granulysin-, perforin-, and granzymes A/B-expressing cells on forest bathing days were significantly higher than those on the control days, whereas the mean values of the concentration of urinary adrenaline on forest bathing days were significantly lower than that on the control days in both male and female subjects. The increased NK activity lasted for more than 30  days after the trip, suggesting that a forest bathing trip once a month would enable individuals to maintain a higher level of NK activity. In contrast, a visit to the city as a tourist did not increase NK activity, the numbers of NK cells, or the level of intracellular granulysin, perforin, and granzymes A/B. These findings indicate that forest bathing trips resulted in an increase in NK activity, which was mediated by increases in the number of NK cells and the levels of intracellular granulysin, perforin, and granzymes A/B...|$|E
