40|$|Abstract. Theoretic and {{experimental}} studies have proven {{that the use}} of infrared radiation for drying fruit and berry raw materials allows keeping biologically active substances (BAS) in the product to the maximum. The main goal of designing dryers with the use of infrared radiation lies in achieving even distribution of the thermal flow from the IR radiation generator to the <b>receiving</b> surface (<b>trays</b> with the product), as well as between them. The film electric heating unit (PLEN), which is resistant to temperature and humidity, is recommended to be used for designing IR dryers, and the PET Maker insulating material allows withstanding voltage drops. The experimental dryer for researching drying processes of plant, fruit and berry raw materials has been designed. In order to evaluate the evenness of the thermal flow distribution on receiving surfaces there was used the TracePro software, which models the process {{on the grounds of the}} optics laws, in particular on those, which are based on the statement – the beam tilt angle is equal to the angle of reflection...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical performance of 16 % carbamide peroxide home vital bleaching, using trays constructed with or without reservoirs, and analyze the postoperative hypersensitivity. This was a randomized, double-blind and split-mouth study. Two examinators evaluated 11 and 21 teeth from eleven patients (Kappa 0, 75). Right side of upper stone models <b>received</b> reservoirs before <b>trays</b> were constructed, left side didn't. Home bleaching was performed through two weeks, 6 hours-day. After this time, 11 and 21 teeth was evaluated again by the same examinators. Patients were asked about postoperative hypersensitivity. Data were statistically analyzed by Fisher¿s exact test (p> 0, 05), and didn't show any statistically significant difference between trays with or without reservoirs. All patients related postoperative hypersensitivity during bleaching time. Home bleaching technique was effective on dental bleaching, with or without reservoirs on the trays. Home bleaching promoted postoperative hypersensitivity in all cases...|$|R

The 2008 Dominican Republic Military Games saw Contreras win the 58kg for the later crowned event champion, the National Army. In early March, she won three gold medals at the 2008 Pan American Championships, qualifying her for the next Olympic Games. For her 2007 year-round performance, the San Pedro de Macorís Guild of Sport Writers awarded Contreras in May, as her province [...] "Athlete of the Year". Before the Olympics, she had a two-month training in Bulgaria, trying to recover her legs strength. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she ranked 5th with a total of 204kg in the 53kg category, after being trained by the Bulgarian coach Konstantin Darov.|$|R
40|$|Processing tomato is {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crop of the Brazilian agribusiness and few researches have been conducted to evaluate the tolerance of this crop to saline stress. In this study, the effects of five levels of salinity of the irrigation water (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 dS m- 1) and three equivalent proportions of Na:Ca:Mg (1 : 1 : 0. 5, 4 : 1 : 0. 5 and 7 : 1 : 0. 5) were tested on the emergence and vigor of processing tomato, cultivar IPA 6. Seeds were sowed in expanded polystyrene tray (128 cells) and each <b>tray</b> <b>received</b> 1 L of water after sowing. The trays were piled and, four days after sowing, they were placed on suspended supports in a greenhouse. Irrigation was accomplished daily from the fifth day after sowing. Only dry weight of shoot and root was affected by sodium proportions, while linear reductions of the speed of emergence, stem length and the dry weight of shoot and root were observed with increasing salinity. Root was more affected than shoot by salinity and relative growth ratioincreased with salinity levels on the 14 - 21 days after sowing period, indicating that the crop showed a certain increase of salinity tolerance with the time of exposure to salts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{provision}} of small amounts of peat to piglets would influence behaviour and production. At approximately 5 days of age, nine litters <b>received</b> a <b>tray</b> of peat as enrichment, while nine others did not. All piglets had access to solid feed, which was used to compare substrate-directed behaviour. Piglets were weaned at week 4, and half of the pens in the nursery again received peat. The other half did not. This resulted in the following experimental design: peat/peat (PP), peat/no peat (PN), no peat/peat (NP) and no peat/no peat (NN). Each pen was observed for 4 × 1 min in the morning and also in the afternoon. During every minute the behaviour of each piglet was recorded continuously. The main behavioural categories were: foraging, exploration, playing, locomotion, resting, sleeping, biting and fighting. At 9 weeks of age the pigs were moved to the fattening unit, where no peat was provided. However, observations continued until the pigs reached slaughter age, i. e. until about week 24. Production results (weight, weight gain) and skin lesions were recorded from start to end. Piglets with access to peat performed foraging behaviour significantly more often than piglets without peat (P < 0. 0001). After weaning, the results suggested a greater influence of present enrichment than previous experience in the farrowing pen. NP and PP piglets showed significantly less manipulation of pen mates (P < 0. 005), less fighting (P < 0. 001) and less inactivity (P < 0. 0001). No effect on fighting or manipulation of pen mates was found in the fattening phase. Sleeping was observed more in the NP and PP groups (P < 0. 05). Lying was seen less in the NN group than in the other treatment groups (P < 0. 0001). No treatment effect was found on the frequency and severity of skin lesions. Weaning weight of P piglets did not differ from that of the control piglets (N). At the end of the weaning phase, PP piglets had a higher weight than NN piglets (P < 0. 05). PP piglets also had a higher weight gain during weaning than NN and NP piglets (P < 0. 05). The results suggest that providing small amounts of peat to suckling and weaner pigs could be an effective enrichment strategy to increase explorative behaviour and possibly reduce aggression time post weaning. It also had a beneficial effect on weight and weight gain of piglets. The removal of the peat during fattening led to more inactive behaviour, and differences in aggressive behaviour were no longer significant. Hence, a long term effect of peat supply was not observed. status: publishe...|$|R
