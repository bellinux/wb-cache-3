Statistical analysis was used to investigate the effects of this change in policy on the frequency of <b>financial</b> <b>issue</b> case security clearance investigations. The results of the analysis indicate that a reduction did occur in the number of <b>financial</b> <b>related</b> <b>issue</b> cases {{as a percentage of the}} total number of issue cases after the threshold change had taken place. As a result, resources are saved as case controllers, investigators, adjudicators, administrators, and secretarial staff spend less time, effort, and <b>related</b> travel on <b>financial</b> <b>related</b> <b>issue</b> cases.

40|$|One of {{the best}} ways to get {{expected}} results from information technology (IT) in a business organization is to have a close look at the financial issues related to it. Financial issues such as IT investment, IT costs, IT resources should be dealt with special care if any organization wants to get best result from its IT systems. The purpose of this research is to investigate the condition of IT financial issues such as IT investment, IT costs, IT resources, IT business value etc. in the selected seven organizations of Sweden and to have an understanding behind the condition. First of all, a survey has been conducted with nine IT managers from these seven organizations to get an overview of the condition of dealing with various IT financial issues. Then follow-up interviews have been conducted with four of those IT managers that took part in the survey to find out the reason behind the condition dealing with those IT financial issues. The results of the study show that most the seven companies do not have proper capital budgeting technique, benefit identification plan for IT investment. Most of them do not calculate all the IT related costs. Most of them have lack of knowledge about the business value of IT. Their knowledge of impact of IT resources is not clear. The study further shows why those seven companies are having that kind of condition regarding the IT <b>related</b> <b>financial</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|E
40|$|Energy is {{the engine}} that drives most human {{activity}} {{and is it}} very important today {{in the context of}} global warming and the high cost of energy. Yet there is limited research focusing on children's energy use in developing countries, including {{the ways in which they}} use energy, save energy and the factors that influence such activities. This is a serious deficit in energy literature and problematic because in the near future, today's children will make decisions about energy systems and climate change. This study gained insight into the ways in which Grade 7 children in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, use and save energy, and the factors that influence their energy saving. The study adopted a case study design, and mixed-methods approaches were used, including surveys, energy diaries, an interview and a focus group. The results show that children in Khayelitsha demonstrated a broad understanding of the concept of energy including topics on the environment, basis of life and thermal energy. The children displayed understanding of broader socio-economic, environmental and health issues as they were cognisant of national and community issues, such as limited energy access and the dangers of indoor use of coal. They had lower scores on more abstract and technical topics such as energy transitions and differentiating between renewable and non-renewable sources on energy. 86 % of the children in this study acknowledged the importance of saving energy, while more than 50 % failed to recognise the importance of caring for the environment and moving away from fossil fuels. The study results show that children use multiple sources of energy at home and that the majority of their energy activities were performed at home, followed by school and church. The children reported several energy consumption activities including cooking for others, using the kettle for bathwater and ironing their clothes - findings contrary to activities reported by children in developed countries. For some of the children, the results suggest that energy use may be accompanied by guilt as children want to reduce financial pressures at home, a finding consistent with existing literature. Energy-saving activities included switching off and removing appliances from the wall plug. Children were found to be motivated to save energy by several factors, of which financial considerations were the most dominant. The children demonstrate altruistic tendencies, as motivation to save energy seems to be influenced by the desire to help their families and communities. The study further identified that parents, the community, the school, peers and the relationship between the school and government departments had either a direct or an indirect influence on children. Parents with a positive attitude towards energy saving and the environment were more likely to talk to their children about energy saving, which tended to focus on <b>related</b> <b>financial</b> <b>issues.</b> A conceptual framework is presented to analyse the data, which incorporates existing psychological and sociological frameworks and theories used to explain energy behaviour in addition to theories on child development...|$|E

These challenges can be grouped into internal and external. Al Belushi and Bagum (2017) categorized the challenges into HR related (e.g. lack of managerial skills, lack of knowledge to hire <b>related</b> employees), <b>financial</b> management (e.g. lack of availability of credit, lack of long-term credits, working capital management issues, high cost of finance, lack of marketing budget), operations management (e.g. lack of accurate knowledge of outsourcing and supplier’s management, {{lack of access to}} latest technology), and marketing management (e.g. lack of marketing knowledge, lack of R&D to identify new markets and products). Similarly, Al-Mataani (2017) concluded that the challenges faced by SMEs are mainly bureaucratic related caused by rigid regulations, inefficient labor market, immature entrepreneurship education, and support policies. Further, there are certain pertinent issues related to the mindset that relates to the risk aversion culture, the lack of an entrepreneurial mindset, and undervaluing self-employment. The limited entrepreneurial mindset leads societies to fail to acknowledge and appreciate high achieving entrepreneurs by giving higher status to certain professions than successful entrepreneurs (Al-Shanfari et al. 2013; Porter 2004).|$|R

Because Canton was the only Chinese port open for the international maritime trade after 1760, the Company's trade in China was in effect a trade with Canton. The Canton Commercial System which shaped the Ch'ing Empire's foreign trade policy had another major feature, that is, only a handful of merchants, the Hong merchants, could deal with foreigners. Accordingly, transactions with the Hong merchants in order to procure tea for home demand became one of the Company's priorities in its Canton trade. This research thus investigates in detail the tea transactions between the EIC's supercargoes and the Hong merchants. In particular, the different tea-purchasing methods adopted by the Company are examined. Special attention is also paid to the system of quality control which presents a picture of how the Company developed an efficient system of tea purchases and struck a balance between organising an adequate supply for British consumption and maintaining quality. While developing an efficient tea-purchasing system, the EIC was also struggling to obtain enough funds to finance its tea trade without the needs to continue shipment of a large amount of silver bullion from Britain. The Company finally succeeded in making use of its increasing bargaining power and adopted a trucking system through which British manufactures were exported to Canton in exchange for tea. Indian sources of revenue and the private intra-Asian trade also {{played a crucial role in}} the Company's funding of its enlarged tea trade at Canton. The creation of these different flows of fund and their importance are in turn discussed in this thesis. This study also examines financial relationships between the EIC and the Hong merchants, and especially the strong position gained by the Company. Moreover, the condition of the EIC China trade after the beginning of the nineteenth century is highlighted because by then the dual-monopoly pattern of the Anglo-Chinese trade was facing a challenge. These different areas of discussion provide a comprehensive study of the Company's tea trade with China after the 1760 which helps us more fully to appreciate the EIC's position in the European-Asian commercial links in the early modem period.

40|$|Separation {{procedures}} in drug Distribution Centers (DC) are manual-based activities prone to failures such as shipping exchanged, expired or broken drugs to the customer. Two interventions seem as promising {{in improving the}} reliability in the separation procedure: (i) selection and allocation of appropriate operators to the procedure, and (ii) analysis of potential failure modes incurred by selected operators. This article integrates Learning Curves (LC) and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) aimed at reducing the occurrence of failures in the manual separation of a drug DC. LCs parameters enable generating an index to identify the recommended operators to perform the procedures. The FMEA is then applied to the separation procedure {{carried out by the}} selected operators in order to identify failure modes. It also deployed the traditional FMEA severity index into two sub-indexes <b>related</b> to <b>financial</b> <b>issues</b> and damage to company´s image in order to characterize failures severity.

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, the {{sustainability}} of community-based water supply projects in four different states in Sudan was assessed using a set of multidimensional indicators. A sustainability index was developed using a set of sustainability criteria including technical, reliability/risk, social, organisational, financial as well as sustainability. Basic sustainability criteria were selected based on literature review and stakeholders discussion. For each criterion a set of observable indicators was identified, in total 23 indicators were identified. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis and model development was carried out to identify main sustainability determinants for community-based water supply projects in Sudan. Partial least squares-path modelling {{was used to determine}} and quantify relationships between the sustainability criteria. The results showed that although all analyzed projects were relatively young projects (1 to 4 years), all projects showed low sustainability performance.

This paper first identifies the discontinuities in a worker's cash wage that must occur under the spot model if the pension plan has typical"cliff" vesting and early retirement provisions. The paper then calculates the pension benefits actually accrued, at and around the dates of eligibility for these benefits, by members of five pension plans in Canada.

In India, family controlled businesses account for 70 percent of total sales and net profits of the biggest 250 private sector companies. Family {{businesses are}} different from other businesses because of its unique setup and they {{play an important role}} in Indian economy. This dissertation attempts to find the various available sources of finance for family businesses in India and the difficulties that they face in raising or getting funds. The decision making process <b>related</b> to <b>financial</b> <b>issues</b> in the family businesses also falls under the research preview of the dissertation. The dissertation tries to build an understanding of family business and <b>financial</b> <b>issues</b> with the help of case studies and available literature on the topic. Qualitative research method is used to achieve the desired objective. Questionnaires are used to build the case studies and collect relevant data. Viewpoints of an independent analyst are also compared with the finding of the research so as to arrive at a valid conclusion. The single most important source of fund for Indian Family businesses is own finance and they go for external financing only when required. The second most significant source of fund is bank loans. The informal credit market is also an important source of short term fund requirement but it is mainly confined to small scale businesses. Some of the sources of funds are unique to a particular sector which may also play a significant role in growth and development of businesses in that sector like trade credit and interest free instalments from machinery suppliers in jems and jewellery industry. The selection of financial source depends upon the scale of operation. The financial sources used by medium scale businesses are different from those used by small scale industries. The dissertation also finds that financial decision making process differ from organisation to organisation depending upon the type of management system. The decision making process in family firms following centralised management system is different from that in decentralised organisation...|$|R

The study aims {{to find out what}} types of questions are constructed in Gotcha calls and to what extent would the negotiation of questions and responses show power in Gotcha calls. Thirty Gotcha prank calls <b>related</b> to <b>financial</b> <b>issues</b> were selected for the analysis. The analysis of the question-response sequences was done based on an adapted coding scheme by Stivers & Enfield (2010) and Wang (2006). The questions were categorised based on the functions of the questions in the conversation. Thus, the questions were grouped based on the social action of the question which was either to request for information, request for confirmation, to suggest, make assessment or initiation of repair. The findings show that request for information was primarily used to get facts related to the fabricated situations. Questions were also divided into Yes/No questions and Wh-questions while the responses were divided into answers, non answers or no response. The Yes/No questions restrict the responses and show authority while the answers prove to have the authoritative questions accomplishes its demands.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers, (Cuthbert and Cuthbert, various dates), we {{have been}} concerned {{with a number of}} aspects of the operation of the devolution settlement, particularly but not exclusively <b>relating</b> to <b>financial</b> <b>issues.</b> One of our concerns has been whether the interface between the handling of devolved matters by the Scottish Executive and the handling of complementary reserved matters by UK government departments works satisfactorily. Such an interface issue arises in the field of science: we concentrate here on a particular problematic example, the Scottish Agricultural and Biological Institutes (SABRIs). The SABRIs receive their core funding from the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD), that is out of devolved funding, but they are nevertheless clearly regarded as being an integral constituent of the UK science base. We ask in this paper whether the arrangements for funding the SABRIs and determining their research programmes are {{in the best interests of}} the SABRIs themselves, and more generally, in the interests of the wider Scottish economy. We conclude that there are significant weaknesses. First, the funding arrangements are sub-optimal in that almost uniquely among the core science base the SABRIs are barred from accessing Research Council and major charity funding. Secondly, the existence of the SABRIs in their current form has arguably distorted priorities within the Scottish Executive's overall support for science. Thirdly, and conversely, the SABRIs are not fully integrated into the planning and strategy arrangements for the UK science base. While this paper is concerned primarily with the SABRIs, the issues identified have wider implications for the public funding of research in Scotland and for devolution...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the various {{arguments}} {{that have been}} put forward for the determinants of a company's capital structure are examined critically. However, none of these succeeds convincingly in reflecting actual practice. Furthermore, {{it is argued that}} the common practice of concentrating on Earnings Per Share (EPS) as a key indicator of a company's performance also impacts on the capital issue choice, and that there is functional fixation on EPS, particularly short-term EPS. Therefore the effect on a company's EPS of a particular method of finance turns out to be an important influence on a company's financing decisions. A questionnaire sent to finance directors of companies elicits their views on their perceptions of the important influences on the choice of financing, and the responses are analysed using multivariate techniques. The results are encouraging as far as the present research question is concerned. An innovative approach of reconstructing company's financial statements to investigate the impact on various financial data if an alternative financing method had been chosen provides further evidence of a fixation on EPS. Limited dependent variable analysis is carried out to determine the variables which appear to influence the debtequity choice. A by-product of the research question is an analysis of 'elasticity' measures of gearing, i. e. degrees of financial and operating leverage; and the usefulness and consistency of the bases of measurement used for these. This thesis seeks {{to determine the extent to}} which financial choice is explained by, or at least consistent with, the maximisation of Earnings Per Share. In so doing, it seeks to provide a vital link between finance research and <b>related</b> <b>financial</b> accounting <b>issues...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{wastewater}} of {{one third}} of Ireland’s population is treated on-site using domestic treatment systems (DWWTSs) that usually consist of a septic tank and soil attenuation system. Within the past four years, the legislative framework for these systems has undergone a major change with a registration and inspection regime being introduced to identify legacy sites that will require remediation work, particularly {{in areas of the}} country underlain by subsoils of very low permeability. Against this background this study aims to assess the overall sustainability of existing DWWTSs as well as alternative treatment and disposal options. The results show that main CO 2 eq emissions are from the methane production in septic tanks. The reduced methane production in mechanically aerated secondary treatment systems was found to counterbalance the related emissions due to the additional energy requirements. In contrast, septic tank systems have the lowest construction and operational costs representing the most economically sustainable solution. Pressurised disposal systems are slightly more expensive but have the potential to reduce environmental impact on surface water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Clustered decentralised treatment solutions could be environmentally and economically sustainable but ownership, management and <b>related</b> <b>financial</b> and legal <b>issues</b> will need to be addressed and developed...|$|R

The researchquestions we aim to investigate in our study were the following:· What are the reasons for the small and medium sized Nordic fashion companies wheninternationalizing, and what are the strategies the companies use hereby?· What influences the small and medium sized Nordic fashion companies in their choiceof strategy and market to enter?· Which barriers of entry and problems do the small and medium sized Nordic fashioncompanies see as critical in their internationalization process and how do theyovercome these issues?In the research we especially took a look at the following areas that we found mainlyimportant for fashion companies in their internationalization process: The reasons forexpanding, the choice of market, the entry modes that are used and barriers and problemsthat occur in the process. We take a view on the theoretical models of the Uppsala Model,Helsinki model, Revised Uppsala model and Born-Global Theory to explain the strategiesbehind the small and medium sized Nordic fashion companies. We see that the growth of the company and the profit increase are the main reasons for theNordic fashion companies when expanding their business. The entry modes used by thecompanies are agents and distributors, and when choosing the markets the fashioncompanies are contact-driven and focusing first on markets that have a rather smallerdistance to their own domestic market.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to study and analyse the current trends in internationalisation {{of higher education in}} European countries; analyse the performance of the University of Bologna with regard to development and implementation of its internationalisation strategy as well as identify factors facilitating successful development of internationalisation and hindering this process. Methods. Theoretical methods – analysis of regulatory documents on development and reforming of higher education; documents of national and international organisations which activities are relevant to internationalisation of higher education; conference papers; and regulatory documents of the University of Bologna. Empirical methods – student surveys and interviews with the staff members of the University of Bologna, observation, methods of mathematical statistics. Results and scientific novelty. The study has identified and described the major recent changes in the process of internationalisation in Europe. The outcomes of the research reveal that internationalisation process aimed primarily at enhancing the quality of education and research has become a strategic focus of universities; emphasis is being given to providing all students with the opportunity to develop intercultural competencies. The results of the empirical study suggest that the development of internationalisation at the University of Bologna is focused on enhancing academic mobility of students, elaborating and implementing double / joint degree programmes, as well as developing international research activities. One of the factors driving this development is the development and monitoring of the implementation of the University’s internationalisation strategy. Difficulties in the implementation of this strategy are still <b>related</b> to <b>financial</b> <b>issues,</b> as well as foreign language competency of students and professors and their insufficient motivation to participate in academic mobility programmes and international research projects. Practical significance. Material, presented in the paper, can be useful to staff members of international relations departments as well as people doing theoretical and practical research on development of internationalisation of higher education. The outcomes of the research can be used by Russian universities in developing and implementing their internationalisation strategies. </p...|$|R
