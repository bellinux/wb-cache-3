5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process. Andy does not know what he is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with no choice but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the subject's home, the Fab Five go through his belongings, performing a running commentary of catty <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state of his wardrobe, home decor, cleanliness and grooming. They also speak with the subject and family members {{to get an idea}} of the sort of style they like and their goals for the experience and to discuss the planned event.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers made {{positive}} <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's orchestral {{score and}} voice acting. Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that added choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones, though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic. Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little {{joy in the}} verbose dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes, but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with good quality. He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.|$|E

5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the {{beginning}} of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government officials will likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E

5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E
25|$|WNBC and WFAN {{were the}} flagships of Imus in the Morning from 1971 to 2007. He was dropped after his {{controversial}} <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Rutgers University women's basketball team but {{picked up by}} WABC later that year.|$|E
25|$|In April and May 2008, Jesse Ventura, {{in several}} radio {{interviews}} {{for his new}} book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, reiterated his concerns about {{what he described as}} some of the unanswered questions about 9/11. His <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the World Trade Center was demolished with explosives were also repeated in newspaper and television stories following some of the interviews.|$|E

25|$|Johannes Valentinus Andreä (1586–1654) — German theologian, and {{the real}} author of Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459 (Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz), {{one of the three}} {{founding}} works of the Rosicrucians, but not of the Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen über das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien (Readable and worthwhile <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> country of Ukkbar in Asia Minor) attributed to him in this story.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, De Witt {{is thought to}} have lent a hand in {{revising}} a major work by Pieter de la Court, published in 1662: Interest van Hollandt. The disparaging <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> stadtholderate in this work, which amounted to the assertion that princes (and by implication stadtholders) have an interest in keeping the world in perpetual conflict, because they wield more influence in such circumstances, incensed the Orangist public.|$|E
25|$|Disdainful <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> symphony being {{nothing more}} than a bombastic accompaniment for a bad war movie were voiced {{immediately}} after the London and New York premieres. However, in the cultural and political ear of the period, they had no effect. The American public-relations machine had joined the Soviet propaganda arm in portraying the Seventh as a symbol of cooperation and spiritual unity of both peoples in their fight against the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|Hiddink became {{manager of}} Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid {{in the summer}} of 1998, {{replacing}} Jupp Heynckes, but poor league form and off-pitch <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> board and finances of the club prompted his termination in February 1999. Hiddink then took over the reins at Spanish club Real Betis in 2000 {{for the rest of the}} season. His time at Real Betis would end badly, with Hiddink being sacked by May 2000.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2007, Wogan's home city of Limerick honoured {{him with}} the Freedom of the City at a {{ceremony}} in Limerick's Civic Hall. Because of his long absence {{from the city and}} unflattering <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> city in a 1980 interview, the local press carried out a vox pop, which resulted in support for the award. He was made an honorary freeman of the City of London in 2009, and invited to raise the bascules of Tower Bridge.|$|E
25|$|In June 1975 Adamson {{announced}} to the CBI grand council that he would resign and leave office in mid-1976; it was briefed that his departure was unconnected to the <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Relations Act. Adamson stressed that the job was demanding {{and it was time}} for someone to inject new ideas. Sir John Methven was named as his successor at the end of January 1976. Adamson handed over on 1 July; he had received a Knighthood in the New Year's Honours List of 1976.|$|E

25|$|He {{teamed up}} with Dave Cash for the Kenny & Cash Show, {{one of the most}} popular pirate radio programmes. His offbeat style and likeable {{personality}} quickly gained him attention, but in 1965 he was sacked after some outspoken remarks about religion on air. Like most of the pirate stations, Radio London carried sponsored American evangelical shows and Everett's disparaging <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> World Tomorrow caused its producers to threaten to withdraw their lucrative contract with the station. Everett returned six months later, however, before being given his own show by Radio Luxembourg in 1966.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
25|$|His {{comments}} {{have repeatedly}} caused controversy, and his acrimonious divorce in 2004 from Rachel Royce received much {{attention from the}} media. He was accused of racism for making <b>remarks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> African-Caribbean community and for the content of his posts to an online forum. A November 2011 article by Liddle in The Spectator about the trial of two men involved {{in the murder of}} Stephen Lawrence led to the magazine being prosecuted for breaching reporting restrictions. A court hearing was held in June 2012, in which The Spectator pleaded guilty to contempt of court and accepted a fine of £5,000 plus costs.|$|E
