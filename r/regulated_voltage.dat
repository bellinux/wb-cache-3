40|$|The {{increasing}} {{diffusion of}} distributed generation plants {{in recent years}} could introduce problems concerning voltage regulation in Medium Voltage (MV) radial distribution networks. Among the various control techniques able to perform voltage regulation, local sensitivity analysis based ones are suitable to <b>regulate</b> <b>voltage</b> profiles within standard limits. This paper presents a decentralized sensitivity based control technique able to <b>regulate</b> <b>voltage</b> profiles at buses where wind power generators are connected, taking into account capability curves constraints of wind turbines. The implemented control strategy allows voltage regulation avoiding, as much as possible, both disconnection of the wind turbine and reduction of active power production.

5000|$|For example, in the paragraph:"Zener diodes <b>regulate</b> <b>voltage</b> {{by acting}} as {{complementary}} loads, drawing {{more or less}} current as necessary to ensure a constant voltage drop across the load. This is analogous to regulating the speed of an automobile by braking rather than by varying the throttle position." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the output}} <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> must {{be higher than}} the {{available}} input voltage, no linear regulator will work (not even a Low dropout regulator). In this situation, something like a switched-mode power supply of the [...] "boost" [...] type or a charge pump must be used. Most linear regulators will continue to provide some output voltage approximately the dropout voltage below the input voltage for inputs below the nominal output voltage until the input voltage drops significantly.|$|E
50|$|Low-dropout (LDO) {{regulators}} work in {{the same}} way as all linear voltage regulators. The main difference between LDO and non-LDO regulators is their schematic topology. Instead of an emitter follower topology, low-dropout regulators use open collector or open drain topology. In this topology, the transistor may be easily driven into saturation with the voltages available to the regulator. This allows the voltage drop from the unregulated voltage to the <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> to be as low as the saturation voltage across the transistor.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the glow}} {{discharge}} is a [...] "statistical" [...] process, {{a certain amount}} of electrical noise is introduced into the <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> as the level of ionization varies. In most cases, this could be easily filtered out by placing a small capacitor in parallel with the VR tube or using an RC decoupling network downstream of the VR tube. Too large a capacitance (>0.1μF for an 0D3, for instance), however, and the circuit will form a relaxation oscillator, definitely ruining the voltage regulation and possibly causing the tube to fail catastrophically.|$|E

50|$|In electronics, {{a linear}} {{regulator}} {{is a system}} used to maintain a steady voltage. The resistance of the regulator varies {{in accordance with the}} load resulting in a constant output voltage. The regulating device is made to act like a variable resistor, continuously adjusting a voltage divider network to maintain a constant output voltage and continually dissipating the difference between the input and regulated voltages as waste heat. By contrast, a switching regulator uses an active device that switches on and off to maintain an average value of output. Because the <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> of a linear regulator must always be lower than input voltage, efficiency is limited and the input voltage must be high enough to always allow the active device to drop some voltage.|$|E
50|$|The {{sequential}} shunt unit (SSU) {{is designed}} to coarsely regulate the solar power collected during periods of insolation—when the arrays collect power during sun-pointing periods. A sequence of 82 separate strings, or power lines, leads from the solar array to the SSU. Shunting, or controlling, the output of each string regulates the amount of power transferred. The <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> setpoint is controlled by a computer located on the IEA and is normally set to around 140 volts. The SSU has an overvoltage protection feature to maintain the output voltage below 200 V DC maximum for all operating conditions.

A particular type of piston-cylinder, called Griggs apparatus, is also able to add a deviatoric stress on the sample.The principle of the instrument is to generate pressure by compressing a sample assembly, which includes a resistance furnace, inside a pressure vessel.

The designed controller addresses the problem of optimal coordination of controls with different response time and control characteristics. In our control design, the traditional voltage regulators (TVRs) such as on-load tap changers and capacitors are primarily used to <b>regulate</b> <b>voltages</b> in the network. If the control actions of TVRs cannot meet the control requirements, an event-triggered load-side aggregate controller will be activated immediately to help <b>regulate</b> <b>voltages.</b> The control schedules of TVRs are calculated through a multi-time step optimization based model predictive control method, and are updated {{with the help of}} wind power predictions. The load-side controller is realised by controlling active power consumptions of load aggregators through an optimal distributed algorithm that relies on local information exchanges between neighboring load aggregators.

The therapeutic application of pacemakers consists of numerous rhythm disturbances including some forms of tachycardia (too fast a heart beat), heart failure, and even stroke. Early implantable pacemakers worked only a short time and needed periodic recharging by an inductive link. These implantable pacemakers needed a pulse generator to stimulate heart muscles with a certain rate in addition to electrodes. Today, modern pulse generators are programmed non-invasively by sophisticated computerized machines using RF, obtaining information about the patient's and device's status by telemetry. Also they use a single hermetically sealed lithium iodide (LiI) cell as the battery. The pacemaker circuitry includes sense amplifiers to detect the heart's intrinsic electrical signals, which are used to track heart activity, rate adaptive circuitry, which determine the need for increased or reduced pacing rate, a microprocessor, memory to store the parameters, telemetry control for communication protocol and power supplies to provide <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{stall warning}} system {{utilizes}} a stall warning vane {{on each side}} of the nose. The vanes provide <b>regulated</b> <b>voltage</b> input to the angle-of-attack transducers, modified by a stall warning bias box to compensate for flap position. The angle-of-attack transducer supplies a proportional voltage to the angle-of-attack of the aircraft. When the aircraft speed is 7% above stall, the stall warning energizes a control column shaker that produces a low-frequency buffet signal through the control column to warn the crew. When both angle-of-attack transducer vanes increase to 5% above stall, the pitch servo commands an aircraft nose down attitude. The force applied in the nose down direction is 80 pounds at the control wheel. When the angle-of-attack transducer vanes decrease below the stall point, the nose down command is removed. An angle-of-attack indicator translates signals from the stall warning system into visual indications of the aircraft angle-of-attack and allows the crew to monitor the proximity of stall caution zone. The indicator face is divided into green (safe), yellow (caution) and red (danger) segments.|$|E
