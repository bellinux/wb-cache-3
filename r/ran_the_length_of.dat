5|$|When the {{original}} state trunklines were designated, an M-11 <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 {{by two of}} the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed from the highway system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|When the state's {{highway system}} was first signed in 1919, {{there was a}} {{different}} M-14 that <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This was later replaced {{by a pair of}} different US Highways in the 1920s and 1930s. Another M-14 was designated that lasted until the 1940s. The current highway dates back to 1956 when it was designated along a series of roads that previously carried US12. During the 1960s and 1970s, M-14 was moved to the freeway alignment it currently uses; sections of the former route are still maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as unsigned highways.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E

5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E

The remains of the top of the cross now lie at the base of the cross adjacent to the rock wall.|$|E
25|$|It had a circular-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage with a nose air intake. A range-only radar {{was fitted}} in the conical inlet cone {{of the air}} intake. The wings had a sweep angle of 55° at quarterchord. Two wing fences were fitted on the upper surface of each wing. The horizontal stabilizer was midway down the rear fuselage and two air brakes were fitted on its underside. The cockpit canopy was faired into the spine that <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> {{the top of the}} fuselage. The tandem undercarriage had a single wheel on the forward unit and twin wheels on the main unit with outrigger struts that retracted aft into wingtip fairings.|$|E
25|$|A pugio was {{a dagger}} used by Roman soldiers. It was {{probably}} a sidearm. Like other items of legionary equipment, the dagger underwent some changes during the 1st century. Generally, it had a large, leaf-shaped blade 18 to 28cm long and 5cm or more in width. A raised midrib <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> each side, either simply standing out from the face or defined by grooves on either side. It was changed by making the blade a little thinner, about 3 mm, and the handle was also made out of metal. The tang was wide and flat initially, and the grip was riveted through it, {{as well as through}} the shoulders of the blade.|$|E

25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the {{re-entrant}} angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted chambers are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} on the estate in the past was the {{presence}} of joyriders exploiting the straight main roads that <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the estate. To tackle this, the HAT employed a traffic calming scheme in April 1998. This was done by installing speed bumps, mini-roundabouts and narrowing road lanes. An issue for residents was securing their property from thieves and so the HAT provided burglar alarms and car steering locks. In February 1999, 59 Home Wardens {{were introduced to the}} estate to help protect property and forge links between residents and community groups. As they had no law enforcement powers, funding was provided for two extra police officers for three years. A centre was also set up for dealing with any reports of racial harassment on the estate.|$|E
25|$|The {{portions}} of MD 765 {{that form the}} old alignment of Solomons Island Road {{were part of the}} original state road constructed as in the early 1910s, which <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Calvert County from Solomons to Owings and continued north toward Annapolis. The highway was designated MD 2 in the late 1920s and extensively improved in the late 1930s and 1940s. The first portion of MD 765 was designated in the early 1950s when MD 2's bypass of Prince Frederick opened. Further sections of MD 765 were assigned between Sunderland and Owings when MD 2 was reconstructed north of MD 4 in the mid-1960s. All but one of the remaining {{portions of}} MD 765 were assigned following the relocation of MD 2-4 through Port Republic and St. Leonard in the early 1980s and through Lusby to Solomons in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Originally the Low German house {{took its}} {{simplest}} and basic form, the Zweiständerhaus or two-post farmhouse. This had {{two rows of}} uprights on which the ceiling joists rested. The two rows of posts <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the building and created the great central threshing floor or Diele characteristic {{of this type of}} farmhouse. On the outside of the rows of uprights, underneath the eaves, low side rooms or bays known as Kübbungen were often built with non load-bearing external walls. These Kübbungen acted as stables or stalls for the cattle and gave this type of house its alternative name of Kübbungshaus. A classic feature of the Zweiständerhaus is that the loft is not supported by the outside walls but only by the two rows of uprights that form part of the hall sides or walls.|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|The gardens at Beaudesert (designed by {{landscape}} gardener Humphry Repton) were quite large and {{extended from the}} hall to Castle Ring. A wide pathway called the Broad Walk <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the gardens. The lower end of Broad Walk near the hall had yew hedge on either side which had topiary {{in the form of}} 24 peacock shapes. From Broad Walk access could be gained to the terrace sitting room {{on the first floor of}} the hall, this was gained by the way of a stone terrace beneath which and supporting it on the lawn side were several stone arches. The most outstanding feature of the gardens was a chain of about seven lily ponds. The water would fall from the first pond high up in the garden and cascade by the way of waterfalls into the next one until the water from the last pool but one ran under a stone bridge and then cascaded into the pond nearest to the hall by the way of a 14ft high waterfall. The gardens were landscapes with ornamental shrubs such as azaleas, rhododendrons and mahonias, these are all still present today and contrast with the surrounding pine forest landscape. In 1937 Lord Anglesey gave 123 acres of land on which the gardens stood to the scouts, guides and other associations and organisations having similar purposes. The Beaudesert Trust was set up to administer the land. A camping site was opened on 2 July 1938 by H.R.H. The Princess Royal. Since then the camp has been used by the scout groups using the site.|$|E
