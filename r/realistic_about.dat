5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 70,027 spectators, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the second minute when Gary McAllister scored from a free kick after a foul on Danny Murphy by Roy Keane. Liverpool {{extended}} their lead in the 16th minute when striker Michael Owen scored. Manchester United scored in the second half through Van Nistelrooy but were unable to find the equalising goal in the remaining minutes. Thus, Liverpool won the match 2–1 to win the Shield for the 14th time. Despite the victory, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier was <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> his team's prospects in the upcoming 2001–02 FA Premier League. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was critical of referee Andy D'Urso's performance after he turned down two penalty appeals from his side during the match. Liverpool's victory marked their 14th success, while the match was United's fourth consecutive loss in the competition.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Strachan {{wrote that}} it is a cliché that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many {{professional}} soldiers anticipated a long war. Optimism is a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of a career as a peacetime soldier. Moltke (the Younger) was <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke (the Elder) was proved right in his 1890 prognostication to the Reichstag, that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven or thirty years' duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought and Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.|$|E

500|$|They {{arrived in}} Palermo on 20 July, and Murphy was sidelined by illness for a week. Allied {{capture of the}} transit port of Messina was crucial to taking Sicily from the Axis. En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before.

There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – I was never bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> taking care of myself financially.

500|$|Lucas's {{choice of}} {{background}} music {{was crucial to}} the mood of each scene, but he was <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> the complexities of copyright clearances and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for sound-alikes. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher {{the same amount of}} money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas's first choices, but not to RCA—with the consequence that Elvis Presley is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Clearing the music licensing rights had cost approximately $90,000, and as a result there was no money left for a traditional film score. [...] "I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama," [...] Lucas later explained.|$|E

[...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] He once told a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort". [...] Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming [...] "cramped by premature specialisation".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reception. According to Darrell Giles of The Courier Mail, several American critics [...] characterized it as {{the best}} episode of the show. Jason Steele of the Chicago Tribunes RedEye named it one of his three favorite episodes of Will & Grace. Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk wrote that the episode was hilarious. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Damon's spunky appearance... as a straight guy posing as homosexual and competing with Jack (Sean Hayes) for a spot in a gay men's choir. The show is endlessly imaginative in the ways it explores themes like this with a humor that doesn't betray or belittle its core gay characters." [...] Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News was less positive about the episode, stating that it [...] "plays like bad camp. There's nothing <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> it— seem more like the inhabitants of a lame Saturday Night Live sketch than marginally real characters." [...] He also noted that [...] "the extent of the tastelessness of the sex talk and Karen faking a sexual encounter is amazing." ...|$|E

She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. Now we can see how hard we need to work to be really good." ...|$|E
500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination".

[...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|Nicola Muscat was the {{youngest}} person to compete for Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. She had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games.

Before the Games she said, [...] "Competing at international competitions makes you learn to be <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> winning and making achievable aims.

[...] Muscat was drawn in the event's fifth heat on 3 August, finishing fourth out of eight athletes, with a time of 27.22 seconds. She finished in front of Jessica Teixeira Vieira of Mozambique (27.39 seconds) and Jordan's Talita Baqlah (27.45 seconds) but behind Chinyere Pigot from Suriname (26.30 seconds) in a heat led by Rūta Meilutytė of Lithuania (25.55 seconds).

2500|$|One of John Smith's main {{incentives}} {{in writing}} about his New World experiences and observances was to promote the colonization of the New World by England. Many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but Smith {{was not one to}} exaggerate the facts. He was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that what was truly abundant within America was monetary opportunity in the form of industry.< Smith was <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> his proposition for colonization and the benefits that it could yield. He recognized that no [...] "other motive [...] wealth…would draw [...] from their ease and humours at home".

2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E

2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes {{you feel as if you}} [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
60|$|As I {{considered}} {{these things}} a deepening disquiet possessed me, and my thoughts were {{far away from}} where I stood. After all, the English did not indulge in this doubling of parts and muddling of mistaken identity in their real and unique success in India. They may have been wrong or right but they were <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> Moslems and Hindoos; they did not say Moslems were Hindoos, or send a highly intelligent Hindoo from Oxford to rule Moslems as an Englishman. They may not have cared for things like the ideal of Zionism; but they understood the common sense of Zionism, the desirability of distinguishing between entirely different things. But I remembered that of late their tact had often failed them even in their chief success in India; and that every hour brought worse and wilder news of their failure in Ireland. I remembered that in the Early Victorian time, against the advice only of the wisest and subtlest of the Early Victorians, we had tied ourselves to the triumphant progress of industrial capitalism; and that progress had now come to a crisis and what might well be a crash. And now, {{on the top of}} all, our fine patriotic tradition of foreign policy seemed to be doing these irrational and random things. A sort of fear took hold of me; and it was not for the Holy Land that I feared.|$|E

50|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} Mariner and Apollo, the once-popular subgenre of <b>realistic</b> stories <b>about</b> a first expedition to Mars {{fell out of}} fashion, possibly due {{to the failure of}} the Apollo Program to continue on to Mars. The early 1990s saw a revival and re-envisioning of <b>realistic</b> novels <b>about</b> Mars expeditions. Early novels in this renaissance were Jack Williamson's novel Beachhead and Ben Bova's novel Mars (both 1992), which envisioned large-scale expeditions to Mars according to the thinking of the 1990s. These were followed by Gregory Benford's The Martian Race (1999), Geoffrey A. Landis's Mars Crossing (2000), and Robert Zubrin's First Landing (2002), which took as their starting points the smaller and more focused expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s, mostly building on the concepts of Mars Direct.|$|R
