5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the P. rebeli {{caterpillars}} benefit most when they parasitize off of the Myrmica schencki ant colony than any other ant colony. When Myrmica ant colonies encounter a period of food shortage, more P. rebeli caterpillars survive than if this food shortage were to occur in any other species of ant colony. This is because the P. rebeli caterpillars have a lower social <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> other ant species compared to their social <b>rank</b> <b>in</b> the M. schencki ant colony. This phenomenon is seen during times of stress, when some of the hungry P. rebeli caterpillars secrete compounds to attract attention from the ant colony it has parasitized. While the M. schencki ants are still fooled into believing that the P. rebeli are of their own brood, these compounds do not mimic those of non-host species' societies in other ant species, and thus, results in the P. rebeli being identified as intruders and killed.|$|E
