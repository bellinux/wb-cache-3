5|$|James Gilbert {{had seen}} film actor Bill Owen playing {{northern}} {{characters in the}} Royal Court Theatre and proposed to cast him as Compo Simmonite. Clarke, who initially saw Owen as an archetypal cockney who could not play as solid a northern character as Compo was meant to be, recognised Owen's potential only after going to London for a <b>read-through</b> with him.|$|E
5|$|The Moat Studios in London {{recorded}} Nebulous in stereo, {{with each}} half-hour episode typically taking {{one day to}} record, including <b>read-through</b> and rehearsal. Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, {{using a combination of}} synthesised effects from a Roland SH-101 and foley sound effects. Briggs also carried out the studio editing in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for radio trailers between programmes.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Druckmann {{was writing a}} film adaptation of The Last of Us, produced by Sam Raimi and distributed by Screen Gems. By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a <b>read-through</b> with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled The Last of Us Part II, alongside Halley Gross; Straley will not return to co-direct the game. In August 2017, Druckmann was featured as a guest judge on an episode of Face Off.|$|E
50|$|John Hurt was {{initially}} cast as former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain. However, according to Oldman, Hurt was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer, and {{was unable to}} attend the <b>read-throughs.</b> He died on 25 January 2017. Actor Ronald Pickup assumed the role of Chamberlain instead.|$|R
50|$|Writer {{and actor}} Juha Leppäjärvi was {{inspired}} to write An Act of Valour after a news-story some years back. He kept developing the script at Caravanserai Acting Studio, {{of which he is}} one of the original founding members, through <b>read-throughs</b> with other members and the resulting feedback.|$|R
5000|$|As recounted by George Stauffer, {{the next}} {{documented}} performance (not public) {{in the nineteenth}} century was when Carl Friedrich Zelter—a key figure in the 19th-century Bach revival—led the Berlin Singakademie in <b>read-throughs</b> of the [...] "Great Mass" [...] in 1811, covering the Kyrie; in 1813 he led <b>read-throughs</b> of the entire work. The first public performance in the century—of just the Credo section—took place in Frankfurt in March, 1828, with over 200 performers and many instrumental additions. In the same year in Berlin, Gaspare Spontini led the Credo section, adding 15 new choral parts and numerous instruments. A number of performances of sections of the Mass took place in the following decades in Europe, but the first attested public performance of the Mass in its entirety took place in 1859 in Leipzig, with Karl Riedel and the Riedel-Verein.|$|R
5|$|On March 6, 2014, Sony {{announced}} that Screen Gems will distribute a film adaptation of The Last of Us, written by Druckmann and produced by Sam Raimi. By January 2015, Druckmann {{had written the}} script's second draft, and performed a <b>read-through</b> with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} about £1million per episode (totalling US$9.6million) allowed 20 {{shooting}} weeks of {{five days to}} film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of {{the cast and crew}} gathered for the script <b>read-through,</b> followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast and}} crew {{assembled}} in the Bridge Lounge at the BBC Television Centre for the <b>read-through</b> of all six episodes from the final series on 30 June 2000. Nine days later they moved to Bournemouth to film some exterior sequences. One Foot had used Bournemouth since the show's beginning because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and lower costs compared to filming in the capital. The exterior scenes of the Meldrews' home were filmed, {{as they had been}} since series two, at Tresillian Way in Walkford (a village near New Milton in Hampshire).|$|E
500|$|Chico {{was often}} late for rehearsals, so Perrin {{would have to}} stand in {{for him on the}} <b>read-throughs.</b> When Chico {{eventually}} made his appearance, Perrin remembers, [...] "he'd be reading Ravelli's lines and Groucho would tell him to stop [...] 'show him how the line should be read'. My Italian accent was better than Chico's, you see. But Chico didn't care." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her sons Douglas and Allan have {{launched}} an endowment fund in her memory. The Elizabeth Mawson Theatre Legacy Fund will ensure support {{is available for}} scriptwriters, choreographers, performers, songwriters and directors {{and make sure that}} <b>read-throughs</b> and workshops are made possible for new development projects at The Charlottetown Festival. The fund is held within The Confederation Centre of the Arts Foundation http://www.confederationcentre.com/en/foundation.php ...|$|R
5|$|When {{writing for}} Vince the writers blanked {{out all of}} the {{characters}} swearing like it is done on the show, {{but when it came to}} recording the programme the swear words had to be put in for Kaye to read them. During <b>read-throughs</b> of the scripts, a toy horn was honked whenever Kaye swore to give an idea of what it would sound like during the programme.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} mutant alleles {{with changes in}} the coding region have been identified. A <b>read-through</b> gene, INS-IGF2, {{overlaps}} with this gene at the 5' region and with the IGF2 gene at the 3' region.|$|E
25|$|The {{script for}} an {{upcoming}} episode would be delivered to the cast late in the week, with a <b>read-through</b> the following Monday, awkward lines or other problems being noted for rewrites. On Tuesday afternoon, the script was rehearsed in its entirety for the camera and lighting crew. Over the following three days, individual scenes would be filmed with a single camera.|$|E
25|$|For Kelly Kapowski, {{the love}} {{interest}} of both Zack and Slater, producers {{were able to}} narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for Good Morning, Miss Bliss and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, {{would be a more}} reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a <b>read-through</b> with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped {{computer}} disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during <b>read-throughs.</b> Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.|$|R
5000|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, because we really admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some <b>read-throughs</b> with us. I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between and Webb and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the <b>read-throughs,</b> I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|R
5000|$|Maria is {{torn and}} reluctantly accepts. To {{prepare for the}} role, she accepts Rosa's offer {{to stay at the}} Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her {{memories}} of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their <b>read-throughs</b> of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloë Grace Moretz), has been chosen to interpret the role of [...] "Sigrid." [...] Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch from social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals.|$|R
25|$|Fungal prions are {{considered}} {{by some to be}} epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. PSI+ and URE3, discovered in yeast in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion. Prions can have a phenotypic effect through the sequestration of protein in aggregates, thereby reducing that protein's activity. In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of <b>read-through</b> of stop codons, an effect that results in suppression of nonsense mutations in other genes. The ability of Sup35 to form prions may be a conserved trait. It could confer an adaptive advantage by giving cells the ability to switch into a PSI+ state and express dormant genetic features normally terminated by stop codon mutations.|$|E
25|$|The {{script for}} the pilot episode of Freaks and Geeks was written by Paul Feig as a spec script. Feig gave the script to Judd Apatow, who sold it to DreamWorks, where Apatow was under an overall deal. That company, in turn, sold it to NBC, who quickly greenlit the script as a pilot. Before the script was shot, Feig wrote a second episode {{at the behest of}} Apatow. He showed this second script to Apatow and pilot {{director}} Jake Kasdan, and they suggested that he combine the two episodes to form a stronger pilot. Notable additions in this new draft included the introduction of the character Kim Kelly and Lindsay Weir's recollection of her grandmother's death. Feig wrote a final draft after a <b>read-through</b> with the cast, this time incorporating into the episode a first formal meeting between Lindsay and the freaks (in previous drafts, Lindsay was already considered part of the group).|$|E
25|$|Martin Crane {{was based}} on creator Casey's father, who spent 34 years with the San Francisco Police Department. The creators {{suggested}} to NBC that they'd like to cast someone like Mahoney, to which NBC told them {{if they could get}} Mahoney, they could hire him without auditions. Both Grammer and the producers contacted Mahoney, with the producers flying to Chicago to show Mahoney the pilot script over dinner. Upon reading the script, Mahoney accepted. Grammer, who lost his father as a child, and the childless Mahoney immediately built a close father-son relationship. In discussing Martin's nurse, Warren Littlefield of NBC suggested she be English instead of Hispanic and suggested Leeves for the role. Grammer was initially reluctant as he thought the casting made the show resemble Nanny and the Professor, but approved Leeves after a meeting and <b>read-through</b> with her. Mahoney and Leeves quickly bonded over their shared English heritage; Mahoney is originally from Manchester where Leeves' character is from.|$|E
5|$|A July 2015 {{sighting}} of Harington arriving in Belfast, a primary filming {{location for the}} series where other actors were arriving for season 6 script <b>read-throughs,</b> prompted further speculation about the character's return. However, a story in Vanity Fair pointed out that Charles Dance had been seen in Belfast the previous year after his character Tywin Lannister's death as well, and he only appeared in the first episode of the subsequent season as a corpse. Another photo that showed Harington on set in Belfast in a costume that varied from the Night's Watch outfit was published on September 25, 2015. A season 6 Game of Thrones promotional poster released in November 2015 featured a bloodied Jon.|$|R
500|$|Hennig {{believes}} character emotion {{grew from}} the [...] "production {{of the game}} {{as if it were}} a traditional movie or stage play." [...] The two lead actors were cast because of their experience on stage and film works. The cast had a large role in developing the characters. They were allowed to ad-lib dialog and participate in revising the script. The actors also read lines together on a sound stage, allowing them to play off of one another and organically grow the character relationships. Both games used the same actors for both motion capture and voice acting. The actors did a number of <b>read-throughs</b> and practiced to get the motions correct before capturing.|$|R

25|$|Most of Broadchurch series one {{was shot}} on {{location}} to heighten the reality and intimacy of the series, {{and because the}} Dorset coast was integral to setting {{the mood of the}} drama. The first cast <b>read-through</b> occurred at Bloomsbury Central Baptist Church in London on 7 August 2012. Principal photography began on interior sets at Vision Studios on 13 August 2012. Location shooting began the first week of September. Most location photography occurred in the town of Clevedon. Some scenes were also shot in the towns of Bridport and West Bay, and in the surrounding district of west Dorset. Three locations were used in the area around Yate, South Gloucestershire, and two in Bristol. Other filming locations included Shepton Mallet, Portishead, and Weston-super-Mare, and the villages of Eype and Flax Bourton. The oft-seen cliff where Danny Latimer's body is found, and which features heavily in the visuals of Broadchurch, is Harbour Cliff and Harbour Cliff Beach in West Bay. Many of the villages involved in the shooting of Broadchurch received a boost in tourism, especially in West Bay and Bridport.|$|E
25|$|Production on an SNL episode will {{normally}} {{start on}} a Monday with a free-form pitch {{meeting between the}} cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in Michaels' office, over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, {{the bulk of the}} work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts, a process which usually extends through the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8pm on the Tuesday evening. At 5pm on Wednesday, the sketches are read by the cast during a round-table meeting in the writers room, attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in an attendance of approximately fifty people. At this point there may be at least 40 sketch ideas which are <b>read-through</b> in turn, lasting upwards of three hours.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} of the <b>read-through,</b> Michaels, the head writer, the guest host, {{and some of the}} show producers will move to Michaels' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels' office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived. Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day, but will certainly commence on Thursday, work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches, and possibly rehearsals. If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at 8pm, again on Saturday before the live show. After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed. This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast. The opening monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Hurt was due {{to appear}} {{alongside}} Ben Kingsley in a film entitled Broken Dream, to be directed by Neil Jordan. In 2015, Hurt provided the voice of main antagonist Sailor John in the Thomas & Friends film Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure along with Eddie Redmayne (Ryan) and Jamie Campbell Bower (Skiff). At {{the time of his}} death he had completed filming two yet-to-be-released films: That Good Night, in which he played a terminally ill writer. Hurt was initially cast as former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain in Darkest Hour. However, Hurt was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer, and was unable to attend the <b>read-throughs.</b> After Hurt's death, Actor Ronald Pickup assumed the role of Chamberlain instead.|$|R
500|$|... "Amy's Choice" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Nye, {{who is known for}} writing the sitcom Men Behaving Badly. Nye {{attended}} <b>read-throughs</b> of previous episodes to capture the character and [...] "voice" [...] of the Doctor and Amy. Nye admitted to restraining himself in the change from comedy to science fiction, but said it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "hugely liberating". Showrunner Steven Moffat originally gave Nye the premise of the episode for it to fit in the series arc, which was to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship. Nye states that Rory's [...] "death" [...] scene is essentially where Amy realises her feelings for Rory. Nye wanted to prove that Amy really loved Rory, and he was [...] "not just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé".|$|R
5000|$|Clubrooms {{are used}} for <b>read-throughs</b> of plays, {{training}} and rehearsals other than full dress rehearsals to save the expense of theatre hire. Often they would {{be made available to}} other groups and community organizations. They may also be used for storage, maintenance and sometimes even preparation of programmes, scenery, props and costumes. Doris first rented rooms for this purpose in 1933 at 60 King St then moved to 112 King St in early 1934.and were still there in 1938 [...] when the building was destroyed by fire. They rented the first floor (US second floor) of [...] "Club Chambers" [...] at 175 Pitt St from July 1938 to mid-1939 when they took over the Coliseum and {{there was no need for}} a separate facility.|$|R

[...] "It not only showed how great their voices were together, but showed the power the music would have in the story." [...] However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with her co-star as [...] "nerve-racking". The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice. Regarding the songs that she performed in the film, Kristen said, [...] "We're singing the lovely songs of Kristen and Bobby Lopez, who wrote 'Book of Mormon.' So it's really, really funny music. It's really good music. They're amazing to work for." ...|$|R
500|$|On April 9, 2005, Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson {{were cast}} as the goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. Johnson, who was {{starring}} in the Canadian television series Instant Star (2004–2008), had auditioned to play Wendy's sister Julie; that role later went to Amanda Crew, who originally auditioned to play Erin. Johnson said that she wore a rocker jacket during her second reading and was in a bad mood. As she was leaving, the filmmakers called her back to read for Erin, with the dialogue in her scene being sarcastic. Johnson thought that her dry sense of humor, which the filmmakers caught, helped her land the role. Regarding his role, Lemche said that Ian [...] "spouts some interesting facts {{that seem to be}} just right there on the tips of his fingers". Lemche researched most of Ian's information. During <b>read-throughs,</b> he often asked Morgan about Ian's facts; to help him, Morgan wrote Lemche notes and gave him URLs to research the information Ian gives out.|$|R
