The <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> Kasiyanto discusses mainly focus on the EU Payment System Directive and the proposed changes of the directive. To some extent, it also touches upon the proposed directive on the network and information security. Firstly, security issues of both systems are scrutinized to highlight their vulnerabilities. Secondly, the existing <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> are assessed {{as to whether they}} suffice to address the challenges brought by the security vulnerabilities of both systems. Lastly, final assessment is conducted to seek whether the proposed changes of the frameworks are adequate to address such challenges...|$|R

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework.</b> An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a <b>regulatory</b> <b>framework</b> for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

40|$|What {{does the}} {{international}} legal examination of international (UN, European and network) <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> concerning (European) NHRIs {{tell us about}} the position of NHRIs towards the state in the multi-layered human rights system?’ This is the overarching research question this dissertation aims to answer. Accordingly, two common threads run throughout the dissertation: 1. the international legal approach to the study of NHRIs as bridge-builders in a multi-layered human rights system; 2. attention for the specific position of the state –and NHRIs as state institutions- {{on the basis of the}} analysis of the multi-layered regulation concerning NHRIs (which addresses domestic and supra-national aspects of NHRIs) The dissertation is divided in two overarching parts: Part I. The international legal analysis of international <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> concerning (European) NHRIs, encompassing 3 different but interlinked regulatory frameworks: 1. UN <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> concerning NHRIs 2. European (CoE, OSCE and EU) <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> concerning NHRIs 3. Network <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> concerning NHRIs Part II. Revisiting (European) NHRIs from the perspective of their multi-layered regulation, addressing three themes: 1. The multi-layered identification of (European) NHRIs 2. The multi-layered role of (European) NHRIs 3. The multi-layered status of (European) NHRIs Intermediary conclusions at the end of each chapter wrap up the main findings with regards each of the regulatory frameworks/ themes addressed. Overarching conclusions at the end of the dissertation bring together the research findings in a cross-cutting manner with special attention for the assessment of the position of NHRIs towards the state in the multi-layered human rights system. The main recommendations for policy-makers across the different <b>regulatory</b> <b>frameworks</b> studied are formulated, and avenues for further research are highlighted in the final conclusions too. status: publishe...|$|R

There are some NAS for which no safeguard seem to be adequate and which are therefore subject to prohibition.
