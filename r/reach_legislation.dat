25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new <b>REACH</b> <b>legislation,</b> the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E

In most of these frameworks, ecotoxicity studies used for risk assessment must undergo an evaluation of reliability and relevance, as described in detail in the REACH guidance. REACH defines reliability as “the inherent quality of a test report or publication relating to preferably standardized methodology and the way the experimental procedure and results are described to give evidence of the clarity and plausibility of the findings.” Relevance is defined as “the extent to which data and tests are appropriate for a particular hazard identification or risk characterisation” [5].|$|R

5000|$|Approximately 8.4 {{million tonnes}} of {{plasticizers}} are consumed globally every year, of which European consumption accounts for approximately 1.5 million metric tonnes. Approximately 70% of those totals are phthalates, down from about 88% in 2005. The remaining 30% are alternative chemistries. Plasticizers contribute 10-60% of total weight of plasticized products. More recently in Europe and the US, regulatory developments {{have resulted in}} a change in phthalate consumption, with the higher phthalates (DINP and DIDP) replacing DEHP as the general purpose plasticizer of choice because DIDP and DINP were not classified as hazardous. All of these mentioned phthalates are now regulated and restricted in many products. DEHP, although most applications are shown to pose no risk when studied using recognized methods of risk assessment, has been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, [...] and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's <b>REACH</b> <b>legislation,</b> which means that producers and users must submit authorization requests to the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to continue to use DEHP.

We need to ensure that the assessment approaches specified in the draft <b>REACH</b> <b>legislation</b> and Technical Guidance are able to evaluate EDCs efficiently.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an {{in-depth}} review performed by the European Chemicals Bureau in support of the development of technical guidance for the implementation of the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (<b>REACH)</b> <b>legislation,</b> and is {{one of a series of}} minireviews in this journal. Compared with the QSAR modelling of ecotoxicity, the modelling of mammalian toxicity is more complicated. T his is reflected by the relatively small number of QSAR studies on mammalian toxicity published in the literature. T he main problem is related to wide variations in the accuracy of the in vivo data, in the organisms used, and also in the complexity and poor understanding of the mechanisms involved, especially for long-term effects. Nevertheless, the efforts already made to develop QSAR models for mammalian toxicity demonstrate the usefulness of the approach not only for predictive purposes but also for a better understanding of the multiple mechanisms involved in the toxicity. However, there is a need to better characterise existing models in accordance with the OECD QSAR validation principles, to develop new models, and to investigate the applicabilities of individual models in the regulatory context, such as for the purposes of the <b>REACH</b> <b>legislation.</b> JRC.
