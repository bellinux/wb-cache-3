5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on September 26, 1913 and played in theaters throughout the United States. The unbilled cast list has been stated to include Lon Chaney {{in the role of}} the pawn broker. The propaganda film was billed as a popular love story by theaters, but the production was the subject of much concern by organized charities. The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood <b>Red</b> <b>Tape</b> of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use the media to highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn broker, claimed to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films. The film is now considered lost.|$|E

30|$|In {{the culture}} and arts field, a public {{performance}} center is the platform via which arts performance producers and consumers interact, and which culture and arts is promoted and developed. Most notably, it is the location in which local culture policies actually come to life. However, public performance centers in real life fall short of these expectations. According to Lee (2009 a)), they severely lack in professional manpower, thereby hampering active planning and execution of new projects by the performance center itself. As a result, these facilities are only passively utilized for rental revenue. Moreover, unnecessary or redundant administrative processes and <b>red</b> <b>tapes</b> thwart efforts to mobilize external financial resources. Finally, Lee (2009 b)) argues, public performance centers are overly fixated on increasing rents and only recruiting large-scale performances to secure finances, disregarding their roles as a space provider for local residents and artists.|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of controlling bird damage, especially to crops, may be both social and practical. The practical problems {{are subject to}} environmental and ecological factors.

Damage is often {{as a result of}} feeding and nesting activities. Control measures include both prevention of contact between birds and crops by erection of barriers, use of chemical repellents and scaring devices, and attempted reduction in numbers of pest species, by shooting and trapping.

40|$|In {{the past}} 50 years, a {{striking}} stylized fact {{has been the}} downward—or flat—trend of intra-African trade {{as a share of}} Africa’s total trade, while official development assistance (ODA) has experienced a noticeable expansion. During the same period, economic growth performances have not been consistent and robust enough to put a dent in the poverty level across the African continent in general and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in particular. Using a two-stage least square (TSLS) estimation technique, this paper finds out that intra-ECOWAS trade stimulates per capita income growth substantially more than foreign aid, which rather constitutes an impediment to that growth in most specifications. Additionally, comparable results are obtained when the scope of the study is expanded to include trade of ECOWAS members {{with the rest of the}} world. As a result, it becomes appropriate to suggest policy recommendations encouraging increased cooperation among member states in an attempt to (i) expand and build new cross-states infrastructures, aimed at boosting communications and telecommunications networks, (ii) accelerate the trade facilitation process by addressing administrative <b>red</b> <b>tapes</b> that balloon both transaction costs and delays in the flows of goods across borders, seaports, and airports, and (iii) develop and diversify the industrial base in member states...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge is a {{resource}} that is valuable to an organisation's ability to innovate and compete. It exists within the individual employees, {{and also in}} a composite sense within the organisation. Therefore, {{it is important that}} organisations find a way to tap into this knowledge and effectively manage knowledge processes in order to preserve and expand its core competencies to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the impact of human resource systems (HR planning System, HR Training System, HR Reward System, HR recruitment System) on the successful implementation of knowledge management processes (acquisition, application, sharing). Respondents consist of top/senior managers, human resource managers, and heads of departments in the Jordanian mobile telecommunication companies. A questionnaire survey was developed to collect data from respondents, a sample of 150 were selected according to a simple random sampling technique. Different statistical tools were used to test study hypotheses. The study findings shows that overall human resource systems have a significant impact on knowledge management processes. Based on the findings, the study suggest future research which can seek an enhanced understanding of the relationship of HRS with knowledge management processes in other sectors and other countries as well, since cultural differences exist among organisations, which influence employee perceptions regarding knowledge management processes. This study has implications for HR managers or decision-makers to create an organisational environment that encourages employee empowerment, integration and socialisation by eliminating all forms of barriers and <b>red</b> <b>tapes,</b> which can allow people to participate for new opportunities and foster a positive social interaction culture before introducing knowledge management initiatives.

50|$|The {{fact that}} the show is self-produced by Florence and Macleod's own {{production}} company has presented some issues of budget.
