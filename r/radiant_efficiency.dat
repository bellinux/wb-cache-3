By {{using the method}} developed in Clark Atlanta University, consistent and reliable infrared spectral results can be obtained. An accurate radiant energy can be calculated from these infrared spectra by using a blackbody as the calibration standards. By means of the specially-designed-and-lab-made sampling inlet and the Horiba gas analyzers, the compositions of CO{sub 2 }, CO, UCH, NOx and O{sub 2 } etc. from the combustion exhaust gases have been on-line accurately analyzed. The commercial natural gas IR burner performed differently in the different conditions. For the methane-air combustion, at the equivalence ratio {Phi} = 1, the IR burner produced its maximum radiation efficiency, {approximately} 31. 4 %, and the concentration of CO{sub 2 } reached its maximum value, {approximately} 10. 7 %. In the fuel-lean region, the O{sub 2 } concentration in the emission gas decreased proportionally as {Phi} increased, but the concentrations of CO and UHC were kept {{in a couple of}} hundred ppm ranges. In the fuel-rich region, the O{sub 2 } concentration was kept as a constant, {approximately} 0. 2 %, but the CO and UHC concentrations were quickly jumped to thousands ppm or more as {Phi} further increased. The NOx formation was mainly dependent on the combustion temperature, and reached its maximum, {approximately} 8 ppm, at {Phi}= {approximately} 1. Because of the uniform temperature distribution, the IR burner produced lower NOx than traditional gas burners. Nitrogen is a non-combustible gas. It worked only as diluent for the combustion, reducing the <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Propane has a higher molar combustion enthalpy. It produced a higher combustion temperature and NOx, while maintaining similar <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Hydrogen has a lower combustion activation energy.

40|$|Gas-fired radiant burners {{are used}} to convert fuel {{chemical}} energy into radiation energy for various applications. The radiation output of a radiant burner largely depends on {{the temperature of the}} combustion flame. In fact, the radiation output and, thus, the <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency</b> increase to a great extent with flame temperature. Oxygen-enriched combustion can increase the flame temperature without increasing fuel cost. However, it has not been widely applied because of the high cost of oxygen production. In the present work, oxygen-enriched combustion of natural gas in porous radiant burners was studied. The oxygen-enriched air was produced passively, using polymer membranes. The membranes were shown to be an effective means of obtaining an oxygen-enriched environment for gas combustion in the radiant burners. Two different porous radiant burners were used in this study. One is a reticulated ceramic burner and the other is a ceramic fibre burner.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{combustion}} devices {{is very important}} to society today. They need to be highly efficient, while reducing emissions in order to meet strict environmental standards. These devices, however, are currently not being designed effectively. The most common method of improving them is through parametric studies, where the design parameters are altered one at a time to try and find the best operating point. While this method does work, it is not very enlightening as it neglects the non-linear interactions between the design parameters, requires a large amount of time, and does not guarantee that the best operating point is found. As the environmental standards continue to become stricter, a more robust method of optimizing combustion devices will be required. In this work a robust design optimization algorithm is presented that is capable of mathematically accounting for all of the interactions between the parameters and can find the best operating point of a combustion device. The algorithm uses response surface modeling to model the objective function, thereby reducing computational expense and time as compared to traditional optimization algorithms. The algorithm is tested on three case studies, with the goal of improving the <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a two stage porous radiant burner. The first case studied was one dimensional and involved adjusting the pore diameter of the second stage of the burner.

40|$|The paper aims on {{evaluating}} {{and assessing}} {{of the influence}} of a shape of overhead luminous infrared heater’s burner on heat distribution to the ambient. These devices are mainly used for heating of industrial or other large space buildings. The contribution is based on comparison between the experimental results and created mathematical model. The latest experimental results show that the maximum of radiant intensity does not lay right below the radiant heater. Actually, there exists a ring of maximal values around heater’s midpoint axis. Results prove that instead of reflectors’ geometry, very complicated shape of gas luminous heater’s burner plays the most significant role in radiant heat transfer from the luminous heater. It was evaluated that the position of the radiant intensity maximum is around 10 ° from the radiating surface’s normal direction. All the findings can be summarized in conclusion that uniform distribution of radiant intensity required for thermal comfort of occupants can be maintained just by optimizing of the shape of radiant heater’s burner. Besides this conclusion, it is also apparent that adding the reflector actually increases summary radiant heat flux to the desired zone and therefore <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases.

40|$|With a {{surge in}} future demand for {{hydrogen}} as a renewable fuel, the specific {{aim of this study}} was to develop a novel strategy in photosynthetic hydrogen production from green algae, which is one of the cleanest processes among existing hydrogen-production methodologies currently being explored. The novel strategy designed was a spectral-selective PSI-activation/PSII-deactivation protocol that would work to maintain a steady flow of electrons in the electron transport system in the light-dependent part of photosynthesis for delivery of electrons to hydrogenase for photo-hydrogen production. The strategy would work to activate PSI to assist in driving the electron flow, while partially deactivating PSII to a degree that it would still supply electrons, but would limit its photosynthetic oxygen production below the respiratory oxygen consumption so that an anoxic condition would be maintained as required by hydrogenase. This study successfully showed that the implementation of the spectral-selective PSIactivation/ PSII-deactivation strategy resulted in actual and relatively sustained photohydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells, which had been dark-adapted for three hours immediately prior to exposure to a PSI-spectral selective radiation, which had a spectral peak at 692 nm, covering a narrow waveband of 681 - 701 nm, and was applied at 15 W m⁻². The optimal condition for the PSI-spectral-selective radiation (692 nm) corresponded with low cell density of 20 mg chlorophyll L⁻¹ ("chl" henceforth) with cells grown at 25 ⁰C. At this condition, the PSI-spectral-selective radiation induced the maximal initial hydrogen production rate of 0. 055 mL H² mg⁻¹ chl h⁻¹ which statistically the same as that achieved under white light of 0. 044 mL H² mg⁻¹ chl h⁻¹, a maximal total hydrogen production of 0. 108 mL H² mg⁻¹ chl which significantly exceeded that under white light of 0. 066 mL H² mg⁻¹ chl, and a maximal gross <b>radiant</b> energy conversion <b>efficiency</b> for hydrogen production of 0. 515 μL H² mg⁻¹ chl L⁻¹ that statistically matched that under white light of 0. 395 μL H² mg⁻¹ chl L⁻¹.

40|$|Porous radiant burners {{are used}} in drying, preheating, curing and baking {{processes}} in the manufacturing industry. Most burners presently used are of the surface flame type. Burners with flames stabilized inside reticulated (cellular, foam) ceramics are expected to offer possible advantages over these burners. However, little knowledge is available about the operating characteristics {{and the structure of}} flames stabilized inside porous ceramic radiant burners. ^ The objective of the present work is to investigate the global performance characteristics of the reticulated ceramic burners. A detailed study which includes the operating range, radiation efficiency, spectral intensity, exit gas temperature and velocity, and pollutant emission indices measurement has been carried out. Another objective is to study the flame structure of the submerged names by measuring the local gas temperature and species profiles. Results indicate that reticulated ceramic burners do offer a 30 - 40 % gain in radiation efficiency and a wider operating range than the surface flame type burners. Local temperature measurements show an upstream motion of the flame at the higher firing rates revealing insights into the flashback problem. Local species measurements show that the submerged flame has a much broader reaction zone than the adiabatic laminar flat flame. Measurements are also conducted on a honeycomb ceramic burner of similar porosity. The limited flame stability range of this burner highlights the importance of the tortuous flow paths for flame stabilization in the reticulated ceramic burners. ^ The present theoretical study involves asymptotic analysis using two approximations. The first method yields an equation that is mathematically similar to the adiabatic premixed flame propagation problem, and predicts within 15 % of the experimentally observed flame speed. The second approximate analysis involves the treatment of radiation from the burner as a surface phenomenon. The solid phase and the gas phase energy equations are solved asymptotically. The predictions of flame position are within 20 %, those for <b>radiant</b> <b>efficiency</b> are within 25 %, and those of measured peak temperature are within 15 % of the experimental data.
