40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} of privacy-preserving techniques for LBS is {{often based on}} simulations of mostly <b>random</b> user <b>movements</b> that only partially capture real deployment scenarios. We claim that benchmarks tailored to specific scenarios are needed, and we report preliminary results on how they may be generated through an agent-based contextaware simulator. We consider privacy preserving algorithms based on spatial cloaking and compare the experimental results obtained on two benchmarks: the first based on mostly <b>random</b> <b>movements,</b> and the second obtained from the context-aware simulator. The specific deployment scenario is the provisioning of a friend-finder-like service on weekend nights in a big city. Our results show that, compared to the contextaware simulator, the <b>random</b> user <b>movement</b> simulator leads to significantly different results for a spatial-cloaking algorithm, under-protecting in some cases, and over-protecting in others. ...|$|R

Epileptic patients’ heads are analyzed holistically to infer seizure and normal <b>random</b> <b>movements.</b> The patient does not require to wear any special clothing, markers or sensors, hence it is totally nonintrusive. The user initializes the person-specific skin color and selects few face/head poses in the initial few frames. The system then tracks the head/face and extracts spatio-temporal features. Support vector machines are then used on these features to classify seizure-like <b>movements</b> from normal <b>random</b> <b>movements.</b> Experiments are performed on numerous long hour video sequences captured in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at a local hospital. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system in pediatric epilepsy monitoring and seizure detection. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computational model, called the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model with latent joints (DPGMM-LJ), that can find latent tree structure embedded in data distribution in an unsupervised manner. By combining DPGMM-LJ and a pre-existing body map formation method, we propose {{a method that}} enables an agent having multi-link body structure to discover its kinematic structure, i. e., body schema, from tactile information alone. The DPGMM-LJ is a probabilistic model based on Bayesian nonparametrics and an extension of Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). In a simulation experiment, we used a simple fetus model that had five body parts and performed structured <b>random</b> <b>movements</b> in a womb-like environment. It was shown that the method could estimate the number of body parts and kinematic structures without any pre-existing knowledge in many cases. Another experiment showed {{that the degree of}} motor coordination in <b>random</b> <b>movements</b> affects the result of body schema formation strongly. It is confirmed that the accuracy rate for body schema estimation had the highest value 84. 6 % when the ratio of motor coordination was 0. 9 in our setting. These results suggest that kinematic structure can be estimated from tactile information obtained by a fetus moving randomly in a womb without any visual information even though its accuracy was not so high. They also suggest that a certain degree of motor coordination in <b>random</b> <b>movements</b> and the sufficient dimension of state space that represents the body map are important to estimate body schema correctly...|$|R

Because of this, diffusion is the primary collection mechanism in wet scrubbers for particles smaller than 0.1 µm.|$|E
