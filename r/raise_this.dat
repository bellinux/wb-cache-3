5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that {{it would be difficult to}} do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

25|$|American colonists {{initially}} {{objected to}} the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved. The British Constitution guaranteed that British subjects could not be taxed without their consent, which {{came in the form}} of representation in Parliament. The colonists elected no members of Parliament, and so it was seen as a violation of the British Constitution for Parliament to tax them. There was little time to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> issue in response to the Sugar Act, but it came to be a major objection to the Stamp Act the following year.|$|E
25|$|He {{also worked}} hard to provide {{financial}} aid to the Bourbons in the Spanish War of Succession. He demanded that the clergy turn over one tenth of their rents to the government. The archbishop strongly objected. When Fernández de La Cueva's term in office was extended, in gratitude he remitted two million pesos to the Crown. To <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> money, he resorted to shady methods, such as selling government positions. His remissions to Spain were so large that the government found itself unable to pay many police and other employees, and they were laid off. The streets and highways became infested with brigands.|$|E

25|$|Before his {{conflict}} with Rudolf of Habsburg, Ottokar exacted influence {{over a number}} of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the Margraviate of Brandenburg — and spiritual principalities, including the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Patriarchate of Aquileia. After the death of Konradin in 1268 he was an heir of the House of Hohenstaufen's claim to the imperial crown. However, he did not <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> claim, remaining content with informal influence in Germany. In 1267 he was appointed protector of the royal domains (of the Holy Roman Empire) east of the Rhine by the German king, Richard of Cornwall. He held this office till 1273.|$|E
25|$|George Grenville became prime {{minister}} in April 1763 after {{the failure of the}} short-lived Bute Ministry, and he {{had to find a way}} to pay for this large peacetime army. Raising taxes in Britain was out of the question, since there had been virulent protests in England against the Bute ministry's 1763 cider tax, with Bute being hanged in effigy. The Grenville ministry therefore decided that Parliament would <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> revenue by taxing the American colonists without their consent. This was something new; Parliament had previously passed measures to regulate trade in the colonies, but it had never before directly taxed the colonies to raise revenue.|$|E
25|$|It was {{determined}} by the Marines that a larger flag was needed to be seen more easily from the north side of Mount Suribachi, where most of the Japanese soldiers were located and heavy fighting would occur in the days ahead. In the afternoon, the replacement flag was brought up Mount Suribachi by the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for Easy Company, followed by four Marines from Second Platoon, Easy Company, who were to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> flag on top. The flag was attached to another Japanese pipe and raised and planted (as the other flagstaff came down) by the four Marines, the runner, and a Marine from Schrier's 40-man patrol.|$|E

25|$|By June 2015, an {{estimated}} 17,000 of Syria's once 80,000-strong Armenian population had fled {{the civil war}} and sought refuge in Armenia. David Babayan, spokesperson of the Artsakhi leader Bako Sahakyan, confirmed that some of those refugees had been resettled in Artsakh. The Economist put the number of the resettled families at 30 as of June 2017. In December 2014, Armenian media cited local municipal authorities in stating that dozens of Syrian Armenian families had been resettled in the disputed zone, in particular in the city of Lachin and the village of Xanlıq in Qubadli. Azerbaijan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Elmar Mammadyarov expressed his concern over Armenia's attempts to change the demographic situation in the region and informed of his intention to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> issue with the Minsk Group.|$|E
25|$|The First Anglo-Sikh War (1845–46) {{was fought}} between the Sikh Empire, which {{asserted}} sovereignty over Kashmir, and the East India Company. In the Treaty of Lahore of 1846, the Sikhs {{were made to}} surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the Beas River and the Sutlej River and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> sum, the East India Company allowed the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company. Gulab Singh became the first Maharaja of the newly formed princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, founding a dynasty, that was to rule the state, the second-largest principality during the British Raj, until India gained its independence in 1947.|$|E
25|$|As had {{happened}} during the First World War, when the Second World War began the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force {{was known as the}} Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). From the outset it was decided to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> force with little impact upon the militia, as it was felt that there was a need to build up the defences in Australia due to concerns that Britain {{might not be able to}} fulfill its pledge to defend Singapore if the Japanese were to attack. As a result, initially there was a cap placed on the number of militiamen that were allowed to join the 2nd AIF. Nevertheless, large numbers of militiamen did volunteer for service and in an effort to preserve the territorial identity of the militia units, many men from the 4th Battalion were allocated to the 2/4th Battalion, AIF, which was raised at Ingleburn, New South Wales, in October 1939.|$|E

[...] Part of [...] "The Negotiation" [...] involved Michael Scott reading the English Wikipedia entry on negotiations for advice in his attempt to fend off Darryl's request for a pay <b>raise.</b> <b>This</b> scene triggered a plethora of activity around that particular article, as viewers added their own thoughts on the subject.

500|$|Heseltine {{spent much}} of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham, with a party that {{included}} a young artist's model named Minnie Lucie Channing, who was known as [...] "Puma" [...] because of her volatile temperament. She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair. During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour, which included riding a motorcycle naked [...] down nearby Crickley Hill. However, his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure, lacking any clear sense of purpose. In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met D. H. Lawrence and the pair found an immediate rapport. Heseltine declared Lawrence to be [...] "the greatest literary genius of his generation", and enthusiastically fell in with the writer's plans to found a Utopian colony in America. In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall, where he tried, unavailingly, to set up a publishing company with them. Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled; when she revealed that she was pregnant, Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> unwanted child.|$|E
500|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{established}} a navy and colonies {{during the reign}} of Frederick William. The [...] "Great Elector" [...] had spent part of his childhood at the Pomeranian court and port cities of Wolgast (1631–1633) and Stettin (1633–1635), and afterwards studied at the Dutch universities of Leyden and The Hague (1635–1638). When Frederick William became elector in 1640, he invited Dutch engineers to Brandenburg, sent Brandenburgian engineers to study in the Netherlands, and in 1646 married educated Luise Henriette of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau. After the Thirty Years' War, Frederick William tried to acquire finances to rebuild the country by participating in oversea trade, and attempted to found a Brandenburg-Prussian East Indies Company. He engaged former Dutch admiral Aernoult Gijsels van Lier as advisor and tried to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor and princes of the empire to participate. The emperor, however, declined the request as he considered it dangerous to disturb the interest of the other European powers. In 1651, Frederick William bought Danish Fort Dansborg and Tranquebar for 120,000 reichstalers. As Frederick William was unable to <b>raise</b> <b>this</b> sum, he asked several people and Hanseatic towns to invest in the project, but since none of these were able or willing to give sufficient money, the treaty with Denmark was nullified in 1653.|$|E
