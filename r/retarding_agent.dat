40|$|Scanning {{electrochemical}} microscopy (SECM) {{is shown}} to be a powerful technique for both the measurement of local solution velocities through human dentine slices, in vitro, and for assessing quantitatively the effect of surface treatments on the flow process. SECM employs a small ultramicroelectrode (micron dimensions) as an imaging probe to provide information on the topography and transport characteristics of dentine, with high spatial resolution. In these studies the dentine sample is a membrane in a two compartment cell, which contains solutions of identical composition, including a redox active mediator (Fe(CN) (6) (4 -)). In the absence of an applied pressure, the transport limited current response at the probe electrode is due to diffusion of Fe(CN) (6) (4 -) to the UME, which depends on the probe to sample separation. Under an applied hydrostatic pressure, hydrodynamic flow across the sample enhances mass transport to the UME. With this methodology it was possible to accurately measure effective fluid velocities, by recording tip currents with and without pressure, and assess the efficacy of potential flow <b>retarding</b> <b>agents</b> for the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. For native dentine, the solution velocity was found to vary dramatically with location on the sample. The application of a glycerol monooleate - base paste treatment to the surface of dentine was found to lower local flow velocities significantly.

To enhance the acid performance and to minimize formation damage, this study provides a systematic investigation of the interactions between the Al-based retarded mud acid and clay minerals in sandstone reservoirs. Furthermore, for the first time, ??F NMR spectroscopy was used to follow the reactions of Al-based retarded mud acid with clay minerals. Solubility tests were performed to evaluate the retardation of the Al-based retarded mud acid when reacted with kaolinite, bentonite, and illite. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and ??F NMR were used to analyze the concentrations of key cations and components in the supernatant while the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were used to identify the reaction products and detect any precipitation. This study shows that AlCl? can retard the reaction of HF with kaolinite, bentonite, or illite at 75 and 200 ?F in Al-based retarded mud acid. Even with 5 wt% AlC?? 6 H?O added to the acid system, no AlF? precipitate was observed in any of the solubility tests.

W/O emulsion solvent evaporation technique was employed. Various release <b>retarding</b> <b>agents</b> were used to provide the analgesic and antiinflammatory action of aceclofenac for prolong period of time. Microcapsules were prepared at a fixed stirring rate of 1000 rpm. Polymeric solution containing aceclofenac was emulsified by light liquid paraffin (LLP) which was initially emulsified by 1 % (w/w of the continuum) lipophilic surfactant Span 80. The formulated microcapsules were evaluated for drug-polymer drug loading efficiency, micromeritic properties, surface morphology study, in-vitro drug release kinetics. It was found that all formulations showed satisfactory flow behavior. The maximum loading efficiency of was found to be 87. 42 %. SEM study showed that the microcapsules were discrete and spherical shaped. Efficacy of the dosage forms were evaluated in terms of in-vitro dissolution studies which showed statistically significant difference among the drug release profile from different polymeric blend as well as their increasing concentration. However, by increasing the polymer concentration, the rate of drug release from the microcapsules decreases dramatically. Drug release from all formulations followed Korsemeyer-Peppas kinetics and release mechanisms followed non-Fickian or anomalous type release...|$|R
