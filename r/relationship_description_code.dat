In a multihop mesh network, structured as a directed graph, all nodes decode and display reconstructions of the image (at possibly different qualities). Each node may also perform transcoding before transmitting data downstream in the network. The problem is {{the design of the}} coding and transcoding schemes to deliver the best image quality over the network. For a network with diamond topology, we show that multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> combined with Wyner-Ziv transcoding is often superior to other methods. We argue further that the benefits are magnified for larger networks containing one or more diamond subnets. Our image coding experiments demonstrate that multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> with Wyner-Ziv transcoding outperforms single <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> or multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> with conventional transcoding, for both a diamond network and a two-hop mesh network with four branches...|$|R

40|$|Multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> (MDC) has {{received}} a lot of interest lately, because it allows to split one source of information in multiple entities, where each of the entities is decodable in a stand [...] alone fashion.

Unfortunately the multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> comes with the price of higher bandwidth requirements.

40|$|Abstract—Multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> can be {{implemented}} as pre- and postprocessing to all standards for image and video communications, with obvious advantages. This {{can be achieved by}} generating two subsets from the original data; a controllable amount of extra redundancy between the descriptions has to be inserted to help the estimation of the possibly lost description from the received one. This redundancy can be in the form of spatial oversampling.

40|$|Abstract—Natural type {{selection}} was originally proposed by Zamir and Rose for universal single <b>description</b> <b>coding.</b> In this paper, we generalize this principle to universal multiple <b>description</b> <b>coding</b> (MDC). Two schemes based on random codebooks are proposed: one is of fixed distortion {{and the other}} is of fixed weight. Their operational sum-rate-distortion functions are derived, which coincide with the EGC (El Gamal-Cover) sum-rate bound if the parameters of the schemes are optimized. It is also shown that in both schemes the joint type of reconstruction codewords can be used to improve the rate-distortion (R-D) performance. Based on our theoretical results, a practical universal scheme is proposed by leveraging the MDC methods based on low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes. The performance of this scheme is compared experimentally with the EGC bound, which shows its effectiveness.

All multiple <b>description</b> <b>codes</b> to date assume the existence of multiple independent “on-off ” channels between the transmitter and receiver. Each link is either broken {{in which case the}} symbols or packets are completely lost, or it functions properly, in which case symbols are received free of errors. This channel model is appropriate for wireline networks, such as the Internet, it may not be applicable to other commonly used channels such as wireless channels. In this paper, we replace the parallel independent on-off channel model with wireless channel models such as a Rayleigh fading model. We also communicate using multiple transmit and receive antennas over the channel. Furthermore, we use digital bandpass modulation to transmit the source symbols.
