40|$|Discharge voltage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters in electromagnetic riveting. The effect of discharge voltage on the deformation of Ti Grade 1 rivet was investigated by experiment from macro and micro-scales in low voltage electromagnetic riveting. The result shows that the amplitude of the discharge current, the riveting force and the rivet deformation increases with the discharge voltage. The deformation in the rivet head is inhomogeneous and there are three deformation zones, viz., large, small and difficult deformation zones. The deformation in <b>rivet</b> <b>shaft</b> is quite uniform. The deformation of Ti Grade 1 rivet is an adiabatic process and the deformation mechanism is adiabatic shearing deformation. With the increase of discharge voltage, adiabatic shear band gets more and more obvious and the grains inside the adiabatic shear band are elongated severely and re-arranged along the direction of the adiabatic shear band. A model for the modeling of grain deformation inside the adiabatic shear band is proposed. When the adiabatic temperature does not affect the flow of the material, the process of microstructure evolution mechanism of Ti Grade 1 rivet in electromagnetic riveting is mainly the twinning deformation. With the increase of rivet deformation, it is the sub-grain rotation to complete the dynamic recrystallization. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of Ti Grade 1 rivet deformation mechanism and a basis for process determination and quality assurance of the electromagnetic riveting process.

50|$|The {{standard}} weapons {{carried by}} soldiers were also modified by Marius. The iron {{head of the}} pilum, a javelin, was traditionally <b>riveted</b> to the <b>shaft</b> with iron bolts for strength. This was changed to wooden pegs {{with the intention of}} breaking it upon impact so as to prevent the reuse of the weapon by the enemy. He also provided each soldier with a dagger, or pugio.|$|R
5000|$|The Musings of Miles is {{the first}} 12" [...] LP by Miles Davis, issued by Prestige Records in 1956, {{following}} several LPs in the discontinued 10 inch format. The six tracks were all recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's home studio, June 7, 1955. The rhythm section of this quartet is {{the nucleus of the}} group that later became known as Miles' First Great Quintet. The First Great Quintet would record in the same year."A Night in Tunisia" [...] features Philly Joe Jones playing with special drum sticks which had bells <b>riveted</b> to the <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
