5000|$|Managers in {{the railway}} {{organisation}} had experienced these severe vibrations {{on a trip}} and asked to have the problem solved. In response engineers decided that to solve the problem, the suspension of ICE cars could be improved {{with the use of}} a rubber damping ring between the rail-contacting steel tyre and the steel wheel body. A similar design had been employed successfully in trams (known as resilient wheels), at significantly lower speeds. This new wheel, dubbed a [...] "wheel-tyre" [...] design, consisted of a wheel body surrounded by a 20 mm thick <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> and then a relatively thin metal tyre. The new design was not tested at high speed before it was made operational, but was successful at resolving the issue of vibration at cruising speeds.|$|E
5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the <b>rubber</b> <b>damper.</b> The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type coil springs placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.|$|E
30|$|The sound {{pressure}} level of differently designed circular saw blades were investigated during idling. Nine blade samples were used: three differently designed blade bodies (without slots, with four radial slots, and with four slots with copper cork), each with three diameters (260, 280, and 300 mm). The {{sound pressure}} level was measured at different rotational frequencies ranging from 25 to 65 rps in increments of 1 rps. <b>Rubber</b> <b>damping</b> rings 80 mm in diameter and 0.3 mm thick were placed between the saw blade and the collars, and the emitted noise was measured. Because of the whistling sound the blades without slots emitted high {{sound pressure level}}s. There were no significant changes when <b>rubber</b> <b>damping</b> rings were used. The use of <b>rubber</b> <b>damping</b> rings on the samples with radial slots eliminates the whistling noise. The saws with copper corks did not emit a whistling noise at all, and their aerodynamic noise was 2 – 3 dB (A) lower than the aerodynamic noise of the saws with radial slots. The relation between sound pressure emitted by the damped idling saw and peripheral velocity can be described by the power function with the exponent value between 4.8 and 5.2.|$|R

40|$|A new {{vibration}} control system including viscoelastic or viscoplastic rubber dampers is proposed for residential houses. This system consists of braces {{and a damper}} unit including a high-hardness <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> or a linear <b>rubber</b> <b>damper.</b> The high-hardness <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> possesses many unprecedented properties such as large stiffness, small temperature and frequency dependencies compared to most of usual viscoelastic dampers. Post tensioning forces are introduced into the braces to reduce small gap in joint parts and this system has high damping performance for micro-vibration. The control system can absorb sufficient energy through the high-rubber damper and post tensioning braces.

40|$|The {{connection}} of two building structures with dampers {{is one of}} effective vibration control systems. In this vibration control system, both buildings have to possess different vibration properties {{in order to provide}} a higher vibration reduction performance. In addition to such condition of different vibration properties of both buildings, the connecting dampers also {{play an important role in}} the vibration control mechanism. In this paper, the effect of nonlinearity of connecting dampers on the vibration control of connected building structures is investigated in detail. A high-damping <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> and an oil damper with and without relief mechanism are treated. It is shown that, while the high-damping <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> is effective in a rather small deformation level, the linear oil damper is effective in a relatively large deformation level. It is further shown that, while the oil dampers reduce the response in the same phase as the case without dampers, the high-damping rubber dampers change the phase. The merit is that the high-damping rubber can reduce the damper deformation and keep the sufficient space between both buildings. This can mitigate the risk of building pounding...|$|E

40|$|Cable-stayed bridges {{generally}} having common defects such as {{excessive vibration}} due to wind action, corrosion and fatigue {{occurred at the}} cables supporting member. This study presents two different approaches for the demonstration of the damping effect due to wind action on cable-stayed bridge. The fi rst approach uses a simplifi ed analysis method to study the reaction force at the cable end. A beam element was adopted for modelling the cables and a plate element for modelling the bridge’s deck. The second approach {{is based on the}} selected damper system applied at the cable end to determine the reaction response at the bridge models. Two methods are presented in this report with the consideration of bridge geometric effect. The effect of pretension of the cable and the exact treatment of cable sag with the cable weight is ignored. A numerical calculation has been carried out in determining the nominal transverse wind load, the nominal longitudinal wind load on deck and the nominal longitudinal wind load on cables in accordance to the current code of practice. The results generated from MIDAS Civil software have been used for comparing the analysis results. The stiffness coeffi cient for the selected <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> type was being modelled at the cable end to examine the effect of nominal and combined wind action at critical locations. The effectiveness of using the <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> to suppress the effects of wind was investigated through superposition of these rubber dampers at the maximum reactions at the cable end. It was found that the damper system adapted on the cable-stays has signifi cant infl uence on suppressing the action due to wind...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} is frequently accomplished by placing rubber pads between a structure and its foundation. In typical industrial situations, {{the weight of}} the structure can be used to keep the pads in place and to ensure contact at the interface. However, when dampers are used for small electronic components, they are frequently glued to the component and to the support. The total unit then consists of the component, a glue interface, the <b>rubber</b> <b>damper,</b> a second glue interface, and the foundation. If the interfaces fail, compressive waves can usually be transmitted, but tensile stress waves encounter the separated layer which markedly affects the transmissivity and damping. Consequently, the damper effectiveness generally is reduced. Many modern dampers employ viscoelastic rubber whose frequency characteristics and damping rely less upon resonance than upon the wide frequency spectrum of damping [1]...|$|E

In the real-time hybrid testing, the structure to be tested is divided into one or more experimental and computational substructures with actuators providing the interface between them. Since the laminated rubber dampers can exhibit velocity-dependent behavior due to viscosity and other dynamic properties of rubber material, real-time loading is indispensable in testing {{the performance of the}} device under realistic test condition for the damper specimens that reflects the loading rate effect.

40|$|A new seismic {{protection}} strategy called the hybrid passive control device (HPCD) {{has been developed}} which combines typical passive energy dissipation devices. It consists of a high damping rubber (HDR) sandwich damper in series with a buckling restrained brace (BRB). The HPCD provides energy dissipation at small deformations without significantly decreasing the structural period. The significant energy dissipation capacity of a BRB is provided for significant seismic events in the second phase. The transition between these two phases consists of an increasing stiffness as the device transitions from <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> to BRB. The HPCD reduces deformations, forces and accelerations from seismic events. The hyperelastic or stiffening effect also prevents resonant build-up and aids in collapse prevention due to p-delta effects. The first phase of this work included characterization of high damping rubber compounds and analytical modeling of the HPCD concept. Experimental testing was completed to measure both the static and dynamic material properties of six different rubber compounds. The two most promising rubber compounds were selected for possible inclusion in the device.

40|$|The {{method of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>damper</b> design {{outlined}} {{in this paper}} has been developed owing to the break-down {{on a number of}} occasions of the two-mass system method hitherto widely used. This new method, which is based on the study of the behaviour of the engine as a whole in con-junction with the damper, splits up the functioning of a damper into two parts, one conveniently called the detuning effect, and the other, the absorption effect. The first relies on the powerful tuning curve method, already described in the PROCEEDINGS, and the other is based on numerous painstaking trials and physical tests on rubber samples and on full-scale dampers. The method outlined shows that there is no rigid relationship between the frequencies of the engine and damper, and that the free end of the engine crankshaft is not the only place where a successful damper can be fitted. In addition to giving some particulars about physical and other properties of rubber, it also shows how to calculate the heat dissipated by dampers. Practical support for the theory is provided by accounts of vibration trials on three widely different types of engines with dampers fitted to them. In all cases, comparison of calculated and experimental amplitudes is given. The good agreement between the two cannot escape attention and shows that the method outlined can be used with confidence...|$|E
