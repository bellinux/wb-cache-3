Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment.

500|$|Drawing {{influence}} {{from a more}} diverse array of musical styles than Residente o Visitante (2007), Calle 13 released Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo in 2008, which experimented with genres such as samba, candombe, and electronica. The album won five Latin Grammys at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009 including [...] "Album of the Year". The group generated controversy when vocalist/lyricist Residente was hosting the 2009 MTV Latin America Awards and attempted to inform the audience about a strike in Puerto Rico in protest of governor Luis Fortuño's cutting of thousands of government jobs, one of which belonged to Residente's mother. During the ceremony, he referred to Fortuño as a [...] "son of a whore", which generated widespread anger towards the group.

His later pieces would {{continue}} to mock customs of the day, without <b>really</b> <b>upsetting</b> the status quo enjoyed by the theatre-going public. Offenbach's early operettas were small-scale one-act works, since the law in France limited musical theatre works (at all except the principal theatres) to one-act pieces {{with no more than}} three singers and, perhaps, some mute characters.|$|R

But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was <b>really</b> <b>upset.</b> I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers.

In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was <b>really</b> <b>upset</b> about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life.

The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak and I was so upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago.

[...] Marc Elliott commented: [...] "I think the audience is ready now to see some sort of conclusion to a story that's been bubbling for a bit. John is brilliant and it's been fantastic building up to this moment, and we've had lots of emotion along the way." [...] Kalidas said it was upsetting to watch her final scenes. Speaking to Holy Soap, Kalidas said: [...] "I watched the aftermath of when Amira left because I {{had no idea what was}} going to happen. It was <b>really</b> <b>upsetting.</b> It was actually quite distressing. It was all very sad and everyone was down in the dumps.

Their behaviour causes the actress (Tanushree Dutta) to run away. This <b>really</b> <b>upsets</b> the organizer, who offered the chance mainly because of the heroine. After reaching London, Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get to become hero. Then Babla asks Gulab Singh Lakhan Singh Haryanewale (Rajpal Yadav), a local driver where he can find a heroine. Gulab Singh misinterprets this as prostitute and directs him to a park.|$|R

It occurred to me that projecting and tracing the photograph instead of copying it freehand would be even more shocking. To copy a photograph literally was considered a bad thing to do. It went against all of my art school training... some people were upset by what I was doing and said 'it's not art, it can't possibly be art'.

They really didn't like the movie. And they certainly didn't like it at three hours and two minutes." [...] Deeley wasn't surprised by the Universal response: [...] "The Deer Hunter was a United Artists sort of picture, whereas Convoy was more in the style of Universal. I'd muddled and sold the wrong picture to each studio." [...] Deeley did agree with Universal that the film needed to be shorter, not just because of pacing but also to ensure commercial success. [...] "A picture under {{two and a half hours}} can scrape three shows a day," [...] wrote Deeley, [...] "but at three hours you've lost one third of your screenings and one third of your income for the cinemas, distributors, and profit participants." ...|$|E

Education is a public good and we should be spending more on it and it shouldn't be necessary to do this, but standing on the sidelines moaning and wailing is not an option." [...] In an 2012 interview, Grayling also responded to claims that the college was [...] "elitist": [...] "There is nothing wrong with being elite {{as long as you are}} not exclusive.

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got <b>really</b> <b>upset</b> at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him?

Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Lee Hunter (Alex Carter) start their own radio show and recruit Lynsey to be their on-air agony aunt. Lynsey's advice to [...] "sexually charged" [...] young people does not go down well with Silas. Hassan said that Silas assumes the worst about Lynsey. Silas grows more furious when Lynsey dresses up in a sexy nurse's outfit for the radio's webcam. Lynsey is [...] "horrified" [...] as her flat becomes dark and Silas grabs her from behind. However, Silas is scared off as Lynsey's screams are heard by Silas's grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), who arrives to rescue her. Lynsey realises that it was Silas who attacked her and tells people, {{but they do not}} believe her. Discussing the plot, Bronagh Waugh (who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl Brady) explained that everyone thinks that Lynsey is crazy and making the allegation up. She said [...] "Lynsey's <b>really</b> <b>upset</b> about it and asks Cheryl for some help. While she hates seeing her best friend in that kind of state, she thinks Lynsey's just being paranoid and Silas is a really upstanding member of society." [...] As no one accepts Lynsey's allegation, she wants to bring Silas down even more. Hassan stated that Lynsey is determined to find the evidence she needs to expose Silas. Riley realises that Lynsey is telling the truth and confronts Silas, who has a heart attack. Riley brings Silas into hospital, but Lynsey is not sure whether Silas is genuinely ill. Lynsey is assigned as his nurse and withholds his oxygen mask until he admits that he attacked her. Heidi walks in on Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and Lynsey calls for help. Norbury later told Digital Spy that he did not think Riley's suspicions of Silas would ever completely go and [...] "everything that happened shook [...] up a bit".|$|E
5000|$|The episode, airing {{four months}} after the Sandy Hook Elementary School {{shooting}} in Newtown, Connecticut, was too much for the parents of that town, as noted by Los Angeles Times contributor Patrick Kevin Day. Andrew Paley, whose children survived the shooting at Sandy Hook, appeared on CNN on April 12, 2013 to complain that no one from Glee or its network, Fox, reached out to warn the people of Newtown about the content of the episode. Paley and other parents of Newtown had no problem with the network airing such an episode, but noted: [...] "What's <b>really</b> <b>upsetting</b> is that no one, none of the producers, reached out to the town of Newtown to let us residents, who are so close to this, know that this episode was airing and that if anybody is a fan of Glee... {{it would have been a}} shocker to them if they didn't know what the episode was about."

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was <b>really</b> <b>upset</b> that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E

[...] He notes that [...] "they all seem to start in Shadizar, or Arenjun, and then take Conan on these vast treks into the wilderness surrounding them he slays a monster or a wizard and then {{goes back to the}} tavern." [...] The upshot is that the reader will [...] "likely be very tired of traveling in mountains and slaying sorcerers." [...] He points out that [...] "none of these books <b>really</b> <b>upsets</b> the status quo, none of them become integral to the story, and unlike the previous volumes chronologically from Perry, Carpenter, Offut, (sic) et all (sic), don't move the story forward." [...] Observing that Robert Jordan later [...] "became something of a master of the sideways divergence" [...] he sees in these tales [...] "the prototype of many of the divergences in the Wheel of Time books. Except in Conan's case he has no Waygates to travel through to cut out the walking." [...] The reviewer also finds Karela [...] "a rather obnoxious character," [...] speculating that it [...] "is almost as if Jordan wanted to use Red Sonja and was told he couldn't." [...] In another place, the reviewer rates the book beneath Conan the Victorious, another of Jordan's Conan novels.|$|R

I think the writers are handling this very well and very realistically. It’s what often happens when a family unravels.” Bellamy added how she ends up losing Gabby, “Gabby’s off school sick and behaving badly to irritate Laurel. She then sees Laurel and Marlon kissing and yells at Laurel, telling her how much she hates her and also saying Laurel’s not her real mum. Not surprisingly, this <b>really</b> <b>upsets</b> Laurel, but worse is to come. Marlon tries to calm Gabby down and she lashes out. Gabby then claims Marlon hit her! She decides to tell Ashley what’s happened and that Gabby’s making things up. Laurel doesn’t want Gabby telling Ashley her own version. She’s also angry with Ashley, believing he’s trying to turn Gabby even more against Marlon than she is already. Ashley makes arrangements for Gabby to move into the pub with him." [...] Speaking of how Laurel is towards Gabby, Bellamy said, [...] "Legally, Laurel is only Gabby’s stepmother. But as far Laurel as concerned, Gabby is her daughter. And I think Gabby would very happily accept Laurel as Mummy again if only Laurel and Ashley would get back together. But I very much doubt that is going to happen.|$|R
