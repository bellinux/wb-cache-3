An additional section will discuss about a software implementation of these elements through a software prototype built using this ontology. On a longer scale, we are aiming at sharing this ontology with a broader spectrum of research units in various disciplines, debate on its relevance through experiments with industry and further develop it in a collaborative way.

40|$|Abstract—Superconducting {{magnetic}} energy storage (SMES) {{is known to be}} a very good energy storage device. This article provides an overview and potential applications of the SMES technology in electrical power and energy systems. SMES is categorized into three main groups depending on its power condi-tioning system, namely, the thyristor-based SMES, voltage-source-converter-based SMES, and current-source-converter-based SMES. An extensive bibliography is presented on the applications of these three types of SMES. Also, a comparison is made among these three types of SMES. This study provides a basic guide-line to investigate further technological development and new applications of SMES, and thus benefits the <b>readers,</b> <b>researchers,</b> engineers, and academicians who deal with the research works in the area of SMES.

Thirty 4 th-grade stu-dents read several narrative and informational hypertexts that provided embedded vocabulary and comprehension strategy supports, along with text-to-speech read-aloud functionality. Correlation analyses of pre–post standardized reading vocabu-lary gain scores revealed that vocabulary gain was associated, although not sig-nificantly, with the frequency of access of hyperlinked glossary items throughout the intervention, and that lower pretest vocabulary knowledge was associated with posi-tive vocabulary gains.

Rather than using peer review as a secret screening process, we should use it as an open process to improve papers and inform <b>readers.</b> <b>Researchers,</b> journals, business schools, funding agencies, and professional organizations can all contribute to improving the process. For example, researchers should do directed research on papers that contribute to principles, journals should invite papers that contribute to principles, business school administrators should reward researchers who make important findings, funding agencies should base decisions on researchers' prior success in making important findings, and professional organizations should maintain web sites that describe what is known about principles and what research is needed on principles...|$|R

40|$|Readers are {{accustomed}} to annotating on paper documents while reading. To cater {{to the needs of}} <b>readers,</b> <b>researchers</b> have managed to reproduce this annotation ability for readers working with digital documents. However, most research has focused on textual documents rather than program code documents, and existing programming environments also do not support digital ink annotation. Therefore, this research focuses on the needs of annotating program code directly inside an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is a good platform for reviewing, editing, and running program code. To provide IDE with the annotation functionality, this research designed and developed a tool, CodeAnnotator, which integrates digital ink annotation support inside an IDE. This tool supports direct annotation of program code with digital ink in the IDE. CodeAnnotator enables users to make free-form annotations on program code documents without restriction of location and content, and easily modify existing annotations. This tool also supports grouping ink strokes and anchoring each annotation to a specific piece of code, thus maintaining consistency between grouped annotations and their associated code when the underlying code changes.

I am aware that some <b>readers,</b> <b>researchers,</b> students, and art-makers might find that observation itself, and/or some of its parts, not only taxing but irrele-vant to her or his own practices and objectives. Some of the terms included in my observation can seem rebarbative, especially to creative practitioners: Why this insistence on “expert,” as in “expert-intuitive”? What should be made of my unadulterated use of the verb “to be”—described by others as “ontologising” (see, for example, Osborne 2000), or to assert existence or being (in place of perception, hypothesis, argument) ? And what of “knowledge practice” (or epistemics) when surely what many artists are more concerned with is creativity? Finally, why this insistence on the intuitive—or rather the hyphenated "expert-intuitive”— when research into the nominalised “intuition,” at least, in the late twentieth century, has revealed that uses of the term tend to bring into play notions that are judged to be prejudicial to the pursuit of a reasoned, systematic, and rigorous research undertaking (upon which many judgements of research “quality” and “value” are based) ...|$|R

In the present study, 3 M VHB 4910 tape was used as a DE for the coating and electrical characterization tests. A 150 nm thickness of gold was coated on the DE surfaces by sputter coating under vacuum with different pre-strains, ranging from 0 to 100 %.

Sputter coating, and direct transferring gold leaf coating methods were studied and the results were analyzed in detail in terms of the strain rates and electrical resistivity changes.
