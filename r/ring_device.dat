Tracking them, she finds herself alone in an alley where Toru has strategically left a mysterious, glowing red ring on the ground for her to pick up. Aiko reaches for it, when suddenly the vampire gang's witch Kumiko flies overhead behind her with the Scythe. For a few seconds, the Scythe, the device, and Aiko conduct a red energy, before Toru appears in front of Aiko and breaks her jaw with a single punch, asking her how it feels to be a regular girl again. Before she can answer, Toru takes a horrific bite in her neck and kills her. Toru looks over at Raidon and claims the beta-test was successful. It is now time to take this technology global.

50|$|In YBCO, upon {{crossing}} the 110 planes in momentum (and real) space, the wavefunction will undergo a phase shift of π. Hence if one forms a Josephson <b>ring</b> <b>device</b> where this plane is crossed (2n+1), number of times, a phase difference of (2n+1)π will be observed {{between the two}} junctions. For 2n, or even number of crossings, as in B, C, and D, a phase difference of (2n)π will be observed. Compared {{to the case of}} standard s-wave junctions, where no phase shift is observed, no anomalous effects were expected in the B,C, and D cases, as the single valued property is conserved, but for device A, the system must do something to for the φ=2nπ condition to be maintained. In the same property behind the scanning SQUID microscope, the phase of the wavefunction is also altered by the amount of magnetic flux passing through the junction, following the relationship Δφ=π(Φ0). As was predicted by Sigrist and Rice, the phase condition can then be maintained in the junction by a spontaneous flux in the junction of value Φ0/2.|$|E

A mini-irradiator was also designed and constructed to determine the product of the molar extinction coefficient and the chemical yield value of the Fricke solution at 303 nm against an A- 12 ion chamber, in which its main dosimetric parameters to determine the absorbed dose to water were calculated using the PENELOPE Monte Carlo code.
