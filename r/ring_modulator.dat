25|$|Since 2005, the Dalek {{voice in}} the {{television}} series has been provided by Nicholas Briggs, speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator. Briggs had previously provided Dalek and other alien voices for Big Finish Productions audio plays, and continues to do so. In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC {{asked him to do}} the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC's sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs went as far as to bring the voice modulator to the actors' readings of the scripts.|$|E
500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just like they do at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see {{what you can do with}} it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|E

2500|$|Yorke had {{recorded}} an early demo of [...] "The National Anthem" [...] when {{the band was}} still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it for an OK Computer B-side, but decided to save it for their next album. For Kid A, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sampled sounds from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a <b>ring</b> <b>modulator.</b> In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the [...] "organised chaos" [...] of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus. Yorke and Greenwood directed the musicians {{to sound like a}} [...] "traffic jam"; according to Yorke, he jumped up and down so much during his conducting that he broke his foot. Radiohead also worked on several songs that were not completed until recording sessions for future albums, including [...] "I Will" [...] and [...] "A Wolf at the Door" [...] (released on Hail to the Thief), [...] "Nude" [...] (In Rainbows), [...] "Burn the Witch", and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] (A Moon Shaped Pool).|$|E

2500|$|The avant-garde {{nature of}} Akita's work made {{acceptance}} by mainstream and unprepared [...] audiences difficult. When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani in 1988 at the Jazz-on-Amur festival in Khabarovsk, the Far East of USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians {{as well as}} the festival's producer. The number of the - jazz-oriented (and - even just curious) - crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and much-much more quiet) performance, and started walking out. Prior to his second performance at the festival — which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play [...] "more musically." [...] On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of [...] "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" [...] to display: untuned guitar, a drumset, various micro-objects, small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by domestically supplied slide and light shows. These live recordings were post-processed/re-mixed and released as Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers) LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{products}} dedicated for music was the Bode <b>Ring</b> <b>Modulator</b> developed in 1961 by Harald Bode. Also in 1964 he developed the Bode Frequency Shifter, which produced a clearer sound by eliminating a side band. These devices were designed {{to be controlled by}} voltage, for today's modern modular synthesizer architecture also advocated by him, and these modules were licensed to R.A. Moog for their Moog modular synthesizers started in 1963-1964. In 1963, Don Buchla included an optional <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> in his first modular synthesizer, the Model 100. Also Tom Oberheim built a <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> unit for his musician friend in the late 1960s, and it became an origin of Oberheim Electronics Music Modulator and Maestro <b>Ring</b> <b>Modulator,</b> one of the earliest <b>ring</b> <b>modulator</b> effect products for guitarists. The EMS VCS3, Synthi A, ARP 2600, Odyssey, Rhodes Chroma and Yamaha CS-80 synthesizers also featured built-in ring modulators.|$|E
