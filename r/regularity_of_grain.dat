Due to the <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> structures {{resulting from the}} MIUC process, the GBs are organized into a manhattan grid. The specific grain boundary (GB) organization allows a physics-based model to be developed. The model {{is based on the}} popular BSIM 3 submicron CMOS model framework, which captures most of the physical effects in both long channel and short channel down to the submicron dimension., The model has been verified by a large amount of experimental data and shown to be applicable over a wide range of TFT processes with the application of grain-enhancement techniques such as solid-phase crystallization (SPC) and MIUC...|$|E

This analysis revealed main <b>regularities</b> in transformation <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> size spectra at successive salinity steps of the marginal filter, as well as boundaries between these steps based on data obtained by direct complex studies of SPM dispersion. It is established that water salinity is the main factor that controls changes in grain size {{distribution and}} composition of suspended matter in the marginal filter. Concentrations of < 0. 01 mm size fraction and salinity demonstrate negative correlations between each other. It is shown that areas characterized by mass development of phytoplankton are located along the outer boundary of the marginal filter (at the biological step), where salinity reaches 23 - 24 psu.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} studies <b>of</b> the <b>regularities</b> <b>of</b> subgrain structure changing during plastic deformation of large-grained aluminum specimens with a parquet structure are presented. For most <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> it is {{shown that the}} main substructure change has been the fragmentation of the subgrain structure, which is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the spectral width of misorientations. The effect of a dispersal <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries has been found and the mechanism of such dispersal is defined. The mechanism of the rotation <b>of</b> individual <b>grains</b> during deformation <b>of</b> the specimen and the subgrain structure role in such rotation are investigated. It is shown in experiment that specific and consistent restructuring of the subgrain structure took place in the individual <b>grains</b> during deformation <b>of</b> the specimen. It led to a change in crystallographic orientation <b>of</b> the <b>grain,</b> on the one hand, and to the relative deformation <b>of</b> the <b>grain,</b> which was significantly higher than the relative deformation of the entire specimen, on the other hand. Fine block structure with a wide spectrum of misorientations which changed during deformation <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> was found near the boundaries <b>of</b> such <b>grains.</b> The presence <b>of</b> such a structure near grain boundaries played an accommodative role and excluded the possibility <b>of</b> discontinuities in <b>grain</b> and grain boundaries during deformation of the specimen...|$|R

30|$|The Fourier {{transforms}} (FT) of the simple, {{double and}} imprinted anodizations {{are shown in}} Figure  2 a,b,d. For simple anodization, we observe a large ring, whereas the FT of double-anodized alumina shows a less thick and more prominent circle. If a thick ring is typical of a non-spatial organisation and varying inter-pore distances, we verify with the thin ring that a uniform inter-pore distance without any preferred orientation in the organisation is obtained for double-anodized alumina. This confirms the presence <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> with a hexagonal array randomly orientated. On the FT of the SEM image from the nanoimprinted sample, a hexagonal array of fine dots is seen. This confirms the <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the arrays in two directions irrespective <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> size. These samples and {{the analysis of the}} SEM images show good versatility and improved control of the array in the case of nanoimprint anodization, making AAO a promising template.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{productivity}} of technological operation, accuracy, and surface finish {{depend on the}} patterns of tool wear {{and the state of}} its working surface. It was established that the prediction of the wear of tool is only possible based on modeling the <b>regularities</b> <b>of</b> work <b>of</b> single abrasive <b>grains.</b> The wear <b>of</b> abrasive <b>grains</b> tips as well as a tool, occurs in the contact zone arising when approaching the tool and the workpiece and is determined by the relative wear and length of the path of cutting. The length of the cutting path is not equal to the length of the path <b>of</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> in a contact zone. The length of the cutting is calculated taking into account the probability of contact of the top <b>of</b> the abrasive <b>grains</b> with the material being processed at any point of contact area, which determines the probability that the material at the point is not removed. The analysis of the sequence of contacts of the tool surface with a workpiece surface allowed obtaining a differential equation that links the wear tool with the wear <b>of</b> single abrasive <b>grains.</b> The proposed probabilistic approach provides an opportunity to estimate {{the current state of the}} working surface of the tool, as well as analyze the impact of certain parameters on the processing on the rate of wear...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> multifunctions plays {{a crucial}} role in modern variational {{analysis}} and optimization. This property is a key to study the stability of solutions of generalized equations. Many practical problems lead to generalized equations associated to the sum of multifunctions. This paper is devoted to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. As the sum of closed multifunctions is not necessarily closed, almost all known results in the literature on the metric regularity for one multifunction (which is assumed usually to be closed) fail to imply <b>regularity</b> properties <b>of</b> the sum of multifunctions. To avoid this difficulty, we use an approach based on the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> so-called epigraphical multifunctions and the theory of error bounds to study the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of two multifunctions, as well as some related important properties of variational systems. Firstly, we establish the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> the sum of a regular multifunction and a pseudo-Lipschitz multifunction with a suitable Lipschitz modulus. These results subsume some recent results by Durea and Strugariu. Secondly, we derive coderivative characterizations <b>of</b> the metric <b>regularity</b> <b>of</b> epigraphical multifunctions associated with the sum of multifunctions.
