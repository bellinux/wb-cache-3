30|$|Surprisingly, no GCC {{country has}} a {{national}} solar water heating target despite the excellent <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> resources. Solar water heating (SWH) requires particular consideration since it receives much less attention than solar power but {{is in fact a}} very low cost and effective means of improving energy performance in the buildings sector. In Dubai, installation of solar water heaters is required in all new villas and labor accommodations to provide 75 % of domestic hot water requirements [56, 98]. Given the cost effectiveness of SWH, implementation of such SWH policy and regulation would be sensible throughout the GCC in the very near term.|$|R
50|$|Enhancing {{the natural}} marine sulfur cycle by {{fertilizing}} {{a small portion}} with iron—typically {{considered to be a}} greenhouse gas remediation method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight. Such fertilization, especially in the Southern Ocean, would enhance dimethyl sulfide production and consequently cloud reflectivity. This could potentially be used as <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> radiation management, to slow Antarctic ice from melting. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.|$|R

Thailand’s <b>Solar</b> <b>Programme</b> required that the plants be completed by 2015. However, due to complications, including Solarlite filing for bankruptcy in 2012, no other plants were built. The 5 MWe solar thermal power plant located in Kanchanaburi/Thailand is unique in three different ways: 1). First parabolic trough commercial power plant based on direct steam generation; 2.) Solarlite Trough SL4600 a new generation of parabolic trough made of composite material combined with an efficient thin-glass mirror which reflects more than 95% of the sun radiation; 3.) The construction method allows island solutions and smaller solar thermal parabolic trough plants starting from 500 kWe.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of an economy based on practical solar fuels is chiefly predicated on obtaining cheap and abundant hydrogen by using photons to split water, then cooling or compressing that gas; or on combining such hydrogen with carbon dioxide obtained from abundant industrial sources and eventually the atmosphere to create methanol. The construction of devices to make such fuels {{will be a major}} step in shifting the biosphere from what has been termed the Anthropocene to the Sustainocene epoch. Solar Fuels, particularly those derived from nanotechnology-based artificial photosynthesis represent an’off-grid’ energy, water and climate change solution that may directly challenge substantial investments in’ancient photosynthesis’ fuels by the World bank and multinational corporations in the energy sector, as well as government subsidies. This paper will examine immediate and long-term prospects and potential mechanisms for facilitating collaboration between the major existing national and <b>regional</b> <b>Solar</b> Fuels projects or establishing a macroscience Global Solar Fuels (GSF) initiative...|$|R

40|$|The Solar Deployment System (SolarDS) {{model is}} a bottom-up, market {{penetration}} model that simulates the potential adoption of photovoltaics (PV) on residential and commercial rooftops in the continental United States through 2030. NREL developed SolarDS to examine the market competitiveness of PV based on <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> resources, capital costs, electricity prices, utility rate structures, and federal and local incentives. The model uses the projected financial performance of PV systems to simulate PV adoption for building types and regions then aggregates adoption to state and national levels. The main components of SolarDS include a PV performance simulator, a PV annual revenue calculator, a PV financial performance calculator, a PV market share calculator, and a regional aggregator. The model simulates a variety of installed PV capacity {{for a range of}} user-specified input parameters. PV market penetration levels from 15 to 193 GW by 2030 were simulated in preliminary model runs. SolarDS results are primarily driven by three model assumptions: (1) future PV cost reductions, (2) the maximum PV market share assumed for systems with given financial performance, and (3) PV financing parameters and policy-driven assumptions, such as the possible future cost of carbon emissions...|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{renewable}} generation {{added in the}} year 2004 was 250 megawatts and 500 megawatts in 2005. There is also a program established for micro-generation (less than 50 KWe (kilowatt electrical) or 45 KWt (kilowatt thermal) from a low carbon source) {{as well as a}} solar voltaic program. By comparison both Germany and Japan have photovoltaic (<b>solar</b> cell) <b>programmes</b> much larger than the installed base in the UK. Hydroelectric energy is not a viable option for most of the UK due to terrain and lack of force of rivers.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSolar {{radiation}} {{at ground}} level is a necessary input for several applications such as primary production and agronomic related studies or potential solar energy assessments. The user needs consist generally in values of global daily or hourly irradiation with a spatial resolution of approximately 10 km. Relative errors (RMSE) of daily irradiation should be less than 20 %. Spatial coverage (continent) and temporal coverage are of importance. The data must be available conveniently at low cost. Several <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> atlases {{have been made by}} interpolation of ground measurements, taking into account the local variation of climate. Satellite data produce irradiation maps offering a regular sampling in space and a wide geographical coverage. Time-series are also obtained by weather forecast models. Digital atlases have been created as integrated information systems. They comprise a database and software to exploit it. The co-operative systems are connected with other servers that provide necessary weather data to compute solar radiation quantities. This survey of solar databases showed that in a general case, there is a discrepancy between users needs and available databases. This conclusion supports the efforts made in integrating information systems and co-operative systems to overcome the technical limits of measurements by using the information and communication technologies...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{particular}} geographic situation and relatively high altitude (3069 meters), Reunion Island {{is composed of}} a very large amount of micro-climates which have a direct impact on buildings' comfort, energy consumptions and renewable energy system efficiency. In R?union Island, the industrial engineering laboratory is involved in the <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> school program. Its aim is to gather some local construction actors (city technical offices, architects, civil engineers, specialized university team research, meteorological services), for a better knowledge transfer, and a better environment understanding. The main objective is to rehabilitate primary school in a bioclimatic and low energy consumption way, taking into account climatic conditions. Three primary schools corresponding to three particular micro-climates have been studied and simulated to evaluate main comfort targets (from a thermal, ventilation, humidity, lighting, and acoustic points of view). Architects then worked considering the technical prescriptions for renovation projects. An internal and external instrumentation was installed before and is planned to be reinforced after the renovation to validate these prescriptions. This program illustrates precisely {{what has to be done}} in each building project: - Meteorological data acquisition (hourly data for simulation software and for renewable energy options analysis and optimizations). - Thermal comfort simulations taking into account natural ventilation, heating or cooling needs, condensation or other pathologies risks. - And finally, an instrumentation campaign for all targets evaluation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLand surface {{evapotranspiration}} (ET) {{determines the}} local and regional water-heat balances. Accurate estimation of regional surface ET provides a scientific basis for the formulation and implementation of water conservation programs. This study set up a table of the momentum roughness length and zero-plane displacement related with land cover and an empirical relationship between land surface temperature and air temperature. A revised quantitative remote sensing ET model, the SEBS-Taiwan model, was developed. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, SEBS-Taiwan was used to simulate and evaluate the typical actual daily ET values in different seasons of 2002 and 2003 in Taiwan. SEBS-Taiwan generally performed well and could accurately simulate the actual daily ET. The simulated daily ET values matched the observed values satisfactorily. The {{results indicate that the}} net <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> radiation, evaporation ratio, and surface ET values for the whole area of Taiwan are larger in summer than in spring, and larger in autumn than in winter. The results also show that the regional average daily ET values of 2002 are a little higher than those of 2003. Through analysis of the ET values from different types of land cover, we found that forest has the largest ET value, while water areas, bare land, and urban areas have the lowest ET values. Generally, the Northern Taiwan area, including Ilan County, Nantou County, and Hualien County, has higher ET values, while other cities, such as Chiayi, Taichung, and Tainan, have lower ET values...|$|R

40|$|Few {{detailed}} {{data are available}} on the wide range of determinants of vitamin D status among postmenopausal women, and it is also unclear whether there may be undiscovered determinants. The objective {{of this study was to}} comprehensively evaluate determinants of serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. Data from a subset of the Womens Health Initiative Observational Study were analyzed (50 – 79 y; n = 3345). Information on diet, lifestyle behaviors, secondhand smoke, use of dietary supplements and medication, chronic diseases, and anthropometry was collected at baseline (1993 – 1998) and on sun exposure at year 4 follow-up. Linear regression was performed to estimate regression coefficients (b). Significant determinants were total vitamin D intake (food plus supplements per 100 IU/d, b = 2. 08), years of supplemental vitamin D use (b = 0. 15), total fat intake (grams per day, b = – 0. 03), smoking status (b = – 2. 64, current vs. never), <b>regional</b> <b>solar</b> irradiance (b = 6. 26, 475 – 500 vs. 300 – 325 Langleys), daylight time spent outdoors in summer (b = 5. 15,> 2 h vs. < 30 min/d), recreational physical activity (metabolic equivalent task per hour per week, b = 0. 13), waist circumference (centimeters, b = – 0. 26), and race/ethnicity (b = – 11. 94, black vs. white). Total vitamin D intake (partial R 2 = 0. 09) explained the most variance in serum 25 (OH) D concentrations (total R 2 = 0. 29). The association between total vitamin D intake and serum 25 (OH) D concentrations was stronger among participants who spent less rather than more daylight time outdoors in summer (P-interaction = 0. 026) ...|$|R

Information on spatial variations and site-wide averages of surface albedo, which vary with the underlying surface type and conditions and the solar zenith angle, is important for studies of clouds and atmospheric radiation over a large surface area. In this study, a bidirectional reflectance model was used to inversely retrieve surface properties such as leaf area index and then the bidirectional reflectance distribution was calculated by using the same radiation model. The albedo was calculated by converting the narrowband reflectance to broadband reflectance and then integrating over the upper hemisphere...|$|R
