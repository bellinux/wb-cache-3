5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to {{non-member}} states. First, only European states {{are eligible for}} new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus</b> with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Turkish Cypriot {{migration}} to the UK occurred {{as a consequence of}} intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern Cyprus. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots. Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus</b> passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law.|$|E

25|$|Turkish Cypriots {{have been}} {{applying}} for decades for passports issued by Cyprus. When the entry points with the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus</b> were closed, the applications were made either through middlemen or through consulates and embassies of Cyprus in other countries. A yearly {{increase in the}} number of applications for such passports of 10–15% was observed in years prior to 2001, when the rate greatly increased and 817 were issued in the first eight months of 2001 as compared to 448 for the whole of 2000. After the opening of the borders with the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus,</b> Turkish Cypriots started lineups applying for Cypriot passports by visiting the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus</b> and showing proof of their Cypriot ancestry.|$|E

Another nearly 4% of the island's area is covered by the UN buffer zone. The international community considers the northern part of the island as territory of the <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cyprus</b> occupied by Turkish forces.
