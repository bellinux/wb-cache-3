2500|$|Any {{combination}} of these three primary hybrid advantages {{may be used in}} different vehicles to realize different fuel usage, power, emissions, weight and cost profiles. The ICE in an HEV can be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle, because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above average power demand rather than peak power demand. The drive system in a vehicle is required to operate over a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> and power, but an ICE's highest efficiency is in a narrow range of operation, making conventional vehicles inefficient. On the contrary, in most HEV designs, the ICE operates closer to its range of highest efficiency more frequently. The power curve of electric motors is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion engines. The greater fuel economy of HEVs has implication for reduced petroleum consumption and vehicle air pollution emissions worldwide ...|$|E

40|$|A {{simulated}} ball-hitting {{task was}} used to explore the optical basis for collision control. Ball speed and size were manipulated in Experiments 1 and 2.

50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its number of forward gear ratios), or AT, {{is a type}} of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change gear ratios as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|E
50|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1935, the {{considerable}} potential of the Fieseler Fi 156 project for the tasks of short-range reconnaissance and aerial observation had prompted the RLM {{to draw up a}} requirement for an army cooperation and observation aircraft with its performance parameters. The requirement stipulated the use of the Argus As 10 or the Hirth HM 508 engine and placed emphasis on short field performance, maximum possible allround view for the two crew members, and a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed.</b> It was intended that the resultant aircraft, which the Siebel Si 201 was also designed to compete for, would be evaluated in competition with the Fi 156.|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{development}} of semiconductor power electronics, {{it was difficult to}} vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications. Applications such as electric overhead cranes used DC drives or wound rotor motors (WRIM) with slip rings for rotor circuit connection to variable external resistance allowing considerable <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> control. However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads. [...] Large slip ring motor drives, termed slip energy recovery systems, some still in use, recover energy from the rotor circuit, rectify it, and return it to the power system using a VFD.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall wetted area. As wetted area increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends {{a great deal of}} its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed,</b> bulbous bows are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.|$|E
50|$|The Union {{automobile}} had {{a special}} hand brake controlled by the left foot. The friction disk-drive transmission made an emergency brake, being operated by throwing it in the reverse position. The operator controlled the steering wheel {{with his right hand}} and the speed changing lever with his left hand. The speed of the motor could be varied from 150 revolutions per minute to over 1,500 revolutions per minute. This variation of speed of the motor, in addition to the variable speed from the transmission, allowed a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> for the Union automobile. The transmission was enclosed in a dustproof casing and run in oil. One lever controlled two forward speeds and one reverse. The high speed was 20 mi/h km/h.|$|E
50|$|A special type of bow, {{called a}} bulbous bow, {{is often used}} on large power vessels to reduce wave-making drag. The bulb alters the waves {{generated}} by the hull, by changing the pressure distribution ahead of the bow. Because {{of the nature of}} its destructive interference with the bow wave, there is a limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> vessel <b>speeds</b> over which it is effective. A bulbous bow must be properly designed to mitigate the wave-making resistance of a particular hull over a particular <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speeds.</b> A bulb that works for one vessel's hull shape and one <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> could be detrimental to a different hull shape or a different speed range. Proper design and knowledge of a ship's intended operating speeds and conditions is therefore necessary when designing a bulbous bow.|$|R

5000|$|As some {{factories}} grew {{too large}} and complex {{to be powered}} by a single steam engine, a system of [...] "sub divided" [...] power came into use. This was also important when a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> control was necessary for a sensitive operation such as wire drawing or hammering iron. Under sub divided power, steam was piped from a central boiler to smaller steam engines located where needed. However, small steam engines were much less efficient than large ones. The Baldwin Locomotive Works 63 acre site changed to sub divided power, then because of the inefficiency converted to group drive with several large steam engines driving the line shafts. Eventually Baldwin converted to electric drive, with a substantial saving in labor and building space.|$|E
50|$|The 96th {{had plenty}} of planes, but was short of pilots and {{observers}} {{to carry out the}} operation orders on a large scale. Accordingly, flying personnel was borrowed from the 11th and 20th Aero Squadrons. The formations would leave the ground numbering 17 to 20 planes, and allowing for motor trouble and other difficulties due to difference in <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed,</b> there generally would be a tight formation of 12 to 14 planes when the objective was reached. The success of the big formations was best as when attacked, the planes could form a tighter fighting rear line than in a small formation and often the sight of a well-organized large formation was enough to warn enemy scouts of the hot reception to expect should they attack.|$|E
5000|$|The Not-To-Exceed (NTE) {{standard}} promulgated [...] by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{ensures that}} heavy-duty truck engine emissions are controlled over the full <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speed</b> and load combinations commonly experienced in use. NTE establishes an area (the “NTE zone”) under the torque curve of an engine where emissions must not exceed a specified value {{for any of}} the regulated pollutants. The NTE test procedure does not involve a specific driving cycle of any specific length (mileage or time). Rather it involves driving of any type that could occur within the bounds of the NTE control area, including operation under steady-state or transient conditions and under varying ambient conditions. Emissions are averaged over a minimum time of thirty seconds and then compared to the applicable NTE emission limits.|$|E
50|$|The {{power band}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine or electric motor is the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> operating <b>speeds</b> under which the engine or motor is able to operate most efficiently.

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines found in passenger automobiles {{are able to}} operate over a relatively wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>speeds.</b> A close-ratio type of transmission is designed to allow an engine to remain in a relatively narrow operating speed.
