40|$|Crude oil is {{a product}} of the remains of prehistoric plants and animaIs, buried in the primaeval mud of swamps, lakes and oceans. Over the centuries, layers of mud and organic de bris were {{subjected}} to enormous pressures and high temperatures, and a petroleumsaturated rock was formed. Fourelements must be present for oil to accumu 1 ate in commercially useful quantities: source rock, reservoir <b>rock,</b> <b>trap</b> and seaL. These elements allow the crude oil to remain underground and available in large quantities. A source rock is usually sedimentary rock rich in organic matter. The crude oil created by the decayed matter migrates from the source rock to a reservoir rock. The reservoir röck contains many tiny pores that store the oiL. A trap, either stratigraphie layers of impermeable rock or structural traps, prevents the oil from migrating from the reservoir rock. An impermeable 1 ayer, or seal, prevents the oil from 'rising through or around the trap to the surface (American Petroleum Institute, 1984). Crude oil has been defined as a 'highly complex mixture of paraffnic, cycloparaffinic (naphthenic) and aromatic hydrocarbons, containing low percentages of sulfur and trace amounts of nitrogen and oxygen compounds ' (Hawley, i 981). Crude oils are often classifie...|$|E

Banyumas basin and surrounding area have several oil and gas seep. This seep indicating there are mature source rock that had been migrate to the surface. The factor required for existing of hydrocarbon is called petroleum systems, and the factor are : mature source rock, reservoir rock, cap rock/seal <b>rock,</b> <b>trap</b> and proper timing of migration.

40|$|Emerging identity-preserved grain markets {{depend on}} {{avoidance}} of commingling grain at harvest. Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} grain tank and <b>rock</b> <b>trap.</b> Intermediate amounts were found in the head or feederhouse, elevators, and at times the cylinder/rotor (soybeans), the unloading auger (soybeans, oats), and rear axle/chopper area. The least amounts were found in the cleaning shoe and straw walkers (cylinder-type machine). Time spent to clean the combine varied from about two hours to seven hours. Cleaning the head, grain tank, threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested. Following clean-outs, commingled grain levels dropped below 0. 5 % after 20 bu were harvested. Over 14 lb of wheat were found during the first clean-out of a combine following 50 ac of oat harvest (no physical clean-out prior to oat harvest) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{petroleum}} system {{encompasses a}} hydrocarbon source rock and all generated {{oil and gas}} accumulations and includes all the geologic elements and processes that are essential if an oil and gas deposit is to exist. Petroleum includes concentrated occurrences {{of any of the}} following substances: thermal and microbial natural gas found in conventional reservoirs as well as in gas hydrate, tight sandstone, fractured shale, and coal; and condensates, crude oils, heavy oils, and solid bitumen found in reservoirs in siliciclastic and carbonate rocks. System describes the interdependent geologic elements that create oil and gas accumulations. These elements include a petroleum source rock, migration path, reservoir rock, seal, and trap; and the geologic processes that create each of these basic elements. All these elements must be correctly placed in time and space so that organic matter included in a source rock can be converted into a petroleum deposit. A petroleum system exists wherever all the basic elements are known to occur or are thought to occur. Characteristics and Limits. -The stratigraphic, areal, and temporal extent of the petroleum system is specific. Stratigraphi-cally, the system includes the following rock units: a petroleum source rock, rocks through which migration has occurred, a sealed reservoir <b>rock</b> (<b>trap),</b> and the rock overburden (time and temperature) required for maturity. The areal extent of the petroleum system is defined by a line that circumscribes the mature source rock and all oil and gas deposits, conventional and unconventional, originating from that source. Since microbial gas originates from immature source rocks, the gas deposits themselves or the geologic setting defines the extent of the system...|$|E

50|$|<b>Trap</b> <b>rock,</b> i.e. basalt or diabase, has {{a variety}} of uses. A major use for basalt is crushed rock for road and housing {{construction}} in concrete, macadam, and paving stones. Because of its insensitivity to chemical influences, resistance to mechanical stress, high dry relative density, frost resistance, and sea water resistance, <b>trap</b> <b>rock</b> is used as ballast for railroad track bed and hydraulic engineering rock (riprap) in coast and bank protection for paving embankments. It is also used for the production of cast rock that is used in corrosion and abrasion protection, as for sewage pipes and acid-resistant rocks. Other uses of <b>trap</b> <b>rock</b> include gardening and landscaping, for the production of millstones, for the production of mineral fibres (basalt wool), as a flux in ceramic masses and glazes, for the production of glass ceramics, crushed as a filter aggregate (air filtration of poison gas in ABC bunkers), as filter bed material water treatment facilities, and ground as a soil improvement product. <b>Trap</b> <b>rock</b> has been used to construct buildings and churches: Trinity Church on the Green with <b>trap</b> <b>rock</b> quarried from Eli Whitney's quarry, is a particularly colorful example of a red-orange-brown-colored, natural-faced <b>trap</b> <b>rock.</b> It was also used for foundations and railroad beds in the New Haven area.|$|R
