40|$|The VIERS- 1 model (Janssen et al. 1998) was {{originally}} devised to describe ERS scatterometer measurements over the sea on a physical basis. This model is extended to include the saturation range, and {{it is used to}} derive equilibrium wave spectra and formulations for the relaxation toward that equilibrium, with and without slicks present. It was attempted to derive actual relaxation rates from the model, but this was only successful on part of the spectral range. The extended VIERS model is combined with a radar imaging model originally designed for radar bathymetry, to yield quantitative computations of <b>radar</b> <b>contrast</b> along transects through slicks. The resulting model shows an apparent size increase of the slick and a smoothing of its edges, due to the finite relaxation time of the slick-dampened, backscattering surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract—The scaled complex Wishart {{distribution}} {{is a widely}} used model for multilook full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature. Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques which depend on this model have been devised, {{and many of them}} employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart dis-tributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances.

40|$|A {{potential}} {{strategy for}} wide area airborne mine/minefield detection {{is to identify}} localized areas of soil that have been disturbed due to mine emplacement amidst the undisturbed soil. Disturbed and undisturbed soils are rough in varying degrees and this roughness affects the backscattering behavior at the microwave frequencies. We investigated the feasibility of using high-frequency radar (8 - 18 GHz) backscatter measurements to detect the residual surface disturbances caused by recent mine emplacement. Radar backscatter measurements from recently buried landmines were obtained at a government minefield data collection site. Case studies of radar backscatter from landmines buried in dirt and gravel for varying incident angles are presented. These results demonstrate that the surface roughness contrast between disturbed and undisturbed soils can be exploited to assist in mine detection operations. The maximum <b>radar</b> backscatter <b>contrast</b> between the disturbed and undisturbed soils was observed at normal incidence. The minimum <b>contrast</b> (<b>radar</b> backscatter crossover angle) occurred between 15 0 and 30 0 incident angles.

For example, although the radar might devote a substantial proportion of its duty cycle to a pre-defined mode of ionospheric observation, a fraction of its observing time could be simultaneously devoted to other applications such as space debris, while some of its receiver beams could be used for radio astronomy observations, e.g. for solar wind studies via interplanetary scintillation.|$|R

The bistatic transmitter-receiver constellation has strong implications on ground moving target tracking, which is basic for producing a recognized ground picture as well as for analyzing traffic flows, identifying sources and sinks of traffic, or detecting lines of communication.

While these radars will doubtlessly provide significant new information on the subsurface of Mars, thin films of adsorbed water in the cryosphere will strongly attenuate radar signals and prevent characterization of any true aquifers, if present.

Dielectric <b>contrasts</b> are sufficiently small for low-porosity, deep aquifers that groundwater cannot be reliably identified.

40|$|The largest loss term in Antarctic {{mass balance}} is iceberg calving {{from the ice}} shelves and to {{estimate}} {{the amount of the}} loss, it is necessary to observe icebergs in every size. Because current mass loss calculations only include icebergs with an edge length of > 10 km, we focus on smaller icebergs (0. 1 to 10 km edge length) in a test region north of Berkner Island in the Weddell Sea. Images of the ENVISAT ASAR at different imaging modes are used to analyse the backscattering coefficients of icebergs depending on the season. To detect icebergs in SAR images we need to find differences to the surrounding sea ice. Therefore, the backscattering coefficients of the sea ice are analysed for seasonal variations as well. Statistical analyses of the backscattering of icebergs and sea ice in ASAR image mode data show varying backscatter coefficients over the period of one year. The <b>radar</b> intensity <b>contrast</b> between icebergs and sea ice is smallest in the summer months and highest in winter and spring. The iceberg and sea-ice backscattering is investigated for seasonality in medium and low resolution ASAR images as well and compared to the results derived from image mode data.

This period also coincides with the annual maximum of the cloud cover. Here, we document the macro- and microphysical properties of mid-level clouds, the environment in which such clouds occur, as well as their radiative properties across West Africa. To do so, we combined high resolution observations from two ground-based sites (including lidar and cloud <b>radar)</b> in <b>contrasted</b> environments: one in the Sahel (Niamey, AMMA campaign, 2006) and the other in the Sahara (Bordj Badji Mokhtar, Fennec campaign, June 2011) along with the merged CloudSat-CALIPSO satellite products.

They also are preferentially observed in the southern and western part of West Africa. They are usually thin (most of them are less than 1000 m deep) and as observed in Niamey, mainly composed of liquid water. A clustering method applied to Niamey data allows to distinguish three different types of clouds: one with low bases, one with high bases and another with large thicknesses.
