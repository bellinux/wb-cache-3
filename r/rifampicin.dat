5|$|The {{recommended}} {{treatment of}} new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010, is {{six months of}} a combination of antibiotics containing <b>rifampicin,</b> isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only <b>rifampicin</b> and isoniazid for the last four months. Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|SLCO1B3 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others <b>rifampicin,</b> penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{recommended}} that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with <b>rifampicin</b> or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid {{in the treatment}} of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and US {{government}} are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test {{for use in}} low- and middle-income countries. In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic <b>rifampicin</b> which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV. Many resource-poor places as of 2011 have access to only sputum microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic <b>rifampicin,</b> and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: <b>rifampicin</b> and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, <b>rifampicin,</b> ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and <b>rifampicin,</b> and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
25|$|TB {{treatment}} involves numerous {{drug interactions}} with anti-epileptic drugs and serum drug levels should be closely monitored. There are serious interactions between <b>rifampicin</b> and carbamazepine, <b>rifampicin</b> and phenytoin, and <b>rifampicin</b> and sodium valproate. The {{advice of a}} pharmacist should always be sought.|$|E
25|$|If the {{organism}} {{is known to}} be fully sensitive, then treatment is with isoniazid, <b>rifampicin,</b> and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and <b>rifampicin</b> for four months. Ethambutol need not be used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rifampicin</b> acts at the {{assembly}} phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotic}} <b>rifampicin</b> decreases plasma {{concentrations of}} praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, <b>rifampicin,</b> and {{thioridazine}} cause {{interactions with}} zaleplon.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} leprostatic agents are {{available}} for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and monthly <b>rifampicin</b> for six months is recommended. While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases, treatment with daily dapsone and clofazimine along with monthly <b>rifampicin</b> for 12 months is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{antibiotics}} like rifapentine, <b>rifampicin,</b> rifabutine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin and, possibly, metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and <b>rifampicin</b> {{can reduce}} the {{half-life}} of dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rifampicin</b> makes {{hormonal}} contraception less effective, so additional precautions need to {{be taken}} for birth control while tuberculosis treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{for treatment}} brucellosis is combination of doxycycline and streptomycin and the second-line is combination of doxyxycline and <b>rifampicin</b> (rifampin).|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide is also {{available}} as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as isoniazid and <b>rifampicin</b> (Rifater is an example).|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia is only {{caused by}} RMP and no test dosing need be done. Regimens omitting RMP are {{discussed}} below. Please {{refer to the}} entry on <b>rifampicin</b> for further details.|$|E
25|$|If treated early {{antibiotics}} {{for eight}} weeks are effective in 80% of people. This often includes the medications <b>rifampicin</b> and streptomycin. Clarithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|Sodium stibogluconate {{alone or}} in {{combination}} with <b>rifampicin</b> {{is used for the}} treatment of PKDL for a long course of up to 4 months. Compliance can be an issue for such a long course.|$|E
25|$|The causative {{agent of}} leprosy, M. leprae, was {{discovered}} by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium {{to be identified as}} causing disease in humans. The first effective treatment (promin) became available in the 1940s. In the 1950s, dapsone was introduced. The search for further effective antileprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and <b>rifampicin</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using <b>rifampicin</b> and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. MDT combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three antileprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy is curable with a {{treatment}} known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy {{is with the}} medications dapsone and <b>rifampicin</b> for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of <b>rifampicin,</b> dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported {{per year in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|If {{people are}} treated early, {{antibiotics}} {{for eight weeks}} are effective in 80%. The treatment often includes the medications <b>rifampicin</b> and streptomycin. Clarithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used instead of streptomycin. Other treatments may include cutting out the ulcer. After the infection heals, the area typically has a scar.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, <b>rifampicin,</b> streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant {{administration of}} drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as <b>rifampicin</b> may lower serum nevirapine levels.|$|E
25|$|NET is {{partially}} metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of NET. For instance, the CYP3A4 inducers <b>rifampicin</b> and bosentan {{have been found}} to decrease NET exposure by 42% and 23%, respectively, and the CYP3A4 inducers carbamazepine and St. John's wort have also been found to accelerate NET clearance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rifampicin</b> {{causes a}} very notable {{reduction}} in half-life of zopiclone and peak plasma levels, {{which results in}} a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of zopiclone. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of zopiclone. Nefazodone impairs the metabolism of zopiclone leading to increased zopiclone levels and marked next-day sedation.|$|E
25|$|Transcription inhibitors {{can be used}} as {{antibiotics}} against, for example, pathogenic bacteria (antibacterials) {{and fungi}} (antifungals). An example of such an antibacterial is <b>rifampicin,</b> which inhibits Bacterial transcription of DNA into mRNA by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase by binding its beta-subunit. 8-Hydroxyquinoline is an antifungal transcription inhibitor. The effects of histone methylation may also work to inhibit the action of transcription.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} are CYP2D6 inhibitors {{and reduce}} or even completely block {{the conversion of}} codeine to morphine. The most well-known of these {{are two of the}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac) as well as the antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and the antidepressant, bupropion (Wellbutrin, also known as Zyban). Other drugs, such as <b>rifampicin</b> and dexamethasone, induce CYP450 isozymes and thus increase the conversion rate.|$|E
25|$|Ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir greatly {{increase}} plasma concentrations of oxycodone in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. <b>Rifampicin</b> greatly reduces plasma concentrations of oxycodone due to strong induction of CYP3A4. There {{is also a}} case report of fosphenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of oxycodone in a chronic pain patient. Dosage or medication adjustments may be necessary in each case.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} regimen is 2HRE/7HR, {{for which}} there is excellent clinical trial evidence. The 1994 US CDC guidelines for tuberculosis erroneously cite Slutkin as evidence that a nine-month regimen using only isoniazid and <b>rifampicin</b> is acceptable, but almost all of the patients in that study received ethambutol for the first two to three months (although this is not obvious from the abstract of that article). This mistake was rectified in the 2003 guidelines.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} review {{published by the}} Cochrane Collaboration, compared Rifamycins (monotheraphy and combination therapy) to INH monotheraphy as an alternative in preventing active TB in HIV negative populations. The evidence suggested that shorter <b>Rifampicin</b> regimes (3 or 4 months) had higher treatment completion rates and fewer adverse events when compared to INH. However, {{the overall quality of}} evidence as per GRADE criteria was low to moderate. Another meta-analysis came to a similar conclusion, namely that rifamycin-containing regimens taken for 3 months or longer had a better profile in preventing TB reactivation.|$|E
25|$|A {{gene probe}} for rpoB is {{available}} in some countries and this serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients {{have a history of}} being treated with <b>rifampicin</b> alone). If the results of a gene probe (rpoB) are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+MXF+cycloserine. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH despite the suspicion of MDR-TB is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 it was {{recommended}} by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with <b>rifampicin</b> as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it {{was recommended}} to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition.|$|E
