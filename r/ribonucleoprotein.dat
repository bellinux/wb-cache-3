5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous <b>ribonucleoprotein</b> particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E

In avian cells, transcription/replication activities were in the same range with all <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> tested.

It appears that the splicing capability of galectins is independent of their sugar-binding specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis studies to the carbohydrate recognition domain removes glycan binding but does not prevent association with the spliceosome.|$|E
25|$|A {{ribosome}} is {{made from}} complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a <b>ribonucleoprotein.</b> Each ribosome {{is divided into two}} subunits: 1) a smaller subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA pattern, and 2) a larger subunit which binds to the tRNA, the amino acids, and the smaller subunit. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes are ribozymes, because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are often associated with the intracellular membranes that make up the rough endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

25|$|Anti-nuclear <b>ribonucleoprotein</b> (anti-nRNP) antibodies, {{also known}} as anti-U1-RNP antibodies, are found in 30–40% of SLE. They are often found with anti-Sm antibodies, {{but they may be}} {{associated}} with different clinical associations. In addition to SLE, these antibodies are highly associated with mixed connective tissue disease. Anti-nRNP antibodies recognise the A and C core units of the snRNPs and because of this they primarily bind to the U1-snRNP. The immune response to RNP may be caused by the presentation of the nuclear components on the cell membrane in apoptotic blebs. Molecular mimicry has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for the production of antibodies to these proteins because of similarity between U1-RNP polypeptides and Epstein-Barr virus polypeptides.|$|E
25|$|Each snoRNA {{molecule}} {{acts as a}} {{guide for}} only one (or two) individual modifications in a target RNA. In order to carry out modification, each snoRNA associates with at least four protein molecules in an RNA/protein complex referred to as a small nucleolar <b>ribonucleoprotein</b> (snoRNP). The proteins associated with each RNA depend on the type of snoRNA molecule (see snoRNA guide families below). The snoRNA molecule contains an antisense element (a stretch of 10-20 nucleotides), which are base complementary to the sequence surrounding the base (nucleotide) targeted for modification in the pre-RNA molecule. This enables the snoRNP to recognise and bind to the target RNA. Once the snoRNP has bound to the target site, the associated proteins are in the correct physical location to catalyse the chemical modification of the target base.|$|E

The top half may have evolved first including the 3'-terminal genomic tag which originally may have marked tRNA-like molecules for replication in early RNA world. The bottom half may have evolved later as an expansion, e. g. as protein synthesis started in RNA world {{and turned it into a}} (<b>ribonucleoprotein</b> world (RNP world). This proposed scenario is called genomic tag hypothesis. In fact, tRNA and tRNA-like aggregates have an important catalytic influence (i. e. as ribozymes) on replication still today. These roles may be regarded as 'molecular (or chemical) fossiles' of RNA world.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{two-fold}} increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome. It is common in such organisms for the Y chromosome to be necessary for male fertility, but not for it to play an explicit role in sex determination. In Drosophila, for example, the sex lethal (SXL) gene acts as a key regulator of sexual differentiation and maturation in somatic tissue; in XX animals, SXL is activated to repress increased transcription, while in XY animals SXL is inactive and allows male development to proceed via increased transcription of the single X. Several binding sites exist on the Drosophila X chromosome for the dosage compensation complex (DCC), a <b>ribonucleoprotein</b> complex; these binding sites have varying levels of affinity, presumably for varying expression of specific genes. The Male Specific Lethal complex, composed of protein and RNA binds and selectively modifies hundreds of X-linked genes, increasing their transcription to levels comparable to female D. melanogaster.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, {{also known}} as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are {{commonly}} found in primary Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands. The presence of both antibodies is found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation. Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE; however, Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present. Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, coeliac disease, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, cardiac neonatal lupus erythematosus and polymyositis. During pregnancy, anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in babies. In Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies correlate with early onset, increased disease duration, parotid gland enlargement, disease outside the glands and infiltration of glands by lymphocytes. Anti-Ro antibodies are specific to components of the Ro-RNP complex, comprising 45kDa, 52kDa, 54kDa and 60kDa proteins and RNA. The 60kDa DNA/RNA binding protein and 52kDa T-cell regulatory protein are the best characterised antigens of anti-Ro antibodies. Collectively, these proteins {{are part of a}} <b>ribonucleoprotein</b> (RNP) complex that associate with the hyRNAs, hY1-hY5.

After 1 hr, during which the rate of RNA synthesis was constant, 25 - 30 % of the newly synthesized RNA was recovered in the postnuclear supernatant. About 3 - 5 % of this fraction was characterized as poly(A) -containing <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> by the following criteria: (i) characteristic elution profile in oligo(dT) -cellulose chromatography; (ii) size distribution of the molecules and their deproteinized RNAs; (iii) buoyant densities in CsCl gradients; (iv) presence of RNaseresistant fragments resembling poly(A) -protein complexes; and (v) identification of the protein components by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sensitivity of labeling of the RNA synthesized and released from the nuclei to low doses of α-amanitin suggests the presence of polymerase II products in the particles. Comparison of the sizes of proteins in these particles with those of free and polysomal messenger <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> {{as well as with}} heterogenous nuclear <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> indicates that the released particles contain a protein of 78, 000 daltons, which is also present in the other three classes of <b>ribonucleoproteins,</b> presumably at the 3 ′-poly(A) segments. In addition, a few other proteins, similar in size to those found in the cytoplasmic <b>ribonucleoproteins,</b> were also present in the released particles.

A control group without stimulant was also evaluated. PAD 2, PAD 4, citrullinated peptides, Ro 60, and La were detected by immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence. PAD 2 and PAD 4 mRNAs and protein expression were detected by qPCR and Western blot analysis. PAD activity was assessed using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LPS, ATP, and TNF triggered PAD 2 and PAD 4 expression; in contrast, no expression was detected in the control group (p< 0. 001). PAD transcription slightly increased in response to stimulation. Additionally, PAD 2 / 4 activity modified the arginine residues of a reporter protein (fibrinogen) in vitro. PADs citrullinated Ro 60 and La <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> in vivo.

A very useful approach for monitoring the fine localization of nuclear phospholipids is represented by a recently developed technique using gold-conjugated phospholipases. In fact, in addition to the phospholipids organized in bilayers in the membrane, this technique identifies amorphous lipoprotein complexes present in different celi areas {{as well as in the}} nucleus. In this way and using sample preparation systems which reduce lipid removal and translocation, such as cryofixation, cryosectioning, embedding in hydrophylic resins and cryofracturing, we have analyzed the subnuclear localization of phospholipids in different experimental conditions. The results indicate that: in interphase the nuclear phospholipids are localized mainly in the interchromatin spaces and in the nucleolar domain; the observed co-localization of phospholipids and <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> suggests that phospholipids are involved in the mechanism of transport and release of the transcripts; the demonstrated release of <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> after phospholipase digestion suggests that phospholipids mediate the binding between <b>ribonucleoproteins</b> and the nuclear matrix; significant changes of the phospholipid localization occur in the different phases of the celi cycle or in the course of induced celi differentiation...|$|R
