She qualified but {{did not participate in}} the 2012 Olympics after she voluntarily told her officials she had taken a banned substance. Williams missed qualifying for the 100 m dash; the time required was 11.32, and her best time was 11.33. She did qualify for the 200 m sprint with a time of 23.05; the <b>required</b> <b>time</b> was 23.20. She finished sixth in her heat with a time of 23.61 and did not advance to the next round.|$|E
5|$|In 1080°s two trick modes, trick {{attack and}} contest, players accrue points from {{completed}} tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players {{to perform a}} series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, {{all of which are}} performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and <b>required</b> <b>time.</b> The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Sacramone {{helped the}} U.S. win a team {{gold medal at}} the Pacific Alliance Championships in Honolulu and won the {{individual}} vault title. Her performances caught the attention of the media, which began to mention her as a contender for the American team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. However, at the 2004 U.S. Nationals, an error-filled performance dashed her hopes of an Olympic berth. Although she tied with Mohini Bhardwaj for the silver medal on the vault, she finished in 19th place overall and did not qualify to the Olympic Trials. She also injured her back and <b>required</b> <b>time</b> off to recover.|$|E

The latter result, using reductions given by Chandra, Stockmeyer, and Vishkin (1984), implies that a host of problems including sorting or adding n input bits, or multiplying two n/ 2 -bit integers also <b>require</b> <b>time</b> fl(x/ ~ n) to compute. 1...|$|R
5|$|Rodríguez Saá's brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá {{became the}} new {{governor}} of San Luis in 2003. Together with Carlos Menem, {{they attempted to}} create an alternative political group against Kirchner within the PJ. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá was elected Senator for San Luis representing this group at the 2005 election. He was reelected in 2011, with a term of office up to 2017. He tried {{to run for governor}} of Buenos Aires Province in 2011, but the local judiciary did not allow him, as {{he did not have the}} <b>required</b> <b>time</b> living in the province. The mayor Sergio Massa organized the coalition United for a New Alternative to run for the 2015 presidential election and invited Rodríguez Saá to join, but he refused to join and ran with his own party, Federal Commitment. With 1.64% of the vote, it was the least voted party in the national elections.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. Heading into the draft, the Capitals had only five picks due {{to a variety of}} trades, which was tied for the fewest in {{franchise}} history. Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and not seeing an available player who could help immediately, Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer. With just late round selections remaining, the Capitals decided to take players that <b>required</b> <b>time</b> to develop. Three of their four picks were in, or set to attend, college. Fourth-round pick Steffen Soberg, the lone player not attending college, played in the GET-ligaen, Norway's highest level of competition. At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, he posted the second-highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway's top three players, though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game.|$|E
5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the <b>required</b> <b>time</b> to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} how {{to compute}} <b>required</b> <b>times</b> at inter-mediate nodes in a combinational network given <b>required</b> <b>times</b> at primary outputs. The simplest {{approach is to}} compute them based on topological delay analysis without any consideration of false paths. In this paper, however, we take into account false paths between the intermediate nodes and the primary outputs explicitly to characterize the timing constraints at the nodes more accurately. We show that this approach leads to a technique for computing a more refined and relaxed timing constraint than that obtained by topological analysis. We generalize the notion of <b>required</b> <b>times</b> from a single constant to a relation where a signal is <b>required</b> at different <b>times</b> depending on {{the values of the}} other signals. ...|$|R

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a <b>required</b> <b>time.</b> The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} {{continuous}} {{use for a}} prescriptive easement to become binding is generally between 5 and 30 years depending upon local laws (sometimes based on {{the statute of limitations}} on trespass).
