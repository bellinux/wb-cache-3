25|$|<b>Reward-based</b> {{systems are}} {{certainly}} {{the more common}} practice for attempting to influence motivation within an organization, but some employers strive to design the work itself to be more conducive. There are multiple ways an organization can leverage job design principles to increase motivation. Three of the predominant approaches will be discussed here: the Humanistic Approach, the Job Characteristics Approach, and the Interdisciplinary Approach.|$|E
25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with <b>reward-based</b> training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Rhodesian ridgebacks are loyal, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} aloof to strangers. This {{is not to}} be confused with aggression; a ridgeback of proper temperament will be more inclined to ignore, rather than challenge, a stranger. This breed requires positive, <b>reward-based</b> training, good socialization and consistency; it is often not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners. Ridgebacks are strong-willed, intelligent, and many seem to have a penchant for mischief, though loving. They are protective of their owners and families. If trained well, they can be excellent guard dogs. Like any dog, they can become aggressive when they are not socialized properly.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, <b>reward-based</b> management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E
2500|$|Dysfunctions in the {{prefrontal cortex}} and {{amygdala}} {{regions of the}} brain {{have been associated with}} specific learning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury, including damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled [...] "psychopathic individuals" [...] whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus-reinforced learning in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or <b>reward-based.</b> People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their uncinate fasciculus—white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence from DT-MRI, of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas.|$|E
2500|$|Boxers are a bright, {{energetic}} and playful breed {{and tend to}} be very good with children. They are patient and spirited with children but also protective, making them a popular choice for families. They are active, strong dogs and require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being [...] "headstrong," [...] which can be related to inappropriate obedience training. Owing to their intelligence and working breed characteristics, training based on corrections often has limited usefulness. Boxers, like other animals, typically respond better to positive reinforcement techniques such as clicker training, an approach based on operant conditioning and behaviorism, which offers the dog an opportunity to think independently and to problem-solve. Stanley Coren's survey of obedience trainers, summarized in his book The Intelligence of Dogs, ranked Boxers at #48 – average working/obedience intelligence. Many who have worked with Boxers disagree quite strongly with Coren's survey results, and maintain that a skilled trainer who uses <b>reward-based</b> methods will find Boxers have far above-average intelligence and working ability.|$|E
50|$|The Finnish {{legislation}} surrounding donations- and <b>reward-based</b> crowdfunding {{differs from}} that of most of Europe, which makes donation-based crowdfunding impossible and complicates <b>reward-based</b> crowdfunding in Finland. However, these issues don’t apply to equity-based crowdfunding, as the legislation around it is more {{similar to that of the}} rest of Europe.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reward-based</b> {{algorithms}} {{assume that}} the robot in each state (position and internal state, including direction) can choose between different actions (motion). However, the result of each action is not definite. In other words, outcomes (displacement) are partly random and partly {{under the control of}} the robot. The robot gets positive reward when it reaches the target and gets negative reward if it collides with an obstacle. These algorithms try to find a path which maximizes cumulative future rewards. The Markov decision process (MDP) is a popular mathematical framework that is used in many <b>reward-based</b> algorithms. The advantage of MDPs over other <b>reward-based</b> algorithms is that they generate the optimal path. The disadvantage of MDPs is that they limit the robot to choose from a finite set of actions. Therefore, the path is not smooth (similar to grid-based approaches). Fuzzy Markov decision processes (FDMPs) are an extension of MDPs which generate smooth paths using a fuzzy inference system.|$|E

50|$|Crowdfunding {{exists in}} mainly two types, <b>reward-based</b> {{crowdfunding}} and equity-based crowdfunding. In the former, small firms could pre-sell {{a product or}} service {{to start a business}} whereas in the latter, backers buys certain amount of shares of a firm in exchange of money. As for <b>reward-based</b> crowdfunding, project creators would set a funding target and deadline. Anyone who is interested can pledge on the projects. Projects must reach its targeted amount in order for it to be carried out. Once the projects ended with enough funds, projects creators would {{have to make sure that}} they fulfil their promises by the intended timeline and delivery their products or services.|$|E
50|$|In preference-based planning, the {{objective}} {{is not only to}} produce a plan but also to satisfy user-specified preferences. A difference to the more common <b>reward-based</b> planning, for example corresponding to MDPs, preferences don't necessarily have a precise numerical value.|$|E
50|$|The Pyrenean Mastiff {{should be}} trained with <b>reward-based,</b> {{positive}} lessons from as early an age as possible. This teaches it {{to pay attention}} to people. It is generally an independent-minded dog, and may not respect the owner if the owner is too passive.|$|E

50|$|Crowdfunding as a {{model for}} {{fundraising}} has become more popular {{over the past few years}} with the rise of the US-based Kickstarter and Indiegogo.

50|$|Unlike other European countries, {{there are}} very few deposit-refund schemes in operation. The Defra Packaging Strategy of 2009 {{supported}} <b>reward-based</b> programmes, but other than some trials in Scotland, they have received almost no public or political attention.

50|$|Ideas {{concerning}} the neural bases of motivation and reinforcement in {{behavior can be}} traced back to the 1950s. In 1953, Olds and Milner published findings implicating a brain region, specifically a cluster of dopamine neurons, with <b>reward-based</b> learning. Drugs of abuse were later discovered to increase dopamine in the region of the brain associated with reward-based-learning (see: brain stimulation reward).|$|E

50|$|One {{study found}} an ERN even when {{subjects}} {{were not aware}} of their error. Awareness may not be necessary to elicit an ERN, but it could influence the effect of the amplitude of the feedback ERN. Relating back to the <b>reward-based</b> learning theory, awareness could modulate expectancy violations. Increased awareness could result in decreased violations of expectancies and decreased awareness could achieve the opposite effect. Further research is needed to completely understand the effects of awareness on ACC activation.|$|E

Some of this funding was tied up in process with the Security and Exchange Commission to authorize Fig's use of unaccredited investors; Fig during this time covered Double Fine's development costs from their own capital. The matter was resolved by September 2016, assuring Double Fine will receive the amount funded or invested.|$|E

50|$|Parenting {{interventions}} {{are the most}} commonly used treatment for treating early onset antisocial behaviors and conduct disorder in children, and quality parenting may be able to decrease the manifestation of CU traits. Children with high CU traits are less responsive to time-out and other punishment techniques than are healthy children as they are unperturbed by the threat of punishment and time-out does not seem to bother them, so their behavior does not improve. <b>Reward-based</b> disciplining techniques, such as praise and reinforcement, tend to have a greater effect than punishing techniques on children with high CU traits in reducing antisocial behavior.|$|E

50|$|The {{methods and}} {{tools of the}} behaviourist will depend on several factors {{including}} the dog's temperament, the behaviourist's personal philosophy on training, the behaviourist's experience, and the behavioural problems being addressed. At {{one end of the}} spectrum, some behaviourists attempt to train dogs, refraining from the use of aversive or coercive methods (and the tools associated with them, such as choke, prong/pinch or electric shock collars, kicking, hitting, poking, staring, shaking, or rolling), choosing instead to rely on <b>reward-based</b> methods. Dog behaviourists and dog trainers with a knowledge of how to approach training in a behavioural way usually do not offer guaranteed results.|$|E
