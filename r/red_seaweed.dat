I turned on the compressed air again--for the suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all, in spite of the rum--and stood recovering myself. It struck coolish down there, and that helped take off the stuffiness a bit.|$|E

40|$|Seaweeds or marine macro algae {{consist of}} taxonomically {{distinguished}} groups of Chlorophyta (green seaweeds), Phaeophyta (brown <b>seaweeds)</b> and Rhodophyta (<b>red</b> <b>seaweeds).</b> They are generally found attached to hard substrata such as rocks, pebbles, dead corals or other hard {{structures in the}} intertidal or subtidal regions of the sea. Seaweeds are valued for the natural source of phycocolloids like agar-agar, algin and carrageenan. A number of tropical seaweeds including green algaeUlva, Enteromorpha, Monostroma, Caulerpa) brown seaweeds Dictyota, Laminaria, Cladosiphon, Podina) and <b>red</b> <b>seaweeds</b> (GracUoria, Porphyra, Eucheuma) are eaten directly (sea vegetables) for their minerals, vitamins, proteins, essential amino acids and low fat content. The major economic significance of seaweeds is the polysaccharides (agar, algin, carrageenan, agarose, etc) certain <b>red</b> and brown <b>seaweed</b> species contain. According to the FAO data base during 2008, total world production of marine algae was estimated to 15. 8 million tonnes (wet weight) equivalent {{to the value of}} 87. 4 million US with 99. 8 percent by weight and 99. 5 percent by value contributed by Asian region alone (FAO., 2011) ...|$|R

50|$|Rhodothamniella floridula {{is a small}} <b>red</b> <b>seaweed</b> {{detectable}} {{more easily}} with the feet than with the eyes. It thrives only where sand and rock occur together: anchored to the rock, it accumulates sand to form a slightly soft irregular carpet a centimetre or so in thickness. Although the surface is a dull red colour, in cross section the appearance is of a miniature sand dune with no visible algal component. Unable to stand significant desiccation, it prefers locations from the mid-shore downwards.|$|E

Along the lower shore the coarse grained rocks are partly covered by brown seaweeds such as Flat wrack (Fucus spiralis) and Knotted wrack Ascophyllum nodosum, while pools and crevices {{in the rocks}} provide shelter {{for a wide variety}} of algal species, such as the <b>red</b> <b>seaweed</b> Corallina officinalis.

The MCZ extends from Porthoustock Point south to Polcries and extends 2 km from the coastline. The seabed varies within the site and includes rocky reefs, vertical rock faces, subtidal sand and intertidal coarse sediment. The sediments in shallow water support Maerl beds. Maerl is a collective term for several species of <b>red</b> <b>seaweed</b> which have a hard, chalky skeleton.

40|$|Seaweeds and seaweed-derived {{products}} are underexploited marine bioresources {{and a source}} of natural ingredients for functional foods. Nutritional studies on seaweeds indicate that brown and <b>red</b> <b>seaweeds</b> possess a good nutritional quality and could be used as an alternative source of dietary fiber, protein, and minerals. Moreover, bioactive sulfated polysaccharides are the main components of soluble fiber in seaweeds and also bioactive peptides can be prepared from seaweed protein. This chapter gives an overview of the main biological properties of sulfated polysaccharides and peptides from brown and <b>red</b> <b>seaweeds.</b> Recent studies have provided evidence that sulfated polysaccharides from seaweeds can {{play a vital role in}} human health and nutrition. Besides, peptides derived from algal protein are most promising as antihypertensive agents. Further research work, especially in vivo studies, are needed in order to gain a better knowledge of the relation structure-function by which bioactive compounds from seaweeds exert their bioactivity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
