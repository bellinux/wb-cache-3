5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly <b>rhinoceros</b> (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly <b>rhinoceros,</b> so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros,</b> first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly <b>rhinoceros</b> survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean <b>Rhinoceros</b> or Eastern Sumatran <b>rhinoceros,</b> which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is markedly smaller than the other two. The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo <b>Rhinoceros</b> Sanctuary in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's <b>Rhinoceros</b> is {{the name}} {{commonly}} given to a woodcut executed by German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer in 1515. The image {{is based on a}} written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian <b>rhinoceros</b> that had arrived in Lisbon in 1515. Dürer never saw the actual <b>rhinoceros,</b> which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times. In late 1515, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live <b>rhinoceros</b> was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named Abada, arrived from India at the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577, being later inherited by Philip II of Spain around 1580.|$|E

5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck {{folds of the}} Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> are smaller {{than those of the}} Indian <b>rhinoceros,</b> but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an {{endangered}} species, however, the Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5|$|R. s. annamiticus, {{known as}} the Vietnamese Javan <b>rhinoceros,</b> <b>Rhinoceros</b> sondaicus annamiticu or Vietnamese <b>rhinoceros,</b> once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific annamiticus {{is derived from the}} Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range. In 2006, a single population, {{estimated}} at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> is {{considered}} the least derived of the extant species, as it shares more traits with its Miocene ancestors. Paleontological evidence in the fossil record dates the genus Dicerorhinus to the Early Miocene, 23–16 million years ago. Many fossils have been classified as members of Dicerorhinus, but no other recent species are in the genus. Molecular dating suggests the split of Dicerorhinus from the four other extant species {{as far back as}} 25.9 ± 1.9 million years. Three hypotheses have been proposed for the relationship between the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> and the other living species. One hypothesis suggests the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> is closely related to the black and white rhinos in Africa, evidenced by the species having two horns, instead of one. Other taxonomists regard the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> as a sister taxon of the Indian and Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> because their ranges overlap so closely. A third hypothesis, based on more recent analyses, however, suggests that the two African rhinos, the two Asian rhinos, and the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> represent three essentially separate lineages that split around 25.9 million years ago; which group diverged first remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|The first {{studies of}} the Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> by naturalists from outside of its region took place in 1787, when two animals were shot in Java. The skulls {{were sent to the}} renowned Dutch naturalist Petrus Camper, who died in 1789 before he was able to publish his {{discovery}} that the rhinos of Java were a distinct species. Another Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> was shot on the island of Sumatra by Alfred Duvaucel, who sent the specimen to his stepfather Georges Cuvier, the famous French scientist. Cuvier recognized the animal as a distinct species in 1822, and in the same year it was identified by Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest as <b>Rhinoceros</b> sondaicus. It was the last species of <b>rhinoceros</b> to be identified. Desmarest initially identified the rhino as being from Sumatra, but later amended this to say his specimen was from Java.|$|E
5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the <b>rhinoceros</b> horn black market have determined that Asian <b>rhinoceros</b> horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African <b>rhinoceros</b> horn.|$|E
5|$|A Javan <b>rhinoceros</b> has {{not been}} {{exhibited}} in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta, and London.

5|$|The Indian and Javan <b>rhinoceros,</b> {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus <b>Rhinoceros,</b> first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed <b>Rhinoceros</b> and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> is more closely related to the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.|$|E
