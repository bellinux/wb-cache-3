40|$|<b>Rods</b> <b>and</b> cones {{are both}} photoreceptors in the retina, {{but they are}} {{different}} in many aspects including the light response characteristics and, for example, cell morphology and metabolism. These differences would be caused by differences in proteins expressed in <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. To understand the molecular bases of these differences between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, {{one of the ways}} is to compare proteins expressed in <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, and to find those expressed specifically or dominantly. In the present study, we are interested in proteins in the outer segment (OS), the site responsible for generation of rod- or cone-characteristic light responses and also the site showing different morphology between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. For this, we established a method to purify the OS and the inner segment (IS) of <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> also of cones from purified carp <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, respectively, using sucrose density gradient. In particular, we were interested in proteins tightly bound to the membranes of cone OS. To identify these proteins, we analyzed proteins in some selected regions of an SDS-gel of washed membranes of the OS and the IS obtained from both <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, with Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a protein database constructed from carp retina. By comparing the lists of the proteins found in the OS and the IS of both <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, we found some proteins present in cone OS membranes specifically or dominantly, in addition to the proteins already known to be present specifically in cone OS...|$|R
50|$|He {{found that}} blind mice lacking classic outer-retinal photoreceptors (<b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones) still had eye-mediated {{responses}} to light. Mice with the melanopsin gene knocked out but with functional <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones were {{also able to}} entrain. However, when melanopsin was knocked out in blind mice without <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, they exhibited “complete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light.” Provencio concluded that either melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells or outer-retinal photoreceptors (<b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones) are sufficient to induce a response to light. However, {{in the absence of}} either <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones or melanopsin, melanopsin becomes necessary for photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator and for other photic responses.|$|R

5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E

Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party.

Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E

5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth Nightbeat puzzles out {{the links}} between the Machination's various actions. The {{returned}} Prime attempts to get proactive by moving {{the location of the}} Ark-19, but it is shot down by Sixshot, though the crew survive. The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a carpet bombing strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets. Hunter escapes his captors and discovers the decapitated but still living head of Sunstreaker. Sunstreaker reveals his mind is being used as the hub for the Machination's army, and Hunter opts to fight back, becoming a Headmaster himself. The Reapers arrive at Earth, attacking the Decepticon base and forcing Megatron to recall Sixshot, while Nova Prime (now known as Nemesis Prime), concerned at the pace of events, dispatches Galvatron to Earth.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, Jeffrey was {{appointed}} to establish and command No. 2 Operational Training Unit (No.2 OTU). Initially based at Port Pirie, South Australia, the unit relocated to Mildura, Victoria, the following month, training pilots for combat in such aircraft as Kittyhawks, CAC Boomerangs and Supermarine Spitfires. Its instructors under Jeffrey included aces Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Jeffrey married Colleen Crozier at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 14May; his best man was fellow ace and No.3 Squadron veteran Alan Rawlinson. The couple had two sons, <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> Tim. In August 1943, Jeffrey took charge of No.5 Fighter Sector Headquarters, based in Darwin, Northern Territory. On 25September, he took over from Caldwell as Officer Commanding No.1 (Fighter) Wing, comprising three Spitfire squadrons whose role was to defend North-Western Area (NWA) from air attack. By this time, Japanese raids had declined in strength and frequency, and Allied forces in the NWA shifted from a defensive posture to assaulting Japanese positions in the Dutch East Indies and Western New Guinea. No.1 Wing intercepted some raiders in late September but none came in October; the last Japanese attack on northern Australia took place on 12November. Jeffrey was promoted to temporary group captain in December.|$|E

5|$|Skywatch, {{having lost}} control of Ravage and Laserbeak due to {{interference}} from Soundwave, reactivate Grimlock to use against the increasing Transformer activity. Due to Machination sabotage Grimlock escapes and is approached by Scorponok, who proposes an alliance. Grimlock refuses and is out gunned in the battle, but teleports to the Dynobot ship before Scorponok terminates him, still buried after the battle with Shockwave, vowing to bring the Machination down. Skywatch reactivate the other Dynobots, unaware the Machination are manipulating them into killing Grimlock. Finding the Skyfire, the Headmasters attack and manage to teleport Grimlock to Fallon, Nevada, {{in the midst of}} a pitched battle. Skywatch respond by moving in the other Dynobots as both Hot <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> the combined form of Hunter and Sunstreaker locate the Machination. Hot Rod is almost killed by Scorponok, but kept alive as a witness to the Headmaster's plans. The battle in Fallon devastates the town, but the Dynobots are able to reassert their personalities. Scorponok sends in his Headmaster army as Skywatch head agent Red, now suspicious of the repeated control failures on the Transformers, confers with Shockwave, fitting him with a bomb and directing him to eliminate the Dynobots, Ravage and Laserbeak. In Fallon, the infighting Dynobots manage to fight off the Headmasters with aid from Grimlock's allies the Monsterbots. Hot Rod manages to escape as Sunstreaker and Hunter locate the main Machination facility, while Shockwave locates the stasis locked Soundwave, making a deal with him to deactivate the bomb in his head in return for freeing Soundwave from stasis lock. Sunstreaker saves Hot Rod (who then sends a distress call) but is blasted by Scorponok as the Dynobots and Monsterbots launch a full-scale assault on the Machination. Outclassed by the sheer numbers of Headmasters, they are saved when a grieving Hunter pulls the plug on Sunstreaker's original head, seemingly killing him and disabling the Machination forces. However, a vengeful Scorponok and the newly arrived Shockwave attack as Ultra Magnus, still searching for Scorponok, receives Hot Rod's signal. Shockwave and Scorponok battle each other. The Headmaster loses but Grimlock, finally accepting responsibility for his actions, battles Shockwave, and the other Dinobots aid him. Scorponok is permanently taken out when Hot <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> Swoop disable his original head. Grimlock brings down the Machination compound on top of him and Shockwave as Magnus arrives to clean up the situation. Grimlock is arrested along with Shockwave and Scorponok, but the other Dinobots are no longer under suspicion, and repair the Skyfire to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass <b>rod,</b> <b>and</b> the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E

After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E
