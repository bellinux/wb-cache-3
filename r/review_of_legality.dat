Relying on article 47 of the Charter, the Court ruled that the review performed by the General Court did comply with the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. Unlike the Advocate General, the Court did not rely chiefly on unlimited jurisdiction on fines. It ruled that the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> is capable of affording sufficient protection of parties procedural rights. It held in particular that “Courts cannot use the Commission’s margin of discretion […] as a basis for dispensing with the conduct of an in-depth review of the law and of the facts...|$|E
40|$|The current article {{provides}} a critical {{overview of the}} CJEU’s role as the main ‘architect’ {{of the relationship between}} the EU legal order and the international legal order. The activities of the CJEU are assessed in light of four parameters: the protection of fundamental rights, the protection of the internal division of competences within the EU, issues of primacy and <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> when international agreements are present, and the relationship between the CJEU and other international tribunals. It is argued that the CJEU in the last decade is increasingly acting in a fashion similar to federal constitutional courts that seek to protect the ‘federal’ level legal order from the intrusions of the international legal order and those of the sub-federal level. In its quest to protect the autonomy of the EU legal order and its own exclusive jurisdiction in a multilevel, pluralistic legal system, the CJEU might have caused more harm than good, affecting legal certainty, and the dialogue between it and the international legal order or international tribunals...|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the legal}} remedies {{provided by the}} General Administrative Procedure Act of the Republic of Slovenia (GAPA, 1999), as the only legal instrument for the annulment or modification of an issued decision. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} appeal, often used directly on a constitutional basis. In addition to pursuing the protection of the rights of the parties in administrative proceedings, the purpose of the appeal is to establish an internal administrative supervision of line ministries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess whether and to what extent certain legal remedies under the GAPA are effective in (Slovenian) practice compared to the goals of their regulation. In order to protect their position, parties should have the possibility of challenging the act both after the issue of the act at first instance as well as after it has become complete or even final and has the force of res iudicata. Challenging an act is possible only through legal remedies provided by law. The modification of decisions after their completeness (after the end of administrative proceedings) or even after finality (following an administrative dispute) is diminishing the level of trust in the legal system (i. e. legal certainty). Therefore the use of, in particular, extraordinary legal remedies have to be limited to the most essential errors in the procedure. Legal remedies are specified primarily by the GAPA, by type as well as by grounds, bodies, effects, characteristics (dispositiveness/officiality, non/suspensiveness, non/devolution, etc.), and time limits. The GAPA distinguishes between the use of legal remedies in connection to completeness of a decision (within the administrative procedure when the decision cannot be challenged (any more) by an appeal) and finality (after the administrative dispute regarding the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> of complete decisions is no longer possible). The author is therefore suggesting several amendments to the GAPA to achieve more successfully the goals of present legal remedies and the effectiveness of the administrative system as a whole, including the reduced caseload of the courts when the appeal system is successful in persuading the parties not to continue with the administrative dispute after the completeness of a decision within administrative proceedin g. appeal; effectiveness; administrative system; administrative procedure; legal remedies; legal certainty; legality...|$|E
40|$|Analizira se ocjena zakonitosti općih akata, ponajprije kao oblika kontrole nad radom uprave, a zatim u hrvatskom pravu. U zakonodavstvu i praksi Ustavnog suda Hrvatske pojavila se podjela općenormativnih akata na propise i opće akte. Budući da Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu propisuje da je Ustavni sud nadležan za ocjenu ustavnosti zakona te ustavnosti i zakonitosti drugih propisa, uvriježilo se stajalište da Ustavni sud nije nadležan za ocjenu ustavnosti i zakonitosti svih općih akata. Ustavni sud je stvorio »načelo nužde« te je tako proglašavao opće akte propisima i provodio ocjenu njihove ustavnosti i zakonitosti. Analizira se i kritički preispituje takva praksa Ustavnog suda s obzirom na shvaćanje da su svi opći akti propisi, pa je Ustavni sud oduvijek bio nadležan za ocjenu njihove ustavnosti i zakonitosti. Analizira se uređenje i praksa ocjene zakonitosti općih akata prema Zakonu o upravnim sporovima te se razgraničava nadležnost Ustavnog i Visokog upravnog suda. The paper {{analyses}} {{the legality}} of bylaws, primarily {{as a form of}} control of public administration in general, and then as an institute of the Croatian law in particular. The issue of legality of bylaws has been highly controversial issue of Croatian law. Legislation and case law of the Constitutional Court have divided general normative acts into regulations and bylaws. As the Constitutional Law on the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia has stipulated that the Constitutional Court is in charge of reviewing the harmonisation of laws with the Constitution and of other regulations with laws and the Constitution, there has appeared a conventional opinion that the Constitutional Court is not competent for reviewing the harmonisation of bylaws that are not regulations, with the Constitution and the law. In order to prevent bylaws that must not exist from surviving within the legal system, the Court has created the “principle of necessity”, thus proclaiming bylaws which, according to conventional opinion, are not regulations, to be regulations, and has been reviewing their legality and constitutionality. One can formulate a hypothesis that all bylaws are regulations, thus making the Constitutional Court competent for the <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>legality</b> and constitutionality of all general normative acts. The Constitution recognises only regulations, so it can be claimed that all the acts that have abstract characteristics are in fact regulations. Further, the author analyses the regulation of legality of bylaws introduced by the new Law on Administrative Disputes, which is the competence of the High Administrative Court. The competences of the Constitutional Court and the High Administrative Court are clearly delineated. Finally, case law of the High Administrative Court is analysed in some detail...|$|E
