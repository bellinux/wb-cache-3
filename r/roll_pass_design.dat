50|$|Rolling mills {{are often}} divided into roughing, {{intermediate}} and finishing rolling cages. During shape rolling, an initial billet (round or square) with edge of diameter typically ranging between 100-140 mm is continuously deformed {{to produce a}} certain finished product with smaller cross section dimension and geometry. Different sequences can be adopted to produce a certain final product starting from a given billet. However,since each rolling mill is significantly expensive (up to 2 million euros), a typical requirement is to contract the number or rolling passes. Different approaches have been achieved including empirical knowledge, employment of numerical models, and Artificial Intelligence techniques. Lambiase et al. validated a finite element model (FE) for predicting the final shape of a rolled bar in round-flat pass. {{one of the major}} concern when designing rolling mills is {{to reduce the number of}} passes; a possible solution to such requirement is represented by the slit pass also called split pass which divided an incoming bar in two or more subpart thus virtually increasing the cross section reduction ratio per pass as reported by Lambiase.Another solution for reducing the number of passes in the rolling mills is the employment of automated systems for <b>Roll</b> <b>Pass</b> <b>Design</b> as that proposed by Lambiase and Langella. subsequently, Lambiase further developed an Automated System based on Artificial Intelligence and particularly an integrated system including an inferential engine based on Genetic Algorithms a knowledge database based on an Artificial Neural Network trained by a parametric Finite element model and to optimize and automatically design rolling mills.|$|E

40|$|Hot steel rolling {{techniques}} {{continue to}} develop because rolling is amongst {{the most widely used}} industrial methods and steel is a most recycled material. Moreover, rolling mills are critical polluters and major resource consumers, which all requires introducing significant rationalisations in the relevant manufacturing processes. <b>Roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> is a principal factor that delimits process efficiency, product quality and resource consumption. Therefore it is important to optimise <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> including the selection of roll materials. New avenues for improving <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> are to be found by extracting knowledge buried in the vast of industrial records. Significant improvements can be identified by intelligent mathematical translations that enhance analyses of rolling campaigns and series. A review of <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> criteria is presented.

For the prediction of workpiece sectional shape, for some rod rolling passes, an analytical model by Shinokura and Takai was proposed and verified.

Today, on the other hand, the finite element (FE) techniques allow analysis of rolling processes {{in such a way as}} to simplify the work of design engineers. In this study, a round-oval pass and a round-flat oval pass are analyzed for steel rod rolling.

40|$|During {{hot rolling}} a texture {{gradient}} is developed through {{the thickness of}} the slab. This {{is directly related to the}} different strain paths experienced by the material between the surface and the centre plane. The difference in strain path not only affects the texture, but can also give differences in stored energy though the thickness, which in turn affects the recrystallisation kinetics and ultimately the recrystallisation texture. The strain path is further complicated when a number of <b>roll</b> <b>passes</b> are involved, since the material is subjected to more complex strain paths. In the current investigation the effects of <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> schedule (rolling direction, i. e. reverse rolling or continuous rolling) on the texture development during deformation and subsequent annealing have been characterised for an Al- 1 %Mn alloy. The study has shown that the texture of the surface region of the slabs is dependent on the <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> schedule. This effect is at a maximum in the near surface region, although the effect of <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> schedule on the recrystallisation kinetics is at a maximum 20 % of the half thickness below the surface of the slabs...|$|R

Moreover, the heuristic nature of the inferential engine contributes a great deal toward reducing search time, thus allowing such a system to be employed for industrial purposes.

The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation to fracture reached 232 MPa, 347 MPa and 21 % in the rolling direction. The maximum yield strength occurred after the fourth pass. The maximum is attributed to the small grain size and the formation of networks of sub-grains and deformed grains.

40|$|Purpose: {{investigation}} {{of the influence of}} the metal forming process during rolling in simple-shape passes on the degree of appearance of surface flaws; improvement of the <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> and its structure on the basis of utilization of passes which possess a higher rolling capacity. The investigation improves the methods of calculation of the forming coefficient. An analytic dependence is determined between the amout of flaws and forming coefficients during rolling in simple-shape passes. A procedure is developed for calculating the flaw appearance amount coefficient. The work develops a new pattern for roll grooving to be used in rolling simple-shape sections. The investigation includes the development of methods for estimating the rolling capacity of roll passes, which provides for designing of passes to suit the required quality of the surface. The pass systems are classified with regard to the rolling capacity.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two {{computer-aided design}} (CAD) programs developed for modeling the shape rolling process for airfoil sections. The first program, SHPROL, uses a modular upper-bound {{method of analysis}} and predicts the lateral spread, elongation, and roll torque. The second program, ROLPAS, predicts the stresses, roll separating force, the roll torque and the details of metal flow by simulating the rolling process, using the slab method of analysis. ROLPAS is an interactive program; it offers graphic display capabilities and allows the user {{to interact with the}} computer via a keyboard, CRT, and a light pen. The accuracy of the computerized models was evaluated by (a) rolling a selected airfoil shape at room temperature from 1018 steel and isothermally at high temperature from Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, and (b) comparing the experimental results with computer predictions.

40|$|Hot rolling {{is among}} the most widely used {{manufacturing}} techniques. However, rolling mills are major resource consumers; thus, urgent rationalisation is required in the relevant industrial systems. <b>Roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> (RPD) is a principal factor that determines process efficiency, product quality and resource consumption. Therefore, it is important to optimise RPD including the selection of roll materials. New avenues for optimising RPD are to be found by extracting knowledge buried in the vast repository of industrial records. The extracted statistical functions are then used for the nonlinear optimisation of RPD parameters. The design of a leading oval groove for rolling a wire rod is presented as an example, along with a discussion of the general mathematical aspects. The presented case analysis shows how regression analysis and the probability density function (PDF) are used to define principal dimensions—height and width—for the leading oval groove. These two dimensions are inferred following the logic of probabilistic design, and are based on an understanding of the trend in groove contour changes, which occur due to surface wear during rolling campaigns...|$|E
40|$|The thesis treats <b>roll</b> <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> in {{wire rod}} rolling of {{stainless}} steel for sequences and series built up by two-symmetrical grooves. It is focused on predicting rolling flexibility, also called working range, as well as product quality. For analysing the flexibility a computer program has been developed. The minimum and maximum roll gap and corresponding bar areas for series of grooves including "oval", "round", "false round", "square" and "diamond" shapes are calculated. Six pass designs used in Swedish mills are analysed. Full-scale rolling is compared with laboratory experiments for the square-oval and false round (round) -oval series. The false round-oval series offers the largest working range and that the flexibility is smaller for pass sequences designed for high reductions. The false round-oval series are also acknowledged as a series for high quality steels and are usually better than the square-oval series having a tendency for defect formation. The thesis also includes high-speed rolling of wire rod in blocks. Here interstand tensions are utilised {{in order to keep}} the process stable. For obtaining the required dimensional tolerances of the product they are kept as low as possible. However interstand tensions could be used in order to increase the working range and move the product range towards smaller wire cross sections. For analysing this possibility, a narrow spread technology is utilised. At present time a practical problem is referred to the fixed gearings in the common blocks, which require a certain and given level of interstand tensions and corresponding reductions. This problem can however be solved by means of new block design and modern process control technology. Roll stands can be separately driven and controlled at very high speeds. Thus the eight stand blocks can be subdivided into four plus four passes blocks with a cooling line between enabling also higher productivity without violating the product quality because defect formations caused by a too high rolling temperature. The true working range of a series for a specific steel grade is however not only dependent on the possible spectrum of wire dimensions that can be obtained but might also depend on its ability to decrease or eliminate defects such as surface cracks. Thus, the behaviour of artificial V-shaped cracks in the longitudinal direction has been investigated and compared for the square-oval and false round (round) -oval series mentioned above. In agreement with other research works it was established that efficient rolling conditions for reducing the cracks are obtained when the cracks open up at the same time as their depth is reduced. If the V-shaped crack is closed by contact between its oxidized side surfaces the rolling schedule is not optimal for getting a high quality product. A deeper understanding of the experimental results was obtained by means of an FE-analysi...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{microchannel}} heat exchangers, {{and the methods}} used to try and reduce the charge contained in them. First, four condensers were designed and manufactured with the same air side characteristics and same tube design (with the exception of some blocked ports in one design) so that any difference in charge, capacity, pressure drop etc. {{can be attributed to}} flow geometry. These designs were a two circuit serpentine <b>design,</b> a two <b>pass</b> parallel flow <b>design,</b> and two one <b>pass</b> parallel flow <b>designs.</b> The difference between the two one <b>pass</b> <b>designs</b> were the number of microchannel ports in the tubes, one with 19 ports and the other with 10. The one <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> with 10 ports contained the least amount of charge, on average about 20 g, while the other one <b>pass</b> <b>design</b> contained the most charge, about 28 g. The reason for this difference was not only because the smaller tube volume, but an increase in mass flux also decrease the amount of charge in the exit header by 20 - 30 %. The serpentine condenser also had very low charge amounts, but pressure drop was about ten times higher than in the parallel flow designs. This caused a 4 % lower COP than what was given with the one <b>pass</b> <b>design.</b> Two serpentine evaporators have also been examined. The evaporators had similar core volumes of about 870 cm 3. One evaporator had double the fin length by using a ???splitter??? fin, which reduced the length of the evaporator tube and therefore reduced the internal volume. Both evaporators performed almost exactly the same, but the splitter fin evaporator had less of a pressure drop and contained 15 % less charge. Finally, the models developed for this thesis were used to theoretically compare the performance and charge of six different refrigerants, propane (which was the refrigerant used for experiments), R 22, R 134 a, isobutane, ammonia, and R 410 A in a condenser. A pressure drop based on a 1 % decrease of Carnot COP was found for each refrigerant.
