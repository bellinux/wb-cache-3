40|$|Abstract The {{extent to}} which plant {{communities}} are determined by resource availability is a cen-tral theme in ecosystem science, but patterns of small-scale variation in resource availability are poorly known. Studies of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling provide insights into factors limiting tree growth and forest productivity. To investigate rates of tropical forest litter production and decomposition in relation to nutrient availability and topography {{in the absence of}} confounding large-scale variation in climate and altitude we quantified nutrient fluxes via litterfall and leaf litter decomposition within three distinct floristic associations of tropical rain forest growing along a soil fertility gradient at the Sepilok Forest Reserve (SFR), Sabah, Malaysia. The quantity and nutrient content of small litter decreased along a gradient of soil nutrient availability from <b>alluvial</b> <b>forest</b> (most fertile) through sandstone forest to heath forest (least fertile). Temporal variation in litterfall was greatest in the sandstone forest, where the amount of litter was correlated negatively with rainfall in the previous month. Mass loss and N and P release were fastest from <b>alluvial</b> <b>forest</b> litter, and slowest from heath forest litter. All litter types decomposed most rapidly in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>forest.</b> Stand-level N and P use effi-ciencies (ratios of litter dry mass to nutrient content) were greatest for the heath forest fol-lowed by the sandstone ridge, sandstone valley and <b>alluvial</b> <b>forests,</b> respectively. We conclude that nutrient supply limits productivity most in the heath forest and least in the <b>alluvial</b> <b>forest.</b> Nutrient supply limited productivity in sandstone forest, especially on ridge and hill top sites where nutrient limitation may be exacerbated by reduced rates of litter decomposition during dry periods. The fluxes of N and P varied significantly between the different floristic communities at SFR and these differences may contribute to small-scale variation in species composition...|$|R
