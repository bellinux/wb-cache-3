500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

5000|$|Justice Powell's {{majority}} opinion distinguished this case from Marsh v. Alabama, {{in which the}} court held that a company town could not exclude a Jehovah's Witness from distributing religious literature on a privately owned sidewalk. Balancing Marsh's First Amendment rights against the owner's property rights, the court in that case held that Marsh's rights occupied a [...] "preferred position" [...] and weighed heavier than <b>the</b> owner's <b>rights.</b> <b>Here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, the Court concluded that the respondents could have distributed their handbills on [...] "any public street, on any public sidewalk, in any public park, or in any public building." [...] Therefore, respondents were not entitled to exercise their free-speech rights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> privately owned shopping-center property.|$|R

When I sail, they sail; when I remain ashore, they remain ashore. I'll find plenty {{for them to do}} <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plantation.

Oh! this border life is sad for women. Only {{a little while ago}} my brother Samuel McColloch was shot and scalped <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river bank.

And lately I see his consideration--his {{kindness}} in the light of what he could do if he held to that border law.... And of all the men I've met out here Kells is the least wild with this gold fever.

"Soon {{after that}} I left home--it seems Milly {{was the only}} one who could keep me home--an' I went to the bad, as to prosperin' I saw some pretty hard life in the Pan Handle, an' then I went North.

An' there wasn't many riders as could beat me ridin'. An' I can say all modest-like that I never seen the white man who could track a hoss or a steer or a man with me. Afore I knowed it two years slipped by, an' all at once I got homesick, en' purled a bridle south.|$|E

Why, sometimes in a single day I find and eat almost five hundred eggs of those little green plant lice that do so much damage in the spring and summer. Then there are little worms that bore in just under the bark, and there are other creatures who sleep the winter away in little cracks in the bark. Oh, there is plenty for me to do in the winter. I am one of the policemen of the trees. Downy and Hairy the Woodpeckers, Seep-Seep the Brown Creeper and Yank-Yank the Nuthatch are others.

You wouldn't think {{to look at her}} that she had a tragedy in her life, but she has. Aunt Louisa told me the tale. It all happened long, long ago. Interesting things like this all did happen long ago, it seems to me. They never seem to happen now. This was in '49, when people were rushing to the gold fields in California.

One of the iron bands on our rudder got broke and sprung out a good while ago, and it must have been the sharp end of that which punched into yer boat when we drifted down on her. We ain't got no tackle suitable to h'ist her on board, and as to towin' her--a big boat like that, full of water,--'t ain't possible. We've lost a lot of time already, and now there's a good wind and we are bound to make the best of it; so me and Abner thinks the best thing ye can do is to sink yer boat <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar where we are now anchored, having struck it all right, as ye see, and mark the spot with an oil-cag.

5000|$|Pulse X {{is noted}} for its {{aggressive}} minimalism and original sound, consisting of a single 16 bar loop, with some minor variation to the patterns {{in the second half}} of the song, with a more typical 2-step garage style for 8 bars followed by a stripped down snare and kick for 8 bars. The song has no introduction and the outro is a simple fade out. A voice sample saying [...] "Musical Mob <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> map" [...] plays once every 32 bars throughout on the switch from one 8-bar pattern to the other.|$|E
40|$|What {{relationship}} do we {{have with}} nature, what does it represent to us? It is something foreign, far away.

In my master degree project I wanted to investigate and portray the relationship we have with nature today. Nature as a symbol, as representing something. A longing is a project in illustration presented as exhibition.

40|$|In 1670, the Bolognese {{mathematician}} Pietro Mengoli {{published his}} Speculationi di musica, a highly original work attempting to found the mathematical study of music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{anatomy of the}} ear.

He analysed in detail the supposed behaviour of the subtle part of the air inside the ear, and the patterns of strokes made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eardrum by simultaneous sounds. Most strikingly, he divided the musical octave into a continuous set of regions which he colour-coded to show their effects on a listener.
