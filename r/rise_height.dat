50|$|Spiral stairs, {{sometimes}} referred to in architectural descriptions as vice, wind around a newel (also the central pole). They typically have a handrail on the outer side only, and {{on the inner side}} just the central pole. A squared spiral stair assumes a square stairwell and expands the steps and railing to a square, resulting in unequal steps (larger where they extend into a corner of the square). A pure spiral assumes a circular stairwell and the steps and handrail are equal and positioned screw-symmetrically. A tight spiral stair with a central pole is very space efficient in the use of floor area. Spiral stairs have the disadvantage of being very steep - only if they are tight or are otherwise not supported by a center column. This is because of two reasons. The wider the spiral, the more steps can be accommodated per spiral. Therefore, if the spiral is large in diameter, via having a central support column that is strong (invariably large in diameter) and a special handrail that helps distributes the load, each step may be longer and therefore the rise between each step may be smaller, (equal to that of regular steps.) Otherwise, the circumference of the circle at the walk line will be so small that it will be impossible to maintain a normal tread depth and a normal <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> without compromising headroom before reaching the upper floor. To maintain headroom some spiral stairs have very high rises to support a very short diameter. These are typically cases where the stairwell must be a small diameter by design or must not have any center support by design or may not have any perimeter support. An example of perimeter support is the Vatican stairwell shown in the next section or the gothic stairwell shown to the left. That stairwell is only tight because of its design in which the diameter must be small. Many spirals, however, have sufficient width for normal size treads (8 inches) by being supported by any combination of a center pole, perimeter supports attaching to or beneath the treads, and a helical handrail. In this manner, the treads may be wide enough to accommodate low rises. The photo on the right are self-supporting stairs. This means the spiral needs to be necessarily steep to allow the weight to distribute safely down the spiral in the most vertical manner possible. Spiral steps with center columns or perimeter support do not have this limitation. Building codes may limit the use of spiral stairs to small areas or secondary usage if their treads are not sufficiently wide or have risers above 8 or 9 inches.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the fundamental fluid mechanics of fountains. Attention is restricted to fountains formed by the vertical injection of fluid into a uniform environment of marginally differing density such that {{the momentum of the}} ejection is opposed by buoyancy. The small density dif- ference between the two miscible fluids permits dilution of the ejected fluid and, for sufficiently energetic ejections, turbulent entrainment occurs. Our experimental study of dense saline solution forced vertically upwards into a quiescent freshwater environment examines fountains arising over a broad range of source conditions. We combine experimental results with dimensional reasoning and theoretical arguments to provide meaningful and significant additions to the existing knowledge of fountain dynamics. The results presented enhance our understanding through the study of rise heights, the fluctuations in rise heights and the scale and balance of bulk fluxes within fountains over the range of source conditions. A study of transient and steady-state behaviours and associated fountain rise ratio (peak relative to mean rise heights) identifies previously unreported dynam- ics which extend published results - these include the pinch-off of the initial vortex and <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> ratios (unexpectedly) below unity. Analysis of the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> fluctuations during the quasi-steady state provides characteristic length, time and velocity scales distinct to the varied classes of fountain flow. Our results for the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> ratio and indeed <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> fluctuations reveal a number of differing classes of fountain behaviour; behaviour which highlights the changing and complex nature of fountains. This results in a consistent classification which extends the previous three classes of fountain behaviour to five. Some of the implications of these new behaviours to practical engineering and geophysical applications of fountains are discussed. Imperial Users onl...|$|E

The depth of the plume particle maximum varies significantly in the water column, from 2150 m to > 2350 m, but remains strongly associated with the ? 2 = 36. 987 potential density isopycnal.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study concerning the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> and morphology of a negatively buoyant fluid projectile, produced when a finite volume of saline solution is forced vertically upwards into a quiescent and uniform fresh water environment, is presented. Unlike the much studied continuous injection of high Reynolds number negatively buoyant fluid {{giving rise to}} a turbulent fountain, the behaviour of a finite volume negatively buoyant release remains, until now, unstudied. The work presented herein {{is based on the}} development of an experimental set up and methodology specifically tailored {{to the study of the}} negatively buoyant projectile. We commence by identifying the two source parameters governing the behaviour of the negatively buoyant projectile; namely the source Froude number FrD, expressing the ratio of source momentum to source buoyancy, and the aspect ratio of release L/D. relating the length L of the column of saline solution dispensed to the nozzle diameter D. In doing so, we note the link to turbulent fountains (continuous negatively buoyant releases) whose behaviour is governed solely by FrD and to vortex rings (finite volume neutrally buoyant releases), whose behaviour is governed solely by L/D. Based on its differing <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> behaviour and morphology of release (for varying FrD and L/D), we classified the negatively buoyant projectile into one of three regimes: the weak-fountain regime, where the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> behaviour of the negatively buoyant projectile adhered to very weak fountain predictions; the vorticity-development regime, where the development of an internal vortical structure within the head of the negatively buoyant projectile inhibited its vertical propagation; and the forced-release regime, where the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> behaviour of the negatively buoyant release adhered, under certain source conditions, to forced fountain predictions. This adherence of the <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> behaviour of negatively buoyant projectiles to fountain <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> predictions led to a study of the source conditions (in terms of FrD and L/D), separating finite volume behaviour (negatively buoyant projectile) from continuous behaviour (fountain), at least in terms of initial fountain rise heights. This study led to a classification of the FrD and L/D vales marking the transition from finite volume behaviour to continuous behaviour for negatively buoyant releases, linking our work on the negatively buoyant projectile to existing fountain literature. Finally, we studied the time dependent volume of the head of the negatively buoyant projectile as it propagated, and identified two stages: a growth stage and a decay stage. We established that the volume of the head of the negatively buoyant projectile is subject to an absolute limit. This finding compares favourably with the absolute limit on the volume of fluid contained within a neutrally buoyant vortex ring (the formation number), as detailed in vortex ring literature. On comparing our findings on the negatively buoyant projectile to those on vortex rings, we developed a new method for estimating the formation number of negatively buoyant projectiles (possibly also for vortex rings), determined the dependence of the formation number on FrD, and linked our work on the negatively buoyant projectile to the existing literature on vortex rings.

Considerations of the factors influencing <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> and relating the decrease in <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> to plate velocity indicate {{that the rate of}} topographic dropoff from spreading centers should be about half that on earth due to greater rock-fluid density contrast and lower temperature differential between the surface and interior.

Pre- (2008 – 2012) and post-flood records on groundwater table depth and groundwater chemistry were gathered from 20 wells across the region. Spatial variability of groundwater recharge after the flood was assessed and the changes in groundwater quality in the post-flood period were determined.

The dimensionless problem depends on a single parameter Ra = B/(??) – a Rayleigh number – based on the (conserved) total buoyancy B of the thermal, and the kinematic viscosity ? and thermal diffusivity ? of the fluid. Numerical solutions are found for a range of Ra. For small Ra there are only slight deformations to a spherically symmetric Gaussian temperature distribution. For large Ra, the temperature distribution becomes elongated vertically, with a long wake containing most of the buoyancy left behind the head. Passive tracers, however, are advected into a toroidal structure in the head. A simple asymptotic model for the large-Ra behaviour is obtained using slender-body theory. The width of the thermal is found to increase like (?t) 1 / 2, while the wake length and <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> both increase like (RalnRa) 1 / 2 (?t) 1 / 2, consistent with the numerical results.

In this work, we develop the theory for capillary imbibition and rise in channels of rectangular cross-section, taking into account rigidified and non-rigidified boundary conditions for the liquid–air interfaces and the effects of surface topography assuming Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter states. We provide simple interpolation formulae for the viscous friction associated with flow through rectangular cross-section channels as a function of aspect ratio. We derive a dimensionless cross-over time, T c, below which the exact numerical solution can be approximated by the Bousanquet solution and above which by the visco-gravi- tational solution. For capillary rise heights significantly below the equilibrium height, this cross-over time is T c & (3 X e / 2) 2 / 3 and has an associated dimensionless cross-over <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> X c & (3 X e / 2) 1 / 3, where X e = 1 / G is the dimensionless equilibrium <b>rise</b> <b>height</b> and G is a dimensionless form of the acceleration due to gravity.
