5|$|Recognizing {{the event}} {{as a serious}} {{radiological}} accident, the OAEP organized an emergency <b>response</b> <b>team</b> to manage the situation, {{in conjunction with the}} local public health and civil defense authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to medical DMATs, {{there are other}} <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> that specialize in specific types of medical emergencies such as hazardous material handling and decontamination and LRATs, which are primarily Logistics <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> to support any of the <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> under the NDMS umbrella. Such other types of teams are the DMORTs (Disaster Mortuary Operations <b>Response</b> <b>Teams,</b> NVRTs (National Veterinary Medical <b>Response</b> <b>Teams),</b> IMSuRTs (International Medical/Surgical <b>Response</b> <b>Teams),</b> and the IRCTs (Incident <b>Response</b> Coordination <b>Teams).</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle {{the technical aspects of}} investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and <b>Response</b> <b>Team</b> and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E

5|$|On August23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{deployed}} 717 personnel, {{mainly from}} the disaster <b>response</b> <b>team,</b> to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water, causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks. By August25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home. On August26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency <b>response</b> <b>team</b> well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency <b>response</b> <b>team</b> to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E

5|$|Branches of the Mexican Red Cross in Guerrero, Oaxaca and Michoacán {{were put}} on alert. The organization's {{national}} emergency <b>response</b> <b>team</b> was on stand-by to assist the most affected areas. Navy helicopters delivered food and water to remote areas of the Baja California peninsula. The Mexican Red Cross dispatched 2,000food parcels to {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur. In the city of Mulegé, gas supply, which was necessary to run generators, was low, drinking water was gone, and the airstrip was covered with mud. Many homeless residents initially stayed with friends or in government-run shelters. Throughout the Baja California peninsula, thousands remained without water or electricity two days after the storm, although a pilot from Phoenix prepared to fly to the disaster area with 100gallons (380litres) of water. Other pilots were expected to execute similar flights, as well. The office of Baja California Sur Tourism stated that minimal damage occurred to the tourism infrastructure, with only minimal delays to airports, roads, and maritime facilities. The Episcopal Relief and Development delivered food, clothing, medicine, and transportation to about 100families, and gave mattresses to about 80families.|$|E
5|$|By May1, {{the local}} {{branch of the}} Red Cross {{distributed}} essential supplies to residents in Labutta Township. In coordination with the Disaster Assistance <b>Response</b> <b>Team,</b> the areas in greatest need for aid were identified and requests for tarpaulin were made. Members of the Cabinet of Burma donated 3.7million kyat (US$2,960) in cash and 140bags of rice to victims in the Ayeyarwady Region. On May3, another 1.7million kyat (US$1,360) was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside Yangon. Temporary shelters were set up across Gwa Township. Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash. A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country. Red Cross operations continued through November30, by which time 3,485families were provided with aid. Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation was provided to the 1,000most affected families.|$|E
