Ten tests were performed injecting pressurized subcooled water into the <b>reaction</b> <b>tank</b> partially filled by Lead-Bismuth Eutectic alloy (LBE) at 400 ° C with a cover gas of argon at about 2 bar. Fast pressure transducers, thermocouples and strain gages provided high-quality measurement data for improving the phenomena understanding and supporting the development and validation phase of computer codes for SGTR numerical simulation. The experimental campaign is composed by two series of tests, characterized by different water pressure: 40 and 16 bar. The first two tests belonging to the low pressure experiments are presented, highlighting the pressurization time trends of the water injection tank, injection line and reaction vessel. The injected water mass flow rate and temperature trends in the reaction vessel were measured. The former test is the reference one and the latter was carried out for investigating the injection of water with higher sub-cooling.

The numerical analysis provided injection line and <b>reaction</b> <b>tank</b> pressurization in agreement with the experimental data.

Two tests are analysed. The LIFUS 5 /Mod 2 facility implemented a test section composed by 188 tubes, vertically disposed with triangular pitch, in a shell closed by top and bottom flanges and having a perforated cylindrical wall.

The first test analysed showed a first pressure peak of about 25 bar, due to pressure wave propagation at the cap rupture instant. It did not appear in the second test as consequence of a leakage from the cap before the complete rupture.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} {{wastewater treatment}} plants need a large surface area {{for the treatment of}} their sewage. This is due to the open structure of the biomass used to convert the polluting components in wastewater. Because of the flocculated growth, sludge concentrations in <b>reaction</b> <b>tanks</b> are low and settling times need to be long {{in order to keep the}} biomass in the system. This Ph. D. thesis describes the development of a new compact aerobic granular sludge technology, in which the biomass is grown in compact granular structures. The main advantage of this compact growth structure is the higher biomass concentrations that van be reached and that all processes, needed for the treatment of wastewater, can be performed in one (discontinuously operated) reactor. Therefore, 80 % less area and 30 % less energy is required for the treatment of the wastewater. This process is unique, since by the natural composition of the aerobic granular sludge, combined with different diffusion limitations, all processes for the conversion of the polluting agents can occur in the same granule simultaneously. In the laboratory, biological removal efficiencies of 100 % COD (acetate), 94 % phosphate and 94 % nitrogen (of which full-nitrification) were measured. During the Ph. D. a large-scale design has been made by the engineers of the Dutch consultancy firm DHV. Bottlenecks from practice were translated to scientific research and the results of the research could directly be used in the design. Different bottlenecks that were studied in the laboratory scale research were the influence on conversions and granule morphology of i) the way of influent dosing, ii) the use of a bubble column or airlift (influence of high local shear forces), iii) influence of temperature, iv) type of wastewater. A model for aerobic granular sludge has been developed as well, in order to study the sensitivity of different process parameters on conversion rates and efficiencies.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an {{increasing}} greenhouse gas in the troposphere and a potential destroyer of stratospheric ozone layer. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) {{is one of the}} anthropogenic N 2 O sources because inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds are converted to nitrate (NO 3 -, in the case of standard system) or N 2 (in the case of advanced system) by bacterial nitrification and denitrifcation processes in WWTP. These major processes can be distinguished by isotopocule analysis. In order to reveal production mechanisms of N 2 O in a standard wastewater treatment, we made water sampling at the central WWTP in Ulaanbaatar. The water samples collected from seven stations including biological <b>reaction</b> <b>tanks</b> were measured for concentration and isotopocule ratios of dissolved N 2 O and other inorganic nitrogen. Dissolved N 2 O concentration was extremely higher than that expected under atmospheric equilibrium (about 9 nmol/l) at all stations, indicating that this system is a potential source of N 2 O. It showed a gradual increase with the progress of biological reaction and the highest concentration (335. 7 nmol/l) was observed at station N 5 - 4 of the aeration tank when the DO was 5. 7 mg/l. Nitrification by nitrifying bacteria could actively occur by the concentration of NH 4 + decreased whereas NO 2 - and NO 3 - showed a temporal and monotonic increase, respectively, under high DO concentration. Although the reported values of site preference (SP) of N 2 O, the difference in 15 N/ 14 N ratio between central (α) and terminal (β) nitrogen, produced via NO 2 - reduction (SP(ND)), including both nitrifier and denitrifier denitrification, and NH 2 OH oxidation (SP(HO)) ranged from - 10. 7 ‰ to 0 ‰ and 31. 4 ‰ to 36. 3 ‰, respectively, the observed SP at aeration tank was close to SP(ND) rather than SP(HO). It was ranged from 0. 4 ‰ to 13. 3 ‰ when N 2 O concentration was high, implying that the NO 2 - reduction made a greater contribution to N 2 O production. Slightly elevated SP (13. 3 ‰) only at station N 5 - 1 was derived from the mixing of N 2 O produced via NH 2 OH oxidation and the maximal contribution of this pathway was estimated to be about 40 %. In other words, the contribution of NO 2 - reduction was more than 60 %...|$|R
