25|$|In January 2012, {{rather than}} decide {{yes or no}} per this plan, the ITU decided to {{postpone}} a decision on leap seconds to the World <b>Radiocommunication</b> Conference in November 2015.

25|$|By 2003, however, it was {{becoming}} clear that switchover could not start by 2006. In particular, the decision taken by the International Telecommunication Union to call a Regional <b>Radiocommunication</b> Conference to establish a frequency plan for digital broadcasting meant that in practice, substantive steps towards switchover would need to {{wait until after the}} conference's second session, due to be held in May and June 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} amateur radio operators used Morse code exclusively since voice-capable radio transmitters did {{not become}} commonly available until around 1920. Until 2003, the International Telecommunication Union mandated Morse code proficiency {{as part of the}} amateur radio licensing procedure worldwide. However, the World <b>Radiocommunication</b> Conference of 2003 made the Morse code requirement for amateur radio licensing optional. Many countries subsequently removed the Morse requirement from their licence requirements.|$|E
25|$|Sec. 9(1)(c) of the <b>Radiocommunication</b> Act {{creates a}} {{prohibition}} against all decoding of encrypted programming signals, {{followed by an}} exception where authorization is received from the person holding the lawful right in Canada to transmit and authorize decoding of the signal. This means receiving the encrypted programming of DishNetwork or DirecTV, even with a grey market subscription, may be construed as unlawful (this remains an unresolved Constitutional issue).|$|E
25|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is {{the part}} of the United Nations (UN) that manages the use of both the RF Spectrum and space {{satellites}} among nation states. The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, meeting every four years in order to set the Union's general policies. The ITU is divided into three Sectors: the <b>Radiocommunication</b> Sector (ITU-R) determines the technical characteristics and operational procedures for wireless services, and plays a vital role in the Spectrum Management of the radio-frequency; ITU-R Study Group 1 is the Spectrum Management study group; the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) develops internationally agreed technical and operating standards; and the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) fosters the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in developing nations throughout the world, that make up two-thirds of the ITU’s 191 Member States. The ITU Radio Regulations set a binding international treaty governing the use of the radio spectrum by some 40 different services.|$|E
500|$|Chapter II of Part II of the ISA, {{which allows}} for {{preventive}} detention (also known as detention without trial), is the most conspicuous feature of the Act.
