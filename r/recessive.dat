5|$|Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> condition {{caused by}} mutations in PANK2.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal <b>recessive).</b> The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal <b>recessive</b> hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{in order}} to correct {{pigmentation}} often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, {{some of which are}} <b>recessive,</b> crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same <b>recessive</b> genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.|$|E
5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for <b>recessive</b> genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry <b>recessive</b> chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry <b>recessive</b> genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{syndrome}} is an X-linked <b>recessive</b> disorder caused by mutations in the XK gene encoding the Kx blood type antigen, {{one of the}} Kell antigens.|$|E
5|$|Methylmalonic acidemia – an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> {{metabolic disorder}} that mimics {{the effects of}} ethylene glycol poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a <b>recessive</b> (partially active) one. In mammals, <b>recessive</b> Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the <b>recessive</b> allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Singapura was {{accepted}} for registration by the CFA in 1982 and granted championship status in 1988. In between this period, breeders {{found that the}} occasional litter would have a solid colored kitten, caused by the <b>recessive</b> gene for solid color. In a desire for the Singapura to breed true, many breeders chose to do test matings to pinpoint and remove from their breeding programs individuals with the <b>recessive</b> gene. It was discovered {{that two of the}} three foundation cats carried this gene.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} <b>recessive</b> deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For <b>recessive</b> harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be <b>recessive</b> and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Chorea acanthocytosis is an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the VPS13A, also called CHAC, on chromosome 9q21. The gene encodes the protein Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A, {{also known as}} chorein. The protein's function is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal <b>recessive</b> mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a <b>recessive</b> mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both <b>recessive),</b> and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' {{represents an}} exception. Fragrance is genetically related to flower colour (white, or pastel shades) {{and is a}} <b>recessive</b> characteristic, so that when fragrant and non fragrant varieties are crossed, not all progeny will be fragrant, whereas two fragrant progenitors will produce an all fragrant progeny.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} cultivar {{lacks the}} usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing its white colour to a <b>recessive</b> gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots {{do not provide}} nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a white coat was <b>recessive,</b> then white horses {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not <b>recessive.</b> Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|E
5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, autosomal <b>recessive</b> hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, {{and various}} seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal <b>recessive</b> pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history of the condition. People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the <b>recessive</b> allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas <b>recessive</b> alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are <b>recessive.</b> For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand {{study found}} that the F94L {{mutation}} was partially to significantly <b>recessive</b> in most traits, meaning cattle heterozygous for the mutation express less to significantly {{less than half of the}} effects noted for homozygous cattle, the Japanese {{study found that}} the meat and fat quantities in cattle heterozygous for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1950 as Bassen-Kornzweig disease, or Bassen-Kornzweig Syndrome, a rare, autosomal <b>recessive,</b> childhood-onset disorder {{in which the}} body fails to produce chylomicrons, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa {{and other forms of}} nerve dysfunction. It was first noted by the North American physician Frank Bassen, who later partnered with the ophthalmologist Abraham Kornzweig to identify and describe causes and symptoms of the disease. Affected children appear normal at birth but usually fail to thrive during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal dominant or <b>recessive</b> pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other <b>recessive.</b> Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries <b>recessive</b> piebald alleles {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and are linked to {{congenital}} hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal <b>recessive</b> trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger Species Survival Plan has {{condemned}} the breeding of white tigers, alleging {{they are of}} mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to inbreeding among homozygous <b>recessive</b> individuals. This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of <b>recessive</b> genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked <b>recessive</b> manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> condition {{due to a}} mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing {{may be used to}} screen family members of those affected.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal <b>recessive</b> disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal <b>recessive</b> disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a <b>recessive</b> gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). <b>Recessive</b> disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's {{ability to}} walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a <b>recessive</b> disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E
