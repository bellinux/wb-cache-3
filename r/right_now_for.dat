500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class action suits he said: [...] "It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> very little money, but I don't {{want to do it}} out of principle." [...] Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|Nixon later {{characterized}} {{the attitude of}} his backers and aides as, [...] "We want you to start campaigning <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> 1956, and we think {{the way to do}} it is to have available the funds to make speeches, make trips to California, and so forth." [...] Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000. Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon [...] "will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest". By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000, principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54. Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.|$|E

[...] He has since {{said that he has}} been {{disappointed}} with Obama's presidency, and lacks faith in both major political parties. In 2009, he posted a transcript of a webcast by political activist Lyndon LaRouche to the official Smashing Pumpkins forum. In 2016, he characterized progressive political campaigners as [...] "social justice warriors", compared them to Maoists, cult members and the Ku Klux Klan, and called them a threat to freedom of speech.|$|E

They {{want me to be}} involved, but times in games are tough <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> everyone. They have to raise {{a lot of money to}} fund the game properly... In our early discussions about the game, we had tentatively brainstormed ideas for the Wii. That is NOT a confirmation like the guy posted. We haven't presented the idea to Nintendo... As with anything in the gaming industry, the whole thing could turn on a dime and many of the facts can change about the game. What these fans don’t understand is how squirly things are at the beginning of the game. It would take at least two years to bring out the game and that’s after we’ve confirmed the budget and platform. The game could just as easily go away, get moved to the iPhone or become a Jim Tetris knock off as come out as a game on the Wii. People don’t understand how unstable game design is at the start" ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2013 Stanley Cup {{run by the}} Bruins was {{one that}} further united the New England region that had been rocked by tragedies, such as the Boston Marathon bombing and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Coach Claude Julien said after the {{deciding}} Game 6, [...] "You know, {{at the end of}} the day, I think that's what hurts the most is in the back of our minds, although we needed to focus on our team and doing what was going to be the best thing for our team to win a Stanley Cup, in the back of our minds we wanted to do it for those kind of reasons, the City of Boston, what Newtown has been through, that kind of stuff. It hit close to home, and the best way we felt we could try and cheer the area was to win a Stanley Cup. I think that's what's hard <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> the players. We had more reasons than just ourselves to win a Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking me <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what they are talking about ... people who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} first hinted at during E3 2009 by EA’s CEO, John Riccitiello. Riccitiello stated that Criterion Games, {{developers}} of EA's own Burnout series, {{was working on}} a [...] "revolutionary" [...] addition to the Need for Speed franchise, stating: [...] "We don't have a plan <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>for</b> a separate major launch on Burnout, because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on Need for Speed." [...] The title was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June 2009, where he stated: [...] "We've taken the Burnout team and combined it with our Need for Speed franchise. So we now have that in our favor because that Burnout team {{is probably one of the}} more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion." [...] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, expressed his delight to work with Criterion Games, stating that it would be a [...] "great team to work with on that stuff," [...] referencing the development of Need for Speed. [...] It was reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010. EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer. According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.|$|E
