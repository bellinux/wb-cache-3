25|$|The {{copyright}} law of 1993 also contained, {{similar to other}} European {{copyright law}}s, contract provisions regulating the transfer of copyrights. Contracts {{have to be in}} writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the <b>resale</b> <b>right,</b> or the right to remuneration for home-copying. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given {{as a percentage of the}} gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations. Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.|$|E

A large database was analysed consisting of more than 10500 auction prices of Belgian painted art over the period 1970 - 1997. Hedonic art returns are influenced by auction location and auction house, current of art, painters’ reputation, medium, signature and painting size. Surrealism and luminism were the most popular currents of art (in monetary terms), while expressionism and symbolism gained (financial) esteem. This study concludes that art investments underperform equity market investments due to high riskiness, transaction costs, capital gains, <b>resale</b> <b>rights,</b> and insurance premia.

Members to the Berne Convention may also determine or impose such conditions where the restriction of an exclusive right to the mere right to remuneration is allowed, for example the right to reproduction (Article 9(2)), and in the case of [...] "residual rights", that is, a right to remuneration, usually for authors or performers, that survives the transfer of certain exclusive rights.|$|E
50|$|Directive 2001/84/EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 27 September 2001 on the <b>resale</b> <b>right</b> for {{the benefit}} of the author of an {{original}} work of art is a European Union directive in the field of copyright law, made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome. It creates a right under European Union law for artists to receive royalties on their works when they are resold. This right, often known by its French name droit de suite, appears in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as Art. 14ter) and already existed in many, but not all, Member States. As a result, there was a tendency for sellers of works of art to sell them in countries without droit de suite provisions (e.g. United Kingdom) to avoid paying the royalty. This was deemed to be a distortion of the internal market (paras. 8-11 of the preamble), leading to the Directive.|$|E
5000|$|The Resale Rights Directive {{created a}} {{right for the}} creators {{of works of art}} to {{participate}} in the proceeds of the resale of their work. This right, which is sometime known by its French name droit de suite, is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the resale price (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5 percent for the portion of the resale price up to EUR 50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the resale price above EUR 500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR 12,500, equivalent to a resale price of EUR 2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR 3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this <b>resale</b> <b>right</b> are [...] "works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority." ...|$|E

40|$|The artist's <b>resale</b> royalty <b>right,</b> {{commonly}} called the droit de suite, has proven politically popular in a {{diverse range of}} countries. Since France first codified the right into law in 1920, at least fifty countries have followed suit. To date, the United States, {{with the exception of}} California, has been notably absent from this picture. But a federal resale royalty law is now on the horizon for American artists. In December 2011, delegates in both the U. S. House of Representatives and the U. S. Senate introduced the Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011 (EVAA), a bill which would amend the existing copyright law to include a resale royalty provision.   This Article evaluates whether Congress should adopt the EVAA, or some other variation of the <b>resale</b> royalty <b>right,</b> and provides guidance to lawmakers in considering such legislation. Specifically, this Article points out that an informational deficit, which it terms the information problem, looms over the <b>resale</b> royalty <b>right.</b> Scholars and lawmakers must have access to information about sales of artwork in order to evaluate the effect and efficacy of the right in practice. Likewise, the structure of the right requires that various parties have access to information about sales in order to carry out the requirements of resale royalty laws. However, secrecy norms pervade the art market, especially in the United States, making such information difficult, if not impossible, to come by. This Article considers several possibilities for how federal lawmakers might overcome, or at least minimize, this information problem, and concludes that the most promising scheme would be one that requires parties to disclose relevant information through a registration system...|$|R
