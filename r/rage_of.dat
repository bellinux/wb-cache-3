5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> Zeus.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
5|$|Prometheus– Punished by Zeus {{for giving}} mankind the Fires of Olympus, Prometheus was made mortal, and was {{attacked}} by an eagle that ripped out and ate his liver, which regrew instantly, on a daily basis. Kratos encountered Prometheus near Typhon's lair. Prometheus was eventually freed by Kratos, died by self-immolation in fire, and his ashes empowered Kratos, giving him the ability called the <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> the Titans. The character was voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in God of War II.|$|E

This is the way to make the darkness light, and also to allay the <b>raging</b> <b>of</b> our corruption.|$|R
5|$|The relics Poseidon's Trident, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings {{acquired}} in previous games are retained {{and used to}} overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece also used to deflect enemy attacks. Kratos acquires a new relic, Hades' Soul, which allows him to safely swim in the River Styx. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in God of War II, is used in this game with the special ability <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the commune of Florence spent more than 60,000 gold florins to {{mitigate}} this effects of this disaster. In order to save their own funds and calm the <b>rage</b> <b>of</b> the riotous poor, all the baker's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and {{a loaf of bread}} weighing 170 g (6oz) was then sold at a meager four pennies. This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a day could now buy enough bread to survive.|$|E
5|$|Glam metal band Holy Soldier, {{another group}} hailing from California, {{released}} its self-titled debut on Word and A Records (Myrrh imprint) in 1990 to critical and commercial acclaim. Two years later, the band followed up their debut with Last Train, another critical success, leading to 60 city world tour. The band Guardian achieved some mainstream attention for its album Fire and Love, {{and one of}} the videos was included in the MTV's Headbangers Ball rotation. The heavy metal band Angelica introduced vocalist Rob Rock, who also achieved initial fame as the vocalist for guitar virtuoso Chris Impellitteri's band Impellitteri during the 1980s and 1990s and then went solo with his <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> Creation album.|$|E

He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue has followed the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society {{to help in the}} preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's <b>rage</b> <b>of</b> being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can more freely use his strongest move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori.|$|E

To strengthen his position against his new enemy Yamhad, Shamshi-Adad married Yasmah-Adad to Betlum, the daughter of Ishi-Addu of Qatna. However, Yasmah-Adad neglected his bride causing a crisis with Qatna, and he proved to be an unable leader causing the <b>rage</b> <b>of</b> his father who died in c. 1776 BC, while the armies of Yarim-Lim I of Yamhad were advancing in support of Zimri-Lim, the heir of the Lim dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the game}} world, the player finds chests colored green, blue, or red, and each chest {{contains}} orbs of the corresponding color. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new, more powerful attacks—and replenishing the Rage meter, which, if full, {{allows for the}} usage of the <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> the Gods ability. Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests. The Eyes and Feathers increase {{the length of the}} Health and Magic Meters, respectively; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn, the player's power.|$|E

5|$|Valérian first {{appeared}} on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote, and every Valérian story from Bad Dreams to The <b>Rage</b> <b>of</b> Hypsis was initially serialised in Pilote. The second Valérian story, The City of Shifting Waters (La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes), {{was the first to}} be collected in graphic novel album format by Dargaud. Since On the Frontiers, every Valérian story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the digest-sized Super Pocket Pilote in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in Across the Pathways of Space (Par Les Chemins De l’Espace) in 1997. The series was originally published under the title Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent. However, with the publication of The Order of the Stones in 2007, the series now goes under the title Valérian and Laureline.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the <b>rage</b> <b>of</b> the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|The 1920 Republican National Convention {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on June 8, 1920, {{assembling}} delegates who were bitterly divided, most recently over {{the results of a}} Senate investigation into campaign spending, which had just been released. That report found that Wood had spent $1.8 million, lending substance to Johnson's claims that Wood was trying to buy the presidency. Some of the $600,000 that Lowden had spent had wound up in the pockets of two convention delegates. Johnson had spent $194,000 and Harding $113,000. Johnson was deemed to be behind the inquiry, and the <b>rage</b> <b>of</b> the Lowden and Wood factions put an end to any possible compromise among the frontrunners. Of the almost 1,000 delegates, 27 were women—the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, was within one state of ratification, and would pass before the end of August. The convention had no boss, most uninstructed delegates voted as they pleased, and with a Democrat in the White House, the party's leaders could not use patronage to get their way.|$|E
