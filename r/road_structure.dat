The two strips of ground between the agger and the boundary ditches were used by pedestrians and animals, and were sometimes lightly metalled.

2500|$|A poorly {{constructed}} and maintained road network. Poor construction methods included low quality sub-bases and improperly placed or missing curbs. It {{was not clear}} from the records that the roads were constructed to accommodate the medium or heavy vehicles which often used them. Maintenance issues included extensively cracked road surfaces. In some cases, roads were not repaired by removing the entire <b>road</b> <b>structure</b> but rather by removing only the asphalt or concrete and laying a new road atop the aging, inadequate, crumbling base and sub-base. The Corps estimated that 60 percent of the cemetery's [...] of roads were in poor condition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Rutelaget Askøy–Bergen started {{planning}} possible bus routes {{from the}} island across the bridge, and also proposed purchasing new fast ferries which could run from Kleppestø to Nøsten in less than ten minutes. In September 1979, the Public Roads Administration presented the {{plans for a new}} <b>road</b> <b>structure</b> in Ytre Laksevåg along National Road 555, including a connection to the bridge, as well as the possibility for a new ferry quay. The plan had four main routes from the bridge towards the city center, and the bridge was planned with two clearances, [...] The first alternative involved a tunnel from the bridge to Gravdalsvatnet, which would be the shortest route. The second would run part of the way to Gravdalsvatnet, where it would merge with National Road 555 and both would run through a tunnel to Gravdalsvatnet; this would give about the same distance to the city center, but shorter distance to Sotra. Alternative three involved the tunnel running southwards and intersecting with 555 at Loddefjord. Alternative four involved an even more western route, and would intersect at Storavatnet. Alternative four gave a [...] longer route to the city center than alternative one, but was regarded as the best technically and with the least environmental impact. The agency recommended the first or fourth proposal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>structures</b> are {{important}} to the survival of nations. As the cost for the rehabilitation and maintenance of highways soars, civil engineers and administrators face the ever present difficulty of meeting current resurfacing and rehabilitation needs. The deterioration of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> under growing traffic weight and volume is occurring faster than agencies envisaged coupled with increasingly scarce and expensive new materials required. It is now apparent that for planning, design and construction for <b>road</b> <b>structures,</b> the most efficient and cost effective processes, materials and practices available must be appropriately considered. The use of recycled materials as a sustainable alternative is gaining significant worldwide attention. The overall purpose of this research was to conduct an in-depth investigation and analysis into the design and optimisation of Cold Asphalt Emulsion Mixtures (CAEMs) incorporating high contents of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements (RAP). To achieve the objectives of the research, four proportions of RAP aggregate materials in addition to Virgin Aggregates (VA) were used as categorised below: -	Category 1 : 0...|$|R

40|$|The DER-rating {{method has}} been adopted as the {{national}} standard for the rating of <b>road</b> <b>structures.</b> This method is defects-based and involves the rating of defects on the various inspections items of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> in terms of degree (D), extent (E) and relevancy (R) rating. The DER-rating method has {{been included in the}} Draft TMH 19 Manual for the Visual Assessment of <b>Road</b> <b>Structures.</b> The D, E, and R ratings are used to calculate condition indices for <b>road</b> <b>structures.</b> The method used is a deduct-points approach, similar to what is recommended in the Draft TMH 22 Road Asset Management Systems Manual for calculating different condition and need indices for road pavements. This paper describes the procedure to arrive at a Priority Condition Index (PCI) that identifies those structures with critical defects that should receive urgent attention, using the D, E and R ratings allocated to defects during the visual assessment of the <b>structure.</b> For <b>road</b> <b>structures,</b> defects are identified per inspection sub-item and the worst defect on a sub-item is rated, which then becomes the rating for that inspection sub-item. The sub-item DER ratings are used as input to calculate deduct points for the sub-item. These sub-item deduct points are then used as input to calculate a PCI for the sub-item. The worst sub-item PCI value determines the condition index for an inspection item. Finally, the condition indices of the inspection items are used to calculate the PCI for the whole structure. The PCI value ranges from 0 (worst condition) to 100 (best condition). The structure?s PCI determines what condition category the structure falls in. Five condition categories, namely ?Critical?; ?Poor?, ?Fair?, ?Good?; or ?Very Good?, are used.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is the automatic segmentation of urban areas from high resolution satellite images, such as MOMS- 02 images or from aerial images taken from high altitude flights. The structure of urban areas, as seen from satellites or aeroplanes, is mainly characterized by three elements: the road network, the morphology of the built up areas {{and the distribution of}} the vegetation. There exist many types of <b>road</b> <b>structures</b> in large cities, which govern the local topology and geometry of the individual roads. Typical examples are orthogonal networks, star type networks or irregular networks. Seen world wide, orthogonal networks appear to be the most common ones, as e. g. to be found in Mannheim, Barcelona, New York or Canberra.
