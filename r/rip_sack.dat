25|$|Many {{other names}} have been {{ascribed}} to the gray whale, including desert whale, devilfish, gray back, mussel digger and <b>rip</b> <b>sack.</b> The name Eschrichtius gibbosus is sometimes seen; this {{is dependent on the}} acceptance of a 1777 description by Erxleben.|$|E
60|$|The Chair <b>ripped</b> the <b>sack</b> wide, and {{gathered}} {{up a handful}} of bright, broad, yellow coins, shook them together, then examined them.|$|R
60|$|And then I {{heard him}} fall, and rise, and fall again, {{with a sound}} like the <b>ripping</b> of <b>sacking.</b> His screams grew fainter until they {{were lost in the}} {{worrying}} snarl. And then, after I thought that he was dead, I saw, as in a nightmare, a blinded, tattered, blood-soaked figure running wildly round the room--and that was the last glimpse which I had of him before I fainted once again.|$|R
50|$|Chase is {{administrating}} the deferoxamine, but her alveoli <b>sacks</b> <b>rip</b> and {{she receives}} no oxygen. House {{and the team}} discuss this and {{they come to the}} conclusion she has fungus, but they do not know which one. House tells them to go broad, and Cameron suggests Aspergillus. He tells them to give her the anti-fungal for that. Wilson accuses House of running the paternity test from the beginning. Cameron comes in and says Leona's lungs collapsed and they are treating for the wrong fungus. He goes to Leona and asks if she lied to Dylan about where she was. After hesitating twice, she blinks, signaling she did. House discovers that the patient had gone to a recording studio before she experienced the hallucinations. She had inhaled mold in the studio, contracting zygomycosis.|$|R
5000|$|Fern sporangia {{consist of}} {{hygroscopic}} ribs that protrude from a spine {{on the part}} of the plant that encapsulate spores in a sack (...) [...] A capillary bridge is formed when water condenses on to the surface of these spines. When this water evaporates, surface tension forces between each rib cause the spine to retract and <b>rip</b> open the <b>sack,</b> spilling the spores. Borno [...] and her fellow researchers fabricated a biomimetic device from polydimethylsiloxane using standard photolithography techniques. The devices used the same hygroscopic ribs and spine that resemble fern sporangia. The researchers varied the dimensions and spacing of the features of the device and were able to fine-tune and predict movements of the device as a whole in hopes of using a similar device as a microactuator that can perform functions using free energy from a humid atmosphere.|$|R
500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and hardboard. [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the <b>sack</b> <b>ripped</b> open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|R
