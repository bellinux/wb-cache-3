40|$|Not all copying {{constitutes}} copyright infringement. Quite {{independent of}} fair use, copyright {{law requires that}} an act of copying be qualitatively and quantitatively significant enough or “substantially similar” {{for it to be}} actionable. Originating in the nineteenth century, and entirely the creation of courts, copyright’s requirement of “substantial similarity” has thus far received little attention as an independently meaningful normative dimension of the copyright entitlement. This Article offers a novel theory for copyright’s substantial-similarity requirement by placing it firmly {{at the center of the}} institution and its various goals and purposes. As a common-law-style device that mirrors the functioning of other areas of private law, such as tort law, substantial similarity remains an unappreciated source of flexibility and pluralism in copyright law. It allows courts to modulate the copyright entitlement’s operational robustness by altering the amount of exclusivity that a work obtains, based on different criteria, and thereby introduces “thickness” as an altogether new dimension of the entitlement. It also renders the adjudication of copyright infringement overtly pluralistic by sequencing the introduction of incommensurable values into the inquiry in a particular, <b>reasoned</b> <b>order.</b> As a mechanism of conceptual sequencing—a multicriterion decision-making process long known to the common law—substantial similarity allows copyright law to affirm both utilitarian and personality-based considerations, while prioritizing the former over the latter systemically. Viewing copyright law through the lens of substantial similarity sheds new light on the compatibility of the institution’s goals and purposes, copyright’s structure as a “property” right, and the role of courts within its overall scheme...|$|E

40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for preliminary rulings, given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular preliminary ruling proceedings jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a <b>reasoned</b> <b>order,</b> without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the expedited procedure, by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the urgent procedure, which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular preliminary ruling procedure. The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular preliminary ruling procedure are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the expedited procedure is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the urgent procedure are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months. The time required for deliberation in an urgent procedure has never exceeded three months, which makes this procedure faster and more efficient than the expedited procedure...|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{have devoted}} {{a great deal}} of {{attention}} to explicating cross-national variations in the propensity of domestic judges to submit preliminary references to the Court of Justice (Stone Sweet and Brunell 1998, Alter 1998, Pitarakis and Tridimas 2003, Carruba and Murath 2005). Less well-documented, though, is what happens when the domestic judgesâ requests result in a dismissal. How does the failure to secure a preliminary ruling affect subsequent judicial conduct? While some authors have speculated on the impact of dismissals (Bobek 2008, Bobek 2014, Kornezov 2015), no attempt has been made to investigate their effect on referral dynamics empirically. In this paper, we analyse the extent to which the domestic courtsâ propensity to use the preliminary ruling system is affected by the ECJâs decision to end the preliminary reference by a <b>reasoned</b> <b>order.</b> We argue that the decision to ask a preliminary question is influenced by informational and reputational considerations as well as by policy goals. By exposing poor legal drafting or deficient knowledge of EU law, a dismissal may hurt a courtâs reputation. Associated with this reputational loss is a chilling effect that works to discourage the affected judges to submit references in subsequent cases. Alternatively though, dismissals may have a learning effect. Domestic judges may use the feedback information from the dismissal to adapt to the standards set by the Court of Justice and submit more carefully crafted references less likely to end up in a dismissal. To test these hypotheses, we expand, complement and revise Stone Sweet and Brunell (1998) âs dataset on Article 267 references. Our revised dataset covers all EU- 28 Member States for the period 1961 - 2015 and includes information on case disposition, court type and court level. Our estimation approach implements a hierarchical linear model to control for variations at multiple levels. Specifically, we model referring courts as nested within Member States over time. We reject the chilling effect but find strong evidence of the learning effect hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings for judicial behaviour theory and the evolution of the EU legal order. status: submitte...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Abnormal {{results of}} {{diagnostic}} laboratory tests {{can be difficult}} to interpret when disease probability is very low. Although most physicians generally do not use Bayesian calculations to interpret abnormal results, their estimates of pretest disease probability and <b>reasons</b> for <b>ordering</b> diagnostic tests may [...] in a more implicit manner [...] influence test interpretation and further management. A better understanding of this influence may help to improve test interpretation and management. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of physicians' pretest disease probability estimates, and their <b>reasons</b> for <b>ordering</b> diagnostic tests, on test result interpretation, posttest probability estimates and further management. METHODS: Prospective study among 87 primary care physicians in the Netherlands who each ordered laboratory tests for 25 patients. They recorded their <b>reasons</b> for <b>ordering</b> the tests (to exclude or confirm disease or to reassure patients) and their pretest disease probability estimates. Upon receiving the results they recorded how they interpreted the tests, their posttest probability estimates and further management. Logistic regression was used to analyse whether the pretest probability and the <b>reasons</b> for <b>ordering</b> tests influenced the interpretation, the posttest probability estimates and the decisions on further management. RESULTS: The physicians ordered tests for diagnostic purposes for 1253 patients; 742 patients had an abnormal result (64 %). Physicians' pretest probability estimates and their <b>reasons</b> for <b>ordering</b> diagnostic tests influenced test interpretation, posttest probability estimates and further management. Abnormal results of tests <b>ordered</b> for <b>reasons</b> of reassurance were significantly more likely to be interpreted as normal (65. 8 %) compared to tests ordered to confirm a diagnosis or exclude a disease (27. 7 % and 50. 9 %, respectively). The odds for abnormal results to be interpreted as normal were much lower when the physician estimated a high pretest disease probability, compared to a low pretest probability estimate (OR = 0. 18, 95 % CI = 0. 07 - 0. 52, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Interpretation and management of abnormal test results were strongly influenced by physicians' estimation of pretest disease probability and by the <b>reason</b> for <b>ordering</b> the test. By relating abnormal laboratory results to their pretest expectations, physicians may seek a balance between over- and under-reacting to laboratory test results...|$|R
