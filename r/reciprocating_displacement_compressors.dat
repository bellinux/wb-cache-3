An economical and structurally simple lubrication system, which preferably comprises a classical link rod/crank mechanism, utilizes the mechanical energy provided by the drive shaft of the compressor and sends the lubricant (oil) in a precise manner to the surfaces that need to be lubricated.

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties <b>reciprocating</b> positive <b>displacement</b> pumps {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high delivery pressures and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in <b>reciprocating</b> positive <b>displacement</b> pumps is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in <b>reciprocating</b> positive <b>displacement</b> pumps high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of <b>reciprocating</b> positive <b>displacement</b> pumps...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, no basic {{differentiation}} {{of the energy}} balance is made between a displacement and working piston because that has only a constructive meaning. The appearing leaky mass flow about the piston seals (which can be predicted mathematically only inexactly) is extremely low at a <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> due to the lower pressure differences, and the effects for the process can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are employed in}} low-capacity air conditioning applications. Understanding the advantages and drawbacks {{of each of these}} technologies is important in order to identify the ranges of cooling capacities at which a specific compression technology is more efficient. This paper presents a comparative analysis between two positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> (rolling piston and scroll) designed for air conditioning applications. The compressors operate with R- 22 and present a nominal cooling capacity of 18000 BTU/h at the AHRI-A checkpoint condition. First, the compressors were tested in a hot-cycle test bench to measure the mass flow rate and power consumption for MBP and HBP operating conditions. The results showed that the most efficient compressor depends on the operating condition. Â After this, simulation models for each compressor were validated against the experimental data, showing good agreement. Therefore, through the simulation models, it was possible to evaluate the effect of different aspects, such as leakage, heat transfer and discharge process, on the efficiency of each compressor...|$|R

40|$|Thermodynamic {{models to}} {{simulate}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are well known}} for a few decades already and can describe the compressor performance quite well. One {{of the most complex}} part of the simulation process however is the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> geometry simulation. In the current context, under geometry simulation, values of working compressor volumes, as well as cross-sections of port openings, at different shaft (rotor) angles are considered. In the current paper, as an example, the Greene formula approach was applied to a geometry simulation of a single screw compressor. Working chamber geometry was defined by “cutting “ it with the gate rotor blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated. The results of this geometry simulation were applied for a thermodynamic model of a single screw compressor. Experimental investigation of a single screw working process using pressure transducers has been conducted. Geometry simulation data was applied to calculate compression work from experimental pressure traces. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained experimentally were compared to the simulated ones. Also, indicator work obtained from simulation and experiment, was compared to the power input to the shaft, and demonstrated good correlation...|$|R

50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic discharge valve that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.|$|R
