While {{the plan calls for}} the hiring of new teachers who will not be full-time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300+ teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E
5|$|Election <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> a {{focus of}} the Wildrose Alliance. The party proposes to set fixed {{election}} dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time. It would allow more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province's Senators rather than have them appointed by the Prime Minister. The party also plans to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA. The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care, which it claims will remain compliant with the Canada Health Act, as well as controls on government spending. Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties, believing climate change science remains inconclusive.|$|E
40|$|Administrative <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} {{perceived as}} dramatic organizational changes solving administrative problems {{once and for}} all. In this article it <b>is</b> argued that <b>reforms</b> reflect organizational stability more than organizational change. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> driven by problems, solutions and forgetfulness, which are all common phenomena in modern organizations. <b>Reforms</b> <b>are</b> also driven by <b>reforms</b> [...] <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> highly self-referential. Organizations may have reasons for avoiding reforms, for instance because reforms may increase a preference for values that the organization has particular difficulty in achieving rather than improving performance. Paradoxically, one effective way of stopping <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> to try to implement them and to propose new <b>reforms,</b> which <b>is</b> a further reason of why <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> common in organizations. Administrative reform forgetfulness self-reference...|$|R

5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> {{hard to find}} but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination {{is likely to have}} come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> {{the notion that}} {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E
50|$|Welfare <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> {{changes in}} the {{operation}} of a given welfare system. Welfare <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> often more aligned with neo-liberal policies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} country’s economic <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> affected by <b>reforms</b> adopted by other countries. A simple model of economic <b>reforms</b> <b>is</b> developed to motivate the econometric work. Unsurprisingly, the model predicts that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> more likely when {{factors of production}} are internationally mobile and <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> pursued in other economies. More interesting is the finding that <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> not driven by greater trade openness. Using {{the change in the}} Index of Economic Freedom as the measure of marketliberalising reforms and panel data 144 countries and the years 1995 - 2006, we identify the most important channels through which <b>reforms</b> <b>are</b> transmitted from country to country. We find evidence of the importance of reforms in other countries. Moreover, consistent with our model international trade is not a vehicle for the diffusion of economic reforms, rather the most important mechanism is geographical or cultural proximity...|$|R

Kosygin's [...] "radical" [...] <b>reform</b> {{attempts}} <b>were</b> halted in 1971 and his second <b>reform</b> <b>was</b> more modest.

5|$|The Khurasani {{tax system}} had been {{established}} {{at the time of}} the Muslim conquest and remained unchanged since. It relied on the collection of a fixed tribute by the local non-Muslim (mostly Zoroastrian) gentry, the dihqans, who often discriminated against the Muslim settlers and the native converts. This contributed to the latter's increasing resentment of Umayyad rule, and the demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of Ibn Surayj. Consequently, Nasr streamlined the tax system in 739, implementing a blanket imposition (the kharaj) on all owners of agricultural land and forcing the non-Muslims to pay an additional poll tax (the jizyah). In this way, the chroniclers report, 30,000 Muslims were absolved of the jizyah, and 80,000 non-Muslims were forced to pay it instead. Attention was also paid to the accurate collection of the kharaj in accordance with treaties with the local rulers, as a result of which the tax burden was generally eased. This <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> traditionally held to have assisted in regaining the loyalty of the local populations and their princes, who returned quickly to the Arab fold; other modern scholars however consider the effect of this belated reform on the prevailing anti-Umayyad climate as minimal. Upon his appointment, Nasr also moved the provincial capital back to Merv from Balkh, where Asad had established it. Additionally, for the first time in the province's history he appointed sub-governors. They were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward them and to improve his own control of the province.|$|E

25|$|Another key {{aspect of}} Reform {{doctrine}} is the personal autonomy of each adherent, who may formulate his own understanding and expression of his religiosity. <b>Reform</b> <b>is</b> unique among all Jewish denominations in placing {{the individual as}} the authorized interpreter of Judaism. This position was originally influenced by Kantian philosophy and the great weight it lent to personal judgement and free will. This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement's great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines and standards for positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.|$|E

Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional prison conditions in Brown v.

25|$|SSR is not {{understood}} by researchers {{to be limited}} to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, transitional and developed countries. Nevertheless, security sector <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after war has ceased. However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because conceptualisation overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.|$|E
