40|$|Managing a big {{supply chain}} {{for one of}} the largest quick service {{restaurant}} companies, especially when the company has a policy called "Never Run Out," is very challenging. A traditional way of managing inventory requires high level of safety stock if high level of uncertainty is involved. Sources of uncertainty include variability in demand from frequent promotions or seasonal effect, variability in order lead time from using low-cost mode of transportation, or lack of information sharing. This project developed an expediting policy with dual <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> with demand threshold and tested the policy with a Monte Carlo simulation. Previous research on two <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> provide great foundation for this study but they lack consideration on demand variability and approaches to set up <b>reorder</b> <b>points.</b> We propose an algorithm with a demand threshold to trigger an expedited order and heuristic approaches to develop <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> where the total cost can be minimized while service requirements are met. by Gil Su Lee.

40|$|The {{pressure}} to reduce inventory investments in supply chains has increased as competi-tion expands and product variety grows. Managers {{are looking for}} areas they can improve to reduce inventories without hurting the level of service provided. Two areas that man-agers focus on are {{the reduction of the}} replenishment lead time from suppliers and the variability of this lead time. The normal approximation of lead time demand distribution indicates that both actions reduce inventories for cycle service levels above 50 %. The normal approximation also indicates that reducing lead time variability tends to have a greater impact than reducing lead times, especially when lead time variability is large. We build on the work of Eppen and Martin (1988) to show that the conclusions from the normal approximation are flawed, especially in the range of service levels where most companies operate. We show the existence of a service-level threshold greater than 50 % below which <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> increase with a decrease in lead time variability. Thus, for a firm operating just below this threshold, reducing lead times decreases <b>reorder</b> <b>points,</b> whereas reducing lead time variability increases <b>reorder</b> <b>points.</b> For firms operating at these service levels, decreasing lead time is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing lead time variability...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a serial inventory system with N stages. The material flows from an outside supplier to stage N, then to stage N - 1, etc., {{and finally to}} stage 1 where random customer demand arises. Each stage replenishes a stage-specific inventory position according to a stage-specific reorder point/order quantity policy. Two variations of this policy are considered. One is based on echelon stock, and the other installation stock. The former requires centralized demand information, while the latter does not. The relative cost {{difference between the two}} policies is called the value of centralized demand information. For fixed order quantities, we develop efficient algorithms for computing both the optimal echelon <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> and the optimal installation <b>reorder</b> <b>points.</b> These algorithms enable us to conduct an extensive computational study to assess the value of centralized demand information and to understand how this value depends on several key system parameters, i. e., the number of stages, leadtimes, batch sizes, demand variability, and the desired level of customer service.

50|$|The <b>reorder</b> <b>point</b> (ROP) is {{the level}} of {{inventory}} which triggers an action to replenish that particular inventory stock. It is a minimum amount of an item which a firm holds in stock, such that, when stock falls to this amount, the item must be reordered. It is normally calculated as the forecast usage during the replenishment lead time plus safety stock. In the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model, it was assumed that there is no time lag between ordering and procuring of materials. Therefore the <b>reorder</b> <b>point</b> for replenishing the stocks occurs at that level when the inventory level drops to zero and because instant delivery by suppliers, the stock level bounce back.|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{information}} sharing {{has been known}} to reduce a firm's operating costs. Cost-saving benefits from sharing either upstream or downstream information among supply chain members has been well recognised and well studied in the literature in recent years. Information sharing on inventory policies is also important to both buyers and suppliers. In this study, we utilise a supply chain system consisting of a supplier, Buyer 1 and Buyer 2, and analyse the effect of the <b>reordering</b> <b>point</b> system for the supplier and two buyers when they cooperatively determine their optimal order quantities. This paper provides inventory models for a three-echelon supply chain such that the expected cost function is minimised. The research considers both; the case where inventory information is being shared among the three supply chain partners (supplier, Buyer 1 and Buyer 2) and the case where inventory information is only observed from the downstream partner. Through a numerical example, we compare the performance of both systems and provide a set of observations regarding the utility of inventory {{information sharing}} among partners from an economic viewpoint. supply chain management; SCM; supply chain partners; information sharing; echelon stock; <b>reordering</b> <b>point</b> policy; inventory policies; inventory modelling...|$|R

The company has a fleet of eleven Embraer EMB 120 and six PAC P 750 XL aircraft contracted in services across Africa. Naturelink Aviation seeks improvement regarding the management of inventory for unscheduled maintenance at outstations in Africa. It was established that the company {{does not have an}} automated inventory systems for the outstations, mainly because outstations are dependent on contracts. Currently the engineer at the outstation has to manage the unscheduled maintenance inventory and determine when top-up stock needs to be ordered. The decision was made to develop a multiproduct Economic Order Quantity model to determine optimal order quantities, number of cycles and order times. The main objective is to determine when items of different frequency usage can be ordered together instead of sending orders only days apart. After this project it was clear that <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> often coincide or happen close together in addition to the crew rotation schedule. This information enabled the development of a sample reorder schedule, it requires constant updated and verifications, because <b>reorder</b> <b>points</b> and EOQs may change.
