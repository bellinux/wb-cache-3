40|$|Transportation is of key {{importance}} to the ethanol sector, with a typical 100 million gallon per year (MGY) plant receiving the equivalent of 110 truckloads of corn per day while shipping out 34 truckloads of ethanol and 36 truckloads of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Unlike truck movements, shipment by rail requires that an ethanol plant either purchase or lease rail tanker cars to ship ethanol or hopper cars for DDGS. Thus, <b>rail</b> <b>dependent</b> ethanol plants incur an additional fixed cost. While ethanol profitability itself is relatively well studied, the effect of rail equipment costs on profitability is unknown. ^ This study examines the effect of rail equipment costs on dry-grind corn ethanol profitability. To estimate the rail equipment cost, linear programming (LP) models allocated flows of ethanol to blenders and DDGS to feeders. The LP model results were combined with plant size characteristics to estimate the number of rail cars required and the associated fixed costs of rail equipment. The number of rail cars depends on the distance to market and whether the shipment is by unit train or single car rail. Rail equipment costs were then added to an ethanol plant profitability model based on Eidman (2007). ^ Results first suggest that rail equipment leasing costs decrease profits by 7. 7 percent across all ethanol plants. However, <b>rail</b> <b>dependent</b> ethanol plants most likely factor in this additional cost {{as part of a}} bid price to distant markets to recoup the cost. Second, plants in the 51 to 100 MGY size range are more <b>rail</b> <b>dependent</b> than ethanol plants over 100 MGY. On average, 60 percent of plants have a rail requirement for shipping either ethanol or DDGS, while 40 percent of the ethanol plants are truck houses. Finally, results show that 42 percent of ethanol and 48 percent of DDGS move by rail from the six largest ethanol and DDGS producing states. ...|$|R

40|$|Groundbreaking {{research}} in animals {{has demonstrated that}} the hippocampus contains neurons that distinguish between overlapping navigational trajectories. These hippocampal neurons respond selectively to the context of specific episodes despite interference from overlapping memory representations. The present study used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} in humans to examine the role of the hippocampus and related structures when participants need to retrieve contextual information to navigate well learned spatial sequences that share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate through 12 virtual mazes from a ground-level first-person perspective. Six of the 12 mazes shared overlapping components. Overlapping mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required the retrieval of contextual information relevant to the current navigational episode. Results revealed greater activation during the successful navigation of the overlapping mazes compared with the non-overlapping mazes in regions typically associated with spatial and episodic memory, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. When combined with previous research, the current findings suggest that an anatomically integrated system including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex is critical for the contextually <b>dependent</b> <b>retrieval</b> of well learned overlapping navigational routes...|$|R
40|$|The mood-dependent {{retrieval}} hypothesis {{states that}} mood will enhance recall by {{acting as a}} recall cue if the stimuli have been learned initially in the same mood. Material learned in a happy mood will be best recalled when the person returns to a happy mood; the same holds for a sad mood. Mood-dependent retrieval effect has been regulary demonstrated but has also regularly failed to replicate in a laboratory setting. Relations between mood states, states in general, and memory are not well understood. A first possible specification of what causes the mood-dependent retrieval effect is experimenter demand. An important precondition for obtaining the mood-dependent retrieval effect is to insure strong mood-inductions. Another moderator of mood-dependent retrieval may be whether or not retrieval cues alternative to mood, such as the room, are available to cue recall. Item-mood associations can be heightened using to-be-remembered stimuli that can be perceived as causing the mood or by having subjects generate their own items for recall while in the particular mood. None of these factors suggested to explain mood-dependent retrieval can do so by itself. If mood <b>dependent</b> <b>retrieval</b> is found in experiments which simultaneously use effective mood inductions, eliminate alternative cues, and enhance mood-stimuli associations, then more reliable demonstrations of mood-dependent retrieval may be possible.

DESIGN [...] Retrospective review of case notes, cardiac catheterisation reports, and angiograms. SETTING [...] Tertiary referral centre for congenital heart disease. PATIENTS [...] 205 consecutive {{children and adults}} undergoing therapeutic embolisation for congenital heart disease in the 10 years up to 1 April 1993. This group had 231 therapeutic embolisation procedures at 241 sites using coils, umbrella devices, or detachable balloons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidences of misplacement and retrieval of the device; morbidity and mortality. RESULTS [...] The incidence of misplacement was 3 % (10 / 332) of devices deployed and 4. 3 % (10 / 231) of procedures performed. Retrieval from distal pulmonary arteries was not attempted in two patients, but transcatheter retrieval of coils and umbrellas from systemic and pulmonary vessels, using snares or retrieval baskets, was successful in the remaining eight. There were no deaths or serious sequelae related to the procedure, but one patient required femoral arteriotomy for removal of an umbrella device retrieved {{only as far as}} the groin.

40|$|Chemical vapor {{emissions}} from underground hazardous waste storage tanks on the Hanford site in eastern Washington State are a potential concern because workers enter the tank farms {{on a regular}} basis for waste <b>retrievals,</b> <b>equipment</b> maintenance, and surveillance. Tank farm contractors {{are in the process of}} retrieving all remaining waste from aging single-shell tanks, some of which date to World War II, and transferring it to newer double-shell tanks. During the waste retrieval process, tank farm workers are potentially exposed to fugitive chemical vapors that can escape from tank headspaces and other emission points. The tanks are known to hold more than 1, 500 different species of chemicals, in addition to radionuclides. Exposure assessments have fully characterized the hazards from chemical vapors in half of the tank farms. Extensive sampling and analysis has been done to characterize the chemical properties of hazardous waste and to evaluate potential health hazards of vapors at the ground surface, where workers perform maintenance and waste transfer activities. Worker concerns. risk communication, and exposure assessment are discussed, including evaluation of the potential hazards of complex mixtures of chemical vapors. Concentrations of vapors above occupational exposure limits-(OEL) were detected only at exhaust stacks and passive breather filter outlets. Beyond five feet from the sources, vapors disperse rapidly. No vapors have been measured above 50 % of their OELs more than five feet from the source. Vapor controls are focused on limited hazard zones around sources.

These properties, which control tank waste behavior during retrieval operations, are also critical to the development of valid physical simulants for designing <b>retrieval</b> <b>equipment.</b> The waste is to be retrieved in a series of four steps. First, a selected retrieval technology breaks up or dislodges the waste into subsequently smaller pieces. Then, the dislodged waste is conveyed out of the tank through the conveyance line. Next, the waste flows into a separator unit that separates the gaseous phase from the liquid and solid phases. Finally, a unit may be present to condition the slurried waste before transporting it to the treatment facility. This document describes the characterization needs for the proposed processes to accomplish waste retrieval. Baseline mobilization technologies include mixer pump technology, sluicing, and high-pressure water-jet cutting. Other processes that are discussed in this document include slurry formation, pneumatic conveyance, and slurry transport.
