40|$|Abstract~-In {{order to}} make an {{accurate}} estimation of the location of cambium {{at the time of}} pin insertion, pin marks left in the xylem tissue were minutely examined. The size and shape of the abnormal tissue induced by pin insertion depended on the size of needle, growth rate of trees, and the tree species. Since the abnormal tissue changed its shape and size as the cross section receded from the center, it was concluded to be necessary to use the cross section obtained from the center of pinning for correct application of the pinning method. The site relation between <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> at the time of pinning and the abnormal tissue was investigated following the modified Wolter's procedure. As a result, the site of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> at the time of pinning was assumed to be at the cambial-side margin of the spindle-like abnormal tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrusive}} {{growth of}} fusiform initials was studied in Entandrophragma, This growth makes possible {{a change in}} the position of the cell ends of one storey in respect to those in the neighbouring storey, and this is 'turn leads to changes in the orientation of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> The growth activities of the oppositely directed ends of the same initial are not the same. Not all cell ends are simultaneously actiye. There are groups of ends distributed alternately in a storey which are active or inactive, so that a pattern of growth activity appears in the cambium. The activity of a particular cell end changes in successive time periods. Owing to this, the rate of creeping of one end past. those of the adjoining storey varies. This phenomenon of changes in the activity of cell ends in time may be referred to the phenomenon of the appearance of the growth activity pattern on the cambium surface under the hypothesis of transverse shifting of the elements of this pattern ("active" and. "inactive" groups) in relation to the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials...</b>|$|R

The fiber diameter increased from pith to middle and then decreased somewhat from mid-radius to the periphery (Table  3). These results are comparable with other studies on teak [42, 44]. In general, {{there is a general}} increase of fiber length due to the length increase of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> with increasing <b>cambial</b> age [46, 47].

5000|$|From {{the early}} twentieth century, the {{anthophyte}} hypothesis was the prevailing explanation for seed plant evolution, based on shared morphological characters between the gnetophytes and angiosperms. In this hypothesis, the gnetophytes, along with the extinct order Bennettitales, are sister to the angiosperms, forming the [...] "anthophytes". [...] Some morphological characters that were suggested to unite the anthophytes include vessels in wood, net-veined leaves (in Gnetum only), lignin chemistry, the layering of cells in the apical meristem, pollen and megaspore features (including thin megaspore wall), short <b>cambial</b> <b>initials,</b> and lignin syringal groups. However, most genetic studies have rejected the anthophyte hypothesis. Several of these {{studies have suggested that}} the gnetophytes and angiosperms have independently derived characters, including flower-like reproductive structures and tracheid vessel elements, that appear shared but are actually the result of parallel evolution.|$|R
40|$|Effects of low {{temperature}} on cambial cells induced by localized heating in Cryptomeria japonica and Abies firma were investigated during winter dormancy in January-February. Localized heating induced cambial reactivation in the stems earlier than natural cambial reactivation. In heated Cryptomeria japonica and Abies firma stems, cambial reactivation occurred after 6 and 2 days of heating, on 14 January 2007 and 15 January 2010, respectively. We stopped the electric heating system just after cambial reactivation in stems. When we stopped the heating system, the minimum atmospheric temperature was about 0 C. After cambial reactivation, due to rapid decrease in temperature, cell contents of cambium became coagulated but nucleus {{was present in}} <b>ray</b> <b>cambial</b> cells. After one month, the shrunk cambium produced new deformed tracheids with abnormal cell shape. The results suggest that rapid decrease in temperature just after cambial reactivation might induce temporary damage of cambium that produces deformed tracheids indicating that cambium and its derivatives can response directly to changes in temperature which provides a useful experimental model system for studies of cambial biology and xylogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{vascular}} cambium is discussed {{and the length of}} the elements in the secondary xylem related to the division and elongation cycles of the <b>cambial</b> fusiform <b>initials.</b> Particular attention is given to the activities of the storeyed cambium. The ontogeny of the storeyed cambium is described for Hoheria angustifolia Raoul. (Malvaceae). The transition from procambium to cambium was found to take place gradually, the meristem acquiring cambial characteristics over a number of internodes, some before and some after internodal elongation had ceased. The cambium is non storeyed at the commencement of secondary growth but later develops a storeyed pattern. Developmental changes in the cambium with radial growth were studied in Aeschynomene hispida Willd. (Papilionaceae). Repeated radial longitudinal divisions in the fusiform <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> in this plant produce a highly developed storeyed pattern with radial growth. The frequency of these divisions decreases with increasing distance from the stem centre. The mean length of the fusiform initials decreases slightly with radial growth. Variation {{in the size of the}} fusiform initials and vessel members was also investigated in Hoberia angustifolia. Mean length of the fusiform initials was found to remain constant with increasing distance from the stem centre but a slight decrease was observed with increasing height in the tree. Mean fusiform initial width showed an increase followed by a decrease with increasing height in the tree. The significance of these results is related to the division pattern in the storeyed cambium...|$|R
30|$|Some {{researchers}} believe that the formation of juvenile wood {{is related to the}} year of formation (ring number) of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> and the formation of a somewhat cylindrical, or a conical zone {{in the center of the}} tree while other researchers think that distance from the pith is a better measure for defining juvenile wood than ring number [8]. In yet another concept, some researchers use the term “crown-formed wood” in relation to the position of the wood from the crown during the formation of the wood [9]. In Corsican pine (Pinus nigra), it was suggested that the term “crown-formed wood” should be used to describe fluctuations in wood structure (density) associated with the size of the crown, superimposed upon the inherent trends due to cambial age [10]. The crown size and the position of the wood from the crown when the wood was formed may affect the radial variation of wood properties.|$|R
40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic {{interlocked}} grain, local minute undulations of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is wavy grain alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the interlocked grain formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the spirally thickened xylem element from a cambium initial of sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus has been traced by means of electron microscopy.

After glutaraldehyde fixation, microtubules (200 to 220 A in diameter) are seen to be sited in specific relation to the thickenings, the orientation of the tubules mirroring that of the fibrils seen in the thickenings.

40|$|Indole {{acetic acid}} (auxin) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of wood formation, and an observed overlap between auxin concentration gradient and developing secondary xylem cells {{has led to the}} hypothesis that auxin regulates wood formation by acting as a morphogen. We dissected the role of auxin in wood formation by identifying the auxin-responsive transcriptome in wood-forming tissues and investigating alterations in wood formation in transgenic hybrid aspen plants (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) with perturbed auxin signaling. We showed that auxin-responsive genes in wood-forming tissues respond dynamically to changes in cellular auxin levels. However, the expression patterns of most of the auxin-responsive genes displayed limited correlation with the auxin concentration across this developmental zone. Perturbing auxin signaling by reducing auxin responsiveness reduced the cambial cell division activity, caused spatial deregulation of cell division of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials,</b> and led to reductions in not only radial but also axial dimensions of fibers and vessels. We propose that, instead of acting as a morphogen, changes in auxin concentration in developing secondary xylem cells may provide important regulatory cues that modulate the expression of a few key regulators; these, in turn, may control the global gene expression patterns that are essential for normal secondary xylem development...|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> and their {{derivatives}} have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the fusiform initials. On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the fusiform initials, due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the fusiform initials. The parenchyma strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to fusiform initials indicating that the xylem and phloem mother cells forming parenchyma cells have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated parenchyma cells (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing parenchyma cells (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth. The ray parenchyma cells are slightly longer than the ray initials possibly due to the elongation of these initials during their transformation into vascular ray cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{immediate}} {{environment of}} a <b>cambial</b> <b>initial</b> (weather and nutritional factors, growth regulators, physical stresses) varies continuously over time. Consequently local {{conditions in the}} cambium influencing wood formation at any given instant are unique. The distribution of these conditions can be influenced by longitudinal gradients (stem base to apex), circumferentially or by local factors, such as proximity to branches. Not surprisingly, therefore, the variation in wood properties within a stem is large and in seasonal climates, the greatest variation is typically found within an annual ring. A great advantage {{for the study of}} wood is that the net product of seasonal processes is recorded in the wood structure across the stem radius. Thus by studying the pattern of wood property variation, within the context of its growth history, we can gain insight into cause and effect relationships between the drivers of wood variability. Combining this with temporal, high-resolution measurements of stem growth, weather, and process modelling enables us to better understand and test hypotheses of wood formation and the causes of variability in wood properties. Over recent years and in partnership with industry and other research providers, we have been attempting to model tree growth (Cabala) and cambial activity (TreeRing and CAMBIUM) at a daily time step to explain radial variability in wood properties. CAMBIUM is the latest development of this effort, modelling a population of eucalypt cambial cells, accounting for fibre and vessel formation using physiologically meaningful relationships.

Despite the importance of cambial variants, nothing {{is known about the}} developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems. Here, a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns. We found that all species depart from a common developmental basis, with a continuous, regularly growing cambium. Initial development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem, the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan. In most species, the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct, with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them. Other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges, multiple-dissected phloem wedges, and included phloem wedges take place thereafter. The fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history. This recapitulation is, however, caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process. Truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species, which resemble juveniles of their ancestors, {{as a result of a}} decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia. In addition, the modular evolution of phloem and xylem in Bignonieae seems to indicate that stem anatomical modifications in this group occurred at the level of <b>cambial</b> <b>initials.</b> Conselho de Auxilio a PesquisaConselho de Auxilio a PesquisaConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) CNPq Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico[481034 / 2007 - 2...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{aggregate}} rays {{present in the}} xylem of the New Zealand species of Nothofagus, and compares them with those present in other genera, particularly Fagus and Dracophyllum. The ontogeny of aggregate rays is investigated, and {{shown to be a}} feature largely of the 'leaf-gap' in Fagus and Dracophyllum. In Nothofagus, however, aggregate ray ontogeny relates more to the leaf-trace. Neither the 'synthetic' nor the 'dissection' theory is adequate for describing aggregate ray ontogeny. The presence of aggregate rays in Nothofagus is correlated with an irregular (not circular) outline of the pith (TS) and may relate to light and hormonal factors and their effect on cell division and elongation within the elongating internode. Certain regions within the growth increment are dominated by pseudo-transverse anticlinal divisions of <b>cambial</b> fusiform <b>initials,</b> other regions are dominated by fusiform initial elongation. An attempt was made to determine whether these regions could be distinguished based on deviations from the normal distribution recorded for axial element length data. The results are not conclusive, but may merit further investigation. Certain features of the aggregate rays in Nothofagus such as: reduced element length; paucity of vessels; reduction of individual rays; and the formation of 'wound-like' areas, indicate that the fluting may actually be responsible for the presence of these aggregate rays...|$|R
40|$|Storied pattern, in the {{arrangement}} of both fusiform initials and the rays in cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides, develops in ontogeny relatively quickly and becomes clearly visible in terminal parenchyma of third and fourth annual ring. At first, anticlinal longitudinal divisions and restricted intrusive growth of fusiform initials lead {{to the formation of}} their characteristic horizontal tiers. Then, initiation of secondary rays, taking place rather within such tiers, not between them, makes possible the formation of storied ray pattern. New secondary rays originate most frequently from fusiform initials by their segmentation. This makes the appearance of ray tiers rather quick. However, the high order in the structure of cambium of Hippophae rhamnoides is also due to another, very curious and not known until now mechanism. It operates through limited in its range, thus highly controlled, vertical migration of <b>rays</b> on the <b>cambial</b> surface. This applies to asymmetrically positioned rays either primary, which are often originally sited "out of order" or secondary, initiated off-centre within the existing tiers. Excessively asymmetric rays, lying accidentally on the border between two neighbouring storeys, often undergo splitting and then the derivative rays move toward the centres of the storeys. Ray displacement is due to elimination of one or two of ray initial cells on one edge of the ray and simultaneous, multiple divisions adding new ray cells on the opposite edge...|$|R

We examined cross-sections from dead trees and used a 12 -mm Haglof Swedish Increment borer to collect cores from living white oak (Quercus alba L.) trees in an Eastern Deciduous Forest stand in southwestern Illinois. Spiral grain is the alignment of wood fibers to the longitudinal axis of trees and is driven by patterns of <b>initial</b> <b>cambial</b> cell division. In this study, we examine environmental factors that may affect spiral grain severity, the usefulness of non-destructive sampling methods (using the 12 -mm increment borer), and the relationship between tree age and spiral grain. We tested Brazier’s method (1965) of averaging the spiral grain angle from two radii taken 180 degrees apart (i. e. one diameter in the tree) to get representative grain angles for the whole circumference of a tree at a certain height. The 12 -mm increment borer did not produce consistent results in this study; therefore, the collection of cross-sections is advised for the study of spiral grain in white oaks. Brazier’s method should not be used in white oaks and should not be applied universally to all tree species. The severity of spiral grain is expressed in the xylem and may not be expressed in the bark of the tree. Left spiral grain does generally increase in white oaks with age, although this relationship is not always consistent, so a tree without severe spiral grain is not necessarily young...|$|R
40|$|Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is {{the most}} {{important}} plantation tree in New Zealand forestry, and factors that reduce the quality of wood cause significant economic loss. Two of {{the most important of these}} issues are compression wood and spiral grain. Compression wood is a type of reaction wood, formed when a tree moves away from the vertical, and is characterised by biochemical and structural changes within the wood that reduce its quality and value. Spiral grain, however, is the alignment of the wood grain in a helix around the tree’s axis and away from the vertical. Again, this reduces the structural qualities of the wood and thus its value. Spiral grain and compression wood are notorious for their deleterious effect on the quality of wood produced and are very important for the forest industry due to the huge economic loss they cause. The demand for reliable tools to evaluate these wood quality issues in clonal planting material at an early stage, within 3 years of germination rather than at 8 to 15 years as in current practise, is of ever increasing importance from plant breeders and other industry stake holders. Therefore this research was undertaken with an overall aim to develop quick, easy and reproducible techniques to evaluate young radiata pine clones (up to 3 years old) based on compression wood content and presence of spiral grain. This is important because a shortened breeding cycle could provide significant economic benefits to the forest industry. The incidence of these commercially important wood quality parameters has been studied in this thesis in research conducted on young trees (1 to 3 years old). The research described in this thesis used a variety of different imaging approaches to investigate wood structure, including polarised light and confocal microscopy, and X-ray tomography and circular polarised light scanning. The images achieved have been analysed using a range of different software, including Photoshop, ImageJ and Matlab bringing a quantification approach to the imaging. Compression wood was quantified in young clonal material using images collected with a commercial document scanner, and processed using image analysis tools available in Photoshop. An easy, reliable and robust, automatic image analysis protocol was successfully developed and tested for the detection and quantification of compression wood in these young trees. This new technique to detect and quantify compression wood was based on the thresholding of the blue channel of the scanned RGB image as this was demonstrated to contain the greatest image contrast. Development of this new technique may reduce the waiting time for screening clonal planting materials based on compression wood content. To understand the organisation of the grain at a cellular level within these young trees, confocal microscopy techniques were utilised. The cell wall characteristics and fluorescence properties of compression wood in comparison with normal wood were investigated using a new cellulose specific dye, pontamine fast scarlet 4 B. Staining protocols for this dye for confocal microscopy were optimised, and the potential of measuring the microfibril angle of the S 1 and S 3 layers of the pontamine treated opposite wood was demonstrated through either direct observations of these layers, or through the property of bifluorescence where the dye is excited only when aligned parallel to the polarisation of the incident light. Despite extensive work with confocal microscopy, this technique proved to be unsuitable for investigations of spiral grain because although it provided cellular detail, imaging was limited to the surface layers of sections, and the area over which observations were required was prohibitive. Instead of confocal microscopy, the incidence of spiral grain in young stems was investigated in two completely new ways. Resin canals, which are formed from the same <b>cambial</b> <b>initials</b> as the tracheids and which align with the grain, were used as a proxy to demonstrate the grain changes. A novel technique, using circular polarised light and a professional flatbed scanner, was developed to image whole serial transverse sections of the young stems to detect the resin canals. Using ImageJ, the number and location of resin canals was measured on vertical controls, and trees that had been rocked and leaned. The number and frequency of resin canals were less in tilted trees, especially in compression wood, compared to the higher number of canals formed in the rocked trees. More importantly, a combination of serial sectioning and this approach allowed a 3 -dimensional view of the orientation of resin canals inside a stem to be generated with ImageJ, and the angles of these canals could be measured using Matlab. The resin canals were oriented with a left-handed spiralling near the stem surface whereas the canals near to the pith were nearly straight, consistent with previous observations of the development of spiral grain in radiata pine. However, it was observed that while vertical trees had a symmetric pattern of grain and grain changes around the stem, this was not the case in tilted trees. In these, the opposite wood often had severe spiral grain visible through formation of twist whereas the compression wood formed on the lower side had bending. Consistent with this, grain associated with compression wood was significantly straighter than in opposite wood. This hitherto unknown link between the incidence of compression wood and spiral grain was investigated and explained on the basis of the characteristics of resin canals in these types of wood. X-ray micro-tomography was also used to investigate resin canals in the stubs from which serial sections were collected. The 3 D reconstructions of the resin canals showed exactly the same patterns as observed by polarised light scanning...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Cambial {{activity}} in white spruce stems in Alaska was observed from April, 1964 to September, 1965 in over 300 samples taken from 50 - to 60 -year-old natural stands. Mitotic index {{was used as}} a measure of the rate of periclinal division of fusiform cells in the cambial zone. Anticlinal divisions are relatively rare, occurring only about once per 278 periclinal divisions in most stems. Mitotic index, at any given time, is quite uniform throughout the cambial zone of an internode, among internodes of the same tree, and even among trees of a stand growing at markedly different rates. There may be some difference in rate of division across the radial extent of the cambial zone [...] During dormancy, the radial number of fusiform cells in the cambial zone (NCZ) ranges from two to about eight, the number being related to annual growth rate of xylem and phloem. Two to three overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells border the cambial zone in each radial file of cells. They are the last phloem derivatives of the previous year's cambial activity. They undergo rapid radial enlargement just prior to vernal reactivation of mitosis in the cambial zone, and they become the first new conducting phloem elements of the current year. There are three distinct growing season periods: early period, grand period, and late period. Beginning of early period cambial activity is marked by reactivation of periclinal divisions, first near the apex, then at successively lower stem levels. Each <b>cambial</b> zone fusiform <b>initial</b> divides once before any new xylem or phloem derivatives are produced, thus approximately doubling the NCZ. Mitotic activity varies considerably during the early period, and the time required to double the NCZ varies from year to year depending upon weather conditions. Production of the first new xylem and phloem derivatives marks the beginning of the grand period. Rate of cell production in the cambial zone remains about equal to derivative production for the next 45 to 50 days, when about 80 percent of annual xylem and phloem increment is produced. Rate of division is comparatively uniform in all internodes in all trees. Rate of derivative production is, therefore, dependent on NCZ. There is a rather abrupt drop in NCZ {{at the beginning of the}} late period, apparently due to lengthening of the cell division cycle. Rate of derivative production exceeds rate of cambial zone cell production, and NCZ soon drops to about the dormant level. Subsequently, within about ten days, derivative production slows, the zone of developing tracheids begins to narrow, and radial enlargement of developing tracheids and sieve cells declines. In about two more weeks the zone of developing tracheids is almost eliminated, the most recently produced tracheids show little or no radial and there is evidence of partial inception of dormancy in the cambial zone. Complete termination of cambial activity is gradual, extending through late August and, perhaps, into September...|$|R
