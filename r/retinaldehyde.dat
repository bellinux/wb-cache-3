25|$|There are {{two sources}} of dietary vitamin A. Active forms, which are {{immediately}} {{available to the}} body are obtained from animal products. These are known as retinoids and include <b>retinaldehyde</b> and retinol. Precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body, are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being β-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in Retinol Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001mg of retinol, or 0.006mg of β-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin A, in the {{retinoic acid}} form, plays an {{important}} role in gene transcription. Once retinol has been taken up by a cell, it can be oxidized to retinal (<b>retinaldehyde)</b> by retinol dehydrogenases and then <b>retinaldehyde</b> can be oxidized to retinoic acid by <b>retinaldehyde</b> dehydrogenases. The conversion of <b>retinaldehyde</b> to retinoic acid is an irreversible step, meaning that the production of retinoic acid is tightly regulated, due to its activity as a ligand for nuclear receptors. The physiological form of retinoic acid (all-trans-retinoic acid) regulates gene transcription by binding to nuclear receptors known as retinoic acid receptors (RARs) which are bound to DNA as heterodimers with retinoid [...] "X" [...] receptors (RXRs). RAR and RXR must dimerize before they can bind to the DNA. RAR will form a heterodimer with RXR (RAR-RXR), but it does not readily form a homodimer (RAR-RAR). RXR, on the other hand, may form a homodimer (RXR-RXR) and will form heterodimers with many other nuclear receptors as well, including the thyroid hormone receptor (RXR-TR), the Vitamin D3 receptor (RXR-VDR), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (RXR-PPAR) and the liver [...] "X" [...] receptor (RXR-LXR). The RAR-RXR heterodimer recognizes retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) on the DNA whereas the RXR-RXR homodimer recognizes retinoid [...] "X" [...] response elements (RXREs) on the DNA; although several RAREs near target genes have been shown to control physiological processes, this has not been demonstrated for RXREs. The heterodimers of RXR with nuclear receptors other than RAR (i.e. TR, VDR, PPAR, LXR) bind to various distinct response elements on the DNA to control processes not regulated by vitamin A. Upon binding of retinoic acid to the RAR component of the RAR-RXR heterodimer, the receptors undergo a conformational change that causes co-repressors to dissociate from the receptors. Coactivators can then bind to the receptor complex, which may help to loosen the chromatin structure from the histones or may interact with the transcriptional machinery. This response can upregulate (or downregulate) the expression of target genes, including Hox genes as well as the genes that encode for the receptors themselves (i.e. RAR-beta in mammals).|$|E

40|$|RDH 12 {{mutations}} {{are responsible}} for early-onset autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy, which results in profound retinal pathology and severe visual handicap in patients. To investigate the function of RDH 12 within the network of retinoid dehydrogenases/reductases (RDHs) present in retina, we studied the retinal phenotype of Rdh 12 -deficient mice. In vivo rates of all-trans-retinal reduction and 11 -cis-retinal formation during recovery from bleaching were similar in Rdh 12 -deficient and wild-type mice matched for an Rpe 65 polymorphism that impacts visual cycle efficiency. However, retinal homogenates from Rdh 12 -deficient mice exhibited markedly decreased capacity to reduce exogenous <b>retinaldehydes</b> in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo levels of the bisretinoid compound diretinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A 2 E) were increased in Rdh 12 -deficient mice of various genetic backgrounds. Conversely, in vivo levels of retinoic acid and total retinol were significantly decreased. Rdh 12 transcript levels in wild-type mice homozygous for the Rpe 65 -Leu 450 polymorphism were greater than in Rpe 65 -Met 450 mice and increased during postnatal development in wild-type mice and Nrl-deficient mice having an all-cone retina. Rdh 12 -deficient mice did not exhibit increased retinal degeneration relative to wild-type mice at advanced ages, when bred on the light-sensitive BALB/c background, or when heterozygous for a null allele of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod 2 +/−). Our findings suggest that a critical function of RDH 12 is the reduction of all-trans-retinal that exceeds the reductive capacity of the photoreceptor outer segments...|$|R
40|$|Phototransduction in {{vertebrate}} {{vision is}} mediated by visual pigments composed of opsin apoproteins covalently {{attached to a}} light-sensitive chromophore, 11 -cis retinal. Absorption of light isomerizes 11 -cis retinal to all-trans retinal, initiating a signal transduction cascade. A complex set of enzyme reactions occurring in the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina {{is responsible for the}} synthesis and regeneration of the chromophore and is termed the visual cycle. Several forms of inherited retinal degeneration and dysfunction manifest as a result of mutations in the genes associated with visual cycle function, such as RPE 65 and RDH 12. RPE 65 is essential for the synthesis of 11 -cis retinal and was recently confirmed to function as the visual cycle isomerase. Cone photoreceptors have been proposed to possess an exclusive chromophore regenerative pathway. Using a monoclonal antibody approach, we have now mapped antigenic determinants of the protein surface, shown that RPE 65 is not expressed in cone cells, and confirmed that RPE 65 is associated with the visual cycle enzyme RDH 5. Rdh 12 has an in vitro activity and localization profile that made it an excellent candidate to serve as the all-trans retinal reductase of the visual cycle. Immunochemical analysis localized RDH 12 protein to the photoreceptor inner segments and outer nuclear layer in both humans and mice, suggesting an equivalent physiological role for RDH 12 in both species. However, analysis of the phenotype of Rdh 12 -deficient mice revealed no differences in histology, retinoid processing or electroretinogram response compared to wild-type. Rdh 12 -deficient mice did show a decreased ability to reduce all-trans retinal and 11 -cis retinal as measured by in vitro activity assays of retinal homogenates. These findings suggest that RDH 12 function in mice does not directly contribute to visual cycle function. Instead, a critical function of RDH 12 is likely the reduction of <b>retinaldehydes</b> that exceed the reductive capacity of the photoreceptor outer segment and gain access to the inner segments in conditions of high illumination. The study of these genes is important not only {{to gain a better understanding}} of visual cycle mechanism, but also to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis and to develop targeted forms of therapeutic intervention...|$|R
50|$|Retinoic acid can be {{produced}} in the body by two sequential oxidation steps that convert retinol to <b>retinaldehyde</b> to retinoic acid, but once produced it cannot be reduced again to retinol. The enzymes that generate retinoic acid for control of gene expression include retinol dehydrogenases (i.e. Rdh10) that metabolize retinol to <b>retinaldehyde,</b> and <b>retinaldehyde</b> dehydrogenases: RALHD1 (ALDH1A1), RALHD2 (ALDH1A2), and RALHD3 (ALDH1A3) that metabolize <b>retinaldehyde</b> to retinoic acid. Enzymes that metabolize excess retinol to prevent toxicity include alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450(cyp26).|$|E
50|$|RDH13 is {{most closely}} related to the NADP+-dependent microsomal enzymes RDH11, RDH12 and RDH14. Purified RDH13 acts on retinoids in an {{oxidative}} reductive manner, and strongly prefers the cofactor NADPH over NADH. Moreover, RDH13 is much has much more efficient reductase activity than dehydrogenase activity. RDH13 as a <b>retinaldehyde</b> reductase is significantly less active than that of a related protein RDH11, primarily because of the much higher Km value for <b>retinaldehyde.</b> However, the kcat value of RDH13 for <b>retinaldehyde</b> reduction. arable with that of RDH11, and the Km values of the two enzymes for NADPH are also very similar. Thus, consistent with its sequence similarity to RDH11, RDH12 and RDH14, RDH13 acts as an NADP+-dependent <b>retinaldehyde</b> reductase.|$|E

50|$|Retinoic acid is {{responsible}} for most of the activity of vitamin A, save visual pigment effects that require retinal (<b>retinaldehyde),</b> and cell metabolism effects that may require retinol itself. Also, some biochemical functions necessary for fertility in vitamin A deficient male and female mammals originally appeared to require retinol for rescue, but this is due to a requirement for local conversion of retinol to retinoic acid, as administered retinoic acid does not reach some critical tissues unless given in high amounts. Thus, if animals are fed only retinoic acid but no vitamin A (retinol or retinal), they suffer none of the growth-stunting or epithelial-damaging effects of lack of vitamin A (including no xerophthalmia—dryness of the cornea). They do suffer retina degeneration and blindness, due to retinal (<b>retinaldehyde)</b> deficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Retinaldehyde</b> is a retinol (vitamin A) {{derivative}} {{responsible for}} vision. It binds rhodopsin, a well-characterized GPCR that binds all-cis retinal in its inactive state.

The peripheral association of RDH13 with the membrane further distinguishes this protein from the microsomal <b>retinaldehyde</b> reductases, which are integral membrane proteins that appear to be anchored in the membrane via their N-terminal hydrophobic segments.|$|E

These two specific xanthophylls do not function in the mechanism of sight, since they cannot be converted to retinal (also called <b>retinaldehyde</b> or vitamin A aldehyde). Their arrangement {{is believed to be the}} cause of Haidinger's brush, an entoptic phenomenon that allows to perceive the polarization of light.|$|E
50|$|Common posttranslational {{modifications}} include methylation of the ε-amino group, giving methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyllysine (the latter {{occurring in}} calmodulin); also acetylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and hydroxylation - producing the hydroxylysine in collagen and other proteins. O-Glycosylation of hydroxylysine residues in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus {{is used to}} mark certain proteins for secretion from the cell. In opsins like rhodopsin and the visual opsins (encoded by the genes OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW), <b>retinaldehyde</b> forms a Schiff base with a conserved lysine residue, and interaction of light with the retinylidene group causes signal transduction in color vision (See visual cycle for details). Deficiencies may cause blindness, {{as well as many}} other problems due to its ubiquitous presence in proteins.|$|E
50|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} RDH, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase catalyzes the 11-cis <b>retinaldehyde</b> (the most common visual pigments in higher animals) formation. The enzyme is mainly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is part of short-chain dehydrogenase (SDR) / reductase superfamily. The integral membrane enzyme is anchored to the membranes by its two hydrophobic chains. The catalytic domain of 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase is restricted to the lumenal compartment, suggesting its origin from compartmentalized process. 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase is also mainly associated to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of RPE cells. The 32-kDa integral membrane protein protein (p32) was found to act as the stereospecific 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+ cofactor, and p32 catalyzes the biosynthesis of 11-cis retinal commonly found visual chromophore.|$|E
50|$|RGR-opsin is {{a member}} of the rhodopsin-like {{receptor}} subfamily of GPCR. Like other opsins which bind <b>retinaldehyde,</b> it contains a conserved lysine residue in the seventh transmembrane domain. RGR-opsin preferentially binds all-trans-retinal, which is the dominant form in the dark adapted retina,upon light exposure it is isomerized to 11-cis-retinal. Therefore, RGR-opsin presumably acts as a photoisomerase to convert all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal, similar to retinochrome in invertebrates. 11-cis-retinal is isomerized back within rhodopsin and the iodopsins in the rods and cones of the retina. RGR-opsin is exclusively expressed in tissue close to the rods and cones, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells. RGR-opsin may be associated with autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (arRP and adRP, respectively). RGR-opsin comes in different isoforms produced by alternative splicing.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compound}} that {{interferes with the}} vitamin A pathway {{has been shown to}} render male mice sterile for the course of the treatment without affecting libido. Once taken off the compound, the mice continued to make sperm. The mechanism of action includes blocking the conversion of vitamin A into its active form retinoic acid which binds to retinoic receptors which is needed to initiate sperm production. This can be done, for instance, by blocking an aldehyde dehydrogenase called RALDH3 (ALDH1A2), which converts <b>retinaldehyde</b> into retionic acid in testes. Past attempts to do this failed because the blocking compounds were not sufficiently specific and also blocked other aldehyde dehydrogenases, such as those responsible for the alcohol metabolism, causing serious side effects. Another way is blocking retionic receptors themselves, although it can also have serious side effects.|$|E
50|$|When {{inside the}} RPE cell, bound to CRBP, the all-trans retinol is esterified by Lecithin Retinol Acyltransferase (LRAT) {{to form a}} retinyl ester. The retinyl esters of the RPE are chaperoned by a protein known as RPE65. It is in this form that the RPE stores most of its retinoids, as the RPE stores 2-3 times more retinoids than the neural retina itself. When further {{chromophore}} is required, the retinyl esters are acted on by isomerohydrolase to produce 11-cis retinol, which is transferred to the Cellular <b>Retinaldehyde</b> Binding Protein (CRALBP). 11-cis retinol is transformed into 11-cis retinal by 11-cis Retinol Dehydrogenase, then it is shipped back to the rod photoreceptors via IRBP. There, it replaces the spent chromophore in opsin molecules, allowing the opsin to function again as a light receptor.|$|E
50|$|Opsin {{proteins}} covalently bind to a vitamin A-based <b>retinaldehyde</b> chromophore {{through a}} Schiff base linkage to a lysine residue {{in the seventh}} transmembrane alpha helix. In vertebrates, the chromophore is either 11-cis-retinal (A1) or 11-cis-3,4-didehydroretinal (A2) and {{is found in the}} retinal binding pocket of the opsin. The absorption of a photon of light results in the photoisomerization of the chromophore from the 11-cis to an all-trans conformation. The photoisomerization induces a conformational change in the opsin protein, causing the activation of the phototransduction cascade. The opsin remains insensitive to light in the trans form. It is regenerated by the replacement of the all-trans retinal by a newly synthesized 11-cis-retinal provided from the retinal epithelial cells. Opsins are functional while bound to either chromophore, with A2-bound opsin λmax being at a longer wavelength than A1-bound opsin.|$|E
5000|$|ABCR is {{localized}} to outer segment disk {{edges of}} rods and cones. ABCR is expressed {{much less than}} rhodopsin, approximately at 1:120. Comparisons between mammalian ABCA4 to other ABCs, cellular localization of ABCA4, and analyses of ABCA4 knockout mice suggest that ABCA4 may function as an inward-directed retinoid flippase. Flippase is a transmembrane protein that [...] "flips" [...] its conformation to transport materials across a membrane. In the case of ABCA4, the flippase facilitates transfer of N-retinyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NR-PE), a covalent adduct of all-trans <b>retinaldehyde</b> (ATR) with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), trapped inside the disk as charged species out to the cytoplasmic surface. Once transported, ATR is reduced to vitamin A and then transferred to retinal pigment epithelium to be recycled into 11-cis-retinal. This alternating access-release model for ABCA4 has four steps: (1) binding of ATP to an NBD to bring two NBDs together and expose outer vestibule high affinity binding site located in TMD, (2) binding of NR-PE/ATR on extracellular side of the channel, (3) ATP hydrolysis promoting gate opening and movement of NR-PE/ATR across the membrane to the low-affinity binding site on the intracellular portion of TMD, and (4) release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) to release the bound ligand. The channel is then ready to transfer another molecule of NR-PE/ATR again.|$|E
40|$|Retinoids serve {{two main}} {{functions}} in biology: <b>retinaldehyde</b> forms the chromophore bound to opsins, and retinoic acid (RA) is the activating ligand of transcription factors. These two functions are linked in the vertebrate eye: we describe here that illumination of the retina {{results in an}} increase in RA synthesis, as detected with a RA bioassay and by HPLC. The synthesis is mediated by <b>retinaldehyde</b> dehydrogenases which convert some of the chromophore all-trans <b>retinaldehyde,</b> released from bleached rhodopsin, into RA. As the eye contains high levels of <b>retinaldehyde</b> dehydrogenases, and as the oxidation of <b>retinaldehyde</b> is an irreversible reaction, RA production has to be considered an unavoidable by-product of light. Through RA synthesis, light can thus directly influence gene transcription in the eye, which provides a plausible mechanism for light effects that cannot be explained by electric activity. Whereas the function of <b>retinaldehyde</b> as chromophore is conserved from bacteria to mammals, RA-mediated transcription is fully evolved only in vertebrates. Invertebrates differ from vertebrates in the mechanism of chromophore regeneration: while in the invertebrate visual cycle the chromophore remains bound, it is released as free all-trans <b>retinaldehyde</b> from illuminated vertebrate rhodopsin. RA synthesis occurring as corollary of dark regeneration in the vertebrate visual cycle may have given rise to the expansion of RA-mediated transcriptional regulation...|$|E

An additional physiological role for the <b>retinaldehyde</b> reductase activity of these enzymes, consistent with their tissue localization, is their participation in β-carotene absorption. <b>Retinaldehyde</b> metabolism may be subjected to subcellular compartmentalization, based on enzyme localization.

40|$|<b>Retinaldehyde,</b> {{a natural}} {{metabolite}} of β-carotene and retinol, {{has been proposed}} recently for topical use in humans.

Some quantitative differences, not all in favor of all-trans retinoic acid, were found in several indices. Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II and cellular retinol-binding protein I mRNAs were increased by both topical <b>retinaldehyde</b> and all-trans retinoic acid. Whereas all-trans retinoic acid, 9 -cis-retinoic acid, and 13 -cis-retinoic acid were not detectable (limit 5 ng/g) in vehicle-treated skin, 0. 05 % retinaldehyde-treated skin contained 13 ± 6. 9 ng/g wet tissue of all-trans retinoic acid (mean ± SD), 12. 6 ± 5. 9 ng/g 13 -cis-retinoic acid, and no 9 -cis-retinoic acid. In contrast, 9 -cis-retinoic acid was detectable in 0. 05 % of all-trans retinoic acid-treated skin, which also contained 25 -fold more all-trans retinoic acid and 5 -fold more 13 -cis-retinoic acid than retinaldehyde-treated skin. Our results show that topical <b>retinaldehyde</b> is transformed in vivo into all-trans retinoic acid by mouse epidermis. The small amounts of ligand for retinoic acid nuclear receptors thus produced are sufficient to induce biologic effects similar to those resulting from the topical application of the ligand itself in much higher concentration...|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{in human}} Retinol Dehydrogenase 12 (RDH 12) {{are known to}} cause {{photoreceptor}} cell death but the physiological function of RDH 12 in photoreceptors remains poorly understood. In vitro, RDH 12 recognizes both retinoids and medium-chain aldehydes as substrates. Our previous study suggested that RDH 12 protects cells against toxic levels of <b>retinaldehyde</b> and retinoic acid [Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 282 (2007) 35621 – 35628]. Here, we investigated whether RDH 12 can also protect cells against highly reactive medium-chain aldehydes. Analysis of cell survival demonstrated that RDH 12 was protective against nonanal but not against 4 -hydroxynonenal. At high concentrations, nonanal inhibited the activity of RDH 12 towards <b>retinaldehyde,</b> suggesting that nonanal was metabolized by RDH 12. 4 -Hydroxynonenal did not inhibit the RDH 12 <b>retinaldehyde</b> reductase activity, but it strongly inhibited the activities of lecithin:retinol acyl transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in decreased levels of retinyl esters and retinoic acid and accumulation of unesterified retinol. Thus, {{the results of this}} study showed that RDH 12 is more effective in protection against <b>retinaldehyde</b> than against medium-chain aldehydes, and that medium-chain aldehydes, especially 4 -hydroxynonenal, severely disrupt cellular retinoid homeostasis. Together, these findings provide a new insight into the effects of lipid peroxidation products and the impact of oxidative stress on retinoid metabolism...|$|E
