40|$|Payload Fairing (PLF) of {{a launch}} vehicle protects the payload from {{excessive}} thermal loads, acoustic vibrations, aerodynamic loads and other undesirable environmental influences during the atmospheric ascent {{phase of the}} flight. The Payload Fairing (PLF) of LVM 3 consists of four segments, the Boat Tail, the Cylinder, the Nose Cone and the Nose Cap. It has a cylinder diameter of 5 m and a semi-cone angle of 200 for the boat-tail and nose cone portions. The overall height of the structure is 10. 65 m. In order to save structural mass and minimize fabrication time, the PLF is realized using sandwich construction with carbon/epoxy face sheets and aluminium honeycomb core and assembled with aluminium alloy interface rings at all the segment joints. It is constructed in two halves with the longitudinal joints formed using a Linear Bellow System (LBS). The LBS consists of a linear piston-cylinder riveted structure holding a reinforced <b>rubber</b> <b>bellow</b> in folded condition and accommodates a Mild Detonating Cord (MDC) for pyro separation. For qualification of the structural elements of the payload fairing, a full-scale structural test is to be conducted. This involves simulation of aerodynamic pressure on the nose cap and nose cone areas and shear force application at three levels of bulkhead segment joints. This project brings {{out the details of}} the methodology, loads, test set-up and procedure for this test. For this purpose two pressure chambers are used in nose cone and nose cap regions for the simulation of aerodynamic pressures. So this paper includes the Design, Modeling and Finite Element Analysis of these pressure chambers...|$|E
40|$|Silva Sweden AB has {{developed}} a new compass transducer module, {{that will be used}} for OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) business as well as in Silva´s own products. In order to market the module, the company has decided to develop a number of products around this module. The aim with the master thesis work is to develop two new products that are based around the new compass module that Silva Sweden AB {{has developed}}. As the two products differ from each other, the thesis work will be divided into two projects, referred to as Project 1 and Project 2. The aim with Project 1 is to incorporate the new compass module in a hand- held electronic navigation instrument. The development process will consist of designing the shell of the product, finding relevant features to incorporate in the product, and to design the user interface of the instrument: which includes button and display design. The aim with Project 2 is to develop a tactical compass made for use on dinghies. The development process will consist of designing the shell of the product, finding relevant features to incorporate in the product, and to design the user interface of the instrument: which includes button and display design. Also a mounting bracket for compass-attachment on the boat will be designed. Both of the projects are defined to be at a conceptual stage, whereby no drafting or preparation for manufacturing will be produced. To approach the projects in a systematic and structured way, a number of methods for product development have been used. Different methods have been used mixed together, but the general structure applied is taken from a method described by Ulrich and Epplinger in the book “Product design and development”. To gather data and get information about navigation and sailing two web surveys in the form of inquiries were conducted, one for each project. The inquiries together with, mind maps, product specifications and the question method served {{as the basis for the}} problem investigation and provided a good start for the concept development for both projects. To solve problems brainstorming sessions were held and different ideas was brought up. The ideas were continuously discussed and evaluated with Mr. Jan Silfvén, Product manager at Silva Nexus Marine. Criteria’s were formulated and weighted against each other. With the criteria’s ant the prior work ultimately final concepts were developed. The final concept for project 1 is a handheld device that is designed to be used in both outdoor and marine environments. To be as functional as possible in these environments, the compass is made very portable, but yet has a relatively big display. The main function of the product is to serve as an electronic compass made for both map-aligned navigation and sighting. In its standard version, the compass will also feature a built-in watch and stop-watch with included alarm function. The compass will also come as a hi- end version, which will have the following additional features: altimeter, thermometer/ barometer, time/date/alarm/stop-watch. The compass is also made so that it can be mounted vertically on e. g. a boat. To make the compass more compatible with a map, a rotatable bezel is placed on the top surface of the compass. The bezel has meridian lines printed on the top surface of it, which furthermore simplifies the map-alignment. On the top of the bezel, two sights that make up a gun-sight are also placed. A ruler used as a tool for map-alignment is integrated in the compass. The ruler is retractable, which means that it can slide in and out of the compass. The final concept for project 2 is a tactical compass with two separate displays that are united through a centre part. Both of the displays are hinged together to the centre part, which makes the angle between the displays adjustable. The adjustable angle between the displays makes the compass more versatile as it permits the compass to be viewed from a wider range of different angles, and more portable as the displays are foldable behind the centre part. To ensure that the compass is water tight it is wrapped up in a <b>rubber</b> <b>bellow</b> that is glued onto the surfaces of the compass. This also gives the compass a more united feeling, as it looks more like one part instead of three parts hinged together. To be able to mount the compass onto the mast, and to ensure that the displays can be adjusted to the same angle every time the compass is used, a mounting bracket was developed. The bracket is strapped onto the mast with a Velcro- strap. Once the bracket is strapped to the mast, the mounting, and demounting of the compass is done easily. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{considers}} a novel modular and intrinsically safe redundant robotic system with biologically inspired actuators (pneumatic artificial muscles and <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows</b> actuators). Similarly to the biological systems, the stiffness {{of the internal}} parallel modules, representing 2 DOF joints in the serial robotic chains, is controlled by co-activation of opposing redundant actuator groups in the null-space of the module Jacobian, without influencing the actual robot position. The decoupled position/stiffness control allows the realization of variable joint stiffness according to different force-displacement relationships. The variable joint stiffness, as well as limited pneumatic muscle/bellows force ability, ensures internal system safety that is crucial for development of human-friendly robots intended for human-robot collaboration.

50|$|Some {{machines}} {{which actually}} load {{from the top}} are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, {{but there is no}} front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows</b> seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life.|$|R
5000|$|One {{surviving}} Hugon {{engine is}} owned by the Science Museum (London) and is currently on display at the Anson Engine Museum, there appear to be no other survivors. It is the same engine described in detail by Clerk, which was a half horse power engine at that time located at the South Kensington Museum (first edition of his work was in 1886). Clerk notes that [...] "The only parts that gave trouble were the bellows pumps controlling the gas supply to cylinder and igniting ports these were made of rubber, and deteriorating after some use gave trouble by leaking and occasional bursting. In some of the engines in use they were replaced with metal pumps and a mixing valve. With these additions the engine at the Patent Office Museum ran for many years." [...] The Patent Office Museum was transferred to the South Kensington Museum in 1883. The surviving Hugon engine lacks the <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows</b> and the drive mechanism for the gas pumps, which by this account were probably removed while the engine was relatively new, and still being actively used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A design {{concept of}} low-cost, simple, fully {{mechanical}} {{model of a}} mechanically ventilated, passively breathing lung is developed. An example model is built to simulate a patient under mechanical ventilation with accurate volumes and compliances, while connected directly to a ventilator. Methods The lung is modelled with multiple units, represented by <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows,</b> with adjustable weights placed on bellows to simulate compartments of different superimposed pressure and compliance, as well as different levels of lung disease, such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The model was directly connected to a ventilator and the resulting pressure volume curves recorded. Results The model effectively captures the fundamental lung dynamics {{for a variety of}} conditions, and showed the effects of different ventilator settings. It was particularly effective at showing the impact of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) therapy on lung recruitment to improve oxygenation, a particulary difficult dynamic to capture. Conclusion Application of PEEP therapy is difficult to teach and demonstrate clearly. Therefore, the model provide opportunity to train, teach, and aid further understanding of lung mechanics and the treatment of lung diseases in critical care, such as ARDS and asthma. Finally, the model's pure mechanical nature and accurate lung volumes mean that all results are both clearly visible and thus intuitively simple to grasp. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{development of}} a three somites earthworm type mobile inspection robot which is able to move in long pipes. We have many small diameter pipes which are gas or water pipes for individual or corporate houses and boilers or hot water pipes for industries. They are settled in the ground horizontally or in the narrow spaces vertically {{and some of them}} are covered by casings or hard heat insulating matters. It is very difficult to inspect from out of the pipes. If we can insert a mobile inspection robot into the pipes from the suitable position, we are easy to inspect the pipes. Authors fabricated a three somites earthworm type mobile inspection robot in which we use three <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows</b> as pneumatic actuators. Sixteen rubber friction rings are used to get friction force between pneumatic actuators and the pipes. The electromagnetic valves and air-feeding tubes for the pneumatic actuators are carried on trolleys in order to decrease friction force between the pipes and them. The fabricated three somites earthworm type mobile inspection robot can move in a pipe which is 78 mm in inner diameter and vertical pipe carrying a load that is equivalent to the air-feeding tube of 32 m length. Consequently, the inspection robot was confirmed to move in the long pipes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of morphing skin and structure technology in a hydroturbine context. The work has been divided into two parts; construction of a demonstration rig and CFD calculations assessing the concept of camber morphing of guide vanes. Five rubber 'morphing bumps' reduce the intensity of vortex shedding behind a cylinder in an open flow of water. The bumps are made by a <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows</b> placed in a perforated stainless steel pipe. Their size is controlled by air pressure, and the option of reducing them to a neutral state is present. A control software has been designed using Labview, allowing manual and automatic (model predicted flow control) operation, as well as logging of measurements. The tests show that the bumps are capable of reducing vortex intensity by approximately 25 %. CFD simulations has been performed on a Francis turbine section to determine if altering the camber of guide vanes at different loads can have a beneficial effect to the performance and wear characteristics. The simulations resulted in a dataset consisting of steady state and transient simulation results from 28 combinations of camber and wicket gate opening. The results did not establish that camber morphing can increase efficiency, but neither did they reject it completely. It {{has been shown that}} for small cambers up to 2 %, the gains from increased lift far outweigh increased drag at part loads. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} brief introduction into scanning tunneling microscopy, and then Chapter III {{reports on the}} design and operation of a cryogenic ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled to a closed-cycle cryostat (CCC). The STM is thermally linked to the CCC through helium exchange gas confined inside a volume enclosed by highly flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>bellows.</b> The STM is thus mechanically decoupled from the CCC, which results in a significant reduction of the mechanical noise transferred from the CCC to the STM. Noise analysis of the tunneling current shows current fluctuations up to 4 % of the total current, which translates into tip-sample distance variations of up to 1. 5 picometers. This noise level is sufficiently low for atomic-resolution imaging {{of a wide variety}} of surfaces. To demonstrate this, atomic-resolution images of Au(111) and NaCl(100) /Au(111) surfaces, as well as of carbon nanotubes deposited on Au(111), were obtained. Other performance characteristics such as thermal drift analysis and a cool-down analysis are reported. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements based on the lock-in technique were also carried out and showed no detectable presence of noise from the CCC. These results demonstrate that the constructed CCC-coupled STM is a highly stable instrument capable of highly detailed spectroscopic investigations of materials and surfaces at the atomic-scale. A study of electron transport in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was also conducted. In Chapter IV, STS is used to study the quantum-confined electronic states in SWCNTs deposited on the Au(111) surface. The STS spectra show the vibrational overtones which suggest rippling distortion and dimerization of carbon atoms on the SWCNT surface. This study experimentally connects the properties of well-defined localized electronic states to the properties of their associated vibronic states. In Chapter V, a study of PbS nanocrystals was conducted to study the effect of localized sub-bandgap states associated with surface imperfections. A correlation between their properties and the atomic-scale structure of chemical imperfections responsible for their appearance was established to understand the nature of such surface states.

5000|$|Pipe {{expansion}} joints {{are necessary}} in systems that convey high temperature substances such as steam or exhaust gases, or to absorb movement and vibration. A typical joint is a bellows of metal (most commonly stainless steel), plastic (such as PTFE), fabric (such as glass fibre) or an elastomer such as <b>rubber.</b> A <b>bellows</b> {{is made up}} of a series of convolutions, with the shape of the convolution designed to withstand the internal pressures of the pipe, but flexible enough to accept axial, lateral, and angular deflections. Expansion joints are also designed for other criteria, such as noise absorption, anti-vibration, earthquake movement, and building settlement. Metal expansion joints have to be designed according to rules laid out by EJMA, for fabric expansion joints there are guidelines and a state-of-the-art description by the Quality Association for Fabric Expansion Joints. Pipe expansion joints are also known as [...] "compensators", as they compensate for the thermal movement.|$|R
50|$|The mil fabric {{reinforcement}} {{can be applied}} on the rubber products with different processes. For straight hoses the most used processes are braiding, spiralling, knitting and wrapping. The first three processes have in common that multiple strands of fibres are applied to the product simultaneously on a predetermined pattern in an automated process. The fourth process comprises manual or semi-automated wrapping of rubber sheets reinforced with fabric plies. For the reinforcement of complex shaped <b>rubber</b> products like <b>bellows</b> most manufacturers use these fabric reinforced rubber sheets. These sheets are made by calendering of rubber onto pre-woven fabric plies. The products are manufactured by wrapping (mostly manually) these sheets around a mandrel until enough rubber and reinforcement is applied. However, the disadvantage of using these sheets {{is that it is}} impossible to control the positioning of the individual fibres of the fabric when applied on complex shapes. Therefore, no geodesic paths can be achieved and therefore also no isotensoid loading is possible. To obtain isotensoide loading on a complex shape, the shape must have an isotensoideal profile and geodesic positioning of the fibre structure is required. This can be achieved by using automated winding processes like filament winding or spiralling.|$|R
