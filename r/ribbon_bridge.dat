500|$|From December 1995 to January 1996, all {{units in}} the brigade, except the 320th Engineer Company (Topographic), {{deployed}} to Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. The 320th Engineer Company deployed their topographic surveying platoon the following year. The 130th Engineer Brigade was tasked with building an assault bridge over the Sava River. Despite severe flooding conditions around the river and international pressure against such a structure, the brigade sent its units to begin work on the bridge. In December 1995, the 502nd Engineer Company deployed to Zupanja, Croatia and placed the historic <b>ribbon</b> <b>bridge</b> over the river. This bridge, at [...] was the longest assault floating bridge in military history. The company operated 24-hours a day for three months crossing critical traffic in support of Task Force Eagle and NATO's Implementation Force. The company also assisted {{in the construction of}} a second bridge over the Sava River in Brčko-Gunja. The 502nd Engineer Company redeployed in May 1996, with a rafting section remaining at Slavonski Brod to support the force restructuring of Task Force Eagle. The 130th Engineer Brigade would go on to construct seven fixed bridges in support of the operation. During the deployment, the brigade was also tasked with creating and maintaining maps and overlays of the area of operations. It would produce over 300,000 such maps. The 130th Engineer Brigade was also tasked with repairing and maintaining much of the Task Force's infrastructure.|$|E

Series of numerical analysis to estimate structural frequency and modal damping were conducted for a two-dof model using the simulated external forces induced by impulse force and white noise.

40|$|By {{computing}} spin-polarized electronic transport {{across a}} finite zigzag graphene <b>ribbon</b> <b>bridging</b> two metallic graphene electrodes, we demonstrate, as a proof of principle, that devices featuring 100 % magnetoresistance {{can be built}} entirely out of carbon. In the ground state a short zig-zag ribbon is an antiferromagnetic insulator which, when connecting two metallic electrodes, acts as a tunnel barrier that suppresses the conductance. Application of a magnetic field turns the ribbon ferromagnetic and conducting, increasing dramatically the current between electrodes. We predict large magnetoresistance in this system at liquid nitrogen temperature and 10 Tesla or at liquid helium temperature and 300 Gauss. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A stress <b>ribbon</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>bridge</b> is {{the structure}} {{in which the}} axial force of prestressed deck, which is developed by introducing prestressed force into the thin deck with the very low value of span to deck-depth ratio which is installed on bearing cables with the specified sag, resists most of external loadings. Since the design of stress <b>ribbon</b> pedestrian <b>bridges</b> should be conducted by assuming the cross-section of deck, the area of bearing cables and post-tensioning cables, and the prestressed force of post-tensioning cables, it requires much more iterative processes than the design of general bridges. In this research, to minimize such iteration processes, regression equations which can reasonably assume the area of bearing cables and post-tensioning cables, and the prestressed force of post-tensioning cables, are suggested for the bridge length of 80 m with th...|$|R

5000|$|Disadvantages {{connected}} with simple suspension bridges are very great. The {{location of the}} deck is limited, massive anchorages and piers generally are required, and loading produces transient deformation of the deck. [...] Solutions to these problems led {{to a wide variety}} of methods of stiffening the deck, resulting in several other types of suspension bridge. These include a stressed <b>ribbon</b> <b>bridge,</b> which is closely related to a simple suspension bridge but has a stiffened deck suitable for vehicle traffic.|$|E

50|$|The Jubilee Bridge {{was officially}} opened on Friday 28 September 1923 by the Queensland Premier Ted Theodore who was driven {{in a car}} through the <b>ribbon.</b> The <b>bridge</b> was {{decorated}} with flags, streamers and palms. The Chairman of the Johnstone Shire Council, Leontine Joseph Duffy, announced the bridge had cost £32,000 of which £20,000 was spent in Innisfail. One of the bridge piers was 72 ft deep, the deepest on any traffic bridge in Australia.However, with a few years, the bridge showed signs of sinking with a report by engineers confirming subsidence of the piers in 1928. A 4-ton weight limit was introduced on the bridge. Repairs costing £2000 were required.|$|R
