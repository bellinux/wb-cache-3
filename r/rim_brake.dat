25|$|<b>Rim</b> <b>brakes</b> are inexpensive, light, {{mechanically}} simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, {{they perform}} relatively poorly when the rims are wet, and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry {{debris from the}} ground to the <b>brake</b> pads, <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are more prone to}} clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes (where braking surfaces are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles.|$|R

25|$|Various {{types of}} brake {{calipers}} {{are also used}} on bicycle <b>rim</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Rim</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{so called}} because braking {{force is applied}} by {{friction}} pads to {{the rim of the}} rotating wheel, thus slowing it and the bicycle. [...] Brake pads can be made of leather, rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal [...] "shoes". <b>Rim</b> <b>brakes</b> are typically actuated by a lever mounted on the handlebar.|$|R
5000|$|Trials brakes {{must create}} more {{stopping}} torque than standard bicycle brakes and are set up, {{especially on the}} rear, with more emphasis on locking the wheel they act on than bringing the bike to a smooth halt from speed. For larger wheeled trials bikes, brakes that act directly on the rim are more popular, namely hydraulic <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> and cable actuated V Brakes, though disk brakes are also used, especially on the front wheel, by most riders. Virtually all competition only riders on 26" [...] wheeled bikes use hydraulic <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> on both wheels, while for 20" [...] competition the split is more even between <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> and disks.|$|R

5000|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{preference}} for <b>rim</b> <b>brake</b> {{on the back of}} 26" [...] wheeled bikes is that there is significant wind-up between the wheel rim and the hub while hopping on the back wheel thanks to the longer spokes and bigger wheel and disk diameter used compared to a 20" [...] wheel. This occurs because disk brakes hold the hub still rather than the rim. The effect is noticeable as a springiness in the bike when on the back wheel and this feels less precise and confidence inspiring to many riders than a <b>rim</b> <b>brake,</b> which holds the wheel directly at the rim.|$|E

5000|$|Drum brakes - a {{drum brake}} has two brake shoes that expand {{out into the}} inside of the hub shell. Rear-mounted drum brakes are often used on tandems to {{supplement}} the rear <b>rim</b> <b>brake</b> and give additional stopping power.|$|E

25|$|A bicycle brake {{reduces the}} speed of a bicycle or {{prevents}} it from moving. The three main types are: <b>rim</b> <b>brakes,</b> disc brakes, and drum brakes. There have been various types of brakes used throughout history, and several are still in use today.|$|R
25|$|Bicycle <b>brakes</b> may be <b>rim</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{in which}} {{friction}} pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is {{contained within the}} wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use <b>rim</b> <b>brakes,</b> but some use disk brakes. Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.|$|R

The landing gear features a steerable nose wheel with a bicycle-style <b>rim</b> <b>brake.</b> The powerplant is mounted underneath the wing and drives a pusher propeller.|$|E
50|$|SRAM {{manufacture}} the i-Light hub dynamo. The D7 {{series is}} available for both rim and disc brakes while the D3 series features several of <b>rim</b> <b>brake</b> varieties. In a 2006 review by the German Stiftung Warentest, the efficiency at 15 km/h of a D1 series i-Light hub dynamo was 66%, 10% better than a SON-28.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2015 Zipp {{released}} an alloy rimmed, tubeless ready wheelset called, Zipp 30 Course.

At Ironman® World Championships in Kona, Hawaii the same year, Zipp launched its new NSW line of wheels with its first offering, the 808 NSW.|$|E

50|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of <b>rim</b> <b>brake.</b> Some brake levers have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake.

50|$|The Arai {{drum brake}} is used during long {{downhill}} descents where a <b>rim</b> <b>brake</b> might overheat the tire and possibly {{cause it to}} fail. The drum of the brake screws onto {{the left side of}} the tandem hub, which must be threaded for the drum. The shoe plate slips over the axle and a small reaction arm from the shoe plate engages with the bicycle frame to prevent the plate from turning. The drum brake is typically controlled by a friction shift lever like a BARCON or similar. The brake is designed to be engaged continuously during a descent to maintain a steady speed. The standard brakes can be used in addition as necessary.|$|E
50|$|Street biased riders tend {{to choose}} disk brakes more often. Part {{of this is}} that disks are almost {{invariably}} better at controlling the speed of a bike while it is rolling, that is they can take more energy per unit time from the rider (i.e. they have more power, which is why they dominate all other off-road cycling disciplines), but most disks will not hold a wheel locked as firmly as a <b>rim</b> <b>brake,</b> making them less desirable for competition trials. Rim brakes set up for trials tend to squeal or howl if they are pulled while the wheel is turning, occasionally leading to trials riders attracting undesirable attention or being considered a nuisance for noise pollution.|$|E
50|$|Rims {{designed}} for use with <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> provide a smooth parallel <b>braking</b> surface, while <b>rims</b> meant for use with disc brakes or hub brakes sometimes lack this surface.|$|R
2500|$|The 1870s and 1880s saw the {{development}} of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today, with two wheels of equal size, initially with solid rubber tyres. These were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism, but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears, allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals. [...] The relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of <b>rim</b> <b>brakes.</b> In the late 1890s came the introduction of <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> and the freewheel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rim</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are also}} often {{enhanced}} by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe shaped plates which are bolted between the brake pistons (Or {{arms in the}} case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the tyre. This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever and in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic <b>rim</b> <b>brakes</b> this has a second benefit which is to protect the brake line which loops over the tyre between the brake pistons from being accidentally hit and broken.|$|R
