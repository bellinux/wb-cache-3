The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
40|$|In the aseptic {{processing}} of particulate fluid foods, the residence time distribution of particles and the fluid-to-particle heat transfer are intimately {{related to the}} linear and <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> of the particles. The development of models correlating these velocities with fluid and particle characteristics and with operating conditions is therefore very useful, as it provides a fast method to estimate fluid-to-particle heat transfer coefficients without measuring the actual particle velocities. The models can further be used to estimate the average residence time of the particles. Data for modelling particle linear and <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> were obtained by videotaping the flow, along the wall, of individual spherical particles in transparent 2 -m long straight tubes. Linear and <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> were correlated with generalized Reynolds, Archimedes and Froude numbers, to the particle-to-fluid density simplex and to the particle/tube diameter ratio.

40|$|High {{resolution}} optical {{spectra of}} 57 Galactic B-type supergiant stars have been analyzed {{to determine their}} <b>rotational</b> and macroturbulent <b>velocities.</b> In addition, their atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulent velocity) and surface nitrogen abundances have been estimated using a non-LTE grid of model atmospheres. Comparisons of the projected <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> have been made with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models and in general good agreement was found. However for {{a small number of}} targets, their observed <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> were significantly larger than predicted, although their nitrogen abundances were consistent {{with the rest of the}} sample. We conclude that binarity may have played a role in generating their large <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities.</b> No correlation was found between nitrogen abundances and the current projected <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities.</b> However a correlation was found with the inferred projected <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> of the main sequence precursors of our supergiant sample. This correlation is again in agreement with the predictions of single star evolutionary models that incorporate rotational mixing. The origin of the macroturbulent and microturbulent velocity fields is discussed and our results support previous theoretical studies that link the former to sub-photospheric convection and the latter to non-radial gravity mode oscillations.

5|$|The <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{measured}} {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true rotational velocity: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|Using {{the stellar}} spectrum, astronomers can also {{determine}} the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> of a star. If {{the distance of}} the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's axial tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E

Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500m/s due to the higher <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where <b>rotational</b> <b>velocity</b> approaches zero.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are priviledged environments {{to perform}} tests of {{theoretical}} predictions at low metallicity on <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> and stellar evolution. According to theoretical predictions, the <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> of B-type stars {{are expected to}} be higher in low metallicity (LMC/SMC) than in high metallicity (MW) environments. To verify the models, we observed with the VLT-FLAMES 523 B and Be stars, which form, at the moment, the largest observed sample of these kind of objects in the MCs. We first determined the stellar fundamental parameters and we found that B and Be stars rotate faster in the MCs than in the MW. We also determined the first distribution of the average ZAMS <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities</b> versus the mass of Be stars. These results indicate that the appearance of Be stars is mass-, metallicity-, stellar evolution-, and star-formation regions-dependant. Moreover, the recent models of Long Gamma Ray Bursts progenitors foresee possible LGRBs progenitors at the SMC’s metallicity. We confront these models with the observed (ZAMS <b>rotational</b> <b>velocities,</b> masses) distributions of the fastest rotators (Be and Oe stars) in our sample. Furthermore, we compare the corresponding predicted rates from our study with observed rates of LGRBs...|$|R
