40|$|The {{beautiful}} sandstone {{building with}} its clock tower, Oregon pine floors and slate staircases {{was the first}} building to be completed {{on the campus of}} what was then the Transvaal University College (TUC). The foundation stone was laid on 3 August 1910. At the opening in August 1911, General Jan Smuts expressed the hope that the TUC would one day be to this country what Oxford was to England. Today, the staircase still features an exquisite stained glass window of the original TUC coat of arms. Designed by a student of Sir Herbert Baker, Percy Eagle, the building boasts different styles including elements of Cape Dutch and Neo-Romanesque. In recognition of its beautiful architectural style, the building was proclaimed a National Monument in 1968. The fountain {{in front of the building}} was redesigned in 1990 with two <b>red</b> <b>lechwes</b> (antelopes) sculpted by Coert Steynberg and sponsored by Dr Anton Rupert and his wife. Initially the building housed almost the entire University. Today it accommodates the UP Archives, Department of UP Arts, Mapungubwe Museum and the Van Tilburg collection. 5 coloured digital photos of the Old Arts Building created using a Canon EOS 350 D Digital Camera.

5000|$|Several rare large mammal {{and bird}} species {{are found in}} Bwabwata. Elephants {{regularly}} move between Namibia, Angola, Botswana and Zambia. Other species found are African buffalo, hippopotamus, roan antelope, sable antelope, tsessebe, Chapman's zebra, blue wildebeest, common reedbuck, <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> sitatunga and crocodile. Main predators are Katanga lion, African leopard, South African cheetah and spotted hyena.|$|E
50|$|The Cape lechwe, or Venter's lechwe, (Kobus venterae) is an {{extinct species}} {{similar to the}} <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> Kobus leche. It was {{described}} by Robert Broom from a frontlet and horn core from Haagenstad (now known as Florisbad), which Broom believed to be an intermediate form between lechwe and waterbuck. However others have failed to find justification for separating the species from Kobus leche.|$|E
50|$|The {{animals and}} birds at Fota Wildlife Park {{originate}} {{from a variety}} of habitats, many of which are threatened with degradation through human activity. Fota currently runs the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for the Sudan cheetah and the European Studbook (ESB) for Lechwe (Kafue lechwe and <b>Red</b> <b>lechwe)</b> Below the animals found in the wildlife park are listed in their respective groupings.|$|E
50|$|Mudumu National Park {{is a vast}} 1000 km2 {{expanse of}} dense savannah and mopane {{woodland}} with the Kwando River at its western border. The park is home to small populations of sitatunga and <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> while spotted neck otter, hippo and crocodile inhabit the waterways. Animals to be encountered are elephant, buffalo, roan, sable, kudu, impala, oribi, zebra, wild dog {{as well as some}} 430 species of birds.|$|E
50|$|Although officially still a village, Maun has {{developed}} rapidly from a rural frontier town and has spread along the Thamalakane River. It now has shopping centres, hotels and lodges {{as well as}} car hire, although it retains a rural atmosphere and local tribesmen continue to bring their cattle to Maun to sell. The community is distributed along the wide banks of the Thamalakane River where <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> can still be seen grazing next to local donkeys, goats and cattle.|$|E
50|$|Many {{antelope}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. In most species, both sexes have horns, {{but those of}} males tend to be larger. Males tend to be larger than the females, but exceptions in which the females tend to be heavier than the males include the bush duiker, dwarf antelope, Cape grysbok, and oribi, all rather small species. A number of species have hornless females (e.g. sitatunga, <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> and suni). In some species, the males and females have differently coloured pelages (e.g. blackbuck and nyala).|$|E
50|$|Nkasa Rupara forms a {{corridor}} for all large mammal species moving between Namibia and Botswana, particularly African elephant and buffalo. There are about 1 000 buffalo in Nkasa Rupara, the largest concentration in Namibia. Around 560 hippopotami and 500 crocodile {{occur in the}} park’s rivers and channels. Rare antelope species include sitatungas, pukus, <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> reedbucks and oribis. Mammals of this park as well as reptiles feature elephants, Katanga lions, Namibian cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyenas, Cape wild dogs, roan antelopes, impala, kudus, warthogs, baboons, spotted-necked otters, rock monitor lizards and water monitor lizards.|$|E
50|$|The slaty egret is an {{inhabitant}} of floodplains, freshwater marshes, {{and temporary}} shallow wetlands, {{it shows a}} preference for areas where the water levels are falling back from their peak following seasonal rains. It is most often found in areas where there is good cover of low, emergent vegetation such as Cynodon dactylon and Panicum repens. Slaty egrets have been observed to be more numerous on floodplains which {{have been subjected to}} fire, and it is often found alongside the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> antelope (Kobus leche). It prefers to forage in shallow water which is less than 10 cm deep.|$|E
50|$|The Cape lechwe {{stood between}} 90 to 100 {{centimetres}} {{at the shoulder}} and topped the scale at between 70 to 120 kilograms. In all probability they were marked similarly to the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> Kobus l. leche subspecies, being golden brown with a white belly. Therefore males were darker in colour, but the general hue of their hide varied depending on the southern ecotypical cline. The long spiral structured horns were vaguely lyre-shaped, and were found only in males. Their hind legs were somewhat longer in proportion than in other antelopes, as with all subspecies within the Kobus leche group, to ease long-distance running in moist, inundated, and marshy soils.|$|E
50|$|Moremi Game Reserve, {{established}} in 1965 and expanded {{over the years}} and now covering an area of 4871 km2, it is the habitat of mopane woodland and acacia forests, floodplains and lagoons. It is said {{to be one of the}} most beautiful reserves in Africa maintained by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Birdlife in the park is wide and of varied species; water birds to shy forest dwellers are commonly seen. Other wild life fauna such as elephants, hippos (found in large number in the Hippo Pool), a few rhino and the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe.</b> Moremi is also particularly well known for its African wild dog sightings.|$|E
5000|$|Yōji Matsuda voices Ashitaka (アシタカ), {{the last}} prince of the Emishi tribe whose {{traveling}} companion is Yakul (Yakkuru), a red elk (Akashishi), {{more similar to}} a <b>red</b> <b>Lechwe</b> than an elk. Miyazaki did not want Ashitaka to be a typical hero, saying {{that he is a}} [...] "melancholic boy who has a fate" [...] and also stated that Ashitaka's curse [...] "is similar to the lives of people the time". Ashitaka's English voice actor Billy Crudup stated that he liked Ashitaka as [...] "an unexpected hero. He’s not your usual wild, brave guy. He’s really just a young, earnest man who’s trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2003 African Parks (Zambia) assumed {{responsibility}} for the park, undertaking an aggressive approach to reestablishing native wildlife populations and relocating extinct species. The most notable {{example of this is}} the astonishing increase in blue wildebeest (Connochaetus taurinus) numbers from approximately 15,000 animals in 2003 to almost 43,000 individuals in 2011. Other species that have shown clear increases in population numbers are Grant's zebra (Equus quagga boehmi), from some 2,800 in 2005 to around 4,500 in 2011, and <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> (Kobus leche) which increased from a counted 966 in 2005 to a counted 1,272 in 2011. Tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus) doubled in number between 2007 and 2011 with the current count at 872 individuals.|$|E
50|$|The Moremi Game Reserve, {{although}} {{not one of}} the largest parks, presents insights and views even for the most experienced of travelers. It is home to nearly 500 species of bird (from water birds to forest dwellers), and a vast array of other species of wildlife including Cape buffalo, Angolan giraffe, black rhinoceros, Southwest African lion, elephant, hippopotamus, zebra, South African cheetah, hyena, jackal, impala, and <b>red</b> <b>lechwe.</b> Cape wild dogs (Lycaon pictus pictus) inhabit this reserve and {{has been the subject of}} a project run in the area since 1989; thus this species is often seen wearing collars emplaced by researchers. The Moremi area contains one of the most significant extant habitat areas for L. pictus.|$|E
5000|$|The Linyanti Marsh, {{located at}} the Northwest corner {{of the park and}} to the North of Savuti, is {{adjacent}} to Linyanti River. To the west of this area lies Selinda Reserve and on the northern bank of Kwando River is Namibia's Nkasa Rupara National Park. Around these 2 rivers are riverine woodlands, open woodlands as well as lagoons, {{and the rest of the}} region mainly consists of flood plains. There are here large concentrations of lion, leopard, African wild dog, roan antelope, sable antelope, a hippopotamus pod and enormous herds of elephants. The rarer <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> sitatunga and a bask of crocodiles also occur in the area. Bird life is very rich here.|$|E
50|$|Kafue has {{a superb}} range of antelopes {{as well as}} large herds of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> and puku, with smaller groups of zebras and blue {{wildebeest}} in the Busanga Plains around June, when it starts to dry out. Across the northern half of the park, there's a good range of mixed bush environments. Kudus, bushbucks, elands, reedbucks, duikers, grysboks and defassa waterbucks are all frequently seen in Kafue. Lions are relatively widespread all over the park, but the larger males are increasingly uncommon, with inevitable consequences for numbers as a whole. Prides stalk through nervous herds of pukus and lechwes nightly, using the natural drainage ditches for cover with deadly efficiency on the Busanga Plains. The Kafue River and its tributaries themselves are a hive of activity and home to pods of hippopotami {{and a few of}} the largest crocodiles in southern Africa. Elephants are commonly seen particularly along the Kafue River and around Lake Itezhi-tezhi. Leopards remain very common throughout the main forested areas of this park, though they are seldom seen on the open plains. Spotted hyenas are seen regularly, though not often, throughout the park. Cheetahs are not common anywhere, but they are most frequently seen in the north of this park, where they seem to be thriving. Occasional sightings of Cape wild dogs occur all over the park which is one of Zambia's best strongholds for them.|$|E
40|$|A {{ground survey}} of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> {{was carried out}} in the Linyanti swamps and the Chobe {{floodplains}} of northern Botswana in the dry and wet seasons of 2012 and 2013, respectively. We documented numbers, sex ratio and age structure of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> within the linear strips of 25 km × 300 m along the Linyanti swamps and the Chobe floodplains. Results indicated {{a significant difference in the}} numbers of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> between sites and seasons. About 66 and 755 <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> were estimated for Chobe in the dry and wet season, respectively, with 343 and 261 of them estimated for Linyanti in the dry and wet season, respectively. In Chobe, the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> densities varied widely between seasons (9 red lechwe/km 2 – 101 red lechwe/km 2) compared with Linyanti, where the densities did not vary much between seasons (35 red lechwe/km 2 – 46 red lechwe/km 2). The lower densities of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> in Chobe in the dry season when compared with the wet season suggest a possible seasonal shift in the distribution of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> to the nearby Zambezi floodplains in Namibia. Conservation implications: The higher number of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> in the Chobe floodplains in the wet season indicates the potential of the floodplains as a habitat for this species in that season. The dry season shift in the distribution of <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> in Chobe presents an opportunity for local communities in Namibia to engage in tourism, whereas the return of the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> to the floodplains in the wet season ensures protection of the animals as well as boosts the tourism potential of the Chobe National Park. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>lechwe</b> Kobus leche leche Gray, 1850 (n = 3), black lechwe K. l. smithermani Lydekker, 1900 (n = 10) and Kafue lechwe K. l. kafuensis Haltenorth, 1963 (n = 19) from Zambia were {{examined}} for genetic variability and differentiation at 30 presumptive structural loci using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. Values of polymorphism (P = 10. 0 - 16. 7 %) and average heterozygosity (H = 6. 3 - 7. 9 %) were {{within the range}} commonly found in ungulates. Genetic variability was lowest in the <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> which {{may be due to}} a genetic bottleneck the Zambia population experienced some 50 years ago. Relative (F ST = 21 %) and absolute (Nei's 1978, D = 0. 020 - 0. 023) genetic differentiation were in accordance with the subspecies status proposed for <b>red</b> <b>lechwe,</b> black lechwe, and Kafue lechwe on the basis of morphological characters...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease of global importance infecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Little {{is known about}} the epidemiology and persistence of brucellosis in wildlife in Southern Africa, particularly in Botswana. Archived wildlife samples from Botswana (1995 - 2000) were screened with the Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) and included the African buffalo (247), bushbuck (1), eland (5), elephant (25), gemsbok (1), giraffe (9), hartebeest (12), impala (171), kudu (27), <b>red</b> <b>lechwe</b> (10), reedbuck (1), rhino (2), springbok (5), steenbok (2), warthog (24), waterbuck (1), wildebeest (33), honey badger (1), lion (43), and zebra (21). Human case data were extracted from government annual health reports (1974 - 2006). Only buffalo (6 %, 95 % CI 3. 04 %- 8. 96 %) and giraffe (11 %, 95 % CI 0 - 38. 43 %) were confirmed seropositive on both tests. Seropositive buffalo were widely distributed across the buffalo range where cattle density was low. Human infections were reported in low numbers with most infections (46 %) occurring in children (< 14 years old) and no cases were reported among people working in the agricultural sector. Low seroprevalence of brucellosis in Botswana buffalo in a previous study in 1974 and again in this survey suggests an endemic status of the disease in this species. Buffalo, a preferred source of bush meat, is utilized both legally and illegally in Botswana. Household meat processing practices can provide widespread pathogen exposure risk to family members and the community, identifying an important source of zoonotic pathogen transmission potential. Although brucellosis may be controlled in livestock populations, public health officials need to be alert to the possibility of human infections arising from the use of bush meat. This study illustrates the need for a unified approach in infectious disease research that includes consideration of both domestic and wildlife sources of infection in determining public health risks from {{zoonotic disease}} invasions...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-five museum {{specimens}} {{collected in}} 1926 and 1947 - 48 vouch for the distinctiveness of an undescribed large mammal, {{a form of}} lechwe antelope. Their preservation has allowed comparative analyses of morphological characters to reveal this new species, the Upemba lechwe Kobus anselli sp. nov. It is most similar to the black lechwe K. smithemani and quite distinct from all other known taxa, including topotypical red lechwes K. leche. Prevailing threats and conservation concerns underwrite its formal description after neglect by science for decades. This lechwe is restricted to the Upemba wetlands, Kamalondo depression, south-east Congo basin (Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of Congo), and has declined greatly since the 1970 s. Commercial poaching through the 1980 s reduced c. 20 000 individuals to under 1000 estimated today. Recognition of K. anselli as a distinct evolutionary entity was previously ignored, because the entrenched taxonomy assumed {{it was just another}} <b>red</b> <b>lechwe.</b> Its speciation seems to be recent, probably Pleistocene. Lechwes evolved in an archipelago of wetlands formed through vicariance of a more extensive drainage system, the Palaeo-Chambeshi, which extended from Katanga and north-east Zambia across the south-central African plateau, into the Kalahari basin. The Palaeo-Chambeshi was a major endoreic tributary of Palaeo-Lake Makgadikgadi. Its fragmentation isolated lechwes in the Kamalondo depression from wetlands in the Upper Zambezi-Okavango, Upper Kafue, and the Chambeshi and Luapula drainages. The belated discovery of K. anselli emphasizes the region's conservation significance. Because of its high species richness and high endemism, Katanga is a biodiversity hotspot within the encompassing Katanga-Chambeshi region, also covering eastern Angola and much of Zambia. A secure future for the critically endangered Upemba lechwe hinges on reducing adverse human impact and maintaining the integrity of its wetland habitat. Support for protected areas is critical. Maintenance of ecological processes, focused on aquatic systems, is especially important to conserve biodiversity. Recognition of the complex evolutionary history of the region (since the Late Neogene) underpins the scientific foundation for all conservation plans and activities. It prescribes why a regional conservation strategy should encompass the landscape mosaic, structured across neighbouring drainage systems (Lufira, Upper Lualaba and Chambeshi-Luapula rivers). A trans-frontier conservation area will consolidate the protected areas and land use systems of the region in an ecological context. Articl...|$|E
