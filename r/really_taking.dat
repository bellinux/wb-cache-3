500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out, and did well, and will do better next time. I am sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> part in the war. I trust they will come to no harm." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Pine, Urban said {{of taking}} on the role that [...] "it {{is a case of}} not doing some sort of {{facsimile}} or carbon copy, but <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> the very essence of what DeForest Kelley has done and honoring that and bringing something new to the table". Urban has been a fan of the show since he was seven years old and actively pursued the role after rediscovering the series on DVD with his son. Urban was cast at his first audition, which was two months after his initial meeting with Abrams. He said he was happy to play a role with lots of comedy, something he had not done since The Price of Milk, because he was tired of action-oriented roles. When asked why McCoy is so cantankerous, Urban joked the character might be a [...] "little bipolar actually!" [...] Orci and Kurtzman had collaborated with Urban on , in which he played Cupid and Caesar.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} more positive and uplifting lyrics {{in comparison with}} Green Day's earlier work. Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason why I was <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E
500|$|... "The Monkey Suit" [...] is {{an episode}} that tackles the creation–evolution controversy, and {{according}} to Theresa Sanders in her book Approaching Eden: Adam and Eve in Popular Culture, [...] "skewered antievolution legislation." [...] The authors of the book Chronology of the Evolution-Creationism Controversy commented that the episode [...] "caricatures creationism as an intellectual joke." [...] Burns has cited the episode as [...] "a nice example of The Simpsons <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> one clear side". However, as pointed out by Sanders, it [...] "should {{be pointed out that}} though the Simpsons episode clearly sides with Darwin, evolutionists come in for criticism as well. When Ned and his sons go into the museum's Hall of Man, one of the exhibits they see in support of evolution is a collection of dinosaur bones with the title 'Indisputable Fossil Records.' The cartoon's inclusion of the sign can be interpreted as mocking the pretension that science knows all and may not be questioned." [...] Sanders cited another scene as an example of this; at the trial, Drummond asks Professor Frink if [...] "this theory of evolution necessarily mean that there is no God?", to which he replies, [...] "No, of course not. It just says that God is an impotent nothing from nowhere with less power than the undersecretary of Agriculture." [...] Sanders wrote that [...] "His arrogance is clear, and equally clear is the show's satirical presentation of science's hubris." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E

2500|$|British critic Sir Christopher Frayling {{identifies}} three principal {{sources for}} A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "Partly derived from Kurosawa's samurai film Yojimbo, partly from Dashiell Hammett's novel Red Harvest (1929), {{but most of}} all from Carlo Goldoni's eighteenth-century play Servant of Two Masters." [...] Leone has cited these alternate sources in his defense. He claims a thematic debt, for both Fistful and Yojimbo, to Carlo Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters—the basic premise of the protagonist playing two camps against each other. Leone asserted that this rooted the origination of Fistful/Yojimbo in European, and specifically Italian, culture. The Servant of Two Masters plot can also be seen in Hammett's detective novel Red Harvest. The Continental Op hero of the novel is, significantly, a man without a name. Leone himself believed that Red Harvest had influenced Yojimbo: [...] "Kurosawa's Yojimbo was inspired by an American novel of the serie-noire so I was <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> the story back home again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Berlin", set {{later in}} the season, {{features}} Tony and Ziva departing for Germany to track down Ilan Bodnar, her father's killer. Before the episode aired, Glasberg disclosed that they would share a slow dance while there, resulting in [...] "a very personal moment of vulnerability where her guard goes down and she lets herself melt into his arms". De Pablo added, [...] "You also see [...] as a man Teddy Bear — like, a very sweet but manly man, a guy who's <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> care of a situation and really wants to make it better, a guy who's not looking for the joke or is uncomfortable staring at a woman or reaching out to hold her hand." [...] This is highlighted in the closing scenes {{as the two of}} them drive home from the airport, and Ziva explains her animosity towards Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), the new director of Mossad: Elbaz was the reason her parents split up. She tells Tony, [...] "If it were not for Orli, things would be different. I would be a different person." [...] Tony then takes her hand, and Ziva intertwines their fingers together. Tony replies, [...] "Then I should catch her before she leaves, you know, and thank her." [...] The episode ends with a cliffhanger when an unknown vehicle crashes into them, leaving their fates unknown.|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's <b>really</b> <b>taking</b> a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E
