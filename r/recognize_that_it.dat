5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

The effort to build one world {{requires}} a closer understanding among {{the peoples of the}} world and their cultures. This translation of the Dhammapada... is offered as a small contribution to world understanding.

From 1968 to 1978 he was employed supporting the government in Gabon and was available to carry out military actions on behalf of the French government in Africa. He may have been involved in a raid against Guinea in 1970. He was involved in a failed coup attempt in Benin (Opération Crevette, or Operation Shrimp), against Mathieu Kérékou, the leader of the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin, in 1977. Although Jacques Foccart denied knowledge of the attempted coup after its failure, he did <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been backed-up by Gnassingbé Eyadéma (Togo), Houphouet-Boigny (Ivory Coast), Omar Bongo (Gabon) and Hassan II (Morocco), all allies of France.|$|E

[...] Oswald Doughty states that the [...] "most important additions" [...] to Coleridge's 1797 edition of poems included Reflections. Richard Holmes points out that both Reflections and The Eolian Harp [...] "mark a new stage in Coleridge's exploration of the sacred relations between man and nature, which gradually become more serious and impassioned as they carry increasingly theological implications behind his Romanticism." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} this period that Rubinstein drew his {{greatest}} success as a composer, beginning with his Fourth Piano Concerto in 1864 and culminating with his opera The Demon in 1871. Between these two works are the orchestral works Don Quixote, which Tchaikovsky found [...] "interesting and well done," [...] though [...] "episodic," [...] and the opera Ivan IV Grozniy, which was premiered by Balakirev. Borodin commented on Ivan IV that [...] "the music is good, you just cannot <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Rubinstein.

2500|$|A similar {{proposal}} by those advocating this diet suggests that cancer grows in an acidic environment, {{and that a}} proper alkaline diet can change {{the environment of the}} body to treat cancer. [...] This proposal ignores the fact that while cancer tissue does grow in an acidic environment, it is the cancer that creates the acidity. The rapid growth of cancer cells creates the acidic environment; the acidic environment does not create cancer. [...] The proposal also neglects to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "virtually impossible" [...] to create a less acidic environment in the body. [...] "Extreme" [...] dietary plans such as this diet have more risks than benefits for patients with cancer.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I have to <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E
