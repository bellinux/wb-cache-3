40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to measure the relative importance of fish foreign trade in the Saudi economy and to estimate the present and <b>targeted</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fish exports and imports. To achieve these objectives, the study relied on descriptive and econometric analysis. Specifically, the study has used the following indices: the coverage rate of exports on imports, and the partial adjustment model. The results of the study indicated that: The average value of fish imports exceeded the estimated fish exports and the average deficit of fish commercial balance reached 299. 08 million riyals during the period 1985 - 2003. The average coverage rate of exports on imports reached about 4 % which is low rate as the kingdom still exports little quantities of fish that represents about 4. 67 % of fish production during the study period. The fish foreign trade {{does not appear to be}} to the benefit of the kingdom because of the low gross and net terms of trade as their averages reached 96. 22 % and 98. 58 % respectively, during the study period. There was a relative divergence between the actual and the <b>targeted</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fish exports and imports. The actual fish exports achieved abort 90. 79 % <b>of</b> the <b>targeted</b> <b>levels</b> while the actual fish imports achieved about 96. 23 % <b>of</b> the <b>targeted</b> <b>levels,</b> during the study period. The <b>targeted</b> quantity <b>of</b> fish exports is expected to increase from 5. 69 thousands tons in 2006 to about 10. 36 thousands tons in 2015, while the targeted fish imports is expected to increase from 108. 52 thousands tons in 2006 to 163. 39 thousands tons in 2015, and accordingly the coverage rate <b>of</b> <b>targeted</b> fish exports on targeted fish imports is expected to increase from 5. 24 % in 2006 to about 6. 34 % in 2015.

A large, but unquantified amount, is taken by recreational crabbers. Ecologically, blue crab is an important benthic predator. In turn, it is prey for several predatory fish. Sound management of this resource to insure a sustainable population is critical. It is important to establish targets to protect the resource and judge the efficacy of management actions.

40|$|Bayesian {{adaptive}} {{methods have}} been extensively used in psychophysics to estimate {{the point at which}} performance on a task attains arbitrary percentage levels, although the statistical properties of these estimators have never been assessed. We used simulation techniques to determine the small-sample properties of Bayesian estimators of arbitrary performance points, specifically addressing the issues of bias and precision as a function <b>of</b> the <b>target</b> percentage <b>level.</b> The study covered three major types of psychophysical task (yes-no detection, 2 AFC discrimination and 2 AFC detection) and explored the entire range <b>of</b> <b>target</b> performance <b>levels</b> allowed for by each task. Other factors included in the study were the form and parameters of the actual psychometric function Psi, the form and parameters of the model function M assumed in the Bayesian method, and the location of Psi within the parameter space. Our results indicate that Bayesian adaptive methods render unbiased estimators of any arbitrary point on psi only when M=Psi, and otherwise they yield bias whose magnitude can be considerable as the <b>target</b> <b>level</b> moves away from the midpoint of the range of Psi. The standard error of the estimator also increases as the <b>target</b> <b>level</b> approaches extreme values whether or not M=Psi. Contrary to widespread belief, neither the performance level at which bias is null nor that at which standard error is minimal can be predicted by the sweat factor.

This study examined two potentially important attentional variables in change blindness: spatial distribution, manipulated via set size, and detail level, varied by having the change at either the global or local level of a compound letter. Experiment 1 revealed that both types of change were equally detectable in a single item, but that global change was detected more readily when attention was distributed among several items. Variation <b>of</b> <b>target</b> <b>level</b> probability in Experiment 2 showed further that observers could flexibly set the detail level in monitoring both single and multiple items. Sensitivity to change therefore depends not only on the spatial focus of attention; it depends critically on the match between the detail level of the change and the level-readiness of the observer. 1...|$|R

Material and methods. 40 patients (aged 52. 7 ± 9. 4 years old) were included into the study after 10 - 14 days of the acute Q-MI onset. Determination of blood lipids profile, alanine and asparagine transaminase levels was included into the initial examination. Rosuvastatin in a fixed dose of 20 mg/day was prescribed to the patients {{as a part of}} the standard therapy. Depending on the dynamics of the investigated parameters the individual doses of rosuvastatin were adjusted from 10 to 40 mg/day after 1 month of therapy. Final evaluation of blood lipids profile and transaminase levels was performed in the next 2 months of therapy. Results.
