In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography they really had to slap each other. We had to change the styling to hide all the bruises, particularly on the thighs.|$|E
500|$|After the band's movie {{debut in}} Roger Corman's Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), renowned {{producer}} Phil Spector {{became interested in}} the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century. During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff. Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: [...] "End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones." [...] This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, [...] Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> tremendously. 'Rock 'N' Roll Radio' is really good. For the harder stuff, it didn't work as well." [...] The string-laden Ronettes cover [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] released as a single, became the band's biggest hit in Great Britain, reaching number8 on the charts.|$|E
500|$|I {{loved the}} play; I saw its {{original}} production when I {{was a teenager}} so I <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> hard on it and tried to dispel any prejudices that might be there. I'm sensitive {{about the idea of}} a singer-turned-actress, it could give across the impression that a celebrity gets bored and goes [...] "hey, what'll I do" [...] and that's really not where I'm coming from, I'm very passionate about this and I have been for a lot of years.|$|E

500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> hard {{to make it a}} special show, because I thought it was special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen."

500|$|Though as a {{minor league}} prospect, analysts derided his {{defensive}} potential, with one calling him [...] "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it.

I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> out perfectly." ...|$|E

During the filming of [...] "Prometheus Unbound", people on set responded [...] "very well" [...] to the chemistry between Vala and Daniel. Director Andy Mikita called executive producer Robert C. Cooper during the first lunch break {{and told him to}} [...] "hire this gal", and Cooper thought Vala/Black [...] "was absolutely wonderful. The character <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> out." [...] Writer Damian Kindler [...] "really loved" [...] what Black brought to the show, believing that [...] "her character, when used properly, is just absolutely wonderful grist for the mill on SG-1."

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club complimented the episode's {{opening scene}} for {{providing}} a succinct synopsis {{of the season}} to new viewers {{who may have been}} newly discovering the series after watching its lead-in, American Idol. Though he graded the episode with an A-, Murray did however critique its climatic scene for being [...] "clumsily paced and staged". Murray mainly found positive aspects with the episode, explaining, [...] "For a show that started out being a fairly dour procedural with wacky mad-scientist elements, Fringe has <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> its way into that fantasy/sci-fi sweet-spot, where its own forward momentum makes the ridiculous look likely and arcane mythology seem well-worth the time to sort through and analyze." [...] Other highlights Murray found was Noble's performance, which he considered his [...] "finest moment in the series to date," [...] and Olivia's visions of the other universe.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{development}} stages of Within the Woods, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were long time {{friends who had}} grown up with each other. The duo had produced several low-budget films with super 8 mm film during their youth. During the early parts of Raimi's career, he directed films that were mostly classified as comedies, such as Booby Bartenders, Shemp Eats the Moon and The Great Bogus Monkey Pignut Swindle. While those films were described as [...] "goofy" [...] and primitive by members of the cast and crew, Raimi eventually produced the short film It's Murder!, which featured mostly comedic moments. One of the sequences of the film involved a suspenseful moment where a criminal jumped on an unsuspecting individual. Raimi later dismissed the short film, but complimented that scene, stating that it was [...] "the only part of It's Murder! that <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> well.|$|E

It was a great start and I managed to defend in {{the first couple of}} corners and then I really just tried to push flat out this time. I was really happy with the car and happy to see the gap open up to Lewis, so it <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> out perfectly today." [...] Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton conceded that his teammate had done a [...] "fantastic job," [...] stating that [...] "t the end of the day, he was quicker during the race." [...] Speaking about his start at the post-race press conference, Hamilton explained that his car suffered from a lot of wheelspin, which made him get off the line slowly. Meanwhile, third placed Felipe Massa told the press that his team had [...] "managed to get the opportunities, which it was a mistake of another team," [...] adding that the changes made to the car were [...] "definitely positive." ...|$|E
500|$|Buzz Byrne from Critics rant called Taub, [...] "interesting". James Chamberlin of IGN did {{not think}} that the black and white {{documentary}} <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> for him, and when it was over he didn't feel like he had just watched an episode of House. Chamberlin graded the episode with a 7.7. Michelle Romero, of Entertainment Weekly commented [...] "I loved it when House told his crew that she Dr. Terzi got the gig because she had more experience than the swimsuit model". Television without Pity graded the episode with a B- (out of 84 votes). According to Glen L. Diaz, of BuddyTV, various fans think that the smile on Cuddy's face {{at the end of the}} episode explains everything about how she thinks of House. Peter Jacobson submitted the episode for a Primetime Emmy Award on his behalf in the category Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Sean Whitesell submitted the episode on his behalf in the category Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Neither nomination came through.|$|E

He went into a studio with only three tracks for the mix, and was {{impressed}} {{that there were many}} technicians and programmers that probably had been using a hundred. However, the singer was protecting the idea of the raw version, and said: [...] "This is how we wanted to be". They added two changes to the song and then {{spent the rest of the}} day recording Björk's vocals. They wanted to have only one take that <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> so that they did not have to edit different takes. They recorded 20 takes, and used the fifth or sixth, and because of that, the producer thought that [...] "this track is very intimate and personal because of the way the vocals were recorded". The way the song was recorded was [...] "kind of rough" [...] according to Knak; [...] "It's also very close to the mic; all these things that you wouldn't normally keep. In that sense, it is very kind of, almost naked. In the structure and in the feeling because of the lyrics".|$|E

Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders.

[...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the episode and the {{character}} of Patrick began when Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff {{and asked if he}} could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show, so the producers came up with the character of Patrick for Downey. Show producer Seth MacFarlane believes Downey [...] "did a great job," [...] and brought a [...] "very kind of half crazy, and maybe just eccentric personality to that character that <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> out great." [...] When Patrick makes his second appearance in season 10's [...] "Killer Queen", he is not voiced by Downey. Instead, he is voiced by Family Guy writer, and recurring guest voice actor, Danny Smith. Bob Barker voiced himself presenting The Price Is Right; but the actual sequence took years to make. Barker has provided his voice for the show twice, although MacFarlane has never met him. John Veiner voiced Bobby McFerrin falling down a flight of stairs. The ball-in-a-cup scene is commented upon by MacFarlane, where he states that [...] "the voice-overs work, the drawings work" [...] and that Walter Murphy [...] "did a great job of creating a piece of deliberately annoying music." [...] Several jokes had been pitched for Peter's words after killing an evil dragon, but all were dropped, as they weren't deemed funny enough by production staff.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics; many were {{more critical of}} the episode than [...] "Christmas Carol". Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote {{that he did not}} [...] "totally buy “Emily” [...] even though I like large portions of" [...] the episode. VanDerWerff wrote positively of [...] "most of the Scully scenes", noting that Anderson [...] "found some of the raw sense of hope and loss" [...] that the shots required. However, he was critical of the episode's plot, arguing that it only [...] "goes through the motions" [...] and [...] "is about everybody getting <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> up over a little girl we’ve just met." [...] He concluded that [...] "two-parter is strongest when it grabs hold of this notion. But it’s at its weakest when it turns into just another episode of The X-Files." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode was not as strong as the previous installment, largely due to the shift from in-depth character exploration to a rehashing of earlier elements of the mythology. Emily is a good plot device in terms of personalizing the conspiracy’s depredations just a bit more, but at times, it seems like the writers are victimizing Scully a bit more than necessary. Unlike the later mythology episodes, however, this one manages to avoid any unnecessary new elements." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "We had so many Houston legends all together in that video, and they all <b>really</b> <b>worked</b> hard to let us capture Houston properly.
