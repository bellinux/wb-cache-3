40|$|The rub {{mechanics}} of aircraft {{gas turbine engine}} compressor abradable blade tip seals was studied at simulated engine conditions. In 12 statistically planned, instrumented rub tests using single titanium blades and fiber-metal rubstrips the rub velocity, incursion rate, incursion depth, blade thickness, and abradable strength were varied {{to determine the effects}} on rub energy, heat split between the blade, <b>rubstrip</b> surface and rub debris, and blade and seal wear. The rub energies were found to be most significantly affected by the incursion rate while rub velocity and blade thickness were of secondary importance. In five additional rub tests using single nickel alloy blades and multiple titanium alloy blades, rub energy and wear effects were found to be similar for titanium and nickel alloy blades while rub energies increased for multiple blades relative to single blade test results...|$|E
40|$|The rub {{mechanics}} of compressor abradable blade tip seals at simulated engine conditions were investigated. Twelve statistically planned, instrumented rub {{tests were conducted}} with titanium blades and Feltmetal fibermetal rubstrips. The tests were conducted with single stationary blades rubbing against seal material bonded to rotating test disks. The instantaneous rub torque, speed, incursion rate and blade temperatures were continuously measured and recorded. Basic rub parameters (incursion rate, rub depth, abradable density, blade thickness and rub velocity) were varied {{to determine the effects}} on rub energy and heat split between the blade, <b>rubstrip</b> surface and rub debris. The test data was reduced, energies were determined and statistical analyses were completed to determine the primary and interactive effects. Wear surface morphology, profile measurements and metallographic analysis were used to determine wear, glazing, melting and material transfer. The rub energies for these tests were most significantly affected by the incursion rate while rub velocity and blade thickness were of secondary importance. The ratios of blade wear to seal wear were representative of those experienced in engine operation of these seal system materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the NASA Glenn Research Center anechoic 9 - by 15 -Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel to investigate two new advanced noise reduction technologies {{in support of the}} NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program Subsonic Fixed Wing Project. The goal of the experiment was to demonstrate the noise reduction potential and effect on fan model performance of the two noise reduction technologies in a scale model Ultra-High Bypass turbofan at simulated takeoff and approach aircraft flight speeds. The two novel noise reduction technologies are called Over-the-Rotor acoustic treatment and Soft Vanes. Both technologies were aimed at modifying the local noise source mechanisms of the fan tip vortex/fan case interaction and the rotor wake-stator interaction. For the Over-the-Rotor acoustic treatment, two noise reduction configurations were investigated. The results showed that the two noise reduction technologies, Over-the-Rotor and Soft Vanes, were able to reduce the noise level of the fan model, but the Over-the-Rotor configurations had a significant negative impact on the fan aerodynamic performance; the loss in fan aerodynamic efficiency was between 2. 75 to 8. 75 percent, depending on configuration, compared to the conventional solid baseline fan case <b>rubstrip</b> also tested. Performance results with the Soft Vanes showed that there was no measurable change in the corrected fan thrust and a 1. 8 percent loss in corrected stator vane thrust, which resulted in a total net thrust loss of approximately 0. 5 percent compared with the baseline reference stator vane set...|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, {{the three}} [...] "AXI" [...] cars had further {{modifications}} to the amber front door lights, which were exchanged for clear lenses of the same style. Perhaps the most significant alteration on the [...] "AXI" [...] cars is the deletion of {{the front and rear}} side markers. These are replaced by a single small round European style indicator side repeater, situated on the front wing (fender). The body <b>rubstrips</b> are also of a different configuration in order to cover the areas which would otherwise have had federal side marker lenses fitted.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, the bumpers were updated, and the matte {{finished}} surfaces {{were eliminated}} {{for a more}} uniform surface. <b>Rubstripping</b> was increased to 2-inch height w/ scribe detailing. The honeycomb radiator grille was replaced with a slatted version that spanned the entire front end (previous was shorter), and cornerlights were shortened. The [...] "SE" [...] model and the Turbo (Canada, Europe) came with new fiberglass ground effects and mudflaps, painted in {{the color of the}} car, and a new and more pronounced lower deflection lip in the front. All Mark II S12's received a new reverse-cowl hood bulge design to accommodate clearance for the 3.0L V6. Optional rear mudflap accents were available.|$|R
2500|$|The second batch were {{registered}} {{and used by}} the factory in Northern Ireland, with registration numbers (license plates), AXI 1697, AXI 1698, AXI 1699 and are referred to by enthusiasts as the [...] "AXI cars". These three cars (VINs 5565, 5592 and 5638) differ from the first Wooler-Hodec cars in several ways. These three cars all had roof mounted radio antennas, indicator repeater lights, no side marker lights, white forward-facing door lights, fog-light switch, and textured body <b>rubstrips</b> on the stainless panels. No catalytic converters or Lambda equipment were fitted as British legislation did not require them. VIN 5565 with the registration number AXI 1697 was a fully UK homologated example {{which would have been}} shown at the British motor show at Birmingham, UK in October 1982. It includes a unique rearward-facing twin exhaust, no catalytic converters and the UK specification engine as used by Volvo, but retaining the usual Renault ancillaries. The transmission final drive was also set at 3.88:1 versus the standard 3.44:1. Attention was paid to other unique details such as correctly offset wing mirrors.|$|R
5000|$|The first trim of the S12 chassis. Bumpers {{featured}} matte-finish raised surfaces, {{and sides}} featured half-inch <b>rubstripping.</b> Cars featured a honeycomb radiator grille, and long corner lights. The RS-X trim in Japan and Europe received a hood bulge accent {{to accommodate the}} oversized dimensions of the FJ20E/ET engine, and featured a faux front vent with monogram (either FJ20, DOHC, or TURBO); In North America, the 1984 Turbo came with a [...] "TURBO" [...] monogrammed hood bulge accent, although all subsequent North American Mark I hoods were flat regardless of trim. In some markets, the 1984 and 85 could be had with a foam rubber deck spoiler. In 1986 the foam rubber deck spoiler was changed for a fiberglass version with an integrated third brake light. Some hatchbacks and all Turbo models came with ground effects, as did the RS-X coupes These had¬ù a combination of plastic mudflaps (monogrammed as either [...] "NISSAN", or [...] "SILVIA" [...] in applicable markets) and accommodating foam rubber sideskirts, {{as well as a}} foam rubber lower deflection lip. 1984 year foam rubber sideskirts featured the [...] "NISSAN" [...] monogram.|$|R
