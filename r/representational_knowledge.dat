Goldman-Rakic spoke of how this <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge</b> was used to intelligently guide thought, action and emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, distractions, actions, and feelings. In this way, working memory can be seen as fundamental to attention and behavioral inhibition. Fuster speaks of how this prefrontal ability allows the wedding of past to future, allowing both cross-temporal and cross-modal associations in the creation of goal-directed, perception-action cycles. This ability to represent underlies all other higher executive functions.|$|E

On the one hand Al-Farabi believes that Aristotle rejected Plato's Forms, but Aristotle himself, on the other hand, had difficulty with divine forms. Avicenna developed the notion of knowledge by presence in the argument of the floating man. According to this argument, if we consider the I-ness of a human in absolutely empty air, then the only thing to conceive is the selfness of a human without any material faculties. On one hand Surevardi criticized Avicenna's theory of knowledge which is based on the important roles of definitions. On the other hand Suhrevardi introduced innate knowledge in which awareness and consciousness are basic. According to Suhrevardi,k nowledge by presence encompasses the conception of a thing, which is along with assent to it. According to Suhrevardi's theory of knowledge, the true knowledge is achieved not by concepts but through a direct knowledge of things divine. Illuminationist philosophers know the knowledge of two kinds, of which knowledge by presence is one of them. Knowledge by presence is of a nonrepresentational, immediate character along with no reference to external objects. According to Suhrevardi, the [...] "self" [...] could know itself just by virtue of its presence. It also knows consciousness beyond the distinction of the subject and object division in epistemology. According to Suhrevardi, it is also described by self-objectivity, namely the nature of this knowledge is to the reality of awareness and in this knowledge the self is aware it is existentially one and the same thing. Therefore, the self and consciousness of the self are individually and numerically one thing. Surevardi also pointed out that all knowledge is returned to knowledge by presence. In other words in <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge</b> the presence of an image in the mind in turn is a kind of knowledge by presence.|$|E

Recently, evidence has suggested that DN activation may be associated with better cognitive control when access to stored <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a putative DN function, is congruent with task goals (Spreng et al., 2014). Near-ceiling behavioral performance in this earlier study precluded analysis of incorrect trials. We address this limitation by increasing cognitive control demands.

Famous and anonymous face stimuli were used to contrast high versus low access to stored <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> respectively. Differential DN activation was observed during correct and incorrect trials when famous faces were goal-relevant, or distractors. These results provide further evidence that the DN is not a task negative network, but can support cognitive control when access to stored representations is goal-congruent...|$|E

40|$|SummarySpatial {{working memory}} (WM; i. e., “scratchpad” memory) is {{constantly}} updated to guide behavior based on <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge</b> of spatial position. It is maintained by spatially tuned, recurrent excitation within networks of prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons, evident during delay periods in WM tasks. Stimulation of postsynaptic α 2 A adrenoceptors (α 2 A-ARs) {{is critical for}} WM. We report that α 2 A-AR stimulation strengthens WM through inhibition of cAMP, closing Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and strengthening the functional connectivity of PFC networks. Ultrastructurally, HCN channels and α 2 A-ARs were colocalized in dendritic spines in PFC. In electrophysiological studies, either α 2 A-AR stimulation, cAMP inhibition or HCN channel blockade enhanced spatially tuned delay-related firing of PFC neurons. Conversely, delay-related network firing collapsed under conditions of excessive cAMP. In behavioral studies, either blockade or knockdown of HCN 1 channels in PFC improved WM performance. These data reveal a powerful mechanism for rapidly altering the strength of WM networks in PFC...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing {{the nature}} of {{linguistic}} representations and how they emerge during early development is a central goal in the cognitive science of language. One area in which this development plays out is in the acquisition of dependencies—relationships between co-occurring elements in a word, phrase, or sentence. These dependencies often involve multiple levels of representation and abstraction, built up as infants gain experience with their native language. The authors used the Headturn Preference Procedure to systematically investigate the early acquisition of 1 such dependency, the agreement between a subject and verb in French, at 6 different ages between 14 and 24 months. The results reveal a complex developmental trajectory that provides the first evidence that infants might indeed progress through distinct stages in the acquisition of this nonadjacent dependency.

This position focuses on the creation of self-organising entities, emergent processes, living organisms or new species that (seem to) carry an intrinsic momentum of rest and dynamics in themselves, such as synthesised proteins, nano-bots or artificial life (cp.

40|$|The core {{notion of}} modern Universal Grammar is that {{language}} ability requires abstract representation {{in terms of}} hierarchy, movement operations, abstract features on words, and fixed mapping to meaning. These mental structures are a step toward integrating <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge</b> of all kinds into a larger model of cognitive psychology. Examining first and second language at once provides clues as to how abstractly we should represent this knowledge. The abstract nature of grammar allows both the formulation of many grammars {{and the possibility that}} a rule of one grammar could apply to another grammar. We argue that every language contains Multiple Grammars which may reflect different language families. We develop numerous examples of how the same abstract rules can apply in various languages and develop a theory of how language modules (case-marking, topicalization, and quantification) interact to predict L 2 acquisition paths. In particular we show in depth how Germanic Verb-second operations, based on Verb-final structure, can apply in English. The argument is built around how and where V 2 from German can apply in English, seeking to explain the crucial contrast: “nothing”yelled out Bill/*“nothing” yelled Bill out in terms of the necessary abstractness of the V 2 rule...|$|E
40|$|Integration/differentiation {{of mental}} {{processes}} is major mechanism of development. Developmental theories ascribe intellectual development to it. In psychometric theory, Spearman’s law of diminishing returns postulates that increasing g allows increasing differentiation of cognitive abilities, because increased mental power allows variable investment in domain-specific learning. Empirical {{evidence has been}} inconsistent so far, with some studies supporting and others contradicting this mechanism. This state of affairs {{is due to a}} developmental phenomenon: Both differentiation and strengthening of relations between specific processes and g may happen but these changes are phase-specific and ability-specific, depending upon the developmental priorities in the formation of g in each phase. We present eight studies covering the age span from 4 to 85 years in support of this phenomenon. Using new powerful modeling methods we showed that differentiation and binding of mental processes in g occurs in cycles. Specific processes intertwine with g at the beginning of cycles when they are integrated into it; when well established, these processes may vary with increasing g, reflecting its higher flexibility. <b>Representational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> inductive inference and awareness of it, and grasp of logical constraints framing inference are the major markers of g, first intertwining with in their respective cycles and differentiating later during the periods of 2 – 6, 7 – 11, and 11 – 20 years, respectively.

For years, it was assumed that stimulants had paradoxical calming effects in ADHD patients, whereas stimulating ‘normal ’ individuals and producing locomotor activation in rats. It is now known that low doses of stimulants focus attention and improve executive function in both normal and ADHD subjects. Furthermore, the seminal work of Kuczenski and Segal showed that low, oral doses of methylphenidate reduce locomotor activity in rats as well. Berridge et al have now shown that these low doses produce marked increases in norepinephrine and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, whereas having only subtle effects on subcortical catecholamine release. ihe prefrontal cortex regulates behavior and attention using <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and imaging and neuropsychological {{studies have shown that the}} prefrontal cortex is weaker in subjects with ADHD.

Administering low doses of methylphenidate to rats improves the working memory and attentional functions of the prefrontal cortex, while high doses impair working memory and produce a perseverative pattern of errors similar to that seen in patients. The low dose improvement is hiocked by either an a 2 -adrenoceptor or Dl receptor antagonist, suggesting that both norepinephrine and dopamine contribute to the beneficial actions of stimulant medications...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the potential that {{an analysis of the}} feminist-postmodernist debate in light of the linguistic tum may hold. To date, very few feminist theorists have directly engaged with the linguistic tum, even though this most recent revolution in philosophical thought has drastic implications for theory itself, and more importantly, for theory that seeks to influence or describe political engagement. In Chapter One, I begin by outlining the significance of the linguistic tum {{in the development of the}} postmodern agenda. I then explore the difficult terrain of the tense relationship between feminism and postmodernism in Chapter Two. Finally, in Chapter Three, I critically analyse the way in which viewing the feminist-postmodernist debate in light of the imperatives of the linguistic turn can help to ease the tensions that have clouded this relationship from its very outset. By examining three major aspects of postmodernism upon which feminist theorists concentrate - the subject, history, and metaphysics - I attempt to locate where each theorist is positioned in relation to both the linguistic tum and postmodernism. I conclude that, even though contemporary feminist theory works within the horizon of the linguistic tum, many feminist theorists have not embraced the imperatives that come along with it. Indeed, many feminist theorists who advocate an alliance with postmodernism, still retain vestiges of <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge</b> within their philosophical systems, which is incompatible with taking the linguistic tum. I end by considering the epistemological options that are available after the demise of the episteme of representation, arguing that any feminist theory that seeks to influence or describe feminist political action, must maintain an epistemological basis...|$|E

Musical activities are at the centre of Music on the Lap, a Dutch approach to early childhood music education. The present study takes an in-depth look at the role of movement in these musical activities and thereby focuses on the representation of musical elements through movement. This study has among its aims the raising of more awareness for the conscious use of movement in early childhood music education. Departing from an embodied approach within an interpretative design, the premise of the current study is that movement should be considered an important form of kinaesthetic representation through which preschool children can come to understand and learn different aspects of music. The musical movement responses of children aged 18 to 36 months in a regular Music on the Lap setting were investigated. The musical movement behaviour of the children, during specific musical activities, was captured on DVD and the individual responses of 27 children were analysed. Interviews with the participating teacher provided important additional information. Through microanalysis of the childrenâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s movements, the study arrived at a theoretical interpretation: movement responses to music can be considered enactive symbols, creating direct and indirect representations of musical characteristics. To further musical learning the movements should be firmly based in a temporal framework of aural and verbal connotations in order to stimulate purposeful movement responses. This temporal framework should be structured by the teacher through a process of appropriate movement models and verbal guidance to arrive at meaningful movement actions, which can consequently generate implicit and explicit musical kinaesthetic and musical <b>representational</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In this process the children are actively participating to construct with body and mind their own musical knowledge.

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{practice}} of democratic mediation is an increasingly common, yet under-researched, component of engagements between citizens and public authorities across the globe. While the actors who mediate (and their tactics) are diverse and are not necessarily of the marginalised group, they share a commitment to overcoming <b>representational,</b> <b>knowledge</b> or ideological deficits in decision-making for the marginalised group. While the ‘speaking for’ nature of democratic mediation clearly opens up critical legitimacy problems, the practice of democratic mediation appears to be remarkably common, and even effective. The paper demonstrates this by surveying at least three kinds of democratic mediation observed across a large number of cases. First is ‘mediationas professional advocacy’. The mediator in these cases is more an ‘interested intermediary’ in contentious policy politics. In a context of skewed power relations where certain groups remain systematically marginalised, not least through knowledge and representational deficits, a degree of advocacy is required to get more egalitarian policy dialogue. Second is ‘mediation as representational entrepreneurship’. This refers to engagements between citizens and forms of public authority that stretch from the local to the global level. In more ‘global-local’ mobilisations, mediators are often experts, professionals, and international NGOs. In more ‘local – global’ movements, the mediators are ‘hybrid activists’ deeply rooted in the local identities and associations. However, in either case the actor is distinguished by the taking of initiative to include the voices of the marginalised in a domain of power-relations which is multi-level. Lastly, ‘mediation as citizenship development’ refers to forms of activism typically associated with community and capacity development, and usually involves limited advocacy by civil society organisations (CSOs). Hence there may be little by way of explicit mediation in local governance decision-making in these cases, although the empowerment of communities has a demonstrable and mostly positive impact on local governance...|$|E
