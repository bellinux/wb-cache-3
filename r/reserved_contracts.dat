40|$|The first aim of {{this study}} is to examine what the {{differences}} are between the Classic directive (directive 2004 / 18 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts) and the Revised Classic directive (directive 2014 / 24 /EU of the European Parliament and of the council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004 / 18 /EC) when it comes to social considerations in public procurement. The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions. The regulations regarding <b>reserved</b> <b>contracts,</b> technical specifications, and selection criterion are satisfied in the Revised Classic directive. Certain changes and clarifications are still required in regards to the regulations of exclusions grounds, contract award criterion and abnormally low tenders. The facet of the directive which requires the most significant clarification is regarding the conditions for performance of contracts.     Keywords: public procurement, social considerations, socially responsible public procuremen...|$|E
