40|$|Background: In 1996 the Client <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Complaint</b> Act {{was issued}} in The Netherlands. Since then, {{patients}} complaints are being handled by independent complaint committees according to legal regulations. Despite this patient centred Act, many patients {{appeared to be}} dissatisfied with {{the way in which}} their complaints were dealt with, even when the complaint was judged as founded. We investigated why and found some answers. Methods: Patients who lodged a complaint against the hospital completed a questionnaire at the start and at the end <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> handling (six months later). Patients’ expectations and ambitions at the start were compared with their experiences at the end. In this pre post design, 424 279 patients, respectively, completed a postal questionnaire in 2003, as well as 76 complaint committees. Dependent variable is patient satisfaction; independent variables are characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>complaint</b> handling procedures. Results A total of 36 % of patients were dissatisfied with the way in which their complaint was judged by the committee. Many more patients (65 %) were dissatisfied with the (legally required) response of the hospital. According to patients, hospitals had often not responded at all or not responded with correcting or preventive measures. However, the main reason for the majority of patients (94 %) to lodge a complaint was the ambition to bring about a change in the hospital: ‘this should never happen again’. A minority of patients (7 %) wanted a financial compensation. Conclusions: Patients’ dissatisfaction concerned the hospital more than the complaint committee.

The method is secondary analysis. The data consist of 110 questionnaires completed by clients in 1999 when the Complaint Act was evaluated. The results show that clients' dissatisfaction was related to the complaint committee as well as to the hospital. In the clients' view the committee had not tried for an acceptable solution for the problem, the committee was biased and the committee had judged the complaint as unfounded. Besides, the hospital had not responded with correcting or preventive measures, according to the clients. Relatively many clients whose complaints were judged as founded remained dissatisfied. The reasons are as yet unknown. New research has been started to investigate causes of clients' dissatisfaction...|$|R

Health care professionals’ view about confidentiality of patient’s information, knowledge about patient’s right to select physician, nursing specialist and health care institution, the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint,</b> the right to information, possibilities to assure patients’ rights in the hospital were assessed. Methods. Anonymous surveys of 260 physicians and nurses were carried out (response rate 72 percent). Results. The results revealed that 80, 8 percent of medical staff claimed that information about patient must be confidential. 91, 6 percent of health care professionals thought that patient can select health care institution. 83, 8 percent of medical staff thought that patient can select a physician and nursing specialist. 29, 2 percent of the respondents indicated that the patient who is dissatisfied with medical care services can apply to director of health care institution. 18, 6 percent of medical staff indicated that don’t know where the patient can make a complaint against health care institution’s activity if patient is dissatisfied with medical care services. The majority of health care specialists claimed that they provide information about medical care services and rulebook of the hospital. 55, 1 percent of medical staff introduced themselves to the patients. 68, 7 percent of the respondents claimed that patients know their position and qualification. 54, 5 percent of medical staff indicated that information about health status, treatment, methods and outcomes is necessary for the patients. Conclusions. Although knowledge of medical staff about some patients’ rights is good, but often there are limited possibilities to assure them in the hospital. Fifth of medical staff who claimed that patient’s information must be confidential indicated that didn’t ask patient’s consent when gave information to the patient’s fellow-men (p< 0, 05).

40|$|This master thesis {{attempts}} to disclose and describe specific social apparatuses, through {{the study of}} the so-called search zone, which was implemented by law in Denmark in 2004. The search zone will be methodologically used as a case study in the investigation of the apparatus of security’s specific way of governing and ordering the social space. The thesis simultaneously attempts an immanent critique, through a diagnosis of the apparatus of security as a post-political regime. It is argued that 4 social technologies - police, statistics, the state of exceptions and the installation of fear – form a progressing ordering of security of the social. The thesis describes how the state of exception makes it possible to search citizens without ’reasonable suspicion’, in a pursuit to secure insecure social spaces. The thesis also examines how the link and interaction between police tactics and statistics is employed in order to identify special ‘high-risk’ or ‘insecure’ areas and zones, for the purpose of governing these areas with special efforts and tactics. Through an arrangement of social technologies a specific social ordering is formed, where security, necessity and the state of exception are central conceptions. The demand of security is stretched out between security and the intensified government on one hand, and free circulation and laissez faire government on the other. The apparatus of security works to restore ordinary and normative social order, through the state of exception. Hereby the apparatus of sovereignty reintroduces itself and becomes reinstated through the demand of security. This demand of security has consequences, since other possible conceptualizations of social problems or conflicts are excluded. The thesis emphasizes this by describing the inclusive exclusion taking place when the citizen is expected to accept being searched in regards to the newly applied police measures, whilst not being given normal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>complaint.</b> Conclusively the work of this thesis has diagnosed the apparatus of security and the search zones as a post-political regime. The political debate and political conflicts are absent, while statistics, police tactics and fear-based solutions are expected to solve social difficulties, which results in the state of exception. Conceptualizing social problems only in terms of security is a way of approaching the post-political order of security and forms specific ways of articulating problems and solving social difficulties, where security becomes a necessity. The study of the search zone is a clear example of this. I have showed that security, necessity and the state of exception are not indisputable origins of government. Rather, the apparatus of security is a specific and systematic producer of social order, which organises specific practises of government. Hence, the thesis {{attempts to}} re-politicize the apparatus of security...|$|R
