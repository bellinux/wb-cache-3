40|$|Phonological {{features}} are often {{assumed to be}} innate (Chomsky & Halle 1968) or learned as a prerequisite for learning grammar (Dresher 2013). In this paper, I show an alternative approach: {{features are}} learned in parallel with grammar. This allows for addressing an interesting question: is it really optimal that the phonological grammar only use phonological features to refer to segmental material (Chomsky & Halle 1968), or could it be more advantageous for the grammar to refer to segmental material {{on more than one}} level of representation? The learner considered here finds that it is only optimal for the grammar to use phonological features to refer to multiple segments in the same pattern (e. g., the class of nasals), but when a pattern refers to a single segment, it may be at least equally good for the grammar to refer to this single segment as a bare segment label (for instance, [m] instead of [labial, nasal]). In this way, the grammar uses different kinds of <b>representational</b> <b>units</b> (<b>features</b> and non-features) for the same sound – which mimics models with multiple layers of representation (such as Goldrick 2001, Boersma 2007) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{unsupervised}} feature selection. As we have known, the combination of several <b>feature</b> <b>units</b> into a whole feature vector is broadly adopted for effective object representation, which may inevitably includes some irrelevant/redundant <b>feature</b> <b>units</b> or <b>feature</b> dimensions. Most of the traditional feature selection models can only select the feature dimensions without concerning the intrinsic relationship among different <b>feature</b> <b>units.</b> By taking into consideration the group sparsity of feature dimensions and <b>feature</b> <b>units</b> based on an 2, 1 minimization, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection model, unsupervised deep sparse feature selection (UDSFS) in this paper. In comparison with the state-of-the-arts, our UDSFS model can not only select the most discriminative <b>feature</b> <b>units</b> but also assign proper weight to the useful feature dimensions concurrently; moreover, the efficiency and robustness of our UDSFS can be also improved without extracting the discarded irrelevant <b>feature</b> <b>units.</b> For model optimization, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the non-smooth, convex model and obtain a global optimization with the convergence rate as O(1 /K 2) (K is the iteration number). For the experiments, a new medical endoscopic image dataset, Abnormal Endoscopic Image Detection dataset (AEID), is built for evaluation; we also test our model using two public UCI datasets. Various experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-arts justified the effectiveness and efficiency of our UDSFS model. © 2016 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

That is, nature tends to continually accumulate novel forms without any final goal, while most evolutionary algorithms eventually converge to {{a point in the}} search space that locally maximizes the fitness function.

40|$|Specification of {{objectives}} constitutes {{a central issue}} in knowledge representation for planning. Decision-theoretic approaches require that representations {{of objectives}} possess a firm semantics in terms of utility functions, yet provide the flexible compositionality needed for practical preference modeling for planning systems. Modularity, or separability in specification, is the key <b>representational</b> <b>feature</b> enabling this flexibility. In the context of utility specification, modularity corresponds exactly to well-known independence concepts from multiattribute utility theory, and leads directly to approaches for composing separate preference specifications. Ultimately, we seek to use this utilitytheoretic account to justify and improve existing mechanisms for specification of preference information, and to develop new representations exhibiting tractable specification and flexible composition of preference criteria. 1 REPRESENTING UTILITY FOR PLANNING As generally conceived, the AI [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Students in {{introductory}} physics {{struggle with}} vector algebra and these challenges are {{often associated with}} contextual and <b>representational</b> <b>features</b> of the problems. Performance on problems about cross product direction is particularly poor and some research suggests {{that this may be}} primarily due to misapplied right-hand rules. However, few studies have had the resolution to explore student use of right-hand rules in detail. This study reviews literature in several disciplines, including spatial cognition, to identify ten contextual and <b>representational</b> problem <b>features</b> that are most likely to influence performance on problems requiring a right-hand rule. Two quantitative measures of performance (correctness and response time) and two qualitative measures (methods used and type of errors made) were used to explore the impact of these problem features on student performance. Quantitative results are consistent with expectations from the literature, but reveal that some features (such as the type of reasoning required and the physical awkwardness of using a right-hand rule) have a greater impact than others (such as whether the vectors are placed together or separate). Additional insight is gained by the qualitative analysis, including identifying sources of difficulty not previously discussed in the literature and revealing that the use of supplemental methods, such as physically rotating the paper, can mitigate errors associated with certain features...|$|R

40|$|TEST {{is a novel}} {{taxonomy}} of knowledge representations based on three distinct hierarchically organized representational features: Tropism, Embodiment, and Situatedness. Tropic <b>representational</b> <b>features</b> reflect constraints {{of the physical world}} on the agent’s ability to form, reactivate, and enrich embodied (i. e., resulting from the agent’s bodily constraints) conceptual representations embedded in situated contexts. The proposed hierarchy entails that representations can, in principle, have tropic features without necessarily having situated and/or embodied features. On the other hand, representations that are situated and/or embodied are likely to be simultaneously tropic. Hence while we propose tropism as the most general term, the hierarchical relationship between embodiment and situatedness is more on a par, such that the dominance of one component over the other relies on the distinction between offline storage vs. online generation as well as on representation-specific properties...|$|R

I argue that this characterization is inadequate to account for the ways in which representation is used in cognitive science; in its place, I suggest an alternative taxonomy. I will defend and extend David Lewis's account of analog and digital representation, distinguishing analog from continuous representation, as well as digital from discrete representation.

40|$|Many {{information}} filtering systems use keyPhrases as <b>representational</b> <b>features</b> of documents. Since a keyPhrase {{can be used}} {{in different}} senses in different documents, it is worth designing a system to find the appropriate sense of each keyPhrase. In this paper we propose a word-sense (keyPhrase sense) disambiguation methodology called "context filters". A context filter finds whether an input keyPhrase has occurred in the required context. Context filters consider various factors of ambiguity. Some of these factors are special to information filtering and they are handled in a structured fashion. The proposed structure of context filters also has good comprehensibility. Context filters consider varieties of contexts which are not considered in existing word-sense disambiguation methods but these are all needed for information filtering. We propose a decision model of context filters and three modes of building context filters and also suggest various algorithms for learning them. The i [...] ...|$|R

The CGDESIRE framework that we propose offers several advantages: It relies on a powerful knowledge representation formalism, it shortens specifications by using inheritance, it supports the knowledge engineer when specifying a system by offering a specification lattice and it enables reusability by generic task modules and inheritance. We describe the DESIRE framework and redefine it using CGs.

Further, we show that the influence of the actual constituents in the structures supplied during training is not necessarily available, in the generated patterns, for holistic processing. The outlook for holistic processing is therefore limited unless new forms can be found which take into account, what Sharkey and Jackson call, `whole net' representations. 1 Introduction In the spirit of accomplishing truly connectionist solutions to the problem of representing compo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss ground logics, a family of nonmonotonic modal logics, {{with the goal of}} using them in {{knowledge}} representation. Ground logics are based on the idea of minimizing the knowledge expressed by non-modal formulae. The nonmonotonic character of the logics can be described either by a fix-point equation or by means of a preference relation on possible-worlds models. We address both the epistemological and the computational properties of ground logics. We discuss their <b>representational</b> <b>features</b> and provide a thorough comparison with McDermott and Doyle logics. Then, we show that reasoning in ground logics is Π p 3 -hard, and prove that Π p 3 is also an upper bound for reasoning in the major ground logics. Moreover, we identify some special cases where the complexity of reasoning in ground logics is lower than in the general case.

40|$|AbstractStudies of the primate {{visual system}} {{have begun to}} test {{a wide range of}} complex {{computational}} object-vision models. Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e. g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear <b>representational</b> <b>features</b> appropriate for the task (e. g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the <b>representational</b> <b>feature</b> space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical area’s representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas. Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a model’s original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space...|$|R
