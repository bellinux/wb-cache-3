5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{training}} {{was carried out}} at Fort Benning in the United States and at RAF Ringway in England. Groups of recruits were dispatched to both countries {{with the intention of}} getting the best out of both training systems prior {{to the development of the}} Canadian Parachute Training Wing at CFB Shilo, Manitoba. The group that traveled to Fort Benning in the United States included the unit's first commanding officer, Major H. D. Proctor, who was killed in an accident when his parachute <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> were severed by a following aircraft. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel G. F. P. Bradbrooke, who led the battalion until the end of operations in Normandy on 14 June 1944.|$|E
50|$|It is {{standard}} practice for overhead <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> and hardware to be rated {{with at least}} an 8-times safety factor to help ensure the protection of cast and crew. In other words, a line intended to support 100 pounds should have a safe working load of at least 800 pounds.|$|E

50|$|The first {{specifically}} designed Japanese military parachute was the Type 01 of 1941, {{similar to the}} German RZ version, which has {{more in common with}} the Italian D-30 series chute, having a canopy diameter of 28 feet (8.5 metres) in a pronounced hemispherical shape with skirting and a vent hole for stable flight. The harness was modified in the later Type 03 leaving out the lift webs, and the <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> were brought to a single point connected to a large steel ‘D’ ring behind the paratroopers neck for a more upright controlled landing.|$|E
50|$|For use by Airborne troops, the Denison {{was worn}} over the battledress {{and under the}} webbing, with a {{sleeveless}} green denim oversmock being worn over the ensemble to prevent <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> snagging in the webbing and causing a 'chute malfunction. This sleeveless smock had a long external zip (often removed and {{used to make the}} half-zip Denisons full zip), a monkey tail that press studded to the outside front of the oversmock and two elasticated open pockets on the lower front which were to hold grenades for use whilst in the air or immediately upon landing. After a successful parachute landing fall, the oversmock was discarded.|$|E
50|$|Main parachutes used by skydivers {{today are}} {{designed}} to open softly. Overly rapid deployment was an early problem with ram-air designs. The primary innovation that slows the deployment of a ram-air canopy is the slider; a small rectangular piece of fabric with a grommet near each corner. Four collections of lines go through the grommets to the risers (risers are strips of webbing joining the harness and the <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> of a parachute). During deployment, the slider slides down from the canopy to just above the risers. The slider is slowed by air resistance as it descends and reduces {{the rate at which}} the lines can spread. This reduces the speed at which the canopy can open and inflate.|$|E
60|$|Paul set the lug-sail, {{into which}} he had {{converted}} the royal, and seated himself directly {{in the eyes of}} the boat, with a leg hanging down on each side of the cutwater. He had <b>rigged</b> <b>lines</b> to the tiller, and with one in each hand he steered, as if managing a boat with yoke-lines. Mr. Sharp was seated at hand, holding the sheet of the mainsail; a boat-hook and a light spar lying on the roof near by, in readiness to be used should they ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{alongside}} connected replenishment (CONREP) is {{a standard}} method of transferring liquids such as fuel and fresh water, along with ammunition and break bulk goods. The supplying ship holds a steady course and speed, generally between 12 and 16 knots. Moving at speed lessens relative motion due to wave action and allows better control of heading. The receiving ship then comes alongside the supplier {{at a distance of}} approximately 30 yards. A gunline, pneumatic line thrower, or shot line is fired from the supplier, which is used to pull across a messenger line. This line is used to pull across other equipment such as a distance line, phone line, and the transfer <b>rig</b> <b>lines.</b> As the command ship of the replenishment operation, the supply ship provides all lines and equipment needed for the transfer. Additionally, all commands are directed from the supply ship.|$|R

50|$|Moveable {{lines that}} control sails or other {{equipment}} are known collectively as a vessel's running <b>rigging.</b> <b>Lines</b> that raise sails are called halyards while those that strike them are called downhauls. Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called sheets. These are {{often referred to}} using {{the name of the}} sail they control (such as main sheet, or jib sheet). Sail trim may also be controlled with smaller lines attached to the forward section of a boom such as a cunningham; a line used to hold the boom down is called a vang, or a kicker in the United Kingdom. A topping lift is used to hold a boom up in the absence of sail tension. Guys are used to control the ends of other spars such as spinnaker poles.|$|E
50|$|In 1883 or 1884 New Zealand {{photographer}} Alexander McKay {{discovered he}} {{could create a}} much more manageable long-focus lens by combining a shorter focal length telescope objective lens with negative lenses and other optical parts from opera glasses to modify the light cone. Some of his photographs are preserved in the holdings of the Turnbull Library in Wellington, and two of these can be unequivocally dated as having been taken during May 1886. One of McKay’s photographs shows the Russian warship Vjestnik anchored in Wellington harbour {{about two and a}} half kilometres away, with its <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> and gun ports clearly visible. The other, taken from the same point, is of a local hotel, the Shepherds Arms, about 100 metres distant from the camera. The masts of the Vjestnik are visible in the background. McKay's other photographic achievements include photo-micrographs, and a ‘shadow-less technique’ for photographing fossils.|$|E
50|$|In manual <b>rigging,</b> a <b>line</b> set’s lift lines support weights {{opposite}} {{their connections}} to the batten in order to balance {{the weight of the}} batten and whatever it carries. The lift lines are reeved through a series of pulleys, known as blocks, that are mounted above the stage to fly loft structure. An operating line (a.k.a. hand line or purchase line) allows riggers on the fly crew to raise and lower the batten.|$|R
50|$|In a {{drilling}} <b>rig,</b> the drill <b>line</b> is a multi-thread, twisted wire rope that is threaded or reeved through the traveling block and crown block {{to facilitate the}} lowering and lifting of the drill string {{into and out of}} the wellbore.|$|R
60|$|We <b>rigged</b> <b>lines</b> {{on either}} side between the main and mizzen riggings. To these we laced the big deck awning, {{hoisting}} it up aft with a sailing pennant so that any rain it might collect would run forward where it could be caught. Here and there squalls passed across the circle of the sea. All day we watched them, now to port or starboard, and again ahead or astern. But never one came near enough to wet us. In the afternoon a big one bore down upon us. It spread out across the ocean as it approached, and we could see it emptying countless thousands of gallons into the salt sea. Extra {{attention was paid to}} the awning and then we waited. Warren, Martin, and Hermann made a vivid picture. Grouped together, holding on to the rigging, swaying to the roll, they were gazing intently at the squall. Strain, anxiety, and yearning were in every posture of their bodies. Beside them was the dry and empty awning. But they seemed to grow limp and to droop as the squall broke in half, one part passing on ahead, the other drawing astern and going to leeward.|$|R
5000|$|The Junkers J 1, {{nicknamed the}} Blechesel ("Tin Donkey" [...] or [...] "Sheet Metal Donkey"), was the world's first {{practical}} all-metal aircraft. Built early in World War I, when aircraft designers relied largely on fabric-covered wooden structures braced with struts and exposed <b>rigging</b> <b>lines,</b> the Junkers J 1 was a revolutionary development in aircraft design, being built and flown only 12 {{years after the}} Wright Brothers had first flown the [...] "Flyer I" [...] biplane in December 1903. Hugo Junkers' experimental all-metal aircraft never received an official [...] "A" [...] nor an [...] "E-series" [...] monoplane designation from IdFlieg and the then-designated Fliegertruppe, probably because it was primarily intended as a practical demonstration of Junkers' metal-based structural ideas, and was officially known only by its Junkers factory model number of J 1. It {{should not be confused}} with the later, armoured all-metal Junkers J 4 sesquiplane, accepted by the later Luftstreitkräfte as the Junkers J.I (using a Roman numeral).|$|E
50|$|The Basic Parachute Course {{is three}} weeks long for regular troops. During that time, {{trainees}} are instructed in exit, flight and landing techniques. They {{are required to}} complete eight descents, one at night, to qualify for their 'wings'. Exit training is carried out from full-size mock ups of C-130 Hercules fuselages. In groups of eight, {{each with its own}} RAF parachute jumping instructor (PJI), trainees are taught the techniques of jumping individually and in 'sticks', both with and without equipment. Trainees are taught fight drills while suspended from the hangar roof in parachute harnesses on cables. They learn to control their parachutes while descending, and to carry out emergency measures, such as untwisting their <b>rigging</b> <b>lines,</b> taking the necessary action on colliding with another parachutist, and landing in water. Techniques for landing safely are taught using rubber mats. As trainees become more proficient, the height from which they jump is increased by the use of steps and eventually ramps which they run and jump off. Forward, side and backwards landings are practiced on a six-sided trapeze from which the trainees hang by their hands while being swung in the air. On the command of the PJI, trainees let go and perform the appropriate roll on landing.|$|E

5000|$|The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased to confer the VICTORIA CROSS in {{recognition}} of most conspicuous bravery to:- 905192 Sergeant (Now Warrant Officer) Norman Cyril Jackson R.A.F.V.R., 106 Squadron.This airman was the flight engineer in a Lancaster detailed to attack Schweinfurt {{on the night of}} 26th April 1944. Bombs were dropped successfully and the aircraft was climbing out of the target area. Suddenly it was attacked by a fighter at about 20,000 feet. The captain took evading action at once, but the enemy secured many hits. A fire started near a petrol tank on the upper surface of the starboard wing, between the fuselage and the inner engine.Sergeant Jackson was thrown to the floor during the engagement. Wounds which he received from shell splinters in the right leg and shoulder were probably sustained at that time. Recovering himself, he remarked that he could deal with the fire on the wing and obtained his captain's permission to try to put out the flames.Pushing a hand fire-extinguisher into the top of his life-saving jacket and clipping on his parachute pack, Sergeant Jackson jettisoned the escape hatch above the pilot's head. He then started to climb out of the cockpit and back {{along the top of the}} fuselage to the starboard wing. Before he could leave the fuselage his parachute pack opened and the whole canopy and <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> spilled into the cockpit.Undeterred, Sergeant Jackson continued. The pilot (Tony Mifflin), bomb aimer (Maurice Toft) and navigator (Frank Higgins) gathered the parachute together and held on to the <b>rigging</b> <b>lines,</b> paying them out as the airman crawled aft. Eventually he slipped and, falling from the fuselage to the starboard wing, grasped an air intake on the leading edge of the wing. He succeeded in clinging on but lost the extinguisher, which was blown away.By this time, the fire had spread rapidly and Sergeant Jackson was involved. His face, hands and clothing were severely burnt. Unable to retain his hold he was swept through the flames and over the trailing edge of the wing, dragging his parachute behind. When last seen it was only partly inflated and was burning in a number of places.Realising that the fire could not be controlled, the captain gave the order to abandon aircraft. Four of the remaining members of the crew landed safely. The captain and rear gunner have not been accounted for.Sergeant Jackson was unable to control his descent and landed heavily. He sustained a broken ankle, his right eye was closed through burns and his hands were useless. These injuries, together with the wounds received earlier, reduced him to a pitiable state. At daybreak he crawled to the nearest village, where he was taken prisoner. He bore the intense pain and discomfort of the journey to Dulag Luft with magnificent fortitude. After ten months in hospital he made a good recovery, though his hands require further treatment and are only of limited use.This airman's attempt to extinguish the fire and save the aircraft and crew from falling into enemy hands was an act of outstanding gallantry. To venture outside, when travelling at 200 miles an hour, at a great height and in intense cold, was an almost incredible feat. Had he succeeded in subduing the flames, there was little or no prospect of his regaining the cockpit. The spilling of his parachute and the risk of grave damage to its canopy reduced his chances of survival to a minimum. By his ready willingness to face these dangers he set an example of self-sacrifice which will ever be remembered.|$|E

NTLs are also reported to range up to 40 % of the total electricity distributed in countries such as Brazil, India, Malaysia or Lebanon. This is an introductory level course to discuss how to predict if a customer causes a NTL. In the last years, employing data analytics methods such as data mining and machine learning have evolved as the primary direction to solve this problem. This course will compare and contrast different approaches reported in the literature. Practical case studies on real data sets will be included. Therefore, attendees will not only understand, but rather experience the challenges of NTL detection and learn how these challenges could be solved in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] Reasom for Enquiry. [...] To {{determine}} {{the underlying cause}} {{of the collapse of}} a parachute, known as ' squidding. ' Range of Investigatio~,. [...] Measurements of pressure were made in a wind tunnel at. a number of positions over the surfaces of rigid models representing (a) a fully inflated canopy (b) a semi-squidded shape, and also at points over tile surface of a small paiachute. Each rigid model was uniformly perforated with holes representing a degree of porosity which was varied in some of tile tests by covering different areas of the surface. Tests on the parachute were made with it tethered, (1) with <b>rigging</b> <b>lines</b> to a fixed point, (2) by wires to tile sides of the tunnel. Directional measurements of flow required for tracing streamlines were made in the neighbourhood of the parachute {{both before and after the}} fabric had been rendered non-porous. Conclusions. [...] It was found that, through the lack of deformable areas near each mouth, tile rigid models did not reproduce adequately the prerequisite conditions of flow which normally lead to squidding. Radial outward forces tending to prevent collapse were shown to depend not only on the pressure inside. the canopy but also on the strength and direction of the local flow. Any change which brings tile direction nealer to that of tile axis of the parachute decreases tile incidence of the lip of each gore, and hence reduces the outward radial force. Such a change results from an increase in porosity of the fabric, and since an increase in porosity usually occurs with rise of speed, tile proces...|$|E
