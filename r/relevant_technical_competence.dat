40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the past that robots help to bring {{theoretical}} concepts into practice, {{while at the same time}} increasing the motivation of the students. Despite these benefits, robots are hardly ever integrated in education programs and at the same time students feel that they have the competences nor the infrastructure to build a robot on their own. Therefore the workgroup electronics (WELEK) of Ghent University gives students the opportunity to build a robot by organizing workshops and competitions. Up until now, four competitions were organized in which over 200 students voluntarily participated. This paper describes our approach in the hope that it will inspire other educators to do the same thing. We also measured the effectiveness of our competitions by sending each of the participants a questionnaire. The results confirm that students acquire <b>relevant</b> <b>technical</b> <b>competences</b> by building a robot, learn to work as a team and are challenged to use their creativity...|$|R

The processes in an IT-project requires <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> to be present among the project participants to ensure the achievement of business goals and to make organisations competitive. The success of an IT-project largely depends on the project manager which makes it interesting to further investigate what impact the project manager’s <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> has on the project. Previous research shows differing opinions whether <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> is considered important for the project manager to be successful or not. In this study we focused on this question from project participators perspective. We have investigated this by a qualitative study that employed semi-structured interviews. Five interviews was done with as many respondents, were all respondents had participated in software development projects. The results of the study shows {{that it is not the}} project manager's responsibility to neither discuss, nor perform, technical tasks. The project manager’s responsibility is to push the project forward, by organizing and planning the project together with motivating the participants to work towards the goal. <b>Technical</b> <b>competence</b> can however be an efficient resource for the project manager. The study shows that it is easier to communicate with technical project participants by possessing <b>technical</b> <b>competence.</b> Moreover, the study concludes that the constellation of the project may alter the significance of <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> for the project manager. A project consisting of junior project participants tends to be is in more need of a technical competent project manager than a project consisting of senior project participants...|$|R

40|$|A broad based {{industry}} survey investigates whether repeat {{public sector}} construction clients are technically competent, measured by their in-house innovation performance. The study covered non-residential building and civil work in three Australian States – New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Data were collected via {{a large scale}} mail survey undertaken in 2004 which covered 38 % of key construction organisations in the study population. Descriptive statistical methods are employed to give {{an indication of the}} relative level of <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> held by repeat public sector clients compared to contractors, consultants and suppliers. Such competence is taken to be reflected in a number of innovation indicators. The results show a high level of <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> held by repeat public sector clients. As the literature reports a relationship between <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> and innovation leadership ability, this finding has positive implications in terms of industry development potential. This research has immediate benefits in giving the construction industry more confidence in the quality of leadership shown by government clients. It also provides the basis for further research examining the link between the <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> of clients and industry perceptions of client leadership...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} of owner/manager knowledge, competitive intensity, complexity of marketing, <b>technical</b> <b>competence,</b> firm size with the mediation of advisory services on the performance of Nigerian SMEs. The study employed structured questionnaire survey involving a sample of 278 manufacturing SMEs operating in Kano State, a total of 198 valid questionnaires were completed and returned representing 71 percent response rate. Evidence suggests that there is significant relationship between owner/manager knowledge, complexity of marketing decision and <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> and advisory services. In contrast, the result found no significant relationship between firm size and advisory services. Similarly, the result found that owner/manager knowledge, complexity of marketing decision, <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> and advisory services have significant relationship with performance. The result also indicates that, there is no significant relationship between firm size performance and <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> and Performance. We also found that advisory service mediates the relationship between owner manager knowledge and the complexity of marketing decision. The findings of this study will benefit owner/managers of SMEs, regulatory agencies, accounting firms, government at all levels and will also serve as frame of reference to future studies...|$|R

In view of the importance of customer-orientation in services, we investigate the effect of the frontline employee’s intercultural competence on customer’s affective and cognitive evaluations of intercultural service encounters. The focus of this study is on the effect of employee cultural competence, relative to employee <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> and cultural distance. A 2 x 2 x 2 full-factorial design (N= 322) with video vignettes was used. MANOVA results show significant main effects of employee intercultural <b>competence</b> and employee <b>technical</b> <b>competence</b> on both types of customer evaluations. Moreover, employee intercultural competence positively moderates the effects of employee <b>technical</b> <b>competence,</b> and eliminates a negative effect of cultural distance. We conclude that employee intercultural competence is a powerful extra-role behavior with an additive effect on both the affective and cognitive evaluation of intercultural service encounters, even when ETC is at a low level...|$|R
