(The applied radial force is depicted by the green arrow. The arrow's counterclockwise rotation depicts the direction of precession, while the direction of rotation is shown by the clockwise rotation of the blue square. The center of the blue square is traversing counterclockwise along a small circle, the orbit, of diameter equal to the difference of the diameters of the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> and the blue circle, even though the blue square rotates clockwise). If the blue circle has a diameter d and the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> adiameter [...] d + δ. The instant the green arrow is pointing downwards, the blue circle is pressed against the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> at the bottom (point A on the blue circle). The force rotating anticlockwise causes the blue circle to roll around the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> anticlockwise. When it has rolled a distance [...] πd, the circumference of the blue circle, point [...] A again touches the <b>red</b> <b>circle.</b> Since the circumference of the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> is π(d + δ), point [...] A touches the <b>red</b> <b>circle</b> a distance πδ clockwise from the bottom.|$|R

On the contrary in Keynes, the real <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> is determined in commodity markets. Many Marxian economists consider real <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by labor market.
