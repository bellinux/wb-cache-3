5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working {{to close the}} gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> explored scientifically. There {{is no reason}} to presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{appears to}} be a remnant of an early {{expansion}} of passerines in the country of New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family Callaeidae, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako. The only close relative to the family is the stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships to other birds <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.|$|E

It will consist of 21 volumes (57 books) of music and 10 volumes (13 books) of relevant documents and texts. As at October 2017, three volumes <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published.

Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future. The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
