40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs), using combination {{of an internal}} combustion engine (ICE) and one or more electric motors, are widely considered as the most promising clean vehicles. One example of successfully developed electric machines for HEVs is interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM), due to its smaller size and lighter weight providing with design freedom of the vehicles and its higher efficiency contributing to less fuel consumption. As an example, from the historical progress of IPMSM installed on Toyota HEVs, the power density of each motor employed in Lexus RX 400 h' 05 and GS 450 hC 06 has been improved five times and more, respectively, compared to that installed on PriusY 97 O. ne of the driving forces behind this successful improvement has been the adoption of combination of reduction gear with IPMSM operated at high-speed. However, IPMSM design tends to be difficult because permanent magnet (PM) {{is embedded in the}} rotor core. The mechanical strength relies mainly on thickness and number of bridges around PM, but high number of bridges degrades the vximum torque capability due, to increases in leakage flux. Therefore, a new candidate of flux switching machine (FSM) with rugged rotor structure suitable for high-speed operation and the ability to keep high torque and power density is proposed, and examined in this thesis.. This thesis deals with the design studies on high power density hybrid excitation (HE) /field excitation (FE) FSM for HEV drives. Firstly, research background, related works including IPMSM used in HEV, issues of IPMSM for further improvements, and research objectives are discussed in Chapter 1. Then, classifications of FSM and the proposed 12 s- 10 P HEFSM selected for HEV applications are explained in Chapter 2. Under similar restriction and specifications of IPMSM used in HEV, performances of the original 12 s- 10 P HEFSM are examined. Since the initial performances are far from the target requirements, design improvements using "deterministic optimization method to treat several design parameters are conducted using commercial 2 D FEA package, JMAG-Studio ver. 10. 0, released by JSOL Corporation. The improved design which successfully achieved the target performances as well as enough mechanical strength being possible to operate at maximum speed of 12, 400 rlmin is discussed in Chapter 3. b Another infirmity of this motor is the presence of high pole numbers, so that the required PWM frequency becomes very high. To reduce the supply frequency of inverter, various combinations of slot-pole HEFSMs such as 6 s- 4 P, 6 s- 5 P, 6 s- 7 P and 6 s- 8 P are designed. and analyzed in Chapter 4. Among various slot-pole combinations of HEFSMs discussed in Chapter 4, the 6 s- 5 P HEFSM has a better efficiency at high speed operating conditions when compared with other designs, thus it is selected for further analysis. In addition, the problem of high torque ripple of more than 50 % in 6 s- 4 P and 6 s- 8 P HEFSMs is difficult to solve. However, to realize high torque and power density, the design motor requires high current density which leads to necessity of complex cooling system to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>To</b> overcome this issue, a low-torque, low current density, high-speed and high reduction gear 6 s- 5 P HEFSM- 2 is proposed. The target torque is reduced to 210 Nm with the introduction of reduction gear ratio of 4 :l to get similar torque axle via reduction gear in IPMSM. Since the rotor mechanical strength is strong enough to operate at high speed, the target speed of the motor is increased to 20, 000 rlmin. Although the 6 s- 5 P HEFSM- 2 has successfblly achieved the new target performances, the problem of unbalance pulling force is serious and difficult to overcome. Therefore, the final design of 12 s- 10 P HEFSM discussed in Chapter 3 is selected for hrther analysis. Even though the proposed machine requires high frequency to operate at high. speed, it can be overcome by / introducing high frequency switching devices. In addition, it also has no pulling force as well as very less torque ripple which is suitable for high speed HEV applications. Further design reconsiderations are made and the final performances which achieved the target requirements are demonstrated. Recently the enormous annual usage of rare-earth magnet has increased the price of Neodymium (Nd), Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb) which are indispensable to provide the rare-earth magnet with high coercivity as the additives. From view point of cost reduction, the final design 12 s- 10 P HEFSM- 2 is analyzed for less rare-earth magnet by reducing the volume of PM in stages. The achieved performances are discussed in Chapter 5. Finally, by removing all PM in the final design HEFSM discussed in Chapter 5, a new ' structure of 12 s- 10 P FEFSM is introduced. The results of the initial and improve design which met the target performances are analyzed and discussed in Chapter 6. The prototype model of FEFSM is manufactured and some preliminary experimental results show the proposed FEFSM with no PM is viable candidate for HEV drives...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{activities}} on optimizing the base design of LHD-type helical reactor FFHR 2 m 1 is presented. Three candidates {{to secure the}} blanket space are proposed {{in the direction of}} reactor size optimization without deteriorating α-heating efficiency and with taking cost analyses into account. For this direction the key engineering aspects are investigated; on 3 D blanket designs, it is shown that the peaking factor of neutron wall loading is 1. 2 to 1. 3 and the blanket cover rate over 90 % is possible by proposing Discrete Pumping with Semi-closed Shield (DPSS) concept. Helical blanket shaping along divertor field lines is a next big issue. On large superconducting magnet system under <b>the</b> maximum nuclear <b>heating</b> of 200 W/m 3, CICC and alternative conductor designs are proposed with a robust design of cryogenic support posts. On access to ignited plasmas, new methods are proposed, in which a long rise-up time over 300 s <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> power <b>to</b> 30 MW and a new proportional-integration-derivative (PID) control of the fueling can handle the thermally unstable plasma at high density operations...|$|R
