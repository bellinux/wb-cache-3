The material under investigation contains 86 % by weight of hard particles embedded in a <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix.</b> The specimens were tested at a constant strain rate under a confining pressure. Two confining pressures, 3. 45 MPa and 6. 9 MPa, and two types of loading, monotonically increasing and cyclic, were considered.

40|$|The solid nematic {{equivalent}} of the Fredericks transition is found to depend on a critical field rather than a critical voltage as in the classical case. This arises because director anchoring is principally to the solid <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix</b> of the nematic gel {{rather than to the}} sample surfaces. Moreover, above the threshold field, we find a competition between quartic (soft) and conventional harmonic elasticity which dictates the director response. By including a small degree of initial director misorientation, the calculated field variation of optical anisotropy agrees well with the conoscopy measurements of Chang et al (Phys. Rev.

The reinforcement of <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrices</b> by CNFs was studied in the case of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The tensile strength was greatly (61 %) increased, even for very low fiber content (i.e., 1.0 wt.%). The surface modification of the fiber by high energy electron beam and gamma irradiation led to better dispersion in the rubber matrix. This in turn gave rise to further improvements in mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties of EVA. The thermal conductivity also exhibited improvements from that of the neat elastomer, although thermal stability of the nanocomposites was not significantly altered by the functionalization of CNFs. Various results were well supported by the morphological analysis of the nanocomposites.|$|R

These composites combine the elastic behavior of rubbers with strength and stiffness of fibers. Reinforcement with short fibers offers additional features such as design flexibility, high modulus, tear strength, etc. The degree of reinforcement depends on parameters such as: {{the nature of the}} rubber matrix, the type of fibers, the concentration and orientation of fibers, fiber to rubber adhesion (generation of a strong interface), fiber length and aspect ratio of the fibers. In this research aramid fibers have been chosen because of their significantly higher modulus and strength, compared to other commercial fibers. Compounds based on NR and EPDM are prepared.

The lamellar star block copolymer shows nearly elastic behavior of small scale yielding and unstable crack growth.

In the case of epoxy, the VGCF were introduced in the hardener and blended with the prepolymer. Nanocomposites were produced by subsequent polymerization. For the second matrix, samples were prepared by casting of a mixture of SBR latex and a water suspension of VGCF. Evaluation of mechanical performances revealed a linear increase of the modulus measured above and below the glass transition temperature for nanofibre content up to 10 wt%. This increase is low, but in good agreement with the estimation based on mechanical coupling models. In the case of epoxy matrix, the ultimate stress and strain are largely increased, even for very low fibre content (i. e. 1 wt%).

40|$|The {{current study}} focuses on giving a basic {{understanding}} of tubular graphene sheets or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and points towards their role in fabricating elastomer composites. Since the properties and the performance of CNT reinforced elastomer composites predominantly depend on the rate of dispersion of fillers in the matrix, the physical and chemical interaction of polymer chains with the nanotubes, crosslinking chemistry of rubbers and the orientation of the tubes within the matrix, here, a thorough study of these topics is carried out. For this, various techniques of composite manufacturing such as pulverization, heterocoagulation, freeze drying, etc. are discussed by emphasizing the dispersion and alignment of CNTs in elastomers. The importance of the functionalization technique as well as the confinement effect of nanotubes in elastomer media is derived. In a word, this article is aimed exclusively at addressing the prevailing problems related to the CNT dispersion in various rubber matrices, the solutions to produce advanced high-performance elastomeric composites and various fields of applications of such composites, especially electronics.

40|$|International audienceThe present work proposes an {{approach}} to identify the network structural evolution of EPDM rubbers induced by loading. An experimental device based on two camera pair systems has been developed in order to accurately measure the volume change of rubber samples during stretching. Results show that the loading is associated with an increase of volume change (âˆ†V/V 0) up to 2 % and should be related to cavitation/decohesion at the interface between fillers and the <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix.</b> Post mortem analysis of the microstructure, combining swelling and thermoporosimetry experiments, were then carried out. A good agreement has been found between the volume change and the microstructural evolution: as compared to virgin samples (not submitted to loading), the effective network density estimated from swelling measurements of tested materials (Î½) is decreased of 7 % and thermoporosimetry shows that damage during stretching is accompanied by an average increase of the chains length. These changes are significantly increased for samples stretched up to the rupture (Î»= 8). Indeed, in that case, the effective network density is decreased of more than 20 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} factor that determines {{the improvement of}} properties in rubber by the incorporation of nanoclay is its distribution in the rubber matrix. The simple mixing of nonpolar rubber and organically modified nanoclay will not contribute for the good dispersion of nanofiller in the <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix.</b> Hence a polar rubber like epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) {{can be used as}} a compatibilizer in order to obtain a better dispersion of the nanoclay in the matrix polymer. Epoxidized natural rubber and organically modified nanoclay composites (EC) were prepared by solution mixing. The nanoclay employed in this study is Cloisite 20 A. The obtained nanocomposites were incorporated in styrene butadiene-rubber (SBR) compounds with sulphur as a curing agent. The morphology observed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) shows that the nanoclay is highly intercalated in ENR, and further incorporation of EC in SBR matrix leads to partial exfoliation of the nanoclay. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed an increase in storage modulus and lesser damping characteristics for the compounds containing EC loading in SBR matrix.

40|$|Immobilization of EPDM chains on {{the surface}} of carbon black and network {{structure}} in the rubber matrix of filled EPDM rubbers were studied by low-field proton NMR experiments. Advanced NMR experiments unambiguously show strong immobilization of EPDM chain fragments {{on the surface}} of carbon black. The thickness of the immobilized EPDMâ€“carbon black interfacial layer is estimated to be = 0. 6 nm. The average number of monomer units per adsorption site is approximately nine, which suggests preferential chain adsorption at the crystal boundaries of carbon-black particles. The adsorbed chain fragments form physical (adsorption) junctions restricting chain mobility in the <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix</b> outside of the interface. The cross-link density in filled EPDM is determined {{as a function of the}} filler type and its amount. The contribution of adsorption junctions to the total cross-link density is moderate as compared to the density of chemical cross-links and entanglement density. The mechanically effective network density in carbon-black-filled vulcanizates is determined by analysis of the stressâ€“strain curves on the basis of the dynamic flocculation model. Comparison of the network density as measured by NMR and mechanical experiments shows significant differences which helps in better understanding of the reinforcement mechanism of filled rubbers.

40|$|International audienceNickel {{nanowires}} {{with high}} aspect ratio (250) were elaborated and incorporated into poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) up to 30 vol% via solvent mixing way. These nanocomposites {{are characterized by}} a conductive behavior with a high electrical conductivity value (102 S mâˆ’ 1) above a very low percolation threshold (0. 75 vol% of metallic nanowires). The introduction of nanowires strongly depressed the matrix crystallinity. Static and dynamic mechanical analysis have been realized at low nanowire volume fraction (< 10 vol%). Below 5 vol% of nanowires, nanocomposites remain ductile. The dynamic mechanical properties {{are related to the}} volume fraction of nanowires. A strong increase of the viscoelastic contribution related to the increase of the percentage of amorphous phase is observed. The major effect is the increase of the rubbery modulus. The highest increase of 300 % is obtained for only 5 vol% of nanowires; it represents an original mechanical result for low filled composites. The dependence versus nanowire content has been described by adapting the Halpin-Tsai model to high aspect ratio filler. Metallic nanowires create additional entanglements that are randomly distributed in the <b>rubbery</b> polymeric <b>matrix.</b> With their low percolation threshold, metallic nanowires based nanocomposites constitute a new class of multifunctional materials with a high conductivity associated with a ductile polymer matrix characterized by a high rubbery modulus...|$|R
40|$|High {{explosives}} {{are highly}} sensitive to accidental detonation by impact, fire, shrapnel and small arms fire. This sensitivity {{can be reduced}} by storing the energetic material within a <b>rubbery</b> polymer <b>matrix</b> and are known as plastic bonded explosives (PBX). The current procedure used to manufacture PBX involves mixing the energetic material with a hydroxy-functionalised aliphatic polymer. Upon the addition of an isocyanate crosslinker an immediate polymerisation occurs and thus the rapidly curing mixture must be used to fill the missile or shells, referred to as â€˜storesâ€™. This process can lead to poor distribution of the crosslinker resulting {{in the formation of}} an inhomogeneously crosslinked matrix and the formation of voids. One solution to this problem involves containing the crosslinker within polyurethane microcapsules that are uniformly dispersed in the explosive-polymer mixture. Upon the application of a stimulus the crosslinker can be released from the microcapsules and the formation of a uniformly crosslinked PBX achieved. Herein is reported the design and synthesis of polyurethane microcapsules that release isocyanate crosslinkers when desired using a thermal stimulus. This has been achieved by exploiting the thermally-reversible nature of oxime-urethane and Diels-Alder adducts that have been incorporated into the shell wall of the microcapsules.

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{coefficients of}} helium, argon, and xenon in two SBS block copolymer samples having different domain structures were determined between 25 and 120 Â°C by the desorption and the time-lag methods. In {{the first method}} after the equilibrium had been established between polymer and gas phase, the dissolved gas was desorbed into a known large volume, and the solubility coefficient S was evaluated. In the second method the time-lag solubility coefficient S was cal-culated from the values of permeability and (time-lag) diffusion coefficients, which were obtained from permeability experiments. In the desorption process of the first method, the pressure increase in the desorption system was measured {{as a function of}} time, and the diffusion coefficient was es-timated therefrom. For all systems over the pressure and temperature range studied, Henry's law was always obeyed, and little differences between two copolymer sampleswere observed. At lower temperatures the values of S were greater than those of S 5. It was concluded that the time-lag method counts only the mobile penetrant molecule in the <b>rubbery</b> polybutadiene <b>matrix,</b> while the desorption method counts less diffusive species in the glassy polystyrene domains as well.

40|$|The {{proposition}} is {{made that}} simple time-temperature superposition {{should not be}} valid for block copolymers exhibiting multiple mechanical transitions; and {{an explanation of the}} time temperature behavior, which is more consistent with the behavior of the individual phases, is presented in terms of an equivalent mechanical model. Based on this model, a method for generating time-temperature shifts, which depend on the experimental time as well as temperature, is developed. This method can easily be extended to any mechanical model and should be valid for polymer composites in general. The storage and loss compliances of three benzene cast polystyrene/l, 4 -polybutadiene/polystyrene triblock copolymers with different compositions were measured between - 85 and 90 [degrees]C over a frequency range from 0. 1 to 1000 Hz. The measurements suggest the presence of four relaxation processes. Two, the polystyrene and polybutadiene glass transitions, are treated according to the method of time-temperature superposition referred to above. Anomalous behavior appearing between the two glass transitions is attributed primarily to a temperature dependent interlayer between the two phases and can be treated as a compositional change in the composite. Entanglement slippage in the <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix</b> also contributes to the total relaxation. The apparatus used for these experiments is an extensively modified model of the Miles shear generator.

40|$|A {{special class}} of {{composite}} laminates composed of soft rubbery matrices and stiff reinforcements {{made of steel}} wires or synthetic fibers is examined, where each constituent behaves in a nonlinear fashion even in the small strain domain. Composite laminates made of piles stacked at alternating small orientation angles {{with respect to the}} applied axial strain are primarily dominated by the nonlinear behavior of the reinforcing fibers. However; composites with large ply orientations or those perpendicular to the loading axis, will approximate the behavior of the matrix phase and respond in even a more complex fashion for arbitrarily stacked piles. The geometric nonlinearity due to small cord rotations during loading was deemed here to have a second order effect and consequently dropped from any consideration. The user subroutine USRMAT within the Micromechanics Analysis Code with the Generalized Method of Cells (MAC/GMC), was utilized to introduce the constituent material nonlinear behavior. Stress-strain behavior at the macro level was experimentally generated for single and multi ply composites comprised of continuous Nylon- 66 reinforcements embedded in a carbon black loaded <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix.</b> Comparisons between the predicted macro composite behavior and experimental results are excellent when material nonlinearity is included in the analysis.

40|$|The {{characterization}} {{of the structure of}} polymer nanocomposites by the techniques of small-angle scattering of neutrons and X-rays is reviewed. Within a concise introduction to elastic small-angle scattering, the basics of shape, structure, and interactions of particles are presented, as well as the scattering from polymer chains. The scattering properties of polymer chains can be described within models that can also account for stress-strain properties. In neutron scattering, stretched polymer chains and their fluctuation width can be directly accessed by taking advantage of the difference in the scattering length between H and D atoms. Further, SANS can equally cope with the mounting interest in the {{characterization of}} polymers in nowadays popular multiphase materials. Using contrast matching or a combination of two probes, i. e. neutrons and x-rays, the solid phase can be made invisible or visible. This allows to extract new structural information about the <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix</b> that could not be obtained separately by other methods. Current literature on filler scattering in polymer nanocomposites will be reviewed. The most common fillers where scattering {{has been shown to be}} decisive are carbon black, silica, polymeric fillers, and, to a lesser extent, clay. Scattering is a powerful tool to analyse the filler structure in a non destructive way, in the dry (pure filler) state, in solution, or inside macroscopically thick nanocomposite samples. The scattered intensity is obtained as an average over the complete sample, thereby decreasing the impact of possible artefacts as it might be the case in direct-space imaging.

This polymer provided an exceptional opportunity {{for the study of}} the ordering of segregated microphases and resulting properties, hopefully with some general implications. When obtained in the form of an extruded plug (first provided by the University of Genoa) it displayed single crystal type diffraction patterns at low angles, from which it could be deduced that the whole sample, or at least macroscopic portions of it, could be regarded as a " single crystal " formed by the segregated phases which themselves are amorphous. Here, the glassy S phase is in the form of cylinders arranged in a crystallographically regular manner within a <b>rubbery</b> B <b>matrix.</b> The cylinder direction is identifiable with a macroscopic sample dimension, so that the structure postulated from the diffraction patterns could be directly tested and verified in a quantitative manner by electron microscopy involving ultrathin sectioning along preselected cutting directions. Again, the observed birefringence was quantitatively accountable by form birefringence, implying random orientation of the molecules within the individual phases themselves. This randomness has been verified lately for each phase separately by infra-red dichroism. Swelling behaviour was found to be anisotropic. In its first stages it corresponds to the lateral separation of cylinders. The mechanical anisotropy was exceptionally pronounced : the sample behaves as a glass or as a rubber when stressed parallel or perpendicular to the cylinder direction respectively. This, together with its behaviour along intermediate directions, was found to be in very good quantitative agreement with even the simplest theory...|$|R

Experimental techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis, uniaxial tensile tests, and nanoindentation were employed to study the variation to thermo-mechanical properties {{as a function of the}} concentration(s) of MOF nanoparticles. With 30 wt. % ZIF- 8 content, it was demonstrated that the addition of filler nanoparticles decreased the quasi-static mechanical properties of the Matrimid/ZIF- 8 nanocomposite (17. 5 % decrease in the Young's modulus and ~ 90 % drop in ductility), but benefit the PU/ZIF- 8 nanocomposite (~ 700 % increase in the Young's modulus while retaining ~ 70 % ductility of the neat PU matrix). The dynamic mechanical response of Matrimid/ZIF- 8 nanocomposite remained almost comparable with its matrix, but PU/ZIF- 8 nanocomposite exhibited tunability in its dynamic response. Higher concentrations of ZIF- 8 nanoparticles resulted in a significant rise in storage moduli and decrease in loss moduli. The PU/ZIF- 8 (30 wt. % of ZIF- 8) nanocomposite exhibited significant uptake/retention of iodine (~ 32 wt. %) and reversible uptake of ethylene (~ 0. 6 mmol g - 1 at 5 Ã‚Â°C). This is attributed to the molecular accessibility afforded by the PU matrix in conjunction with the porosity and chemical affinity of the 2 -methylimidazolate ligands with iodine and ethylene guest species. In contrast, the glassy Matrimid matrix demonstrated poorer uptake performance due to its limited accessibility and robust microstructural features, which greatly limited the interactions between the ZIFÃ¢Â€Â‘ 8 nanoparticles with iodine and ethylene. It was also confirmed that the response of the matrix dictates the overall performance of the nanocomposites because they constitute the structural majority of the composite system, and determine crucial factors such as accessibility to the functional MOF nanoparticles incorporated within. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thermally {{actuated}} shape-memory polymers (SMPs) {{are capable}} of being programmed into a temporary shape and then recovering their permanent reference shape upon exposure to heat, which facilitates a phase transition that allows dramatic increase in molecular mobility. Experimental, analytical, and computational studies have established empirical relations of the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs that have been instrumental in device design. However, the underlying mechanisms of the recovery behavior and dependence on polymer microstructure remain to be fully understood for copolymer systems. This presents an opportunity for bottomâ€“up studies through molecular modeling; however, the limited time-scales of atomistic simulations prohibit the study of key performance metrics pertaining to recovery. In order to elucidate the effects of phase fraction, recovery temperature, and deformation temperature on shape recovery, here we investigate the shape-memory behavior in a copolymer model with coarse-grained potentials using a two-phase molecular model that reproduces physical crosslinking. Our simulation protocol allows observation of upwards of 90 % strain recovery in some cases, at timescales {{that are on the}} order of the timescale of the relevant relaxation mechanism (stress relaxation in the unentangled soft phase). Partial disintegration of the glassy phase during mechanical deformation is found to contribute to irrecoverable strain. Temperature dependence of the recovery indicates nearly full elastic recovery above the trigger temperature, which is near the glass-transition temperature of the <b>rubbery</b> switching <b>matrix.</b> We find that the trigger temperature is also directly correlated with the deformation temperature, indicating that deformation temperature influences the recovery temperatures required to obtain a given amount of shape recovery, until the plateau regions overlap above the transition region. Increasing the fraction of glassy phase results in higher strain recovery at low to intermediate temperatures, a widening of the transition region, and an eventual crossover at high temperatures. Our results corroborate experimental findings on shape-memory behavior and provide new insight into factors governing deformation recovery that can be leveraged in biomaterials design. The established computational methodology can be extended in straightforward ways to investigate the effects of monomer -chemistry, low [...] molecular-weight solvents, physical and chemical crosslinking, different phase [...] separation morphologies, and more complicated mechanical deformation toward predictive modeling capabilities for stimuli-responsive -polymers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} the physical and mechanical characteristics of two commercial thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) systems. Both systems studied exhibit elastomeric behavior similar to more traditional crosslinked elastomers; however, in these TPEs non-conventional polymer architectures and morphologies are used to produce their elastomeric behavior. The two TPEs of interest are ethylene-propylene random copolymers and dynamically vulcanized blends of ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). Very {{few studies have examined}} the mechanical behavior of these materials in terms of their composition and morphology. As such, the primary goal of this research is to both qualitatively and quantitatively understand the influence of composition and morphology on mechanical behavior. In additional very little information is available that compares their performance with that of crosslinked elastomers. As a result, the secondary goal is to qualitatively compare the mechanical responses of these TPEs with that of their more traditional counterparts. ^ The ethylene-propylene copolymers studied have very high comonomer contents and exhibit slow crystallization kinetics. Their morphology consists of nanoscale crystallites embedded in an amorphous <b>rubbery</b> <b>matrix.</b> These crystallites act as physical crosslinks that allow for elasticity. Slow crystallization causes subsequent changes in mechanical behavior that take place over days and even weeks. Physical responses (e. g., density, crystallization kinetics, and crystal structure) of five copolymer compositions are investigated. Mechanical responses (e. g., stiffness, ductility, yielding, and reversibility) are also examined. Finally, the influence of morphology on deformation is studied using in situ analytical techniques. ^ The EPDM/iPP blends are dynamically vulcanized which produces a complex morphology consisting of chemically crosslinked EPDM domains embedded within a semicrystalline iPP matrix. Six compositions are investigated as a function of three parameters: major volume fraction, iPP molecular weight, and EPDM cure state. The influence of these parameters on morphology and resulting mechanical behavior is examined. This work culminates {{in the development of a}} morphological model to describe the steady-state reversibility of these EPDM/iPP blends. The model is then evaluated in terms of composition and cure state. ...|$|E
40|$|Polymer nanocomposites {{made up of}} {{nanoporous}} metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) {{are fast}} becoming a staple of next generation hybrid composites, and are currently being intensely developed for gas capture and separation. This work reports the first attempt to capture and retain iodine (I 2) using polymer-MOF (ZIF- 8) nanocomposites. Membranes of ZIF- 8 -based nanocomposites (comprising either a glassy Matrimid or a <b>rubbery</b> polyurethane (PU) <b>matrix)</b> were preparedviaa colloidal-mixing approach and their viability for I 2 capture and retention effects was determined through absorption experiments, nanoindentation mechanical measurements, and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. The absorption experiments demonstrated that I 2 capture and retention is possible {{in all of the}} nanocomposite membranes, although the PU/ZIF- 8 30 wt% nanocomposite exhibited higher affinity for I 2 absorption (> 32 wt%). It is reasoned that the molecular affinity and attraction between I 2, (2 -methylimidazolate organic ligands of) ZIF- 8 nanoparticles, and polymer matrices (Matrimid and PU) will catalyse the formation of weak secondary bonds, resulting in theâ€˜captureâ€™ andâ€˜retentionâ€™ of I 2 within molecular segments of the polymers and inside the pores of ZIF- 8. The enhancement of the Young's modulus (E) of the PU/ZIF- 8 30 wt% nanocomposite (Eincreased by âˆ¼ 6 %) is postulated to be due to I 2 rigidification, while TGA analysis proved that I 2 retention within both free volume of the polymer and ZIF- 8 sodalite cages remained intact up till the points of structural degradation, at âˆ¼ 200 Â°C for the PU-based nanocomposites, and atâˆ¼ 300 Â°C for the Matrimid-based nanocomposites. We propose that the affinity of the organic ligands in ZIF- 8 and the formation of free volume in the nanocomposites from the presence of ZIF- 8 attracted I 2, and the formation of secondary bonds between these constituents (H-bonds) strengthened not only the nanocomposite, but also kept I 2 from being released despite the larger pore size and gate-opening dynamics of ZIF- 8. It was therefore concluded that a combination of nanoparticles of porous MOFs and a rubbery polymer is promising for further development to enable I 2 capture and retention applications...|$|R
40|$|Carbon nanofillers such as {{graphite}} nanoplatelets (GNPs) and vapour grown carbon nanofibres (VGCNFs) {{have enormous}} potential for developing thermal interface materials (TIMs), mainly {{due to their}} high thermal conductivity. In this project GNPs, VGCNFs and carbon black (CB) fillers were dispersed in the compliant polymer <b>matrices,</b> <b>rubbery</b> epoxy and silicone, to form composites. Mechanical mixing, dual asymmetric centrifuge speed mixing, three-roll milling or combined sonication and solvent mixing were used to produce composites. The effects of processing technique, wt. % offiller(s), particle size and silane-functionalisation of fillers on the properties of composites were studied. Composites were characterised mainly in terms of morphology, texture, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. The interfacial thermal transport performance of carbon nanofiller/polymer composites was studied using a steady state method, {{with a view to}} their use as 'thermal interface adhesives and thermal pads. Roll milling was found to be the best method for producing composites with superior transport properties. GNP/rubbery epoxy and GNP/silicone composites produced by roll milling have thermal conductivities in the range of 1 - 3 W/m. K with 8 - 25 wt. % GNP. The thermal conductivities of the composites increase with increasing GNP loading and particle size but slightly decrease with silane-functionalisation of GNPs. Composites produced using GNPs) synthesised (in-ho~se) via graphite, oxidation and thermal exfoliation offered improved transport properties compared to corresponding composites produced with commercial GNPs. Development of good interconnects between carbon nanofillers was found to be vital for producing composites with improved transport properties. GNP/silicone composites are more compliant materials than GNP/rubbery epoxy composites. VGCNF/rubbery epoxy composites have thermal conductivities in the range of 0. 2 - 1. 8 W/m. K with 2 - 40 wt. % VGCNF. VGCNFs increase the compressive strength of both rubbery epoxy and silicone without compromising their compliant nature. The thermal conductivity of CB/polymer composites reached ~O. 2 - 0. 3 W/m. K with 8 - 36 wt. % CB, depending upon the CB used. CB incorporation improved dispersion of GNPs in hybrid CB/GNP/rubbery epoxy composites and produced a thermal paste-type morphology. Similarly, VGCNFs improved the dispersion of GNPs in GNPNGCNF/rubbery epoxy hybrid composites but reduced the density of interconnects between GNPs. GNP/rubbery epoxy and VGCNF/rubbery epoxy composites offered the best performance as thermal interface adhesives compared to CB/rubbery epoxy and commercial thermal interface adhesive. The thermal contact resistance of the adhesives depends on their viscosity/conformability, bond line thickness, filler particle size, surface roughness of the substrate and thermal conductivity.

40|$|Prolonged therapy {{required}} to effectively treat mycobacterial infection frequently results in severe dose-limiting side-effects and drug resistance due to patient non-compliance with protracted dosage regimens. Biodegradable poly-a-hydroxy acid microspheres and microcapsules containing rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) respectively {{have been prepared}} {{with the intention of}} providing high sustained site-specific concentrations to overcome some of the shortcomings of existing oral treatments. Due to the high dose, hydrophilicity and instability of both drugs, formulation strategies to attain high drug loading and methodologies to characterize in vitro drug release during ongoing decomposition were required. Stability indicating HPLC assays to quantify drug release have been developed, validated and applied to monitor drug release based on cumulative quantification of drug and degradates. A mathematical correction for serial decompositions associated with RIF was made based on the terminal pseudo equilibrium observed during stability studies. An isocratic HPLC assay was prospectively developed for the quantification of both drugs and their major metabolites in biological samples. Further preformulation studies confirmed the absence of significant polymorphs for both drugs when recrystallized from solvents later used in formulation development. Furthermore, thermal analysis revealed only modest interaction between the drugs and ResomerÂ®. The high and moderate water solubilities of INH (145 mgmL- 1) and RIF (1 mgmL- 1) determined the selection of spray-drying (SD) and emulsion solvent evaporation (ESE) for RIF, whereas preparation of INH microcapsules relied solely on the former technique. Examination of the effects of varying RIF: polymer ratio, phase volumes and continuum presaturation with selected poly(L-lactide) and poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA) ResomerÂ® identified optimum conditions to maximize drug loading during a comparison of aqueous ESE with spray-drying with a range of nine further amorphous ResomerÂ® polymers. Although yields were generally higher with ESE (85 - 90 %), SD (45 - 75 %) was considered a superior preparation technique {{on the basis of the}} rapid production of microspheres of high and predictable drug loading (100 % of that attempted), with monodisperse granulometry and superior morphology. Release profiles were typically asymptotic characterized by a rapid `burst' of release followed by a slow release of residual entrapped RIF, irrespective of the preparative technique or polymer used. Poor yields (7. 2 %) when SD low molecular weight (MW) PDLGA (8 kD) were greatly enhanced (74. 8 %) by reduction in drying temperature and substitution of chloroform: dichloromethane (CFM: DCM) (1 : 1) cosolvent with DCM. These conditions were adopted as the optimum parameters for further studies of blends of low (2 kD, R 104) and moderate (11 kD, R 202 H) MW poly(D, L-lactide) (PDLLA); materials which demonstrated excellent sprayability and dramatically modulated the release of drug when combined compared to their use alone. Drug release showed a remarkable dependence on blend, dramatic acceleration being observed between 44 and 48 %w/w R 104. Release over this range showed a marked dependence on medium temperature and led to the proposal of an autohydration mechanism linked to the hydrophilicity and glass transition (T 9) of the blend which accounted for the sigmoidal profiles observed. First order dependence of release allowed calculation of Arrhenius derived activation energies of drug release in glassy anhydrous and <b>rubbery</b> plastic <b>matrices</b> of 630 and 320 J mol- 1. Hydration and thermal studies supported the postulated diffusion mechanism, whereas granulometric and morphological examinations demonstrated that erosion did not contribute significantly. The criticality of matrix composition was further highlighted when interchange with nominally identical polymer, R 202 H, shifted the critical composition to 30 %w/w R 104. Moreover, this observation contested the batch-to-batch reproducibility of commercial polymer. Substitution of DCM with halothane (HAL) and acetone (ACT) had a profound influence on the properties of compositionally identical ('R 104 : R 202 'H, 30 : 70) microspheres, particularly release kinetics. This was attributed to the more rapid drying kinetics with the poor solvent, ACT, and the generation of a porous matrix. Consequently, drug was largely released during the 'burst' phase. Superior solvents, HAL and DCM resulted in enhanced matrix coherence at the expense of considerable residual solvent burdens (6 - 12. 5 %), which allowed extensive matrix relaxation as solvent was lost with first order kinetics. This ageing process was followed by the development of an endotherm associated with the Tg as the matrix stabilized with a resultant increase in the induction period and a general retardation of drug release. Extension of the concept of blending R 104 as release 'initiator' to a range of MW PDLGA of 50 : 50 and 75 : 25 comonomer ratio as release 'modulator' was of limited success generating release profiles reminiscent of each polymer when used alone. The magnitude of the 'burst' correlated to the precipitation kinetics of the predominant complementary PDLGA polymer as determined by cloud-point titration. Due to the more hydrophilic nature of the copolymers, at the critical concentration uncontrolled hydration resulted in a single rapid release phase. Spray-dried biodegradable INH microcapsules were prepared by a two stage process whereby SD cores of drug or in combination with biodegradable albumin or casein were subsequently coated with PDLGA by SD. The highly crystalline, aggregated and irregular morphology of SD drug resulted in poor coating efficiency and a rapid release of encapsulated drug. Protein microspheres of superior sphericity allowed more effective coating and hence slower INH release. It is concluded that SD has excellent industrial potential for the preparation of biodegradable poly-a-hydroxy acid microspheres for high dose drugs to be delivered directly to their site of action, e. g., intra-pulmonary. Indeed, the granulometry of these particles and, in particular, the hydrophilic character of blends of PDLLA described have considerable potential for the sustained delivery of drugs in the low volumes of fluid that prevails in the lung. These formulations might offset some of the limitations of current oral antimycobacterial therapy. Financial support was provided by Knoll Pharmaceuticals and Professor K. Khan...|$|R
