50|$|<b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis,</b> {{commonly}} known as the Norwegian skate or black skate, is a species of skate found in the Norwegian Sea, North Sea and the Bay of Biscay. It is occasionally encountered off the western coast of Ireland, and historically has been found near Rockall and in the Norwegian Deep, though recent surveys have not identified the species there. It inhabits waters from 200m to over 1000m in depth. In 2010, researchers reported the species in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{confirms}} {{the presence of}} the Norwegian skate <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Storm, 1881) in the Mediterranean Sea, by means of morphological traits and molecular markers providing the first record of this species in the Alboran Sea. Cannas et al. (2010) reported D. nidarosiensis {{for the first time in}} the Mediterranean from specimens captured in the central western basin, but Ebert & Stehmann (2013) and Stehmann et al. (2015) considered these records "likely refer to the smaller morphotype, Dipturus sp. ", a species not yet described. Eight specimens of the Dipturus genus (Rajiformes: Rajidae) were caught off the Alboran Island (western Mediterranean) in 2012, 2013 and 2016, between 620 and 819 m depth. These specimens showed morphometric diagnostic features corresponding to those of Norwegian skates from the Northeast Atlantic and the central western Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the Alboran individuals were genetically compared to Northeast Atlantic specimens available in GenBank by means of two mitochondrial DNA fragments: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Analyses showed that the Northeast Atlantic Norwegian skate specimens and the Alboran Sea ones were genetically similar and shared haplotypes, corroborating the identification of the Alboran individuals as <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis.</b> However, they were different from other Dipturus species distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis,</b> <b>Dipturus</b> oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, Raja montagui, Raja radula, Raja polystigma, Raja undulata, Rostroraja alba, Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|R

Eggcase features such as dimensions, horns and apron lengths, and presence/ absence of lateral keels were crucial to discriminate the eggcases of the various species. Morphological and morpho- metric data, con rmed by the multivariate analysis, indicated that the eggcase of R. miraletus and L. melitensis were distinct {{from those of the}} other species for being unkeeled. Within the species having keeled eggcases, those of the genus Dipturus and R. brachyura were discriminated from the remaining group by having the largest dimensions and aprons. Sandy bottoms (< 100 – 150 m depth) were identi ed as egg-laying sites (i. e. sites with females bearing eggcases in uteri) for many species belonging to genus Raja Raja asterias, R. brachyura, R. miraletus and R. polystigma). The nding of R. asterias and R. miraletus carrying eggcases yearly on the same sites, seems to con rm the theory that many rajid species demonstrate site delity, returning to the same depositional area on an annual basis. Some remarks on reproductive biology of these skates are also provided. The eggcase identi cation key reported here repre- sents the rst for the Mediterranean and may be useful, in the future, to identify egg-laying grounds of skates with a nonlethal method...|$|R
40|$|In my thesis, I {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the diversification of the Eastern Atlantic skate faunas arose through vicariance rather than dispersal, using combined approach of molecular phylogeny reconstruction and zoogeography (namely historical biogeography). This analyses have been carried out independently on four Rajidae genera belonging to two different tribes: Rajini (<b>Raja</b> and <b>Dipturus)</b> and Amblyrajini (Rajella and Leucoraja). These taxa were selected because they displayed high species diversity and richness of endemic species in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The verification of this hypothesis was carried out by reconstructing the best phylogenetic relationships among four genera and 26 species (including several endemism) based on mtDNA and nuDNA gene variation and several statistical approaches. Divergence times of taxa have been estimated based on molecular clock and fossil calibration to explain evolutionary patterns in the context of geological framework. Main issues are (i) the evidence that Eastern Atlantic skate evolution and displacement of species diversity occurred from pulsed geographical speciation (i. e. repeated series of parallel and independent speciation events) started in the Late Eocene-Early Miocene and they have occurred prevalently during Miocene; (ii) such relatively ancient origin of diversification has been allowed the sympatric displacement and evolution of several congeneric taxa likely because they have accumulated huge differences in the genomic and physiological/behavioural phenotypic traits; (iii) recently diverged sister species and taxa showed allopatric or parapatric evolution by the presence of oceanographic or hydrogeographical barriers which likely prevent large mixing between parapatric sister species...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{reconstruct}} a solid phylogeny of four genera of the Rajidae family (Chondrichthyans: Batoidea) using a concatenated alignment of mtDNA genes. Then use the resultant tree to estimate divergence time between taxa based on molecular clock and fossil calibration and conduct biogeographic analysis. The intent was to prove that the actual distribution of species of Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean skates is due to a series of vicariant events. The species considered belongs to two different tribe: Rajini (<b>Raja</b> and <b>Dipturus)</b> and Amblyrajini (Leucoraja and Rajella). The choice of this genera is due to their high presence in the area of interest and to the richness of endemic species. The results show that despite the ancient origin of Rajidae (97 MYA), the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean faunas originated more recently, during Middle Miocene-Late Pliocene, after the closure of connection between these areas and the Indo-Pacific ocean (15 MYA). The endemic species of the Mediterranean (Raja asterias, R. radula, R. polystigma and Leucoraja melitensis) originated after the Messinian salinity crisis (7 - 5 MYA), when the recolonization of the basin occurred, and are still maintained in allopatric distribution by the presence of biogeographic barriers. Moreover from 4 to 2. 6 MYA we can observe the formation of sister species for Raja, Leucoraja and Rajella, one of which has a Northern distribution, and the other has a Southern distribution (R. clavata vs R. straeleni, L. wallacei vs L. naevus, R. fyllae vs R. caudaspinosa and R. kukujevi vs R. leopardus + R. barnardi). The Quaternary and present oceanographic discontinuities that occur along the western African continental shelf (e. g., Cape Blanc and the Angola–Benguela Front) might contribute to the maintenance of low or null levels of gene flow between these closely related siblings species. Also sympatric speciation must be invoked to explain the evolution of skates, for example for the division between R. leopardus and R. barnardi. The speciation processes followed a south-to-north pathways for Dipturus and a north-to-south pathways for Raja, Leucoraja and Rajella underling that the evolution of the genera occurred independently. In the end, it is conceivable that the evolutionary pathways of the tribes followed the costal line during the gondwana fragmentation. The results demonstrate that the evolution of this family is characterized by a series of parallel and independent speciation events, strictly correlated to the tectonic movement of continental masses and paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events and so can be explained by a panbiogeographical (vicariance) model...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of fisheries and globalized trade are emerging as the principal drivers of coastal and ocean threat. Considering {{the important role of}} Chondrichthyes as predators at the top of food chain in marine ecosystems, knowledge on their biology remains scarce in the Mediterranean. In this regard, our objective is to give information on their spatial distribution, abundance and population structure. Data were collected for 25 demersal species, including batoid species, sharks and holocephalans from 1994 to 2013 during scientific bottom trawl surveys (MEDITS project) carried out around the Sardinian seas. The total frequency of occurrence (f%), the Biomass Index (BI, kg/km 2), and the Density Index (DI, N/km 2) were estimated for the continental shelf (10 - 200 m), slope (200 - 800 m), and overall (10 - 800 m) depth strata. Size trends were also calculated for the most abundant species considering all depth strata. The correlation among MEDITS figures (f%, BI, DI, size structure) and years were assessed by species computing the Pearson linear coefficient. From f% and abundance indexes investigation, only the small spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula and the thornback ray Raja clavata were ubiquitous in all strata investigated, instead, all the other species showed a preferential distribution for the shelf or the slope. In general, the temporal trends of BI and DI were stable or positive for both macro-strata, except for the longnose spurdog Squalus blainville which seemed to show a statistically significant decreasing trend. All analyzed species displayed temporal stable trends in size structure analysis, apart from <b>Raja</b> brachyura and <b>Dipturus</b> oxyrinchus that showed a statistically significant increase. Despite the time series analysis revealed stable or positive trends, it appears clear the need of urgent management measures to protect the demersal chondrichthyan species extending the monitoring over time and implementing the data collected by scientific and commercial trawl surveys...|$|R
40|$|Elasmobranchs, due {{to their}} K-selected life strategy, {{represent}} a taxonomic group particularly susceptible to fishing mortality (Cahmi et al., 1998). Although {{the increasing number of}} studies that shows a global collapse of their populations (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002; Baum et al., 2003; Cortés, et al., 2002, 2006; Dulvy et al., 2010), our knowledge about this organisms life-cycle seems surprisingly still scarce (Frisk et al., 2010; Cortés et al., 2012). Among elasmobranchs the Rajidae family is generally identified {{as one of the most}} vulnerable and impacted (Dulvy & Reynolds, 2002). Given the wide-ranging decline in terms of abundance, diversity and distribution observed, the skates stocks appear even in more critical condition in the Mediterranean sea (Walker et al., 2005). For this reason the need for management plans seems clear. However this kind of measures necessitate a precise evaluation of the population‟s condition, through a stock assessment process. Nevertheless such analysis require a huge amount of data regarding some peculiar aspects of the studied species life-cycle, and among these, especially growth parameters. This necessity often represented a problem for stock assessment studies. Indeed the estimation of age and growth for elasmobranchs is considered generally more challenging than in teleosts (Campana, 2014). Therefore the first step of this work was represented by the estimation of age and growth, through annuli counts in the vertebral centra of the three selected skates species: Raja brachyura, <b>Raja</b> polystigma, <b>Dipturus</b> oxyrinchus. Four different models were applied on length at age data: the common von Bertalanffy growth function, the Exponential, and finally the Gompertz and the Logistic functions. According to the Akaike‟s Information Criterion, the classical von Bertalanffy growth function, showed the best fitting to the observed data for R. brachyura (L∞= 1113. 4 mm, k= 0. 10 e t 0 = - 1. 19). On the other hand the growth of the other two species resulted better described by the S-shaped functions, respectively the Gompertz model for D. oxyrinchus (L∞= 1275. 5 mm, k= 0. 14 and 2 Inflection Point = 3. 97), and the Logistic model for R. polystigma (L∞= 691. 49 mm, k= 0. 26 and Inflection Point = 4. 03). The obtained growth parameter were employed in several analysis for stock assessment. Those analysis revealed a general high exploitation level for Sardinian skates populations. Indeed both species R. brachyura and R. polystigma seemed to be in an overfishing condition. These results, in addition with what already reported for other two raids, R. asterias and R. clavata, in the GFCM workshop on the stock assessment of selected species of elasmobranchs (GFCM:SAC 14 / 2012 /Inf. 16) confirmed the critical situation of these organisms in the Mediterranean sea. D. oxyrinchus, instead, showed a healthy stock state not subjected to overexploitation. This result was also confirmed by the biomass and abundance trends, which proved to be stable for the entire time period investigated by MEDITS, in agreement with what reported by Follesa et al. (2013) in Sardinia and Relini et al. (2010) for the Italian coasts. In conclusion, this work represents a first step towards a better understanding of the growth and the life cycle of the Rajidae family in the Mediterranean Sea, these knowledge were then applied to the stock assessment of these organisms in order to provide several advices for a conscious and correct management of their fragile populations...|$|R
