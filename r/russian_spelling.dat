25|$|For centuries the Tatar {{language}} {{as well as}} other Turkic languages used a modified Arabic alphabet, İske imlâ. The alphabet was far from perfect, both technically and logically (different initial, medium, final and stand-alone forms, no glyphs for short vowels). Because of this some Turkic intelligentsia tended to use the Latin or even Cyrillic script. The first attempts appeared in the mid-19th century among Azerbaijanis. At the same period the Russian missionary Ilminski, along with followers, invented the modified Russian alphabet for all peoples of Idel-Ural. Nevertheless, modern alphabet uses other glyphs: (Ә instead of Ӓ, Ө instead of Ӧ, Ү instead of Ӱ, Җ instead of Ж, Ң instead of Ҥ), the principles of the modern Cyrillic Tatar alphabet was first invented then. But Ilmiski's alphabet were used for the purpose of Christianization and Muslim Tatars didn't use his alphabet. Ilminski's alphabet is still used among Keräşen Tatars. Interestingly, this alphabet still uses pre-revolutionary <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> of Orthodox names, using Fita and Ukrainian I.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} {{ways in which}} <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> does not match pronunciation. The historical transformation of [...] into [...] in genitive case endings and the word for 'him' is not reflected in the modern Russian orthography: the pronoun [...] 'his/him', and the adjectival declension suffixes -ого and -его. Orthographic г represents [...] {{in a handful of}} word roots: легк-/лёгк-/легч- 'easy' and мягк-/мягч- 'soft'. There are a handful of words in which consonants which have long since ceased to be pronounced even in careful pronunciation are still spelled, e.g., the 'l' in [...] ('sun').|$|E

2500|$|A 14- to 15-letter-long name, {{composed}} of the three roots proved too cumbersome, {{and a lot of}} shortened versions appeared in habitual use. The first General Governor of the city Menshikov is maybe {{also the author of the}} first nickname of Petersburg which he called Петри (Petri). It took some years until the known <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> of this name finally settled. In 1740s Mikhail Lomonosov uses a derivative of [...] (Petropolis, Петрополис) in a russified form Petropol (Петрополь). A combo Piterpol (Питерпол) also appears at this time. In any case, eventually the usage of prefix [...] "Sankt-" [...] ceased except for the formal official documents, where a three-letter abbreviation [...] "СПб" [...] (SPb) was very widely used as well.|$|E
2500|$|The printed Russian {{alphabet}} {{began to}} assume its modern shape when Peter I introduced his civil script (...) type reform in 1708. The reform was not specifically orthographic in nature. However, with the effective elimination of several letters (Ѯ, Ѱ, Ѡ) {{as well as}} all diacritics and accents (with the exception of й) from secular usage and the replacement of Cyrillic numerals with Arabic numerals, there appeared {{for the first time a}} visual distinction between Russian and Church Slavonic writing. With the strength of the historic tradition diminishing, <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> in the 18th century became rather inconsistent, both in practice and in theory, as Mikhail Lomonosov advocated a morphological orthography and Vasily Trediakovsky a phonemic one.|$|E
2500|$|In 1852 Goncharov {{embarked}} on a long journey through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia, on board the frigate Pallada, as a secretary for Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin, whose mission was to inspect Alaska and other distant outposts of the Empire, and also to establish trade relations with Japan. The log-book which it was Goncharov's duty to keep served {{as a basis for}} his future book. He returned to Saint Petersburg on 25 February 1855, after traveling through Siberia and the Urals, this continental leg of the journey lasting six months. Goncharov's travelogue, Frigate [...] "Pallada" [...] ("Pallada" [...] is the <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> of [...] ""), began to appear, first in Otechestvennye Zapiski (April, 1855), then in The Sea Anthology and other magazines.|$|E

2500|$|Responses to {{the article}} pointed {{to the need to}} simplify <b>Russian</b> <b>spelling</b> due to the use of Russian as the {{language}} of international communication in the Soviet Union and an increased study of Russian in the Eastern Bloc {{as well as in the}} West. That instruction for non-native speakers of Russian was one of the central concerns of further reform is indicated in the resistance to Efimov's proposal to drop the terminal [...] "ь" [...] (soft sign) from feminine nouns, as it helps learners identify gender category. Additionally, Efimov claimed that a disproportionate amount of primary school class time was devoted to orthography, rather than phonetics and morphology. Efimov asserted that the existing orthography was essentially unchanged since Grot's codification, and that only by bringing orthography closer to phonetic realization, and eliminating exceptions and variants, could appropriate attention be paid to stylistics and the [...] "development of speech culture". The state's focus on proper instruction in Russian, as the national language of ethnic Russians, as the state language, and as the language of international communication continues to the present day.|$|E
