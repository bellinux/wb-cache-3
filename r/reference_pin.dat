The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD).

The morphology of Ge dots formed on AlAs are observed by atom probe tomography, which revealed nearly spherical QDs with diameters approaching 10 nm and confirmed the complete absence of a wetting layer.

The half pins were inserted in a bi-cortical fashion perpendicular to the long axis of the metacarpal, by hand, using a predrilled 1.6  mm pilot hole with minimal protrusion of the tip of the pin. A proximal <b>reference</b> <b>pin</b> was inserted first, followed by insertion of the most distal pin to ensure that further intermediate pins were aligned with the axis of the metacarpal. Two further half pins were then inserted in the same fashion. A longitudinal incision was made in the periosteum, and a midshaft osteotomy was made of the metacarpal using a drill to perforate the metacarpal diaphysis prior to low-energy osteotomy with an osteotome. Fluoroscopy and direct vision were used to confirm that the osteotomy was complete. After an initial latency period of 7  days, the initial distraction protocol was set at 0.5  mm/day with the aim of achieving 15 – 20  mm of length to optimize symmetry with the unaffected side. The distal segment of the fixator was moved at a rate of 0.25  mm two times a day. Lengthening of the metacarpal occurred for 61  days, followed by a consolidation period of 23  weeks. A minor readjustment of the metacarpal fixator was performed under general anesthesia at day 74 to improve the alignment of the distal fragment that had translated dorsally.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{exchange}} bias {{was used}} as a probe to characterise the temperature profile induced by the inelastic relaxation of electrons tunnelling across a MgO barrier. Thermally assisted magnetic random access memory (TA-MRAM) cells comprising a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with a <b>reference</b> <b>pinned</b> layer and a FeMn exchange biased storage layer were used. The pinning direction of the ferromagnetic storage layer is reversed when heated above the blocking temperature of the antiferromagnetic layer (FeMn). The power density required to reach this blocking temperature in the FeMn layer depends on the current polarity, indicating that the heat source term associated with the current flowing through the barrier depends itself on the current direction in contrast to simple Joule heating. This effect is due to the mechanism of energy dissipation in tunnelling. The tunnelling itself is ballistic i. e., without dissipation. However, after tunnelling, the hot electrons very quickly relax to the Fermi energy thereby loosing their excess energy in the receiving electrode. Therefore, the heat is essentially generated {{on one side of the}} barrier so that the whole profile of temperature throughout the pillar depends on the current direction. Full 3 D thermal simulations also confirmed the temperature profile asymmetry. The proper choice of heating current direction (i. e., voltage polarity applied to the MTJ) can yield a reduction of about 10 % in the heating power density required to enable writing in thermally assisted MRAM cells...|$|R

In the Orthofix system, the screws are held in the template clamps with their respective screw guides. Next, incise the skin corresponding to the third seat of the distal clamp template. Divide the fascia percutaneously and bluntly dissect a track down to the lateral cortex of the femur. Using the drill tip in its drill and screw guides, locate {{the central part of the}} femur and drill across at right angles to the axis of the femur. This is the location of the second ‘reference pin’. When both <b>reference</b> <b>pins</b> are securely held in their respective screw guides in the proximal and distal clamp templates, insertion of the remaining screws is a mechanical process as the position of the rail against the femur would have been determined by first two reference screws. Place the remaining screws in the template seats so that the first, third and fifth positions are filled. It is important to note that the most proximal screw of the proximal clamp is likely to be at a level where the second cortex for the screw will be across the femoral neck; perforating the femoral neck with a screw may leave the patient at risk of a femoral neck fracture after fixator removal. My recommendation is that the drill (4.8  mm in the Orthofix system) is advanced across this level by 2 – 3  cm, and the screw is inserted in a unicortical fashion until it abuts against the femoral calcar. This creates a reasonable level of radial preload by the screw in the cancellous bone, and bonding will occur between it and the HA coating of the screw (Fig.  2).|$|R

The input track-andhold acquires a signal in 500 ns and features a single-ended sampling scheme. The AD 7888 contains eight single-ended analog inputs, AIN 1 through AIN 8. The analog input {{on each of these}} channels is from 0 to VREF. The part is capable of converting full power signals up to 2. 5 MHz. The AD 7888 features an on-chip 2. 5 V reference that can be used as the reference source for the A/D converter. The REF IN/REF OUT pin allows the user access to this <b>reference.</b> Alternatively, this <b>pin</b> can be overdriven to provide an external reference voltage for the AD 7888. The voltage range for this external reference is from 1. 2 V to VDD. CMOS construction ensures low power dissipation of typically 2 mW for normal operation and 3 µW in power-down mode. The part is available in a 16 -lead narrow body small outline (SOIC) and a 16 -lead thin shrink small outline (TSSOP) package...|$|R
