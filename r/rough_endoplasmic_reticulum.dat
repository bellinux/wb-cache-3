5|$|The thyroid hormones {{are created}} from thyroglobulin. This is a protein within the {{follicular}} space that is originally created within the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular space. Thyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the follicular space.|$|E
5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is {{so named because}} the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E

The plasmid-derived gene ParM encodes an actin-like protein whose polymerized form is dynamically unstable, and appears to partition the plasmid DNA into its daughter cells during cell division by a mechanism analogous to that employed by microtubules in eukaryotic mitosis.Actin is found in both smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulums.</b>|$|R
25|$|Within the perikarya of {{pars compacta}} neurons, DAT was {{localized}} primarily to <b>rough</b> and smooth <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> Golgi complex, and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation.|$|R
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes {{attached to the}} surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E

40|$|Cardiac muscle of rabbit embryos {{from day}} 9 through day 18 of {{gestation}} was studied by {{a modification of}} the Koelle-Friedenwald copper thiocholine technique for the localization of cholinesterase activity. In the earlier stages of development a cholinesterase, presumed to be acetylcholinesterase from its substrate and inhibitor specificity, {{is found in the}} abun-dant, randomly dispersed <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of the myoblast. Cyto-chemical end product is also occasionally found in the nuclear envelope, Golgi complex and subsarcolemmal cistemae. The localization of the enzyme first in the <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> and Golgi complex and at later stages in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is significant with regard to the differentiation of the cardiac myocyte. Furthermore, the presence of this enzyme in contractile tissue before the appearance of nerves or nerve end-ings demonstrates an acetyicholine-cholinesterase system of myogenic origin. The localization of cholinesterase (ChE) has been reported in adult striated muscle by Barrnett and Palade (1), Karnovsky (6), Miledi (10), Ulbrecht and Kruchkenberg (14) an...|$|R

40|$|Embryo sac {{cells are}} highly {{differentiated}} in plants. The central cell {{is one of}} the most important cells of the embryo sac. It forms endosperm by fusion with a sperm cell. Ultrastructure of the central cell in the mature embryo sac of Castilleja wightii was investigated in this study. Nucleolus which had a lot of vacuole in a large secondary nucleus and numerous dictyosomes, vesicles, mitochondria, amyloplasts in cytoplasm were seen in this cell. Also free ribosomes in the form of polysomes and large lipid bodies were detected in the cytoplasm. Numerous vacuoles of different size were observed and some of them had autophagic function. Both smooth and <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulums</b> were seen. Although invaginations were seen in the plasmalemma of the central cell to the inside of the embryo sac, a thick cuticular layer was observed outer side on the cell wall. The aim of this study was to contribute studies about the ultrastructure of embryo sacs...|$|R
25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) {{is a type}} of organelle in eukaryotic cells that forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as cisternae. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth. The outer (cytosolic) face of the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification. The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells. The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The {{fibroblasts}} in {{the newborn}} Reinke's space are immature, showing an oval shape, {{and a large}} nucleus-cytoplasm ratio. The <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> and Golgi apparatus, as shown by electron micrographs, are not well developed, indicating that the cells are in a resting phase. The collagenous and reticular fibers in the newborn VF are fewer than in the adult one, adding to the immaturity of the vocal fold tissue.|$|E
25|$|Cryptophytes, or cryptomonads are a {{group of}} algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes. Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes, the {{outermost}} of which is continuous with the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> They synthesize ordinary starch, which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space—outside the original double membrane, in the place that corresponds to the red alga's cytoplasm. Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.|$|E
40|$|During {{recent years}} cytoplasmic corpuscles {{commonly}} known as dense bodies, lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, cytosomes, phagosomes, and microbodies have attracted much attention (see reviews by de Duve (3) and Novikoff (5)). Probably the different terms cover the same concept in several cases, {{but it is not}} clear what the exact relationship between these various corpuscles is, and whether they bear a possible relationship to other cell components. During a study of the epithelium of the small intestine in newborn rats we found in several instances cytoplasmic bodies containing mitochondria, vesicles, ribosomes, and <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> Mitochondria and what looks like mitochondrial residue have been observed earlier in cytoplasmic bodies in the epithelium of the small intestine of adult mice (11). In the proximal tubule cells of the kidney of infant mice, Clark (2) found membrane-bounded cytoplasmic bodies and vacuoles which sometimes contained lamellar inclusions and altered mitochondria. Similar cytoplasmic vacuoles containing mitochondria in apparently varying states of disintegration have been observed by Novikoff (4) in the proximal tubule cells in experimentally produced hydronephrosis. As far as we know, bodies with incorporated <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> have not been reported...|$|R
5000|$|Eukaryotes: Eukaryotic {{cells are}} also {{surrounded}} by the plasma membrane, {{but on the other}} hand, they have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane or envelope.

In addition, they possess organized chromosomes which store genetic material.|$|R
40|$|The thrombocytes of the {{tortoise}} (Geoclemys reevesii) were {{studied at the}} electron microscopic level. The presence of a surface connected canalicular system, composed of numerous anastomosing canaliculi, has been demonstrated by the ruthenium red technique. However, monoamine storage organelles have not been found in tortoise thrombocytes. Peroxidase activity is localised to the nuclear envelope and the <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> but is not present in the Golgi apparatus or granules. Acid phosphatase is localised to the large inclusions with myelin bodies, but is {{not found in the}} electron-lucent small granules. These results are discussed in relation to those from comparable studies of mammalian and submammalian thrombocytes...|$|R
25|$|The {{ependymal cell}} bodies present a clear zonation, {{specially}} marked in certain species: the perinuclear region - the most distinct ultrastructural feature off virtually all species {{is the presence}} of large and dilated cisternae of the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (RER); intermediate region – constituted mainly by the RER and the Golgi apparatus (it is not certain the involvement of the Golgi apparatus in the secretary process of the subcommissural organ); subapical region – short region, with microtubules, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum; and an apical region – projecting a large protrusion into the ventricle.|$|E
25|$|A {{ribosome}} is {{made from}} complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein. Each ribosome {{is divided into two}} subunits: 1) a smaller subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA pattern, and 2) a larger subunit which binds to the tRNA, the amino acids, and the smaller subunit. When a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes are ribozymes, because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are often associated with the intracellular membranes that make up the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} the host cell, the viral genome is replicated in the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (ER) {{and in the}} so-called vesicle packets. At first, an immature form of the virus particle is produced inside the ER, whose M-protein is not yet cleaved to its mature form and is therefore denoted as prM (precursor M) and forms a complex with protein E. The immature particles are processed in the Golgi apparatus by the host protein furin, which cleaves prM to M. This releases E from the complex which can now take {{its place in the}} mature, infectious virion.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{a highly}} metastatic ovarian yolk sac carcinoma in a 52 -week-old female Crl:CD(SD) rat. Macroscopically, the present case had severe ascites, bilateral ovarian masses and numerous nodules in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. Histopathologically, these masses and nodules were generally {{composed of two}} types of cells mimicking a parietal and visceral yolk sac. The parietal cells were round to polygonal, contained eosinophilic droplets and were arranged in nests and cords in the eosinophilic matrix. Both the intracytoplasmic droplets and the matrix were stained positively with PAS. The visceral cells were cylindriform, and proliferated in papillary and tubular patterns and occasionally formed Shiller-Duval body-like structures. In the dissemination sites, the neoplastic cells proliferated {{on the surface of}} the various tissues and often infiltrated into deeper parts of the tissues. Immunohistochemically, both neoplastic cells were positive for α-fetoprotein and keratin, and the eosinophilic matrix was positive for laminin. Ultrastructurally, the parietal cells had dilated <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulums,</b> which were filled with electron-lucent laminated structures. The visceral cells had poorly to moderately developed intracytoplasmic organelles and were interconnected with desmosomes. Taken together, the present tumor was diagnosed as yolk sac carcinoma arising from the ovary and was characterized by not only high metastasis but also invasive infiltration with biphasic proliferation of the parietal and visceral cells...|$|R
50|$|The general {{structure}} of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton.

The quantity of both <b>rough</b> and smooth <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} of rabbit lymphocytes by anti-allotype serum (AAS) has been confirmed. The transformed cells closely resembled at the ultrastructural level those obtained by phytohaemagglutinin stimulation. The cytoplasm contained abundant free ribosomes {{with virtually no}} <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> A feature peculiar to AAS stimulated cultures was {{the presence of an}} amorphous material in and around the blast cells which might represent immune complexes of AAS with its antigen. The suppression of immunoglobulin allotype in animals heterozygous at a given locus by foetal exposure to AAS has been confirmed. It was further shown that this allotypic suppression was accompanied by gross deficiency in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes which transformed {{in the presence of the}} AAS to which the animal had initially been exposed in utero...|$|R
25|$|Pathological changes {{associated}} with CYN poisoning {{were reported to}} be in four distinct stages: inhibition of protein synthesis, proliferation of membranes, lipid accumulation within cells, and finally cell death. Examination of mice livers removed at autopsy showed that on intraperitoneal injection of CYN, after 16 hours ribosomes from the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (rER) had detached, and at 24 hours, marked proliferation of the membrane systems of the smooth ER and Golgi apparatus had occurred. At 48 hours, small lipid droplets had accumulated in the cell bodies, and at 100 hours, hepatocytes in the hepatic lobules were destroyed beyond function.|$|E
25|$|As the hyphae of the Hartig net region {{become more}} densely packed, they press against the cell {{walls of the}} phytobiont’s root cells.

The tips of the branched hyphae contain dense cytoplasm with {{a high concentration of}} mitochondria and <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> This arrangement is stretched in the direction of hyphal growth indicating that the transfer of nutrients between fungus and plant is localized in this area of contact.

40|$|Ultrastructure of the corpora lutea (CL) of {{pregnant}} rats were studied {{at different stages}} of pregnancy. The CL cells {{of pregnant}} rats are distinguished from the non-pregnant animals by the increases in the large secretory granule (type-I granule) and well developed mitochondria (so-called disk-type), abundant <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (both smooth surfaced and <b>rough</b> surfaced <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum),</b> and enlarged Golgi complex. In addition, a new type of the secretory granule with small size (type-II granule) appeared after day 16 of pregnancy. These changes were less evident when the conceptus number was reduced to one on day 7 of pregnancy (one-conceptus rats). Interestingly, hypophysectomy on day 12 of pregnancy in the one-conceptuts rats resulted in the significant increase in type-II granuls, which, however, were completely suppressed by ACTH injections. It was concluded form these ultrastructual studies that the CL of the pregnant rat was stimulated by the conceptus-derived substances particularly {{during the second half of}} pregnancy, and that ACTH would exert inhibitory effect on the luteal function in pregnant rats...|$|R

25|$|Goblet {{cells are}} simple {{columnar}} epithelial cells, having {{a height of}} four times that of their width. The cytoplasm of goblet cells tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the Golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> staining with hematoxylin. Mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out {{in the preparation of}} microscopy samples.

25|$|Proteins {{that are}} {{destined for the}} plasma {{membrane}} or export to the extracellular environment in eukaryotic cells are translated on ribosomes that sit on the <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (RER). Most proteins are co-translationally transported into the ER (i.e., while the ribosome is translating the mRNA code into a polypeptide, the polypeptide is simultaneously inserted via the translocon pore into the ER). The ER provides an environment that helps nascent polypeptides fold into and become functional or partially functional proteins. The ER provides an oxidizing environment (for formation of disulfide bonds) and the necessary chaperones (folding assisting agents that {{are not part of}} the final protein). Numerous exported proteins form disulfide bonds—covalent bonds that stabilize the protein structure in harsh extracellular environments. A classic example are the disulfide-linked heavy and light chain polypeptides of antibodies secreted by B-cells of the immune system.|$|E
25|$|In the infant, many fibrous {{components}} were seen to extend from the macula flava towards the Reinke's space. Fibronectin is very {{abundant in the}} Reinke's space of newborn and infant. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is believed {{to act as a}} template for the oriented deposition of the collagen fibers, stabilizing the collagen fibrils. Fibronectin also acts as a skeleton for the elastic tissue formation. Reticular and collagenous fibers were seen to run along the edges of the VF throughout the entire lamina propria. Fibronectin in the Reinke's space appeared to guide those fibers and orient the fibril deposition. The elastic fibers remained sparse and immature during infancy, mostly made of microfibrils. The fibroblasts in the infant Reinke's space were still sparse but spindle-shaped. Their <b>rough</b> <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> and Golgi apparatus were still not well developed, indicating that despite the change in shape, the fibroblasts still remained mostly in a resting phase. Few newly released materials were seen adjacent to the fibroblasts. The ground substance content in the infant Reinke's space seemed to decrease over time, as the fibrous component content increased, thus slowly changing the vocal fold structure.|$|E
