30|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{rotation}} angle measurement, one novel type of miniaturization fiber Bragg grating (FBG) <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> with high measurement precision and temperature self-compensation is proposed and studied in this paper. The FBG <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> mainly contains two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), triangular cantilever beam, and rotation angle transfer element. In theory, the proposed sensor can achieve temperature self-compensation by complementation of the two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), {{and it has a}} boundless angel measurement range with 2 π rad period duo to the function of the rotation angle transfer element. Based on introducing the joint working processes, the theory calculation model of the FBG rotation angel sensor is established, and the calibration experiment on one prototype is also carried out to obtain its measurement performance. After experimental data analyses, the measurement precision of the FBG <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> prototype is 0.2 ° with excellent linearity, and the temperature sensitivities of FBG 1 and FBG 2 are 10 pm/℃ and 10.1 pm/℃, correspondingly. All these experimental results confirm that the FBG <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> can achieve large-range angle measurement with high precision and temperature self-compensation.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of an RGB-D sensor (e.g., Kinect sensor) as a motion capture system based on the accuracy in estimated 3 D positions and computed <b>rotation</b> <b>angles,</b> and the <b>sensor’s</b> impact on action recognition. We conducted an experiment to collect motion capture data for 25 trials of ladder climbing actions, and we analyzed the accuracy on the datasets to identify the sources of errors. In the experiment, a 3 D position RMSE and standard deviation were 10.7  cm and 5.3  cm, compared with a VICON. In the case of <b>rotation</b> <b>angles,</b> the RMSE and standard deviation were 16.2 degrees and 18.0 degrees, respectively. The <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> were used for motion detection, and {{the results show that}} among 25 trials, only 1 case of an ascending action was incorrectly detected (i.e., accuracies of 98 % and 100 % for ascending and descending actions, respectively). The experimental study implies that the inaccuracy of the Kinect motion capture system, particularly on occluded body parts, did not have a considerable effect on action recognition. However, the Kinect system produces large errors in estimating the positions of body parts, which can even increase errors as converted into <b>rotation</b> <b>angles.</b> The relatively lower accuracy of the Kinect system than that of marker-based systems can thus limit its application to construction; for example, the Kinect system may not be suitable for applications requiring high accuracy such as hand-related ergonomic analysis. Moreover, further investigation of Kinect performance evaluation on various actions (e.g., walking, running, lifting and carrying an object, and slipping) in construction operations is required for the thorough review of the feasibility of a Kinect for construction applications (e.g., productivity and safety). In addition, occlusions by a performer or other moving objects might be common in construction; thus a single Kinect motion capture system may potentially produce noise in a field setting. In this respect, further investigation on the use of multiple Kinect sensors is required to collect reliable motion information on a jobsite.|$|R

Methods: In 145 fetuses at 11 - 37 weeks' gestation, we visualized the four-chamber view {{in one of three}} cardiac positions: a subcostal view with the apex at the 3 or 9 o'clock position; an apical view with the apex at the 12 or 6 o'clock position; or a view with the fetal heart apex midway between these two positions. We then used the rotation function of xPlane imaging, using the four-chamber view as the reference plane, to visualize the LVOT view simultaneously in real time on the secondary image plane, {{on the right side of}} the split screen, by rotating a reference line from 0 ° with a rotation step of 5 °. The <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> necessary for the first appearance of LVOT was recorded as the first <b>rotation</b> <b>angle.</b> The reference line was then rotated until the LVOT was just out of view, and this last <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> was recorded as the second <b>rotation</b> <b>angle.</b> The difference between these two angles was recorded as the angle span of the LVOT display. Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Of the 145 fetuses examined, 29 had cardiac defects. Using xPlane imaging, the LVOT was visualized successfully after 14 weeks in 95. 1 % of cases. The first and second <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> varied significantly with cardiac position (P < 0. 001); when the fetal heart was examined using a subcostal approach with the apex at the 3 or 9 o'clock position, the first <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> was smaller than that at the apical view for normal hearts (20 ° vs. 50 °, P < 0. 001). There was also a significant difference for the second <b>rotation</b> <b>angle</b> and for the angle span, between fetuses with and without normal LVOT (P = 0. 038 and 0. 006, respectively). Regarding intra- and interobserver reliability for measurement of first and second <b>rotation</b> <b>angles,</b> the ICCs were high (range, 0. 847 - 0. 980). Conclusion: Using xPlane imaging, it is feasible to examine simultaneously the four-chamber and LVOT views in real time, and measurement of the <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> between these two views is reproducible. The <b>rotation</b> <b>angles</b> depend on the position of the fetal heart, and the normality of the LVOT.
