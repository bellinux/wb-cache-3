5|$|On 24 November, {{some of the}} French ships {{traveled}} to Tangier, where they picked up Consul Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on Narval. Later that evening, Caton reached Salé and offered safe passage to <b>Rabat</b> for the British consul Elton and his family, {{in anticipation of the}} bombardment of the city. The following day, at 11:00a.m., Caton anchored between the cities of <b>Rabat</b> and Salé. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, under threat of bombardment. The rais in the ports of both cities promised to answer to the French demands within three hours. Two hours later, all of the French ships had reached the mouth of the Bou Regreg, between <b>Rabat</b> and Salé.|$|E

5|$|By 1474, cannons {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Mdina. Other extensive preparations for an attack {{were made in the}} 1480s, when the fortifications were once again improved under the direction of Sicilian military engineers. At this point, some buildings in <b>Rabat</b> were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, the walls were still regarded as obsolete, since they lacked bastions and could not resist bombardment from modern artillery.|$|E
5|$|In January 1986, a {{governmental}} committee {{was established to}} discuss options {{for the management of}} Malta's public records. It was decided that a stand-alone National Archives of Malta would be established, to be headquartered in <b>Rabat</b> in a building that once housed a hospital. In addition, the Banca Giuratale in Mdina was identified as suitable to house the records of Malta's courts {{from the beginning of the}} occupation of Malta by the Knights Hospitaller to the early period of occupation by the United Kingdom. In September 1987, the transfer of court records to the Mdina building began and was completed in October 1988. The transfer of all other records to the <b>Rabat</b> facility was not completed until July 28, 1989, and the official opening of the building did not occur until May 28, 1994, when Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, the fifth President of Malta, presided over the opening. At that time, the officer in charge was Joe Caruana.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the episode}} was shot on set at the Irish studios of The Paint Hall. The exteriors of the {{entrance}} of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area, and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei {{taking place in the}} Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in <b>Rabat,</b> in Malta.|$|E

5|$|The Moroccan {{soldiers}} in both <b>Rabat</b> and Salé prepared to repel the French attack, and armed themselves with artillery. On the French side, Sané {{had moved to}} the fort {{at the entrance to the}} Bou Regreg river; Henri IV was a short distance from the Moroccan batteries north of Salé. Gomer moved to a suitable position to attack, and both Narval and Caton would provide logistical support.|$|E
5|$|The {{order to}} build an {{aqueduct}} to carry water from springs in Dingli and <b>Rabat</b> to the capital was issued on 19 October 1596. That year, Grand Master Grand Master Martin Garzez brought in the Jesuit Padre Giacomo to design the watercourse.

5|$|The same {{building}} {{was also the}} site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in <b>Rabat.</b> It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made {{at the same time as}} the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in <b>Rabat,</b> is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Fentress, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town {{to the west of the}} ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the <b>Rabat</b> Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the National Archives of Malta {{offers a}} group and school visit program to {{increase}} {{public awareness of the}} records held there.

5|$|On 1 April 1851, a French {{cargo ship}} {{carrying}} 98 tons of goods from Gibraltar to <b>Rabat</b> capsized near {{the coast of}} Salé. A few tons of goods were rescued, and were stored {{in the city for}} safekeeping. Salé turned out to be less than safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods. The thieves were thwarted by , but only temporarily. By the end of the raids, the French had lost 11,391 franc germinals worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of the city would begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in <b>Rabat</b> and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard Caton; the consul did not come aboard the ship until four hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer Janus joined Caton, and took the consul as its passenger.|$|E
5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour into the confrontation, the batteries in Salé were destroyed, and the artillery in <b>Rabat</b> were damaged to a level that they became almost useless. The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance did not stop until 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The National Archives of Malta {{maintains}} three facilities across Malta. The first {{facility to}} be opened was the Legal Documentation Section, located in Mdina, which was opened in 1988. This facility is located in an old bank building and houses court and tribunal records dating back to those decisions made under the Knights Hospitaller. The second facility is the Archives' Gozo location, which holds over 9,000 items.

The Archives has been housed in the Grandmaster's Palace {{for most of its}} lifetime, having moved to three separate locations during the late 1980s. In 1988, the Legal Documentation Section of the National Archives of Malta was opened, after records of court and tribunal hearings and decisions had been transferred to a Mdina facility beginning the previous year. A Gozo facility was opened soon after, and in 1994, the then-President of Malta, Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, officially opened the Archives' new <b>Rabat</b> head office and main facility.

50|$|In Morocco, {{the funding}} of the festival has often {{been the target of}} much criticism. According to critics, the festival has been funded through {{state-owned}} companies such as CDG, OCP, ONCF and Royal Air Maroc, money which they deem can be better spent in sectors such as health/education/unemployment. In 2011, the management of Mawazine declared that budget of the festival is around 62 million Dirhams, of which 27 million is provided by sponsors and 35 million from revenues of the event.
