5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture <b>Review</b> <b>study</b> {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 {{would be sufficient}} for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost to refit the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 dollars) per vessel.|$|E
25|$|During {{a six-year}} <b>review</b> <b>study</b> of the Tri-State Tornado {{published}} in 2013, new surface and upper air data to analyze were obtained and meteorological reanalysis was utilized, adding significantly to {{knowledge of the}} synoptic and even mesoscale background of the event. The late winter to early spring of 1925 was warmer and drier than normal {{over much of the}} central United States. There apparently was persistent ridging in the western US with a troughing pattern over the central US.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of HPV+OPC {{involves}} avoiding or reducing {{exposure to}} risk factors where possible. About 90% of HPV+OPC carry HPV 16, and another 5% type 18. These two types are both targets of available vaccines. HPV vaccines given {{prior to exposure}} can prevent persistent genital infection and the consequent precancerous state. Therefore, they have a theoretical potential to prevent oral HPV infection. A 2010 <b>review</b> <b>study</b> has found that HPV16 oral infection was rare (1.3%) among the 3,977 healthy subjects analyzed.|$|E

25|$|According to a 2017 <b>review</b> <b>study</b> {{of civil}} war research, there are three {{prominent}} explanations for civil war: greed-based explanations which center on individuals’ desire to maximize their profits, grievance-based explanations which center on conflict {{as a response to}} socioeconomic or political injustice, and opportunity-based explanations which center on factors that make it easier to engage in violent mobilization. According to the study, the most influential explanation for civil war onset is the opportunity-based explanation by James Fearon and David Laitin in their 2003 American Political Science Review article.|$|E
25|$|The Soon and Baliunas {{controversy}} {{involved the}} publication in 2003 of a <b>review</b> <b>study</b> written by aerospace engineer Willie Soon and astronomer Sallie Baliunas {{in the journal}} Climate Research, which was quickly {{taken up by the}} G.W.

The paper was strongly criticized by numerous scientists for its methodology and for its misuse of data from previously published studies, prompting concerns about the peer review process of the paper.

25|$|A <b>review</b> <b>study</b> {{suggested}} that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed {{and are more likely}} to be open to homoerotic relationships, partly due to genetic (80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in the US are not adopted and most are the result of heterosexual marriages)) and family socialization processes (children grow up in relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist), even though majority of children raised by same-sex couples identify as heterosexual. A 2005 review by Charlotte J. Patterson for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents. One study {{suggested that}} children of gay and lesbian parents were more likely to adopt non-heterosexual identities, especially daughters of lesbian parents (inter-generational transfer was not significant in some analyses for sons).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{presents}} a literature review that explores the causal factors of smokeless tobacco use {{among college students}} in the United States.
