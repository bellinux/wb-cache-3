5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{married his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) over New Year's. However, {{when he returns}} to New York {{following}} the nuptials he discovers that he is instead married to his employee and friend Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net while Avery wore a black dress. As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. He informs Liz that the minister married {{the two of them}} instead of him and Avery. The two set out for a divorce, however, TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells Liz not to sign the divorce papers as she can use their marriage to her advantage as TGS—a show she is the head writer for—is affected by budget cuts at NBC as part of the merger with the fictional network company Kabletown. She demands that Jack, an executive at NBC, give the show its lost budget but he denies the request, as a result Liz will not sign the divorce papers unless her conditions are met.|$|E
5|$|The {{degrading}} {{structure of}} Isbell resulted in some weakening as it accelerated toward Florida. At 22:00UTC on October14, the hurricane made landfall near Everglades City as a Category2 with sustained winds between 100 and 110mph (160 and 175km/h). Within five hours, the system cleared the Florida Peninsula and emerged over the western Atlantic Ocean north of West Palm Beach. The storm's passage over land resulted in notable weakening, though Isbell remained of hurricane-strength. During {{the afternoon of}} October15, the low that had formed the previous day induced a northward turn of the cyclone and directed it toward North Carolina, a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as the}} Fujiwhara effect. Thereafter, the two systems began to intertwine as Isbell began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone; rapid weakening accompanied this phase. Isbell completed this process by 12:00UTC on October16 as it moved onshore near Morehead City, North Carolina. On October17 the two non-tropical systems merged into a single storm over the Outer Banks. Isbell's remnants emerged back over the Atlantic Ocean on October18 near the Delmarva Peninsula before accelerating northeast. The system was last noted on October19 as it moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E

As a direct <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he experienced, Thompson suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, divorce, and severe nightmare disorder.

As a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Paul described as anti-Communist and anti-Castro political activities, he directed a fraud on the Cuban government of $8.75 million by selling agents of Cuban president Fidel Castro nonexistent coffee. The plan apparently also involved sinking the ship that was to deliver the nonexistent coffee to hide the fraud from Castro and, according to Time magazine, to defraud its insurer, but the conspirators neglected to bribe a port official in Santo Domingo, {{and the people who}} were supposed to scuttle the boat were not allowed on board.|$|E

500|$|Unemployment {{originally}} {{rose from}} 4.2percent in January 2001 to 6.3percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5percent as of July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as the}} [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending.

500|$|Throughout September, Agnew {{was in the}} news, {{generally}} as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{one reporter}} called his [...] "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term [...] "Polack" [...] to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as [...] "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating [...] "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." [...] He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message [...] "Spiro Agnew for Vice President" [...] against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter, before a final message: [...] "This would be funny if it weren't so serious." [...] Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize [...] "white backlash" [...] into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as [...] "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".|$|E
500|$|On January 9, 1779, while {{en route}} to Philadelphia, Hogun was {{promoted}} to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. [...] His promotion came about in part as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Thomas Burke, a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and a fellow Irishman, termed the [...] "distinguished intrepidity" [...] Hogun had exhibited at Germantown. [...] This caused some controversy, as the North Carolina General Assembly, which was customarily consulted {{for the promotion of}} generals from that state, had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. Sumner was promoted, but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun, who received the support of nine of the thirteen states. [...] Hogun's surprising victory was due in large part Burke's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress. [...] By political conventions governing such matters, Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature's recommendations of Clark and Sumner, but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark. [...] Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19, 1779, serving until November 22 that year.|$|E
