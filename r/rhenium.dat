5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of <b>rhenium</b> and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the <b>rhenium</b> halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than <b>rhenium</b> or due to <b>rhenium</b> itself. Only a few compounds of <b>rhenium</b> have been tested for their acute toxicity; two examples are potassium perrhenate and <b>rhenium</b> trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the <b>rhenium</b> trichloride showed LD50 of 280mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain <b>rhenium.</b> The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which <b>rhenium</b> is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. <b>Rhenium</b> catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), <b>rhenium</b> {{is one of}} the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. <b>Rhenium</b> has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5903K. <b>Rhenium</b> resembles manganese and technetium chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of molybdenum and copper ores. <b>Rhenium</b> shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|For example, <b>rhenium</b> diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of <b>rhenium.</b> The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is {{comparable to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>rhenium</b> and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either <b>rhenium</b> or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> {{has a high}} {{melting point}} and a low vapor {{pressure}} similar to tantalum and tungsten. Therefore, <b>rhenium</b> filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere. Those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers, in ion gauges and in photoflash lamps in photography.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> has one stable isotope, rhenium-185, which {{nevertheless}} {{occurs in}} minority abundance, a situation {{found only in}} two other elements (indium and tellurium). Naturally occurring <b>rhenium</b> is only 37.4% 185Re, and 62.6% 187Re, which is unstable but has a very long half-life (≈1010 years). This lifetime can be greatly affected by the charge state of <b>rhenium</b> atom. decay of fully ionized 187Re: 187Re-187Os Cosmochronometry|date=1996|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=77|issue=26|pages=5190–5193|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5190|bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5190B|pmid=10062738}} The beta decay of 187Re is used for rhenium-osmium dating of ores. The available energy for this beta decay (2.6 keV) {{is one of the}} lowest known among all radionuclides. The isotope rhenium-186m is notable as being one of the longest lived metastable isotopes with a half-life of around 200,000 years. There are twenty-five other recognized radioactive isotopes of <b>rhenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> {{is added}} to {{high-temperature}} superalloys {{that are used to}} make jet engine parts, using 70% of the worldwide <b>rhenium</b> production. Another major application is in platinum–rhenium catalysts, which are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane gasoline.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperature}} stability, low vapor pressure, {{good wear resistance}} and ability to withstand arc corrosion of <b>rhenium</b> are useful in self-cleaning electrical contacts. In particular, the discharge occurring during the switching oxidizes the contacts. However, <b>rhenium</b> oxide Re2O7 has poor stability (sublimes at ~360°C) and therefore is removed during the discharge.|$|E
5|$|The nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{have improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of <b>rhenium.</b> The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of <b>rhenium.</b> Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. <b>Rhenium</b> is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. <b>Rhenium</b> can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, <b>rhenium</b> metal reacts with chlorine to form <b>rhenium</b> hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only <b>rhenium</b> pentabromide and iodine can achieve only <b>rhenium</b> tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1908, <b>rhenium</b> was the second-last stable {{element to}} be discovered. It {{was named after}} the river Rhine in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} {{elements were}} still {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (<b>rhenium)</b> and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since <b>rhenium</b> was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, <b>rhenium</b> has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label <b>rhenium</b> onto target compounds can often be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> diboride (ReB2) {{is a hard}} {{compound}} {{having the}} hardness {{similar to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> is a silvery-white metal {{with one}} of the highest melting points of all elements, {{exceeded}} by only tungsten and carbon. It also {{has one of the highest}} boiling points of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and osmium. <b>Rhenium</b> has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=276.1pm and c=445.6pm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the case}} for <b>rhenium,</b> a {{trioxide}} has not been isolated for Tc. However, TcO3 has been identified in the gas phase using mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, it was {{confirmed}} that although relativistic effects are important, bohrium behaves {{like a typical}} group 7 element. A team at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267Bh produced in the reaction between 249Bk and 22Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, technetium (as 108Tc) and <b>rhenium</b> (as 169Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of <b>rhenium</b> oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7. The adsorption enthalpies of the oxychlorides of technetium, <b>rhenium,</b> and bohrium were measured in this experiment, agreeing very well with the theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl.|$|E
5|$|Technetium and <b>rhenium</b> {{are known}} to form {{volatile}} heptoxides M2O7 (M = Tc, Re), so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh2O7. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO4.|$|E
5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between <b>rhenium</b> and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles <b>rhenium,</b> particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{the fifth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 7 in the periodic table, below manganese, technetium and <b>rhenium.</b> All {{the members of the}} group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst <b>rhenium</b> exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well. The higher +7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions, such as perbohriate, , analogous to the lighter permanganate, pertechnetate, and perrhenate. Nevertheless, bohrium(VII) is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution, and would probably be easily reduced to the more stable bohrium(IV).|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the first}} report on {{attempted}} isolation of the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and <b>rhenium</b> for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rhenium</b> and {{technetium}} form a {{range of}} oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO3Cl, so BhO3Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO3F and MO2F3 for the heavier elements {{in addition to the}} <b>rhenium</b> compounds ReOF5 and ReF7. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds. The values are for TcO3Cl and ReO3Cl are −51kJ/mol and −61kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO3Cl is −77.8kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 7 elements as the fifth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier homologue to <b>rhenium</b> in group 7. The chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.|$|E
5|$|Its usual {{commercial}} form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering {{in a vacuum}} or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of {{the density of the}} metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. <b>Rhenium</b> metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K.|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (<b>rhenium,</b> for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, paint dryers, and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|E
5|$|Technetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between <b>rhenium</b> and manganese.|$|E
5|$|The table gives crustal abundances of the {{elements}} commonly to rarely recognised as metalloids. Some other elements are included for comparison: oxygen and xenon (the most and least abundant elements with stable isotopes); iron and the coinage metals copper, silver and gold; and <b>rhenium,</b> the least abundant stable metal (aluminium is normally the most abundant metal). Various abundance estimates have been published; these often disagree to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener <b>rhenium.</b> It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to <b>rhenium</b> and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with <b>rhenium</b> and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, <b>rhenium,</b> the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, <b>rhenium</b> and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and <b>rhenium,</b> the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|Perey {{named the}} new isotope actinium-K (it is now {{referred}} to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name catium (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed {{it to be the}} most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested francium, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and <b>rhenium.</b> Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the many}} {{different}} and unknown radioactive half-lives in the experiment's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring, Fermi's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically. They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this, including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best radiochemists {{in the world at}} the time and supporters of Fermi's claim, but they all failed. Much later, it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series. This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum, uranium below tungsten, and further suggested that element 93, at that point referred to as eka-rhenium, should be similar to the group 7 elements, including manganese and <b>rhenium.</b> Thorium, protactinium, and uranium, with their dominant oxidation states of +4, +5, and +6 respectively, fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten, rather than below the lanthanide series, which was at the time viewed as a fluke, and whose members all have dominant +3 states; neptunium, on the other hand, has a much weaker, more unstable +7 state, with +4 and +5 being the most stable. Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant +3 and +4 states, along with the discovery of the f-block, the actinide series was firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{is nearly}} half as dense as uranium and plutonium, and is harder {{than either of}} them. It becomes superconductive below 1.4K. Thorium's melting point of 1750°C is above both those of {{actinium}} (1227°C) and protactinium (1568°C). In the beginning of period 7, from francium to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), {{because the number of}} delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to plutonium. The number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6, due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals, increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals, and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788°C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points, behind osmium, tantalum, tungsten, and <b>rhenium.</b>|$|E
