Fowler {{observed that}} the relationship between the density, energy, and temperature of white dwarfs could be explained by viewing them as a gas of nonrelativistic, non-interacting electrons and nuclei that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics. [...] This Fermi gas model was then used by the British physicist Edmund Clifton Stoner in 1929 to calculate the relationship among the mass, radius, and density of white dwarfs, assuming they were homogeneous spheres. Wilhelm Anderson applied a <b>relativistic</b> <b>correction</b> to this model, giving rise to a maximum possible mass of approximately 1.37 kg. In 1930, Stoner derived the internal energydensity equation of state for a Fermi gas, and was then able to treat the mass–radius relationship in a fully relativistic manner, giving a limiting mass of approximately (for μe=2.5) 2.19 · 1030 kg. [...] Stoner went on to derive the pressuredensity equation of state, which he published in 1932.

40|$|The hot {{electrons}} in the intra-cluster medium produce a spectral distorsion {{of the cosmic}} microwave background (CMB) black body emission, the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ). This characteristic spectral distorsion is now commonly used to detect and characterize the properties of galaxy clusters.
