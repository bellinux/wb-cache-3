5000|$|Iury Almeida, biologist, {{author of}} {{publications}} about andean teal (a South American species of duck), pauraque, straight-billed reedhaunter, <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema,</b> greater rhea, muscovy duck, {{and other species}} ...|$|E
50|$|The zoo {{contains}} {{a variety of}} animals and birds, such as donkeys, coatis, rheas, maras, red junglefowl, Lady Amherst's pheasants, <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriemas,</b> ring-tailed lemurs, kookaburras, sacred ibis, cattle egrets, little egrets, Eurasian eagle-owls and white-naped cranes.|$|R
50|$|Birds housed {{at the zoo}} include emus, Chilean flamingos, sun conures, black-footed penguins, black-necked swans, blue-and-yellow macaws, black kites, red-crested turacos, {{laughing}} kookaburras, Von der Decken's hornbills, Temminck's tragopans, snowy owls, spectacled owls, Australian wood ducks, Moluccan cockatoos, Swainson's lorikeets, scarlet ibises, African spoonbills, and <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriemas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{biology of}} the seriemas is poorly known, {{and much of}} what is known comes only from the <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriemas.</b> Pairs appear to be territorial and avoid others of their species while breeding, and fights between rivals have been observed. These fights involved kicking rivals, can go on for long periods of time, and involve much calling by the involved birds.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> or crested cariama (Cariama cristata) is {{a mostly}} predatory {{terrestrial}} {{bird in the}} seriema family (Cariamidae), included in the [...] "Gruiformes" [...] in the old paraphyletic circumscription, but increasingly placed in a distinct order Cariamiformes (along with three extinct families). The <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> inhabits grasslands from Brazil south of the Amazon to Uruguay and northern Argentina. The area over which it occurs is estimated at 5.9 million km², though the bird is not found everywhere in this region of course. The species is absent from the Mata Atlântica and planalto uplands {{along the coast of}} Brazil. Unlike the black-legged seriema, farmers often use them as guard animals to protect poultry from predators and sometimes human intruders.|$|E
50|$|The black-legged seriema {{is similar}} to its relative, the <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema,</b> Cariama cristata. However, the black-legged seriema is more {{arboreal}} than its cousin, and it prefers {{to spend more time}} in trees. They often live together in family groups, and hunt prey together.|$|E
50|$|Birds include {{greater rhea}} (Rhea americana), <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> (Cariama cristata), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), solitary eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), seed finches, Oryzoborus crassirostris, O. angloensis, spotted tinamou (Nothura maculosa), Lesser yellow-headed vulture (Cathartes burrovianus), curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), {{fer-de-lance}} (Bothrops jararaca), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), and toco toucan (Ramphastos toco).|$|E
50|$|The main free-flight aviary, {{accessible}} nearly at the entrance, {{is almost}} hidden in overgrown brush and plants, giving {{the feel of}} a wild experience. Inside, the whole area is covered head-to-toe in free-flight birds and waterfowl, including great hornbills, <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriemas,</b> toco toucans, scarlet ibises, white-faced whistling ducks, guineafowl, Raggiana Birds-of-paradise and an array of ducks and tanagers. Every so often, if you hang around, you can observe two-toed sloths lazily hanging in the trees.|$|R
5000|$|The song has {{a quality}} {{described}} as [...] "a cross between 'the serrated bark {{of a young}} dog and the clucking of turkeys'". At the loudest part of the song, the bird has its neck bent so its head is touching its back. Both members of a pair as well as young down {{to the age of}} two weeks sing; often one member of a family starts a song just as another finishes, or two sing simultaneously. The song can be heard several kilometres away; in Emas National Park, Brazil, in 1981-1982, observers often heard four <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriemas</b> or groups singing at once.|$|R
50|$|They are {{brownish}} {{birds with}} short bills and erectile crests, found on fairly dry open country, the <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> preferring grasslands and the black-legged seriema preferring scrub and open woodland. They give loud, yelping calls {{and are often}} heard before they are seen. They have sharp claws, with an extensible and very curved second toe claw.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{living species}} of seriemas. The <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema,</b> or crested cariama (Cariama cristata) is found from eastern Brazil, to central Argentina. It is bigger and nests {{on the ground}} or in bushes or trees up to 3 m above the ground. The black-legged seriema (Chunga burmeisteri) is found in {{northwest}} Argentina and Paraguay. It nests in trees.|$|E
50|$|Both {{species are}} around 90 cm long (the <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> is {{slightly}} {{bigger than the}} black-legged, with 90 and 70-85 cm respectively). They forage on foot and run from danger rather than fly (though they can fly for short distances, and they roost in trees). They have long legs, necks, and tails, but only short wings, reflecting their way of life. They are among the largest ground-dwelling birds endemic of the Neotropics (only behind rheas).|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> prefers {{grassland}} habitat to any other. Though it {{likes to}} inhabit lush meadows near rivers, {{it will not}} readily move into wetlands or crop fields. It is usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes in groups up to four, apparently families. It typically walks {{on the ground and}} can easily run faster than a human in its habitat. It will flee a car on foot at speeds up to 25 km/h (15 mi/hr) before flying.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{known as}} Pets Corner, the revamped Jungle Kingdom opened in 2011. The centrepiece {{of this area}} is a large {{walk-through}} meerkat enclosure, {{the first of its}} kind in the UK. Two crested porcupines share part of this enclosure with the meerkats, which have free rein of the area. Across from this is an enclosure containing two Oriental small-clawed otters and two male binturong. In the centre of Jungle Kingdom is a small enclosure for coati, which access their shelters via an overhead walkway. At the far end of the area is another shared enclosure containing <b>Red-legged</b> <b>seriema,</b> giant anteaters, Aardvarks, and Patagonian mara.|$|E
5000|$|The seriemas are {{the sole}} living {{members of the}} small bird family Cariamidae, {{which is also the}} only {{surviving}} lineage of the order Cariamae. Once believed to be related to cranes, they have been placed near the falcons, parrots and passerines, as well as the extinct terror birds. The seriemas are large, long-legged territorial birds that range from 70 to 90 cm. They live in grasslands, savanna, dry woodland and open forests of Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. There are two species of seriemas, the <b>red-legged</b> <b>seriema</b> (Cariama cristata) and the black-legged seriema (Chunga burmeisteri). Names for these birds in the Tupian languages are variously spelled as siriema, sariama, and çariama, and mean [...] "crested".|$|E
40|$|One hundred eighty {{species in}} a {{preliminary}} inventory were identified. From these, 166 were {{in an area of}} 832. 5 ha (Mata São Francisco State Park), 84 in another of 9. 7 ha (Manoel Júlio de Almeida Municipal Forest) and 99 in the third remnant, briefly sampled, of 218 ha (Mata São Paulo). Comparing these numbers to inventories of nearby sites was considered that the larger area is poor in number of bird species, and believe this to be mainly due to the high degree of environmental degradation. Was considered that the smaller area is rich in birds, but its proximity (375 meters) to the third remnant certainly exeits strong influence. This paper presents the list of birds by site and with their relative frequency of occurrence. A new record for Paraná (Scarlet-headed Blackbird Amblyramphus holosericeus), two new ones for the interior of the state (Uniform Crake Amaurolimnas concolor and Yellow-lored Tody-flycatcher Todirostrum poliocephalum) and several other important records are commented (e. g. <b>Red-legged</b> <b>Seriema</b> Cariama cristata, Vinaceous Parrot Amazona vinacea, and Black-banded Owl Ciccaba huhula). Locally extinct species are discussed (e. g. Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja), as well as the ones that colonized landscapes created by men (e. g. pastures, agricultural areas). When discussing Atlantic Forest endemism, some species were shown not to be endemic to this biome. Because the north of Paraná is almost totally deforested, the presence of the forest remnants by itself conter them great importance for conservation, besides the existence of species endemic to the Atlantic Forest and considered to be under the threat of extinction. Conservation and management measures are also proposed...|$|E
