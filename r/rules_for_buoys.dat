40|$|Abstract. Buoy {{is widely}} applied in oceanographic research, ocean {{engineering}} and so on. The high cable tension and location derivation of its anchor can greatly affected the working condition of buoy. Multi-body software ADAMS {{is used to}} analyze the dynamics of deployment <b>for</b> <b>buoy.</b> Firstly, model of mooring buoy is developed. The forces on components of buoy are given such as drag forces, inertia force and impact force between bottom and anchor. The program is developed by macro commands in ADAMS environment. The trajectory and tension force of different nodes on buoy are calculated. This method can simulate the dynamics of deployment process <b>for</b> <b>buoy</b> system. And it is also helpful <b>for</b> guidance <b>for</b> <b>buoy</b> design and deployment process planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract：This paper {{describes}} a study <b>for</b> the <b>buoy</b> {{which should be}} operated by a stand-alone power system.

40|$|In the North Sea, the {{construction}} of wind parks using pile driving forms a threat to porpoises, since {{they have a very}} sensitive auditory system. In order to protect this species, {{the construction}} work has to be stopped when they are nearby. The purpose of this project is to design a low-cost buoy which should be able to detect these animals in their natural environment and subsequently serve as a supportive device for offshore workers. Additionally, a proposal for a tracking device which can be directly attached to the animals was made. To achieve these objectives, research was conducted on requirements <b>for</b> <b>buoys</b> in North Sea conditions, the behaviour of porpoises, and technical components as well as the necessary software for detection.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented for a tight-moored heaving-buoy wave-energy converter, with a high-pressure hydraulic machinery for energy production and motion control. The buoy is cylindrical, has {{a diameter of}} 3. 3 m, and the height is, at equilibrium, 3. 1 m below mean water level and 2. 0 m above. A valve in the machinery can be actively controlled, and {{it is used to}} obtain largest possible power production, and to limit the excursion of the buoy, {{in order to protect the}} hydraulic machinery. In addition, an end-stop device is provided as a safety measure, in case the control fails to limit the excursion. For comparison a quite similar hydraulic machinery, without active control, is also investigated. A procedure is developed for control in irregular waves, and on the basis of a scatter table the year-average power production is estimated to be approximately 14. 7 kW <b>for</b> the <b>buoy</b> with control and 5. 3 kW <b>for</b> the <b>buoy</b> without control. Further, a duration curve is presented, which shows that <b>for</b> the <b>buoy</b> with control the mean power production is between 10 kW and 20 kW more than 70 % of the year. <b>For</b> the <b>buoy</b> without control more than half of the annual energy output is obtained in less than 20 % of the time.

40|$|Moored buoys {{have long}} served {{national}} interests, but incur high development, construction, installation, and maintenance costs. Buoys which drift off-location can pose hazards to mariners, and in coastal waters may cause environmental damage. Moreover, retrieval, repair and replacement of drifting buoys may be delayed when data {{would be most}} useful. Such gaps in coastal buoy data can {{pose a threat to}} national security by reducing maritime domain awareness. The concept of self-positioning buoys has been advanced to reduce installation cost by eliminating mooring hardware. We here describe technology for operation of reduced cost self-positioning buoys which can be used in coastal or oceanic waters. The ASC SCOUT model is based on a self-propelled, GPS-positioned, autonomous surface craft that can be pre-programmed, autonomous, or directed in real time. Each vessel can communicate wirelessly with deployment vessels and other similar buoys directly or via satellite. Engineering options for short or longer term power requirements are considered, in addition to future options for improved energy delivery systems. Methods of reducing buoy drift and position-maintaining energy requirements <b>for</b> self-locating <b>buoys</b> are also discussed, based on the potential of incorporating traditional maritime solutions to these problems. We here include discussion of the advanced Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) communications draft protocol which offers improved wireless communication capabilities underwater, to adjacent vessels, and to satellites. DTN is particularly adapted for noisy or loss-prone environments, thus it improves reliability. In addition to existing buoy communication via commercial satellites, a growing network of small satellites known as PICOSATs can be readily adapted to provide low-cost communications nodes <b>for</b> <b>buoys.</b> Coordination with planned vessel Automated Identification Systems (AIS) and International Maritime Organization standards <b>for</b> <b>buoy</b> and vessel notificat- - ion systems are reviewed and the legal framework for deployment of autonomous surface vessels is considered...|$|R

In this paper, buoy system with surface buoy, cable segments with components, anchor and so on is modeled by applying multibody dynamics method. Then numerical method is used to solve the ordinary differential equations and dynamics simulations are achieved while anchor is casting from board. The trajectories, velocity and acceleration of different nodes in buoy system are obtained. The transient tension force of each part of cable is analyzed in the process of deployment. This work is helpful for design and deployment planning of buoy system...|$|R

40|$|The Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) was {{launched}} on Envisat in March 2002. The AATSR instrument {{is designed to}} retrieve precise and accurate global sea surface temperature (SST) that, combined with the large data set collected from its predecessors, ATSR and ATSR- 2, will provide a long term record of SST data that is greater than 15 years. This record {{can be used for}} independent monitoring and detection of climate change. The AATSR validation programme has successfully completed its initial phase. The programme involves validation of the AATSR derived SST values using in situ radiometers, in situ buoys and global SST fields from other data sets. The results of the initial programme presented here will demonstrate that the AATSR instrument is currently close to meeting its scientific objectives of determining global SST to an accuracy of 0. 3 K (one sigma). For night time data, the analysis gives a warm bias of between + 0. 04 K (0. 28 K) <b>for</b> <b>buoys</b> to + 0. 06 K (0. 20 K) for radiometers, with slightly higher errors observed for day time data, showing warm biases of between + 0. 02 (0. 39 K) <b>for</b> <b>buoys</b> to + 0. 11 K (0. 33 K) for radiometers. They show that the ATSR series of instruments continues to be the world leader in delivering accurate space-based observations of SST, which is a key climate parameter. <br/...|$|R
