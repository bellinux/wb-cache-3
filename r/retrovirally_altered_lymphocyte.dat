Thus, the presence of virus within lymphocytes impairs their specific immune functions in the absence of cytolysis. Influenza virus also infects human lymphocytes.

Here, we show that competition for the axis of polarization dictates functional outcomes. We investigated the effect of ligation of the immunoregulatory cell surface receptor, CD 46, on lymphocyte polarity during antigen presentation and cytotoxic effector function. Ligation of CD 46 on human T cells prevented recruitment of the microtubule organizing center, CD 3, and perforin to the interface with the antigen-presenting cell and caused a reduction in IFN-γ production. In human NK cells, similar changes in polarity induced by CD 46 ligation inhibited the recruitment of the microtubule organizing center and perforin to the interface with target cells and correlated with reduced killing.

In the study of Le Tulzo et al. [22], the magnitude of apoptosis was correlated with the persistence of multi-organ dysfunctions, duration of mechanical ventilation, and death. The correlation between the quantitative alteration of lymphocyte and a poor outcome was shown in two studies involving children [12, 32, 33]. In 21 adult patients with septic shock, Venet et al.

In this case-control study, the concentrations of these cytokines in <b>altered</b> T <b>lymphocytes,</b> as well as serum vitamin B 12, have been compared in terms of factors such as, age, the clinical course and the patients' disease risk. 40 patients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria of AD were selected and an age- and gender-matched control group was recruited. The participants' cognitive performance was measured according to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Clinical Dementia Ratio (CDR). The levels of cytokines were measured in supernatants of lymphocytes culture, using assays of ELISA and atomic absorption. Higher levels of IL- 6 and IFN-γ were found more in the <b>altered</b> T <b>lymphocytes</b> of the AD patients {{rather than in the}} control individuals. Furthermore, a marginal significant difference was found between the TGF-β levels of the two study groups. Regression analysis of CDR score and cytokines showed the inverse significant correlation between CDR score and IFN-γ levels. Furthermore, the relation between MMSE scores and IFN-γ was significant, meaning that by increasing MMSE score, IFN-γ level was significantly increased. This study suggests that the levels of IL- 6 and IFN-γ are significantly increased in <b>altered</b> T <b>lymphocytes</b> of AD patients, as compared to those who are not inflicted with AD, and that they are related to the patient's age.

40|$|Summary: Cytokines mediate key {{communication}} pathways {{essential for}} regulation of immune responses. Full activation of antigen-responding lymphocytes requires cooperating {{signals from the}} tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related cytokines and their specific receptors. LIGHT, a lymphotox-in-b (LTb) -related TNF family member, modulates T-cell activation through two receptors, the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and indirectly through the LT-b receptor. An unexpected finding revealed a non-canonical binding site on HVEM for the immunoglobulin super-family member, B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), and an inhibitory signaling protein suppressing T-cell activation. Thus, HVEM {{can act as a}} molecular switch between proinflammatory and inhibitory signaling. The non-canonical HVEM–BTLA pathway also acts to counter LTbR signaling that promotes the proliferation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) within lymphoid tissue microenvironments. These results indicate LTb receptor and HVEM–BTLA pathways form an integrated signaling circuit. Targeting these cytokine pathways with specific antagonists (antibody or decoy receptor) can <b>alter</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> differentiation and activation. Alternately, agonists directed at their cell surface receptors can restore homeostasis and potentially reset immune and inflammatory processes, which may be useful in treating autoimmune and infectious diseases and cancer...|$|R

40|$|Lymphocyte {{proliferation}} {{is key to}} {{the regulation}} of the immune system. Cyclin D 2 is the first cell cycle protein induced following stimulation through the T-cell receptor, the B-cell receptor or cytokines. The promoter of this cyclin integrates a diverse range of signals. Through investigating the regulation of this promoter by interleukin- 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, we have identified a role for the transcription factor CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein. Mutation of the CREB-binding site reduced cyclin D 2 promoter activity 5 â€“ 10 -fold. CREB- 1 is phosphorylated at serine 133, a critical site for activity, in both T cells and Epsteinâ€“Barr virus immortalized B cells. The introduction of an S 133 A mutant of CREB- 1 reduces IL- 2 induction of cyclin D 2 promoter activity, demonstrating a role for this phosphorylation site in promoter activity. Two inhibitors of protein kinase A reduce lymphocyte proliferation and CREB- 1 phosphorylation.

We investigated the oxidant/antioxidant status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis C and controls. METHODS/RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation products and superoxide dismutase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher in chronic hepatitis C patients than in healthy subjects while glutathione S-transferase activity was reduced in patients as compared to controls. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase were similar in chronic hepatitis C and normal individuals. No statistically significant differences were found between patients and controls with regard to glutathione levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but 35 % of patients with chronic hepatitis C showed values of glutathione and oxidized glutathione which were below and above, respectively, the limits of normal controls. Finally, the glutathione synthetic capacity of the cytosol of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was significantly higher in patients than in controls, indicating increased glutathione turnover in lymphocytes from patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Suppressor cell activity was evaluated by inhibition of Con A-stimulated blast transformation and by inhibition of pokeweed mitogen-induced immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis of fresh allogeneic normal PBM in the second-set cultures. Of 29 {{patients with chronic}} active liver diseases (CALD), defective suppressor cell activities were observed in eight cases (28 %) for Ig synthesis and 16 cases (55 %) for blast transformation study. The suppressor cell activities were decreased in two (22 %) of nine cases with chronic persistent hepatitis and one (17 %) of six cases with inactive cirrhosis for both Ig synthesis and blast transformation. In contrast, suppressor activities were inducible in all nine patients with acute viral hepatitis.

40|$|Lymphocyte {{locomotion}} {{is critical}} for proper elicitation of the immune response. Locomotion of immune cells via the interstitium is essential for optimal immune function during wound healing, inflammation and infection. There are conditions which <b>alter</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> locomotion {{and one of them}} is spaceflight. Lymphocyte locomotion is severely inhibited in true spaceflight (true microgravity) and in rotating wall vessel culture (modeled microgravity). When lymphocytes are activated prior to culture in modeled microgravity, locomotion is not inhibited and the levels are comparable to those of static cultured lymphocytes. When a phorbol ester (PMA) is used in modeled microgravity, lymphocyte locomotion is restored by 87 %. This occurs regardless if PMA is added after culture in the rotating wall vessel or during culture. Inhibition of DNA synthesis also does not <b>alter</b> restoration of <b>lymphocyte</b> locomotion by PMA. PMA is a direct activator of (protein kinase C) PKC. When a calcium ionophore, ionomycin is used it does not possess any restorative properties towards locomotion either alone or collectively with PMA. Since PMA brings about restoration without help from calcium ionophores (ionomycin), it is infer-red that calcium independent PKC isoforms are involved. Changes were perceived in the protein levels of PKC 6 where levels of the protein were downregulated at 24, 72 and 96 hours in untreated rotated cultures (modeled microgravity) compared to untreated static (1 g) cultures.

The present study provides supplementary data since a deep and prolonged alteration of circulating NK cells was found. Although we did not explore this side, NK cell alterations could promote infections by opportunistic viral pathogens [33]. In contrast with the study reported by Muszynski et al.

This kinetic seems similar to that described in adult septic shock, where an increased proportion of Treg was associated with poor outcome [34]. Here, as for other lymphocyte parameters, no association with nosocomial infections was found. Additional functional testing (proliferation, intracellular cytokine production) would be likely informative and deserves to be further investigated.

Fasting venous blood was collected at baseline and at the end of twelve month study period for complete blood count analyses. Results Between the two treatment groups, the percent changes in hematological parameters, including lymphocytes, were not different. While women consuming the soy supplement had an increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width index (RDW; a marker of reticulocytes), women consuming the control diet had higher percentage of only MCHC.

This recently described primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections, lymphoproliferation, and susceptibility to herpesviruses, with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection being most notable. A broad range of PIDs having disparate, molecularly defined genetic etiology can cause susceptibility to EBV, lymphoproliferative disease, and lymphoma. Historically, PID patients with loss-of-function mutations causing defective cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antigen receptor signaling {{were found to be}} highly susceptible to pathological EBV infection. By contrast, the gain of function in PI 3 K signaling observed in APDS patients paradoxically renders these patients susceptible to EBV, though the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. At a cellular level, APDS patients exhibit deranged B lymphocyte development and defects in class switch recombination, which generally lead to defective immunoglobulin production.

Apoptosis, lymphocyte proliferation and T-cell cytokine production were determined using multiparameter flow cytometry. At concentrations of garlic compounds that did not result in significant increases in Annexin V and 7 -AAD staining of normal lymphocytes, there was a significant increase in apoptosis of ALL cells with no alteration of T-cell proliferation as determined by CD 25 /CD 69 upregulation or interferonγ, interleukin- 2 or tumor necrosis factor-α intracellular cytokine production. In contrast, the presence of chemotherapeutic agents resulted in nonselective increases in both lymphocyte and ALL apoptosis and a decrease in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.

Heterozygous truncating mutations in the CXCR 4 intracellular tail cause a rare genetic disease known as WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, myelokathexis), whose pathophysiology remains unclear. We report CXCR 4 function in 3 patients with WHIM syndrome carrying heterozygous truncating mutations of CXCR 4. We show that CXCR 4 gene mutations in WHIM patients do not affect cell surface expression of the chemokine receptor and its internalization upon stimulation with CXCL 12. Moreover, {{no significant differences in}} calcium mobilization in response to CXCL 12 are found. However, the chemotactic response of both polymorphonuclear cells and T lymphocytes in response to CXCL 12 is increased.

METH exacerbates the severity and onset of HIV- 1 -associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) through direct and indirect mechanisms. Repetitive METH use decreases adherence to antiretroviral drug regimens, increasing the likelihood of HIV- 1 disease progression towards AIDS. METH exposure also directly affects both innate and adaptive immunity, <b>altering</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> number and activity, cytokine signaling, phagocytic function, and CNS infiltration through the blood brain barrier.

Mice were exposed to IR with 2. 5 Gray (Gy) followed four days later by intratracheal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). While either IR or MRSA alone yielded 100 % survival, animals with radiation combined injury had 53 % survival (p = 0. 01). Compared to IR or MRSA alone, mice with radiation combined injury had increased gut apoptosis, local and systemic bacterial burden, decreased splenic CD 4 T cells, CD 8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, and increased BAL and systemic IL- 6 and G-CSF. In contrast, radiation combined injury did not <b>alter</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> apoptosis, pulmonary injury, or intestinal proliferation compared to IR or MRSA alone. In light of the synergistic increase in gut apoptosis following radiation combined injury, transgenic mice that overexpress Bcl- 2 in their intestine and wild type mice were subjected to IR followed by MRSA. Bcl- 2 mice had decreased gut apoptosis and improved survival compared to WT mice (92 % vs. 42 %; p, 0. 01). These dat...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) – a lysosphingolipid {{present in}} HDL – exerts atheroprotective ef- fects in vitro, while FTY 720, a non-selective S 1 P mimetic {{inhibits}} atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient (LDL-R−/−) mice {{under conditions of}} severe hypercholesterolemia. We here examined the effect of FTY 720 and a selective S 1 P receptor type 1 agonist CYM 5442 on atherosclerosis in moderately hypercholesterolemic LDL-R−/− mice. Methods and results: LDL-R−/− mice fed Western diet (0. 25 % cholesterol) were given FTY 720 (0. 4 mg/kg/day) or CYM 5442 (2. 0 mg/kg/day) for 18 weeks. FTY 720 but not CYM 5422 persistently lowered blood lympho- cytes, depleted CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in spleen and lymph nodes, and reduced splenocyte IL- 2 secretion. However, both compounds reduced the activity of splenic and peritoneal macrophages as inferred from the down-regulated CD 68 and MHC-II expression in CD 11 b+ cells and the reduced IL- 6 secretion in response to LPS, respectively. CYM 5442 and FTY 720 reduced weight gain, white adipose tissue depots and fasting glu- cose suggesting improvement of metabolic control, but failed to influence atherosclerosis in LDL-R−/− mice. Conclusion: Despite down-regulating macrophage function and – in case of FTY 720 – <b>altering</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> dis- tribution CYM 5442 and FTY 720 fail to affect atherosclerosis in moderately hypercholesterolemic LDL-R−/− mice. We hypothesize that S 1 P mimetics exert atheroprotective effects only under conditions of increased cholesterol burden exacerbating vascular inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Further {{development}} in organ transplantation requires {{the utilization of}} new immunosuppressive drugs that-in addition to being effective against rejection-do not block tolerance. We previously reported that FTY 720, a drug that <b>alters</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> trafficking, has marked anti-rejection properties. We now investigate how FTY 720 influences tolerance in a model of graft acceptance by donor-specific blood transfusion (DSBT). Two different transplant models [...] heart transplantation (Htx) and intestinal transplantation (Itx) [...] were studied. We performed orthotopic Itx and heterotopic Htx using fully mismatched inbred male RA (RT 1 (p)) and PVG (RT 1 (c)) rats as donors and recipients. Tolerance was induced by DSBT on pre-transplant day - 12. To test the effect of FTY 720 on DSBT-induced tolerance, we administered FTY 720 orally prior to DSBT. Itx: control rats succumbed to rejection at 18 +/- 4 days. DSBT alone prolonged survival to 101. 9 +/- 18 days (P 120 days) and induced tolerance (acceptance of secondary donor-specific Htx). Unlike in Itx, adjunction of FTY 720 prior to DSBT did not reduce Htx survival. Acceptance of secondary donor-specific Htx was not influenced by FTY 720. In Itx, FTY 720 counteracts the beneficial effect of pre-transplant DSBT and triggers acute rejection of primary, but not secondary grafts. In Htx, however, FTY 720 allows full development of tolerance. The mechanisms by which FTY 720 causes rejection in primary intestinal but not in heart grafts need to be elucidated. status: publishe...|$|R

A number of murine {{studies have demonstrated that}} loss of CD 44 expression by T lymphocytes resulted in a delayed migration to sites of inflammation. However, migration to lymph nodes was normal (Camp et al., 1993; Stoop et al., 2002), suggesting that this adhesion receptor is required for T cell migration under inflammatory conditions. In this study, the responses of human T cells following cross-linking of CD 44 were examined. Engagement of the CD 44 receptor using immobilised monoclonal antibody induced cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell polarisation. Further analysis demonstrated that these changes in morphology were accompanied by active migration. Further investigation was carried out using pharmacological inhibitors to determine the signal-transduction pathways switched on following engagement of CD 44. In particular, the roles of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and the lipid kinase, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) were examined. Go 6976, a selective inhibitor of classical PKC isozymes, suppressed lymphocyte polarisation and migration following CD 44 ligation. However, selective inhibition of PKC 5, using rottlerin, reduced CD 44 - activated migration but did not completely ablate it. Two inhibitors of PI 3 -kinase were used to examine {{the role of}} this lipid kinase in CD 44 -induced migration. The competitive inhibitor, Ly 294, 002, suppressed lymphocyte polarisation. However, wortmannin did not significantly <b>alter</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> morphology in response to CD 44 engagement...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of inflammatory and immune cells {{is sensitive to}} change according to the fatty acid composition of the diet. In particular, the proportion {{of different types of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in these cells is readily changed, and this provides a link between dietary PUFA intake, inflammation, and immunity. The n- 6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds, which have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of immunity. Fish oil contains the n- 3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators. In addition, EPA is a substrate for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase and gives rise to mediators that often have different biological actions or potencies than those formed from AA. Animal studies have shown that dietary fish oil results in <b>altered</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function and in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Supplementation of the diet of healthy human volunteers with fish oil-derived n- 3 PUFA results in decreased monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune disease. Clinical studies have reported that fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n- 3 PUFA in fish oil are anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory...|$|R
40|$|Immunofluorescence {{was used}} to {{determine}} the relative percentages of T and B lymphocytes found in the lungs of normal and Mycoplasma pulmonis-infected F 344 rats. Lymphocytes recovered from controls were approximately 25 % T, 25 % B, and 50 % unclassified mononuclear cells. Infected animals had a 2. 6 -fold greater number of T cells and IgA-bearing cells, and a 1. 6 -fold greater number of unclassified mononuclear cells. These studies show that M. pulmonis infection significantly <b>alters</b> lung <b>lymphocyte</b> populations both quantitatively and in subpopulation distribution. Therefore, future studies of rat lung lymphocytes should utilize animals known to be free of this ubiquitous respiratory pathogen...|$|R
