40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{study the}} role of multidetector CT {{angiography}} in diagnosis, and follow up of venous and arterial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomalies</b> in pediatrics. Subjects and methodsRetrospective study was conducted upon 53 consecutive pediatric patients (24 F and 29 M, aged 4 days to 5 years; mean age 11. 78 months). CT examinations were done using 16 -section CT scanner with a detector collimation of 16 × 0. 75 mm, pitch of 0. 6, and gantry rotation time of 0. 5 s. Anatomic coverage extended from above the thoracic inlet to {{below the level of}} the L 2 vertebra to include the origin of celiac trunk. Timed injection method was used. Post processing Image reconstruction was done in 3 D volume rendering and maximum intensity projection (MIP). ResultsThe arterial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomalies</b> were more common than <b>pulmonary</b> venous <b>anomalies,</b> combined arterial and venous anomalies were seen in five cases and two cases had more than one type of <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>anomalies.</b> The commonest <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>anomaly</b> was atresia, followed by stenosis then hypoplasia. The commonest venous <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomaly</b> was supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Microbiologic confirmation of pneumonia was defined by the presence of at least 1 potentially pathogenic microorganism (PPM) in respiratory samples above predefined thresholds (for bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, > 104  CFU/mL; for sputum or tracheobronchial aspirate specimens, 105  CFU/mL). Microbial identification and susceptibility testing are detailed elsewhere [12]. Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis episodes were not included in the study.

Only 10 patients underwent cardiac catheterization. ResultsOur initial experience showed that MSCT is capable of complementing echocardiography and replacing diagnostic cardiac catheterization for anatomical delineation if performed with an optimum technique.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] The aim {{of the study was}} to identify diagnoses that are confused with pulmonary tuberculosis in children. Design. Prospective, investigative clinical study. Setting. Tertiary care teaching hospital and an urban tuberculosis clinic in an area with a very high incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (> 800 new cases/ 100 000 /year). Patients. Children suspected of having tuberculosis, children followed up for pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia and children with congenital <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomalies</b> were investigated. Intervention(s), None. Outcome measure. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed using modified World Health Organisation criteria and the diagnoses of those children not suffering - from pulmonary tuberculosis were analysed. Results. Of the 354 children initially suspected of suffering from tuberculosis 71 (20 %) were found to be suffering from other pulmonary disease, viz. pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (29 %), bronchopneumonia with wheezing (18 %), and asthma with lobar or segmental collapse (12 %). Of 14 children suffering from pulmonary infiltrates with peripheral eosinophilia 6 (43 %) were initially incorrectly diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis. Of 54 children with congenital <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomalies,</b> 8 (15 %) were treated for tuberculosis before the correct diagnosis was made. Congenital anomalies most often confused with tuberculosis were unilateral lung hypoplasia, bronchogenic cyst and tracheal bronchus with an; anomalous lobe. Conclusions. The criteria for diagnosing tuberculosis in children is complicated in areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis and poor socio-economic circumstances where many children presenting with conditions other than tuberculosis will be in contact with an adult case of pulmonary tuberculosis. The commonest conditions confused with tuberculosis are pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and asthma. Pulmonary infiltrates with peripheral eosinophilia and congenital lung abnormalities should be considered especially if the children have an atypical clinical picture or do not respond to tuberculosis treatment.

It is a „re-emerging disease“ in humans and dogs. The aims {{of this study were}} 1) to evaluate distribution of Leptospira serogroups in dogs with leptospirosis from North East Germany (2006 - 2013) and to link specific serogroups with particular clinical manifestations, 2) to analyse epidemiological data and to define risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs, 3) to describe clinical, laboratory and radiological features and outcome in dogs with leptospirosis and 4) to examine negative prognostic factors (clinical signs, laboratory and radiological findings) in dogs with leptospirosis. 1) 526 dogs suspicious for leptospirosis were presented at the small animal clinic between April 2006 and March 2013. The dogs were tested for leptospirosis and 99 dogs met the inclusion criteria. Diagnoses were based on microscopic agglutination testing (MAT; n= 55), blood/urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR; n= 22), MAT and PCR-results (n= 15) and histopathology (Levaditi staining; n= 7). Grippotyphosa (65 %), Australis (61 %) and Pomona (60 %) were the most common serogroups with the highest MAT titers. Serogroup distribution in dogs with leptospirosis from North East Germany changed only slightly in the last seven years. Serogroup-specific evaluation revealed a possible link between thrombocytopenia and Pomona infection and <b>radiological</b> <b>pulmonary</b> changes and Australis/Grippotyphosa infection. 2) Most of the dogs in this study were presented from August to October, in warm, moist weather conditions. Affected dogs often drank from ponds (67 %), lived in rural or suburban regions (62 %) and had regularly contact to standing water, lakes or streams (62 %). Contact with rodents and wild boars or their urine were also often described (46 %). 80 % of the dogs with leptospirosis were regularly vaccinated. 3) At initial presentation, the most common clinical findings were lethargy (96 %), anorexia (88 %), vomitus (85 %), a painful abdomen (39 %), diarrhea (38 %), oliguria (27 %), tachypnea (26 %), delayed capillary refill time (18 %), pale mucous membranes (17 %), fever (15 %), hypothermia (15 %) and icteric mucous membranes (10 %). Abnormal findings of the CBC on admission included anemia (63 %), thrombocytopenia (62 %) and leukocytosis (57 %). Biochemistry abnormalities included increased urea (84 %) and creatinine concentrations (82 %), elevated liver enzyme activities (80 %), hyperbilirubinemia (70 %), hyperphosphatemia (67 %), hyponatremia (63 %) and hypoalbuminemia (55 %). In the course of disease leukocytosis (87 %), anemia (85 %) and thrombocytopenia (75 %) were the most common findings of the CBC. Biochemistry abnormalities included increased creatinine (95 %) and urea concentrations (93 %), elevated liver enzyme activities (93 %), hyperbilirubinemia (87 %), hyponatremia (81 %), hypoalbuminemia (80 %) and hyperphosphatemia (75 %). Urinalysis often revealed glucosuria (77 %) and an elevated urine-protein/creatinine-ratio (U-P/U-C; 75 %). <b>Radiological</b> <b>pulmonary</b> changes were detected in 57 % of the dogs during the progression of disease. Based on clinical, laboratory and radiological changes in the majority of patients renal (95 %) and/or hepatic (93 %) disease was detected. A pulmonary form of leptospirosis was present in 57 % of the dogs. In the course of disease, 99 % of the dogs had a multi-organ involvement. Kidneys/liver/lungs, kidneys/liver, kidneys/lungs or liver/lungs were affected in 49, 5 %, 41, 4 %, 5, 1 % or 3 % of the dogs, respectively. One dog (1 %) had only liver insufficiency. 67 dogs survived. 32 dogs died or had to be euthanized, 24 of them (75 %) due to “leptospiral pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome” (LPHS). In conclusion, lung involvement represented a severe complication causing increased mortality. 4) Severe dyspnea (odds ratio {OR}= 16; p-value< 0. 001), high-grade increased bilirubin (OR= 6; p= 0. 001) and creatinine values (OR= 5; p= 0. 001) as well as <b>radiological</b> <b>pulmonary</b> changes grade 3 (generalized severe reticulonodular interstitial pattern with patchy alveolar consolidations) (OR= 19; p< 0. 001) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. In multiple linear regression, dogs with renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement had the highest risk of letality (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, severely increased creatinine concentrations in combination with severe thrombocytopenia (OR= 4; p= 0. 006) or high-grade elevated liver enzyme activities (OR= 4; p= 0. 004) were significantly associated with letality in dogs with leptospirosis...|$|R
40|$|A 83 -year-old healthy female with no past {{medical history}} {{presented}} with persistent hemoptysis and respiratory failure. She {{was found to}} have a tracheal bronchus on bronchoscopy. Patient underwent pulmonary lavage and sterile irrigation. Patient was stable, but developed excessive hemoptysis which prompted a repeat, emergent, bronchoscopy was performed to advance the ET tube to isolate the left lung from the bleeding right lung. Despite the effort taken, the patient became pulseless from the hypoxia caused by blood spillover into the entire tracheobronchial field. ACLS protocol initiated without successful ROSC. Tracheal bronchus is uncommon but when present patients usually develop recurrent pulmonary symptoms at a younger age which require extensive workup which can lead to discovery of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anomalies.</b> In our patient, she has no recurrent pulmonary symptoms as a child nor as an adult. We suspect the reason to this is the normal size diameter of the bronchus that connects the accessary lobe to the trachea. There are a few Medical conditions that may present with hemoptysis. When there is persistent, new onset hemoptysis in an otherwise healthy individual there should be no hesitation in performing the necessary procedural studies to reach a diagnosis...|$|R
