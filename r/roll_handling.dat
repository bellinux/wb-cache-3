40|$|Active inceptors offer great {{potential}} for improving the handling qualities of fly-by-wire rotorcraft. In a cooperative research effort, the DLR Institute of Flight Systems in Germany and the U. S. Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) conducted several in-flight experiments to study {{the influence of the}} dynamic characteristics (natural frequency and damping) of the cyclic stick on the overall handling qualities of a rotorcraft. Experiments were performed looking at sidestick (DLR) and centerstick (AFDD) inceptors for Rate and Attitude Command response types. The results of two different experiments are presented in this paper. The first experiment evaluated the <b>roll</b> <b>handling</b> in forward flight and was only performed with a sidestick inceptor. The task used in this experiment was designed during exercises of the Empire Test Pilots’ School (ETPS) on DLR’s Flying Helicopter Simulator EC 135 ACT/FHS. ETPS also contributed to the optimization of the static sidestick characteristics that were used for the testing. The second, more comprehensive experiment, evaluating ADS- 33 Hover and Slalom Mission Task Elements, was performed both with a sidestick and a centerstick allowing a direct comparison of both types of inceptors. Regression analyses are performed on the collected pilot ratings to gain a systematic insight into the preferred stick characteristics for the different inceptor and response types. The test results consistently suggest that the preferred characteristics are best described by a first-order response model...|$|E

In this study theoretical and empirical methods were used, theoretical calculations are confirmed by field experiment. Based on theoretical approaches were formed and justified a general outline of aircraft. During the work was used a complex method of decision-making based on expert analysis. For this was defined a list of criteria that most accurately describes the requirements for object of development, calculated numerical values of the coefficients weight bi and numerical values ti of each criterion for a particular layout. In the analysis was founded that the most rational aerodynamic layout for a "tandem" or "duck" with a total normalized value 0. 8145. Determination of design parameters were based on a region of acceptable rational values of design options 6 specific wing load and energy available. Field of values formed with consideration of general requirements and restrictions placed for the aircraft. Considering layout restrictions layout of unmanned aircraft was designed and main geometrical characteristics was calculated. Consideration of the impact of geometric parameters on the characteristics of stability was conducted on based of developed mathematical model. Verification of the mathematical model was conducted in a wind tunnel AT- 1 ("Antonov"). To determine characteristics of lateral stability were tested model schemes "tandem" with the various positions of the wings: longitudinal making wings was varied (390, 490 and 590 mm), angle ?

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} LPV/Hinf fault {{tolerant}} control strategy for <b>roll</b> dynamics <b>handling</b> under semi-active damper's malfunction. Indeed, {{in case of}} damper's malfunction, a lateral load transfer is generated, that amplifies the risks of vehicle roll over. In this study, the suspension systems efficiency is monitored through the lateral (or longitudinal) load transfer induced by a damper's malfunction. The information given by the monitoring system is used in a partly fixed LPV/Hinf controller structure that allows to manage {{the distribution of the}} four dampers forces in order to handle the over load caused by one damper's malfunction. The proposed LPV/Hinf controller then uses the 3 remaining healthy semi-active dampers in a real time reconfiguration. Moreover, the performances of the car vertical dynamics (roll, bounce, pitch) are adapted to the varying parameter given by the monitoring of the suspension system efficiency, which allows to modify online the damping properties (soft/hard) to limit the induced load transfer. Simulations are performed on a complex nonlinear full vehicle model, equipped by 4 magneto-rheological semi-active dampers. This vehicle undergoes critical driving situations, and only one damper is considered faulty at ones. The simulation results show the reliability and the robustness of the proposed solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of fluidic X-coupling of hydro-pneumatic suspension struts {{on the various}} suspension properties are investigated for a sport utility vehicle (SUV). The stiffness and damping properties in the bounce, pitch, roll and warp modes are particularly addressed together with the couplings between the roll, pitch, bounce and warp modes of the vehicle. The proposed X-coupled suspension configuration involves diagonal hydraulic couplings among the different chambers of the four hydro-pneumatic struts. The static and dynamic forces developed by the struts of the unconnected and X-coupled suspensions are formulated using a simple generalized model, which are subsequently used to derive the stiffness and damping properties. The properties of the X-coupled suspension are {{compared with those of}} the unconnected suspension configuration, in terms of four fundamental vibration modes, namely bounce, roll, pitch and warp, to illustrate the significant effects of fluidic couplings. The results suggest that the X-coupling could help achieve greater roll and pitch stiffness and damping, with negligible effects on the bounce and warp mode properties. It is further shown that the X-coupled struts offer greater design flexibility to achieve better compromise among different conflicting measures. From the results, it was concluded that the proposed X-coupling of the suspension struts could help achieve improved <b>roll</b> stability, <b>handling</b> and pitch control, without sacrificing the bounce ride quality and road-holding performance of SUVs during both the on- and off-road driving conditions...|$|R

Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs {{with varying degrees of}} bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes.Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle <b>roll</b> cages, <b>handles,</b> lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application.CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements.The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean bending radius Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the pressure die is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and ovalization. For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the mandrel, and the wiper die (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products.|$|R

Subsequently, the introduction of night-vision goggles increased the BLACK HAWK'S mission effectiveness, but the accident rate also increased. The increased accident rate is strongly tied to increased pilot workload {{as a result of}} a degradation in visual cues. Over twenty years of research in helicopter flight control and handling qualities has shown that these degraded handling qualities can be recovered by modifying the response type of the helicopter in low speed flight. Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation initiated a project under the National Rotorcraft Technology Center (NRTC) to develop modern flight control laws while utilizing the existing partial authority Stability Augmentation System (SAS) of the BLACK HAWK. This effort resulted in a set of Modernized Control Laws (MCLAWS) that incorporate rate command and attitude command response types. Sikorsky and the US Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) conducted a piloted simulation on the NASA-Ames Vertical h 4 otion Simulator, to assess potential handling qualities and to reduce the risk of subsequent implementation and flight test of these modern control laws on AFDD's EH- 60 L helicopter.

40|$|Texto en inglés y resumen en inglés y españolRecent {{studies have}} {{identified}} inattention (including distraction and drowsiness) {{as the main}} cause of accidents, being responsible of at least 25 % of them. Driving distraction has been less studied, since it is more diverse and exhibits a higher risk factor than fatigue. In addition, it is present over half of the inattention involved crashes. The increased presence of In Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) adds to the potential distraction risk and modifies driving behaviour, and thus research on this issue is of vital importance. Many researchers have been working on different approaches to deal with distraction during driving. Among them, Computer Vision {{is one of the most}} common, because it allows for a cost effective and non-invasive driver monitoring and sensing. Using Computer Vision techniques it is possible to evaluate some facial movements that characterise the state of attention of a driver. This thesis presents methods to estimate the face pose and gaze direction of a person in real-time, using a stereo camera as a basic for assessing driver distractions. The methods are completely automatic and user-independent. A set of features in the face are identified at initialisation, and used to create a sparse 3 D model of the face. These features are tracked from frame to frame, and the model is augmented to cover parts of the face that may have been occluded before. The algorithm is designed to work in a naturalistic driving simulator, which presents challenging low light conditions. We evaluate several techniques to detect features on the face that can be matched between cameras and tracked with success. Well-known methods such as SURF do not return good results, due to the lack of salient points in the face, as well as the low illumination of the images. We introduce a novel multisize technique, based on Harris corner detector and patch correlation. This technique benefits from the better performance of small patches under rotations and illumination changes, and the more robust correlation of the bigger patches under motion blur. The head rotates in a range of ± 90 º in the yaw angle, and the appearance of the features change noticeably. To deal with these changes, we implement a new re-registering technique that captures new textures of the features as the face rotates. These new textures are incorporated to the model, which mixes the views of both cameras. The captures are taken at regular angle intervals for rotations in yaw, so that each texture is only used in a range of ± 7. 5 º around the capture angle. Rotations in pitch and <b>roll</b> are <b>handled</b> using affine patch warping. The 3 D model created at initialisation can only take features in the frontal part of the face, and some of these may occlude during rotations. The accuracy and robustness of the face tracking depends on the number of visible points, so new points are added to the 3 D model when new parts of the face are visible from both cameras. Bundle adjustment is used to reduce the accumulated drift of the 3 D reconstruction. We estimate the pose from the position of the features in the images and the 3 D model using POSIT or Levenberg-Marquardt. A RANSAC process detects incorrectly tracked points, which are not considered for pose estimation. POSIT is faster, while LM obtains more accurate results. Using the model extension and the re-registering technique, we can accurately estimate the pose in the full head rotation range, with error levels that improve the state of the art. A coarse eye direction is composed with the face pose estimation to obtain the gaze and driver's fixation area, parameter which gives much information about the distraction pattern of the driver. The resulting gaze estimation algorithm proposed in this thesis has been tested on a set of driving experiments directed by a team of psychologists in a naturalistic driving simulator. This simulator mimics conditions present in real driving, including weather changes, manoeuvring and distractions due to IVIS. Professional drivers participated in the tests. The driver?s fixation statistics obtained with the proposed system show how the utilisation of IVIS influences the distraction pattern of the drivers, increasing reaction times and affecting the fixation of attention on the road and the surroundings...|$|R
40|$|For {{offshore}} installation projects Jumbo uses her J-class {{heavy lift crane}} vessels. The objects {{that need to be}} installed offshore are carried at deck or in the ship's hull. At location the object is lifted by the on-board heavy lift crane and slewed {{to the side of the}} ship. From the final overboard position the object can be lowered to the seabed. When the load is displaces by the slewing crane, the equilibrium of moments is disrupted and the ship will roll or heel. To reduce this moment change the ship pumps ballast water from one side to the other and causes a counter moment. This simple system has limited capacities and it was assumed that an improvement could reduce the duration of the lifting phase. This thesis is about a research to decrease the duration of the lifting phase for the Jumbo J-class, focussing on anti-heeling. To understand the context of the problem, research has been done on the company and the market she is operating in. Then the phenomenon of anti-heeling, the current ballast system and the operational limits were analysed. With the information obtained from this research a list of requirements and the load cases were selected. The analysis showed that the current system capacity is based on three manual controlled centrifugal pumps that can either been switch on or off. This system cannot easily vary the moment change and was believed to be limiting for lift operations. To find a new solution design methods are used to generate a variety of concepts. For five concept calculation has been done to predict their capacity and dimensions. The analysis showed that a new solution is unlikely to be financially attractive for the market Jumbo is operating in. Therefore the decision has been made to research the effects of the most economical potential solution. Variably frequency drives were applied to the pump system to see if the variations of the rotational speed of the pumps and therefore varying the flow rate would make easier to control the roll motions. Or even shorten the lift phase. To examine the ballast system and the sensitivities a model has been made. As this research focused on roll and heeling motions only, a 2 D model is used to predict heave, sway and roll motions. The model is based on the equilibrium of moments where the ship is exposed to wave induced moments and the moments caused by the crane and ballast system. The crane and ballast system are effected by the ship motions and therefore coupled to these motions. The model allows to automate the control of the crane motions and the pump rotations. This allowed the model to test different lift scenarios under different wave conditions. The results showed that the variable frequency drivers can result in smaller differences of the heeling angles. But the results also showed that the ballast system was not the most important limiting factor. It was the moment change caused by the crane. When the crane tip with hanging load was displaced with a certain speed, it caused an impulse making the ship oscillate around the static heeling angle. The amplitudes of these oscillations and the static heeling angle could be reduced by the ballast system. But the best results were shown when the stability properties of the vessel were improved. Increasing the effective metacentric height from 2. 25 to 3. 25 showed significantly reduce roll excitations. Other conclusions are that previously very conservative roll angles of 1 o were used, while the mast crane proved to <b>handle</b> <b>roll</b> angles of 4 o and larger depending on the load. Also the lay out of the current pump system leaves a lot of room of improvement. These improvements can be found in the recommendations as well as suggestions how to discover potential time savings during offshore operations.
