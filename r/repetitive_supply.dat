40|$|Extant {{research}} has made many advances {{in our understanding}} of how relatively stable, <b>repetitive</b> <b>supply</b> chains (SCs) can be run effectively. This study focuses on the less researched SCs that are not stable or repetitive. To capture the management challenges of this type of SC, a definition of "messy supply chains" (MSCs) for SCs presenting "wicked" (Rittel and Webber, 2007) or "messy" problems (Ackoff, 1981) is proposed. A conceptual framework is explored {{in the context of the}} literature on humanitarian operations. This framework will form the foundation of an in-depth examination of MSCs to aid research and managerial practice. Keywords: suppl...|$|E
40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{is widely}} used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive {{uncertain}} data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. This is due to repetitive readings which are unnecessary because it contains only the same information. Thus, an approach to remove <b>repetitive</b> readings in <b>supply</b> chain is paramount to minimize massive data storage that could affect query performances. We propose a simplified approach, which is suitable {{for a wide range}} of application scenarios. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the removing duplicate readings and compressing the massive data significantl...|$|R
40|$|Tumisa (5, 658 m) is a Pleistocene {{composite}} volcano {{located in}} the western margin of the Upper Cenozoic volcanic chain of the CVZ in northern Chile. It consists of a ~ 25 km[sup] 3 non-welded deposit of block-and-ash flow and small-volume ignimbrites, small flank domes and a double peak formed by two cones, the younger a composite of lava flows and domes. The lava flows, domes and blocks of the pyroclastic flows are coarse-grained, crystal-rich dacite (host lava) with dominant plagioclase (An[sub] 30 - 50) and magnesio-hornblendes with different proportions of orthopyroxene (En[sub] 62 - 68), biotite and quartz phenocryts. Accesory phases include Fe-Ti oxides and apatite. These mineral assemblage coexist in disequilibrium with Mg-olivine and Mg-orthopyroxene. In addition to disequilibrium textures and mineral assemblages, there are widespread fine-grained, dark mafic inclusions. The inclusions are interpreted as blobs of hot (> 1100 °C) basic magma containing < 5 % crystals (Mg-olivine, Mg-orthopyroxene, Cr-rich spinel), which quenched on intrusion into a cool (~ 770 °C), wet dacitic magma in a shallow level chamber (4 - 14 km). <b>Repetitive</b> <b>supplies</b> of the basic magma from depth triggered eruptions in a slowly cooling magma chamber. Mingling and partial hybridization of compositionally distinct multiple end-members was the dominant evolutionary process, combined with limited fractional crystallization, mainly in the basic magma. Post-mixing crystallization produced strongly contrasting mineral compositions due to temperature and compositional gradients. Calcic plagioclase (An[sub] 50 - 74) and low-SiO[sub] 2 /high-TiO[sub] 2 hornblende crystallized as prismatic or acicular aggregates in the inclusions (hyalodoleritic textures), as thin reversely zoned rims on resorbed phenocrysts and as groundmass grains. Clinopyroxene formed as acicular crystals in the inclusions, groundmass grains in the dacites and as reaction coronas around quartz. Mechanical transfer of phenocrysts between the two magmas and partial hybridization shifted whole-rock compositions (58. 9 - 66. 2 % SiO[sub] 2 for the host lavas; 52. 7 - 58. 4 % SiO[sub] 2 for the inclusions). The compositions are typical of normal calc-alkaline volcanoes from the western margin in the Central Andes. Isotopic ratios ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr: 0. 7055 - 0. 70683; [sup] 143 Nd/ [sup] 144 Nd: 0. 51239 to 0. 51255, [epsilon][sup]Nd: - 2. 1 to - 4. 8) are within the normal range for parental magmas in this region and reflect minimal interaction with crustal material...|$|R

40|$|A {{family of}} new {{supplies}} for powering superconducting magnets {{was developed in}} our institutes. As an example, two supplies are described in the paper. One of the supplies uses superconducting, another-semiconductor-based <b>repetitive</b> switches. Both <b>supplies</b> are able to generate 1 Volt at the high-current side. Magnets to be powered by the supplies are made with Nb 3 Sn and NbTi wires, operate at 600 and 300 Amps, have inductances of 1. 2 and 1. 3 Henry and generate magnetic fields of 12 and 7 Tesla, respectively. Both magnets operate art 4 Kelvin and are bath-cooled. So far the power supplies were tested at the operating temperature using a small sc magnet as a load. Expected load curves, while ramping the current of the real magnets, are also discussed. A comparison between these sc supplies and a conventional system based on a room temperature power supply with (high-Tc) current leads is mad...|$|R
