5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} to <b>rage</b> <b>in</b> the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of the groundwork for this project.|$|E

5|$|Calliope– Kratos' daughter. As an infant, she was {{stricken}} with the plague and {{was to be}} killed due to Sparta's law. Calliope was saved by Kratos when he obtained the Ambrosia of Asclepius, but was eventually killed with her mother by Kratos during a berserker <b>rage</b> <b>in</b> a temple dedicated to Athena. Kratos was briefly reunited with Calliope in the Underworld in the Fields of Elysium, but was forced to abandon her {{to save the world}} from Persephone and Atlas. Kratos later found a note from her in the Underworld, and when Kratos entered into his psyche during his final fight with Zeus, he was spiritually reunited with both Lysandra and Calliope. The character was voiced by Debi Derryberry in Chains of Olympus and God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis <b>Rage.</b> <b>In</b> addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as a}} lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E
5|$|Back in Dawson Creek in November, the Rage split {{a three-game}} {{series against the}} Monsters, 1-1-1, and won both games against the Chicago Hitmen. Following another 6-game road trip to Alaska, the Rage {{continued}} into December winning approximately one-in-three games, with an 11-22-2 record near the mid-season break, when they traded their 20-year-old captain, Blaine Bokenfohr, to the Merritt Centennials in exchange for future considerations. Scott Fellnermayr became the new captain of the Rage, and would remain the captain {{for the remainder of}} the season and the next. In January, the Rage split two-game series against the Wild and split another in Chicago. The team put together a six-game winning streak in January–February, winning games against the Brown Bears and the Avalanche before splitting a two-game series with the Monsters. On their next road trip, they lost their two games against the Wild and won the next three against the Monsters. The season ended in early March with <b>Rage</b> <b>in</b> fifth place with a 24-31-3 record, in the six-team West division.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{prior to}} the success of The Ultimate Fighter reality show that {{launched}} mixed martial arts into the mainstream media, there was no major coverage of female competitions.

25|$|Additionally, Baring's {{policy of}} raising {{taxes to pay}} off the debts Isma'il had run up sparked much resentment in both Egypt and the Sudan. In 1882, {{nationalist}} <b>rage</b> <b>in</b> Egypt against Baring's economic policies led to the revolt by Colonel Urabi Pasha, which was put down by British troops. From September 1882 onwards, Egypt was a de facto British protectorate effectively ruled by Baring, through in theory Egypt remained an Ottoman province with a very wide degree of autonomy until 1914. With Egypt under British rule, the British also inherited the problems of Egypt's colony, the Sudan, which the Egyptians were losing control of to the Mahdi.|$|E
25|$|Corey's {{political}} path {{took another}} detour {{in the latter}} part of 1936, when he moved again away from the CPUSA's orbit and began an association with the dissident Communist movement around expelled party leader Jay Lovestone. The so-called Lovestoneites embraced the fundamental tenets of Marxism, but oriented themselves towards the American trade union movement and away from foreign domination of the International Communist movement and its centrally-determined obsession with advancing the foreign policy interests of the USSR. With secret police terror beginning to <b>rage</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union from 1936 onwards, the Lovestone political organization's criticism of the USSR became increasingly harsh and its appreciation of American institutions more pronounced — a perspective which Corey himself shared.|$|E
