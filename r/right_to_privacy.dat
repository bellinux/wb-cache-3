5|$|In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court {{decision}} Griswold v. Connecticut overturned a {{state law}} prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> for marital relationships. In 1971, Eisenstadt v. Baird extended this <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> to single people.|$|E
5|$|The author {{questions}} {{the actions of}} the media with respect to privacy. He observes that public expectations regarding morality and what constitutes an impermissible violation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> has changed over time. Lewis cites the dissenting opinion by Brandeis in Olmstead v. United States, which supported a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court {{found that}} a Texas law against {{same-sex}} sexual intercourse violated the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b> In Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included same-sex couples being able to marry.|$|E

5|$|The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> is not {{explicitly}} {{identified in the}} U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b> The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ginsburg did answer {{questions}} about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality. Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written. The U.S. Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote and she took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy,</b> voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Ravin v. State was a 1975 {{decision}} by the Alaska Supreme Court that held the Alaska Constitution's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> protects an adult's ability to use and possess {{a small amount of}} marijuana in the home for personal use. The Alaska Supreme Court thereby became the first—and only—state or federal court to announce a constitutional privacy right that protects some level of marijuana use and possession.|$|E
5|$|The Third Amendment {{has been}} invoked {{in a few}} {{instances}} as helping establish an implicit <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> in the Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along {{with others in the}} Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which cited the Third Amendment as implying a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> is {{one area}} of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as {{to the extent to which}} a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York {{public schools in}} 1921. The ACLU, working with the NAACP, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not {{make an effort to}} defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, government search and seizure issues, <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy,</b> or wiretapping.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b> The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E
50|$|Both of {{the laws}} were criticized in 2012 by the London-based {{association}} advocating for free expression Article 19, which considered that they lack provisions {{to ensure that the}} <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> and freedom of expression and information are appropriately balanced.|$|R

5|$|On 16 August 2007, Odex {{initiated}} {{legal action}} against a third Internet Service Provider, Pacific Internet. Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the personal information of about 1,000 subscribers. The closed-door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts, where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet {{did not have to}} reveal its subscribers' personal information. Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application, despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios. The decision came as a surprise to many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex the court order, he warned that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E
5|$|Another related {{investigation}} {{involved the}} fate of the children of captured pregnant guerrillas, who were given up for adoption by the military junta. An estimated 500 children were involved. The investigation became controversial during the Kirchner administration, as those involved had become adults and some of them refused to participate in DNA testing. One of those cases was the Noble siblings case, involving the adopted sons of Ernestina Herrera de Noble, owner of the Clarín newspaper. The Kirchners advanced a bill in Congress to make the genetic testing of suspected victims mandatory. Although the measure had popular support, critics considered it a breach of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy,</b> and politically motivated because of a dispute between Kirchner and the Clarín newspaper. The Noble siblings tests in 2011 were negative, and the case was closed in January 2016, after Kirchner left the presidency. Hilario Bacca, a confirmed son of disappeared guerrillas, appealed a judicial ruling that sought to change his name, asking to keep the name he had been using.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy, there can be no violation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy</b> (see Alarcon v. Murphy, 201 Cal.App.3d 1, 5 (Cal. Ct.

25|$|During {{a hearing}} in November 2004, Zicari's lawyer H. Louis Sirkin argued that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy,</b> {{recently}} confirmed and strengthened in Lawrence v. Texas, gave individuals the constitutional right to view offending materials in private, a right which cannot be meaningfully exercised without a corresponding right of companies to distribute such materials.

Dronenburg argued that his discharge violated his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b> This argument was rejected in an opinion written by Bork and joined by Antonin Scalia, in which Bork critiqued the line of Supreme Court cases upholding a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>privacy.</b>|$|E
