5|$|David Gilliland, who had {{the pole}} position, was passed {{immediately}} by teammate Dale Jarrett. The race lead changed 63 times, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading for the most laps (37). Earnhardt was leading on the final lap when he and Jimmie Johnson crashed after Vickers made contact with Johnson's right <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> causing the race to end under caution flag conditions. Vickers (Johnson's teammate) was determined the race winner by NASCAR and was later criticized since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Only a {{few changes}} {{were made to the}} 1978 VAM Gremlin. The {{dashboard}} design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the [...] "Gremlin X" [...] logo on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with other}} 1969 GM vehicles, locking {{steering}} columns {{were incorporated into}} the Nova. Simulated air extractor/vents were added below the Nova script, which was relocated to the front fender behind the wheelwell instead of the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> The [...] V8 with four-barrel carburetor that came standard with the SS option was revised with a [...] increase to , while a two-barrel carbureted version of the [...] V8 rated at [...] was a new option on non-SS models. The SS option price remained US$312 A new Turbo-Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic was made available for non-SS Novas with six-cylinder and V8 engines, although the older two-speed Powerglide continued to be available on the smaller-engined Novas. 1969 SS models were the first Nova SS models to have standard front disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury Sable is {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus sold under Ford's near-luxury Mercury brand. Developed jointly with the Taurus, the Sable shared most {{mechanical}} components but had a unique body and interior and a longer length. The Sable had an exterior design that was arguably more experimental than the Taurus, featuring rear windows that wrapped around the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and a front [...] "lightbar", a low-wattage lamp between the front headlamps, which later became a signature styling feature for all Mercury models through the early 1990s. Intended for a more upscale market, it was available in two models, base GS and high-end LS in sedan and station wagon body styles. Powertrain choices were the same, though no manual transmission was offered. The Sable was sold as the Ford Taurus in Mexico, New Zealand and western Europe. The first-generation Sable and Taurus were produced concurrently through the 1991 model year.|$|E
2500|$|The final B-body Caprice was {{not well}} {{received}} by critics and did not hold on to high sales numbers. The car's styling was criticized with car aficionados calling it a [...] "beached whale" [...] and [...] "an upside-down bathtub". For 1993 there were some revisions, the most obvious being {{the removal of the}} skirted rear wheel wells in favor of more conventional, open wheel wells. This applied only to the sedan model; station wagons retained the skirted wheel wells. A final appearance tweak appeared on the 1995 Caprice sedan {{in the form of a}} restyled side window between the back door and C pillar (windows on Caprices of the generation through 1994 were triangular, but the 1995 window had 4 sides and lacked the sharp corner pointed toward the rear), and the wagon was given the same mirrors as the sedan. In 1996 the Impala SS was exported to Middle Eastern markets badged as the Caprice SS, with the car being identical to its American counterpart except for the side fonts on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> & the badge on the dashboard saying Caprice SS.|$|E
5000|$|The 1986 model saw wider flared {{wheel wells}} {{as well as}} body-color bumpers, and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> were {{designed}} specifically to accommodate factory ground effect style side skirts. 1986 turbo models were equipped with an ordinary hood, markedly losing the turbo [...] "scoop" [...] on the driver's side.|$|R
50|$|Visually, the two {{commercial}} vehicles, the Utility and Panel Van, remained {{almost identical}} to the previous model, the FB. In fact, the FB <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and tail lights were carried over to the EK commercials. The carrying capacity was however increased from 8 cwt to 10 cwt by fitting upgraded springs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, due to Boudreaux's Butt Paste ads on the car, Ray's No. 90 Ford {{was named}} the fifth scariest NASCAR paint scheme of all time by ESPN The Magazine for having [...] "'BUTT PASTE' slapped on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> in giant red {{lettering}} and a cartoon baby riding on the hood." ...|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 Rallys {{were mostly}} {{unchanged}} from the 1973s. Just {{like on the}} Rambler American, their largest difference was the new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and relocated rear license plate. These models incorporated {{the first set of}} VAM's original five-spoke wheels, which carried full volcano-shaped hubcaps and trim rings. Due to this, wheelcovers were removed as available accessories for this model. For the first time a set of factory side stripes decorated the exterior of the model including a stylish manuscript [...] "Rally" [...] emblem over the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> creating a two-tone appearance. Front seats were mostly the same as the year before, now shared with the brand-new Classic AMX (Matador X) model. The discontinuation of the original VAM logo during 1973 in favor of the new arrow-type one meant its removal from the dial of the tachometer. The shifter was changed into a T-shaped Hurst unit. A new AMC logo over a black background replaced the American Motors legend over the transparent acrylic cap in the steering wheel's horn button. The 258 six engine got a slight drop in compression ratio from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1.|$|E
2500|$|The American Rally AMX {{was carried}} over for 1979 with {{substantial}} cosmetic changes {{that gave the}} model {{a higher level of}} originality within VAM and pushed it away from AMC's 1978 original. The body featured all-new side decal designs in two tones that were mostly straight and surrounded the side protective rubber moldings. The portion under the rear side windows grew thicker and housed an [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] decal using the same typography and design as the previous model, the legend [...] "AMX" [...] on top of the [...] "Rally" [...] one. All glass frames and moldings, volcano hubcaps, door mirrors, rocker panels and bumpers were blacked-out. AMC's dual quad headlight design with transparent parking lights was adopted alongside an in-house VAM sporty grille design with four horizontal bars shared with the Gremlin X and American 06/S models of the same year. Both bumpers were changed to the new smaller aluminum units with side end caps, bumper guards and nerfing strips. A unique feature of this model is the radio antenna placed on top of the passenger's side <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> instead of the top of the right front fender.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{convenience}} equipment {{included a}} two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield wipers and washers, a 200km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard-type sound-absorbing and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver's side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl-cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, backup lights, steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual [...] "232 SIX" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> emblems, dual [...] "bulleye" [...] emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script [...] "American" [...] emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered [...] "RAMBLER" [...] rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver's side remote mirror, and radio antenna.|$|E
25|$|Also new was a variable-ratio power {{steering}} unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> on coupes and convertibles)for improved side impact protection {{as was the case}} with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.|$|R
50|$|All HJ models, {{aside from}} the One Tonner, were easily {{identified}} from the HQ by having a squared-off frontal treatment with wrap-around indicator lights. The rear of the sedan models featured a new bumper and wraparound triangular taillights, while all other body styles kept the previous HQ's rear styling. Sedan and wagon also had revised <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{model name}} Custom 880 {{was derived from}} Dodge’s {{numerical}} sub-model naming structure that was also used on the Dart and sportier models of the Polara, although the model designation was not physically present on the car. Only [...] "Dodge" [...] badges on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and decklid of the car were applied. A six-way power seat was optional.|$|R
2500|$|The 1977 models had {{numerous}} changes. Most noticeable {{was a new}} front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of {{the previous two years}} and a new front bumper. A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door. The [...] "258" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units.|$|E
2500|$|For 1972, the Torino was {{redesigned}} using many characteristics {{carried over}} from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the [...] "long hood short deck" [...] look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. [...] The Torino line was also revised to {{be made up of}} basic models called [...] "Torino" [...] and more upscale models called [...] "Gran Torinos." [...] The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. Tom McCahill, stated [...] "the gaping grille looks a little like it was patterned after Namu, the killer whale", but also stated that the Torino had [...] "kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling." [...] Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps {{on each side of the}} large oval grille. [...] Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield had a more rakish 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Even with this changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. The rear featured a full width bumper that incorporated thin rectangular tail lights into each bumper end. [...] All Torinos had [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation as standard equipment resulting in vent windows vanishing from four-door and station wagon models. [...] The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new flush mount door handles and side door guard rails.|$|E
2500|$|From 1971 to 1976, Buick's {{full-sized}} Estate Wagon {{shared the}} [...] wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its {{interior and exterior}} styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick's largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new 'clamshell' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> The clamshell system, heavy and complex, {{made it easier to}} load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|A {{commemorative}} Olympic Sprint Edition (also {{available on}} the Pinto and Maverick) was released between March and June of this year. Sprint editions were available in Hardtop and Sportsroof variants, and featured white paint schemes with light blue accents and USA shield decals on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b> An additional 50 Sprint convertibles were produced exclusively for the 1972 National Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington D.C.|$|R
50|$|The Monkeemobile was a {{modified}} Pontiac GTO {{designed and built}} by designer Dean Jeffries. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece windshield, a touring car T-bucket-type convertible top, modified <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a parachute. The front grille sported the GTO emblem.|$|R
50|$|Without {{lead time}} {{sufficient}} {{to develop an}} all new full-sized Dodge, Chrysler approved the sharing of the full-size body used by the Chrysler Newport and the non-letter 300 series. The models were differentiated by mating a modified 1961 Dodge Polara front clip to the Newport's definned <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and passenger compartment. This body sharing allowed Dodge to launch the car in January 1962.|$|R
2500|$|For 1976, VAM {{introduced}} the Gremlin X {{for the first}} time in Mexico, retaking the economical sporty concept originally held by the Rally model. The company's engineers started to find solutions to the problem of lack of power without rising gas emission, and the 258 six obtained a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio this year. Due to this improvement along with the subcompact's lighter body and shorter exhaust, the 1976 Gremlin X outperformed the low-compression 1975 American Rally, despite that it wasn't offered with the new four-speed transmission. To avoid internal competition once again in both performance models as well as further pushing of the line's concept change, VAM proceeded to upgrade the American Rally to distance it from the new subcompact version. The 1976 models switched to the [...] 7.7:1 compression ratio VAM 282 cu in six cylinder with Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor and 266 degree camshaft, shared with the VAM Pacer and all Classic models. This marked {{for the first time}} the presence of VAM's largest engine in the Hornet-based compact line. The works on solving the shortage of power on the 258 six were still in process in the 282, thus the existing version was installed under the hood. The 1976 American Rally in the performance department fared much better with its higher displacement, large-diameter valves, larger intake manifold and larger carburetor but was still falling short on compression ratio. The model outperformed all of its predecessors. However, there was an exception in the form of the 1972 Rambler American Rally with its 9.5:1 compression ratio 252 cu in six, which was still half a second faster despite its high-flow one-barrel carburetor, small intake manifold, three-speed transmission, higher rear gear ratio and lower displacement. Aside from the engine, the 1976 American Rally was accompanied by noticeable improvements consisting of power front disk brakes, power steering and tinted windshield, all as standard equipment. The four-speed transmission and heater were fully standardized this year. New seat patterns and side panel designs (without the etched Rally emblem) were used, while gauges were changed to a 160km/h speedometer and 6,000 RPM tachometer. New dome light lens design and longer sunvisors were shared with the American and Gremlin. The new engine and standard equipment coupled with the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic AMX (Matador X) ascended the American Rally into the top of the line performance model of the company. The sportiness and concept was fairly close to that of the 1972-1976 VAM Javelins and aforementioned Classic AMXs. With the engine change, the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> emblems morphed into [...] "4.6" [...] units. After only one year, the model name [...] "Rally" [...] emblem on the rear panel was once again redesigned.|$|E

50|$|The SV-1 had a rear {{fuel filler}} {{similar to the}} early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side fuel fillers in mid 1972, so all {{production}} liftbacks had fuel fillers on the left <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> with a cover flap.|$|E
50|$|Barris used a vee-butted windshield, a {{very common}} customizers' trick in that era, rather than a {{one-piece}} windshield, which was available on the '53 Merc. He added Appleton spotlights, frenched the headlights (which were fitted with '52 Ford rings), and added '52 Lincoln Capri taillights. The exhaust pipes were routed out through the rear bumper, beneath the taillights, {{and a pair of}} radio antennae were frenched into the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Riding the Fairlane’s 116.5 inch wheelbase, the 1962 Meteors wore unique <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> that mimicked the Monterey's jet-pod tail lights. The base Meteor and better-trimmed Meteor Custom were {{available}} as two- and four-door sedans. The Meteor S-33 was a specially appointed two-door sedan featuring premium exterior trim and interior ameneties including bucket seats, and a center console. Its styling and features {{were similar to}} the Fairlane 500 sports coupe.|$|R
5000|$|The Corvette C7.R is {{the racing}} {{version of the}} 2015 Corvette Z06. It is {{modified}} to have increased cooling and aerodynamic downforce, including similar front splitters, rocker panels, and front- and rear-brake cooling ducts; a 5.5-litre naturally aspirated engine, suspension modified to accommodate wider racing tires and larger brakes, air intake openings {{on each of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> above the brake ducts, rear wing, and larger radiator inlet.|$|R
