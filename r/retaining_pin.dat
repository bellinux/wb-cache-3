5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam the shutter, one shell struck {{the edge of the}} shutter, creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later.|$|E
25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a safety mechanism. This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, ejector and spring, extractor, dummy extractor plug, bolt-head <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's hair brush and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|E
25|$|The rotors and the {{positioning}} of the ring containing the notch were changed daily. The settings were defined in a codebook that was common to all operators on that network. At {{the start of each}} day, before any messages were sent or received, Enigma operators implemented the day's rotor selection and ring settings. Having selected the three rotors, they adjusted the ring settings. That could be done before the rotors were mounted on their axle or after they had been inserted into the machine. It was possible to adjust the ring settings of the loaded rotors by moving the spring-loaded <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> to the right and turning the rotor to display the specified letter. Herivel thought it likely {{that at least some of}} the operators would adjust the rings after they had mounted the rotors in the machine. Having set the alphabet rings and closed the lid, the operator should then have moved the rotors well away from the positions that displayed the three letters of the ring setting in the windows, but some operators did not.|$|E
5000|$|... "Filing-to-fit" [...] {{of certain}} parts during {{production}} limited interchangeability. The exposed rear sight had no protective ears and was vulnerable to breakage. The adjustable front sight {{could be lost}} if the retaining screw wasn't tightly secured. The weapon was susceptible to jamming if grime clogged the bolt's locking recess in the receiver. The two small magazine guide <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> and corresponding receiver stud holes were tapered allowing disassembly and assembly only from one directionâ€”right to left for disassembly, and left to right for assembly; adding unacceptable levels of complexity in a combat environment. The <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> had to be delicately pounded out whenever the bolt needed to be removed for cleaning. During the reassembly process, if the <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> were inserted {{too much or too}} little when reassembling, the receiver might not fit back into the tight confines of the stock.|$|R
50|$|The mine is armed by {{transferring}} the detonator from the fuze cap {{to the well}} {{in the base of}} the mine, the safety cap is then removed. Pressure on the central pressure plate, compresses the spring until the pressure is enough to shear the plastic <b>retaining</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} provide {{emergency oxygen}} to passengers {{to protect them}} from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the <b>retaining</b> <b>pins</b> and trigger the production of oxygen.|$|R

50|$|The PMD-6, PMD-7 and PMD-57 series mines are Soviet Union blast type anti-personnel mines that {{consist of}} a wooden box with a hinged lid with a slot cut into it. The slot presses down against a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> which holds back the striker. When {{sufficient}} pressure {{is applied to the}} lid of the box the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> moves, allowing the striker to hit the detonator. The mines typically have an operating pressure of 1 to 10 kg. All the mines in the series use MOV series fuzes.|$|E
5000|$|Pull fuse: A {{pull fuse}} is a zero-delay fuse used in booby traps: the grenade detonates {{immediately}} when the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> is removed. The pin is typically {{attached to a}} tripwire.|$|E
5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by {{pressure on the}} lid forcing the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> out of the striker which then hits the detonator. It {{can be used with}} a tripwire connected to the fuze acting as a crude anti-handling device.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Retaining</b> <b>pins</b> are {{generally}} {{used as the}} parts of automobile gears, axes, crankshafts, and seat belts, which are proceeded three-stage forming and then drilling processing in the original manufacturing procedure. However, the fixture seizing in the drilling processing could result in rod surface damage and dent, and the depth tolerance exceeding the drawing specifications after the drilling causes the major defects in product manufacturing. This study attempts to modify the cold forging process by adding one stage and replacing the original mechanical drilling processing with backward extrusion and forging engineering. In the research process, Finite Element Method is utilized for analyzing and simulating the forming load at each stage. The analysis results show that increasing the original 3 -stage forging process to 4 -stage could assist in solving the problems of rod dent and depth tolerance exceeding the drawing specifications after the drilling. Although the die cost would increase with an increasing stage, the new process allows the forging force being more even and the die life being prolonged, in consideration of the overall production costs...|$|R

50|$|Some hairpins are {{a single}} {{straight}} pin, but modern versions {{are more likely}} to be constructed from different lengths of wire that are bent in half with a u-shaped end and a few kinks along the two opposite portions. The finished pin may vary from two to six inches in final length. The length of the wires enables placement in several styles of hairdos to hold the style in place. The kinks enable <b>retaining</b> the <b>pin</b> during normal movements.|$|R
50|$|A hairpin clip, {{also known}} as a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> is a type of formed wire used on a grooved shaft. It is {{designed}} to be easily installed and uninstalled, and is reusable. They are commonly made from 1050 carbon steel and 300 series stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|The mine uses an MUV pull fuze {{attached}} {{to an internal}} lever fuze. Pressure on the lid depresses {{one end of the}} lever, removing the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the MUV fuze, allowing the striker to impact a percussion cap, which ignites the detonator followed by the main charge.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid that acts as the trigger mechanism. A slot is cut {{into the side of}} the lid which rests on the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin.</b> The main charge is a block of cast TNT into which a variety of fuzes may be placed, typically either the RO-1 or an MUV series fuze.|$|E

50|$|For larger {{heat sinks}} and higher preloads, push pins with {{compression}} springs are very effective. The push pins, typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb {{at the end}} that engages {{with a hole in}} the PCB; once installed, the barb <b>retains</b> the <b>pin.</b> The compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. Care is needed in selection of push pin size. Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.|$|R
50|$|The TM-38 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine had a large raised rectangular central pressure plate with four reinforcing creases. When enough pressure {{was applied to the}} plate it collapses pressing down on a bolt connected to an internal lever. The lever is pulls a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the MUV fuze, which releases the striker, which impacts the MD-2 detonator.|$|E
50|$|The Schu-mine 42 (Shoe-mine), {{also known}} as the SchÃ¼tzenmine 42, was a German anti-personnel mine used during the Second World War. It {{consisted}} of a simple wooden box with a hinged lid containing a 200 g block of cast TNT and a ZZ-42 type detonator. A slot in the lid pressed down on the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin,</b> sufficient pressure on the lid caused the pin to move, releasing the striker which triggered the detonator.|$|E
50|$|The TM-35 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine has a metal case, which is rectangular with a carrying handle {{on one side and}} a large raised pressure plate in the centre. Sufficient pressure on the central pressure plate presses down on one end of an internal see-saw like lever, which removes the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from an MUV fuze, releasing the striker, triggering the mine.|$|E

40|$|PIN-FORMED (PIN) -dependent auxin {{transport}} {{is essential}} for plant development and its modulation {{in response to the}} environment or endogenous signals. A NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH 3) -like protein, MACCHI-BOU 4 (MAB 4), has been shown to control PIN 1 localization during organ formation, but its contribution is limited. The Arabidopsis genome contains four genes, MAB 4 /ENP/NPY 1 -LIKE 1 (MEL 1), MEL 2, MEL 3 and MEL 4, highly homologous to MAB 4. Genetic analysis disclosed functional redundancy between MAB 4 and MEL genes in regulation of not only organ formation but also of root gravitropism, revealing that NPH 3 family proteins have a wider range of functions than previously suspected. Multiple mutants showed severe reduction in PIN abundance and PIN polar localization, leading to defective expression of an auxin responsive marker DR 5 rev::GFP. Pharmacological analyses and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching experiments showed that mel mutations increase PIN 2 internalization from the plasma membrane, but affect neither intracellular PIN 2 trafficking nor PIN 2 lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane. Notably, all MAB 4 subfamily proteins show polar localization at the cell periphery in plants. The MAB 4 polarity was almost identical to PIN polarity. Our results suggest that the MAB 4 subfamily proteins specifically <b>retain</b> <b>PIN</b> proteins in a polarized manner at the plasma membrane, thus controlling directional auxin transport and plant development...|$|R

50|$|The TMD-40 was a wooden-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{used during}} the Second World War. The mine consisted of a rectangular wooden box which contained a detonator assembly at each end and seven 400 gram and four 200 gram blocks of explosive. The fuse assemblies consisted of a lever device, which when pressed downward by pressure pieces attached to {{the lid of the}} mine, see-sawed upward, pulling the striker <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from a pull detonator. The main charge was then triggered.|$|E
50|$|Using the Gammon {{bomb was}} very simple. After filling the {{stockinette}} bag with explosive, the screw-off cap was removed and discarded. Removing the screw-off cap revealed a stout linen tape wound around {{the circumference of}} the fuze. The linen tape had a curved lead weight on the end. While holding the lead weight in place with one finger (to prevent the linen tape from unwinding prematurely) the grenade was then thrown at the target. When the Gammon grenade was thrown, the weighted linen tape automatically unwrapped in flight, pulling out a <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> from the fuze mechanism. Removal of the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> freed a heavy ball-bearing and striker inside the fuze, which was then held back from the percussion cap only by a weak creep spring. In this manner the Allways fuze became armed in flight. Impact with the target gave the heavy ball-bearing a sharp jolt - overcoming the weak resistance of the creep spring - that slammed the striker against the percussion cap. The percussion cap fired directly into the adjacent detonator, which in turn sent a violent shockwave into the main explosive filling contained inside the stockinette bag. Detonation of a Gammon grenade was instantaneous on impact with the target, i.e. there was no time-delay.|$|E
50|$|Then, on 22 February, {{the convoy}} ran {{into one of}} the worst storms ever {{recorded}} in the Barents Sea. Once again the convoy began to split up and was blown apart. The weather deteriorated to Beaufort scale force 12 with winds at 70 to 90 knots and temperatures 40 below zero. During this storm, one of the main springs on the Henry Bacons steering gear was broken, and the <b>retaining</b> <b>pin</b> was sheared. This damage caused the Henry Bacon {{to drop out of the}} convoy to effect repairs.|$|E
