40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of active-matrix {{liquid crystal display}} (AM-LCD) and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AM-OLED), the amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (a-Si:H TFT) technology forms {{the backbone of the}} driving electronics for the large-size displays. Transistors for such application need to have high electrical performance and stability, as well as a high production output. In this dissertation we present an advanced multi-layer amorphous silicon thin-film transistor structure with a tailored channel region for the flat-panel display application. This specially tailored channel allows the rapid deposition of the TFT’s gate insulator and active material without significantly altering its electrical performance and characteristics. We first investigate the nominal film geometry that maximizes the production throughput of the transistor. We fabricate transistors with the conventional structure, and they show a field-effect mobility of 0. 95 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, threshold voltage of 1. 18 V, and subthreshold swing of 0. 46 V/dec. We are able to produce multi-layer a-Si:H TFTs that show a field-effect mobility of 0. 93 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, threshold voltage of 1. 07 V, and subthreshold swing of 0. 51 V/dec. However, our proposed TFT structure has a 40 % shorter deposition time, which provides it with a competitive edge due to its higher throughput. In order to further improve the applicability of our a-Si:H TFTs, we present a novel, <b>recess</b> <b>contact</b> TFT aimed to reduce the off-current level. We are able to produce TFTs with an off-current level below 10 - 14 A. Compared to a conventional TFT, this low off-current TFT has a comparable electrical performance in the on-regime of operation, but approximately one order of magnitude lower off-current. Finally, we tested the electrical stability of the multi-layer a-Si:H TFTs with the tailored channel. This transistor has similar threshold voltage shift as the conventional transistors, even though the gate insulator is deposited at a high rate. Under 10, 000 s of constant current bias (5. 5 µA) at an elevated temperature (353 K), our TFT (W/L= 24 / 6) has a threshold voltage of less than 4 V...|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of users accidentally {{touching}} energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock, plug and socket systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the <b>recessed</b> <b>contacts</b> of the energized socket. These include plugs with insulated sleeves, sockets with blocking shutters, and sockets designed to accept only compatible plugs inserted in the correct orientation.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design and prepare photomixer devices based on LT GaAs and to {{optimize}} them {{with respect to the}} maximal output power. Essential part of the photomixer is the MSM photodetector structure. For this reason {{a major part of the}} optimization process was done on photodetector structures. One set of our photomixers was optimized for the 460 GHz output frequency employing single dipole antenna. The second set of photomixers used broadband bow-tie and spiral antennas designed for the frequency range up to 1. 6 THz and 3. 7 THz, respectively. The influence of the growth temperature of GaAs on its desired properties (high resistivity, high electric breakdown field, low carrier lifetime, etc.) is presented in Chapter 2. It is well know that with increasing the growth temperature the carrier lifetime in this material increases as well. This is a major parameter for limitation of the maximal output frequency of a photomixer device, that is not RC-constant limited. The second important factor for optimization of the maximal photomixer output power is the mobility of photogenerated carriers. It is a well established fact that with increasing the growth temperature the mobility also increases in GaAs material. The output power of a photomixer device depends on both above mentioned parameters which are in trade-off. Thus, the growth temperature is one of the most important parameters contributing to the output power increase of our photomixers. Photomixers designed for 460 GHz require partially higher growth temperature of LT GaAs, 275 - 300 °C, as shown in Chapter 6. Ion implantation is another possibility how to decrease carrier lifetime in GaAs. In this work we present results showing that employing this technique fabrication of materials with subpicosecond carrier lifetime is possible. Materials implanted with various ion doses (1012 - 1016 ions/cm 2) and implantation energies in the range 82 keV- 880 keV were prepared and their properties and dynamics before and after annealing were studied. Photodetectors based on 880 keV nitrogen-implanted GaAs show 50 % higher sensitivity than our best LT GaAs photodetectors. These results outline new possibilities for increasing of photomixer output power because with right choice of implantation energy and dose it is possible to prepare materials with subpicosecond carrier lifetime and with higher mobility of photogenerated carriers than in previously reported materials. Next improvement, necessary for photomixer devices, is that MSM contact could be also fabricated not only on the surface of photoconductive material, but also in the material. <b>Recessed</b> <b>contacts</b> exhibit higher breakdown voltage, which depends on the depth of recession. In this work we also observed that photodetectors with <b>recessed</b> <b>contacts</b> are more sensitive in comparison to MSM fabricated on the surface. <b>Recessed</b> <b>contacts</b> fabricated by wet etching and IBE are presented in Chapter 3. In both cases we observed sensitivities from 40 % to 200 % higher in dependence on the recession depth than for non-recessed structures. Very important fact is that <b>recessed</b> <b>contacts</b> could for optimal recession depth more efficiently collect photogenerated carriers from deeper regions and so not only increase total number of photogenerated carriers, but also in shorter time, because of decreasing of distance to the collecting electrodes. This was also observed in this work. Our first results from the photomixers with broadbanding antenna show in frequency range from 100 GHz to 1 THz approximately 2 times higher output power than photomixers with non-recessed contacts. In the future combination of here presented improvements will be used to reach next improvement of electrical properties of photodetector and photomixer devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of recess etched Au-free ohmic contacts to an InAlN/AlN/GaN heterostructure is investigated. A Ta/Al/Ta metal stack {{is used to}} produce contacts with contact resistance (R-c) as low as 0. 14 Omega mm. It is found that R-c decreases with increasing recess depth until the InAlN barrier is completely removed. For even deeper recesses R-c remains low but requires annealing at higher temperatures for contact formation. The lowest R-c is found for <b>contacts</b> where the <b>recess</b> etch has stopped just above the 2 D electron gas channel. At this depth the contacts are also found to be less sensitive to other process parameters, such as anneal duration and temperature. An optimum bottom Ta layer thickness of 5 - 10 nm is found.

40|$|An {{optimized}} {{fabrication process}} of ohmic contacts is proposed {{to reduce the}} source/drain access resistance (RC) and enhance DC/RF performance of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with a high Al concentration. We show that source/drain RC can be considerably lowered by (i) optimally etching into the barrier layer using Ar+ ion beam, and by (ii) forming <b>recessed</b> <b>contact</b> metallization using an optimized Ti/Al/Ni/Au (12 nm/ 200 nm/ 40 nm/ 100 nm) multilayers. We found that a low RC of ∼ 0. 3 Ω. mm {{can be achieved by}} etching closer to the 2 -Dimensional Electron Gas (2 DEG) at an optimum etching depth, 75 % of the barrier thickness, followed by a rapid thermal annealing at 850 °C. This is due to the very small distance between the alloy and the 2 DEG (higher electric field) as shown by 2 D drift-diffusion simulations combined with Transmission Line Model (TLM) extractions...|$|R

Compared {{to the same}} devices on SiN/AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMT structure, these have superior performance. This is achieved by recessing the Ohmic contacts to lower the contact resistance. These devices employ a 10 nm PECVD deposited SiN dielectric layer under the gate to reduce the leakage current.

Although the plug is female, with a partially <b>recessed</b> center <b>contact,</b> it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to short-circuit the power source.

40|$|Modern III-Nitride (III-N) heterostructures offer high mobility, high {{electron}} density, large breakdown voltages {{and good}} thermal capabilities. High electron mobility transistors (HEMT) based on III-Ns are therefore ideal for high frequency, high power amplification. The intended applications are within radar and mobile communication. Commercial devices are available although some issues remain unsolved. This thesis deals {{with two of}} these issues: {{the lack of a}} reliable, low resistive ohmic contact and problems with dispersion, which can severely impede output power. <b>Recessed</b> ohmic <b>contacts</b> were developed to an Indium Aluminium Nitride / Aluminium Nitride / Gallium Nitride (InAlN/AlN/GaN) heterostructure. The lowest contact resistance (0. 14 Ωmm) was found after annealing at 550 °C for samples where the recess was almost through the barrier. Recessing through the whole barrier also gave low resistive contacts but required slightly higher anneal temperatures. The results indicate the viability of a reliable <b>recessed</b> ohmic <b>contact</b> process. Furthermore, two different aspects of heterostructure development has been investigated; buffer doping and the AlGaN/GaN interface. An optimized carbon doping profile in the buffer has been evaluated by fabricating HEMTs and characterizing isolation and dispersion. The optimized buffer showed to minimize dispersive effects while providing good isolation. Low values of drain induced barrier lowering was measured (1. 2 mV/V). A common way to increase electron mobility in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is to include an AlN-exclusion layer. Unfortunately this approach makes it more difficult to form ohmic contacts. An optimized AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, with a sharp transition from AlGaN to GaN, has been investigated. HEMTs on the optimized sample showed less electron penetration into the barrier layer as compared to an un-optimized sample resulting in an increased mobility (1800 compared to 1700 cm 2 /Vs). HEMTs with a gate-length of 200 nm exhibited transconductance of 400 mS/mm and fT/fmax of 40 / 156 GHz using the optimized interface, compared to 390 mS/mm and 37 / 146 GHz for the standard interface...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of complex patterns of aligned microstructures has required {{the use of}} multiple applications of lithography. Here we describe an approach for microfabrication that encodes the two-dimensional spatial information of several photomasks onto a single elastomeric stamp by mapping each photomask onto distinct heights {{on the surface of the}} stamp. Pressing the stamp against a surface collapses the topography of the stamp such that each <b>recessed</b> layer <b>contacts</b> the surface in stepwise sequence; the greater the applied pressure, the larger the area of the stamp that contacts the surface. After contact of each new layer with the surface, we use techniques of soft lithography (microcontact printing, microfluidics, and patterning through membranes) to pattern the surfaces that contact the stamp and those that do not with inorganic, organic, or living materials. Microfabrication through the use of multilevel stamps provides a promising alternative to conventional lithography for the construction of multicomponent, aligned surfaces; these structures may find use as components of microfluidic devices or biological patterns...|$|R
50|$|Anathyrosis is the {{technical}} term {{for how the}} ancients frequently dressed the joints of stone blocks. Since the blocks were set directly against each other {{without the use of}} mortar, the joint had to be exact. In order {{to reduce the amount of}} time required to form such a joint, the joining face of the stone was finished and smoothed only in a narrow contact band on the sides and top, while the interior of the face was <b>recessed.</b> The <b>contact</b> band looks somewhat like a doorframe, and the term - it was coined by the ancients - is allusive. Thyra (θύρα) is a Greek word for “door”, and so “door framing” is anathyrosis. This technique was frequently employed in the construction of walls, including ashlar construction, and might be used between the drums of columns as well. Close examination of where this technique was applied to a stone can help to reveal its place within a structure or whether other stones were joined to it.|$|R

Contact resistances under 0. 1 Ωmm are required for the performance of these devices to be competitive. Low ohmic contact resistance can be achieved by recessing the ohmic contacts all the way through to the 2 -DEG channel forming a side contact of the deposited metal with the 2 -DEG channel which is believed to be a more efficient carrier transport mechanism rather than tunneling through the barrier. We will present results in which the conventional Ti/Al/Ni/Au metal stack is deposited on the surface, half way and all the way through to the 2 -DEG channel of GaN-based HEMT material. The contact resistances are extracted from the characterisation of circular TLM test structures...|$|R
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or <b>recessed</b> <b>contact</b> pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R

50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of tap is a Forming Tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly <b>recessed</b> to reduce <b>contact</b> friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most tap drill tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|R

40|$|Geckos {{are well}} known for being rapid climbers that have long existed in nature. The {{reversible}} and reusable adhesive on their feet intrigues scientists to explore a bio-mimetic adhesive, which inherits the adhesion properties of the gecko’s adhesives. Recent advances in electron microscopy reveal the secret of gecko’s climbing ability: there are hierarchical fibrillar structures branching from {{the skin of the}}ir climbing feet. Sizes of these hierarchical fibrils range from micrometer to nanometer. These fibrils are arranged to closely resemble a tree, and these tree like structures form a fibril forest on the skin of the climbing feet. Nano-fibrils in close proximity with the contacting surfaces interact with the substrate through intermolecular forces. Slender micro-fibrils extend the nano-fibrils, which are located at their open ends, to reach <b>recesses</b> of the <b>contacting</b> surfaces. The special arrangement of the fibrillar arrays enables quick attachment and detachment of the feet from surfaces of different materials and varying roughness. Inspired by the gecko’s adhesive, artificial fibrillar adhesives have been sought developing for more than a decade. Early attempts were focused on making use of the intermolecular interaction by nano-fibrillar arrays. These artificial fibrillar adhesives have achieved great performance on flat surfaces but not as good when they were used on relatively rough surfaces. Recent attempts of preparing a hierarchical fibrillar structure, which contains fibrils in different length scales, have rare success on improving adhesion performance. Evidence of extra compliancy provided by the hierarchical structure is also not clear. This thesis provides evidence that there is a correlation between structure compliancy and adhesion performance of a hierarchical fibrillar adhesive. Improved compliancy and adhesion forces are observed on a hierarchical fibrillar structure with achievements of several milestones, which include developing methods for preparing and characterizing hierarchical fibrillar structures. Experimental results also reveal the interaction of fibrillar arrays with the contacting surfaces. Information obtained is valuable for future development and application of such artificial fibrillar adhesive...|$|R
40|$|The InAlN/AlN/GaN HEMT {{has a high}} {{breakdown}} field which allows for excellent power performance. In order to increase frequency operation, a reduction in device size is required, inherently increasing the short-channel effects and limiting device efficiency and linearity. It is possible to mitigate DIBL and subthreshold swing by increasing the carrier confinement in the 2 DEG channel of the HEMT through optimizing the buffer design {{with the use of}} GaN-buffer C-doping. The impact of different C-doping profiles on short-channel effects is investigated by the fabrication and characterization of two-finger U-shaped HEMTs with 2 x 25 μm gate widths and 50, 100 and 180 nm gate footprints. DC and S-parameter analysis show an increased immunity to short-channel effects for devices with constant levels of intentional C-doping to the buffer, but that the high frequency and power performance is impaired by a reduction of the on-state conductance. Best RF performance was achieved for a ramped C-doping profile with values of and of 66 and 180 GHz respectively. Although, these devices showed a deteriorated performance in terms of short-channel effects, including pinch-off, output conductance and current leakage. Consequently, there is a trade-off between the reduction of short-channel effects and an increase of and. Ohmic contact formation and the reduction of contact resistance and specific contact resistivity is important to consider in order to increase the efficient operation of HEMTs. Ohmic contacts induce negligible voltage drop and heat generation compared to the bulk resistance of the semiconductor, but are difficult to realize in wide-bandgap materials. It is possible to assist the formation of ohmic contacts and lower the resistivity by <b>contact</b> <b>recess</b> etching down to the substrate channel and by altering the metallization.

The exclusion layer formed in between the contacts and the semiconductor during anneal, causes N-vacancies in the buffer and promotes tunnelling of carriers through the barrier, which in turn lowers the contact resistance. The lower resistivity of ZrN compared to TaN, yields an interest in Zr-based contacts.
