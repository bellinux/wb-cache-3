5|$|A variant on {{this design}} {{is the use}} of arrays, whose tilt angle can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also <b>require</b> <b>more</b> land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and <b>require</b> <b>more</b> time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E

5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which was perceived {{as a way of}} lessening the amount of work needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to <b>require</b> <b>more</b> effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will <b>require</b> <b>more</b> computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{decomposition}} of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability, necessitating shallower slopes that <b>require</b> <b>more</b> material be disturbed in {{cut and fill}} work, exacerbating the acid rock drainage problem. The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to volumetric expansion, compounding the problem. The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well.|$|E
30|$|The cost of {{performing}} the modified McIndoe technique was {{twice as much}} as the modified Vecchietti technique because it involves three departments (anesthesiology, plastic surgery, gynecology) as opposed to two (anesthesiology, gynecology), <b>requires</b> <b>more</b> surgical interventions for the graft, is a longer operation, and <b>requires</b> <b>more</b> analgesia and a longer hospitalization.|$|R

5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well <b>require</b> <b>more</b> energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} morph the dragon {{to change its}} attack, defense, agility and spiritual {{attribute}}s. Boosting one attribute diminishes another; for example, boosting the attack attribute reduces the spiritual attribute, meaning berserks <b>require</b> <b>more</b> BP, while boosting means gauges fill faster {{at the expense of}} defense. Certain berserks are only available in certain dragon configurations.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can <b>require</b> <b>more</b> digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can <b>require</b> <b>more</b> sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and <b>require</b> <b>more</b> scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and <b>require</b> <b>more</b> food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, <b>require</b> <b>more</b> manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the typhoon in the Ailinglaplap Atoll in the Marshall Islands, {{residents}} experienced severe food shortages due to damaged crops and little rainfall. Experts estimated the entire redevelopment of its fauna would <b>require</b> <b>more</b> than a decade. As a result of the crop shortage, large-scale evacuations of the islands' residents were considered. Officials in the nation requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States, and on March 20, 1998, the area was declared a disaster area; the declaration allowed for the usage of emergency funds.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would <b>require</b> <b>more</b> concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
