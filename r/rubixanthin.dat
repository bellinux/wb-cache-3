50|$|<b>Rubixanthin,</b> {{or natural}} yellow 27, {{is a natural}} {{xanthophyll}} pigment with a red-orange color found in rose hips. As a food additive it used under the E number E161d as a food coloring; it is not approved {{for use in the}} USA or EU but is approved in Australia and New Zealand where it is listed as 161d.|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{formed an}} {{electron}} transport system when exponentially growing cells were aerated. Formation {{of the electron}} transport system occurred concomitantly with increases in the phospholipids and the carotenoids. The addition of piperonyl butoxide or benzo(a) pyrene {{at the onset of}} aeration (i) slowed the formation of the electron transport system, (ii) both inhibited cytochrome oxidase o synthesis and decreased its stability, (iii) simultaneously depressed the increase in total phospholipid (especially cardiolipin), and (iv) depressed the synthesis of the carotenoid <b>rubixanthin.</b> Benzo(a) pyrene was the more inhibitory of the two, both on the rate of synthesis of the electron transport system and on <b>rubixanthin</b> formation. Evidence obtained with the inhibitors suggested that inhibition of the lipid synthesis was related to the formation of the electron transport system...|$|E
40|$|Diphenylamine at {{concentrations}} {{which did}} not effect the growth rate inhibited the synthesis of vitamin K 2 in both anaerobic and aerobic cultures by about 50 %. At this concentration, diphenylamine inhibited the synthesis of the cyclic carotenoids δ-carotene and the <b>rubixanthins</b> 25 to 35 % anaerobically and 60 to 90 % aerobically. The inhibition of synthesis of cyclic carotenoids and vitamin K 2 by diphenylamine had no detectable effect on {{the formation of the}} membrane-bound electron transport system...|$|R
40|$|Compounds {{known to}} be inhibitors of mixed-function oxidase systems {{inhibited}} the aerobic synthesis of hydroxylated carotenoids in Staphylococcus aureus U- 71. Growth of the cells {{in the presence of}} 2 -diethylaminoethyl- 2, 2 -diphenyl valerate, 2, 4 -dichloro- 6 -phenylphenoxyethylamine, 2, 4 -dichloro- 6 -phenylphenoxyethyldiethylamine, and piperonyl butoxide reduced the levels of the <b>rubixanthins</b> found in stationary-phase cells by 75 to 97 %. In cells grown with mevalonate- 2 - 14 C, the turnover rate of phytoene was reduced and the turnover rate of phytofluenol was increased in the presence of these inhibitors. The ζ- and δ-carotenes, which turn over {{in the absence of the}} inhibitors, accumulated 14 C in the presence of the inhibitors. This suggested that a mixed-function oxidase was responsible for the aerobic hydroxylation of δ-carotene in S. aureus U- 71...|$|R
40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (SC-CO(2)) {{extraction}} {{was employed to}} extract carotenoids from the freeze-dried pulp of pitanga fruits (Eugenia uniflora L.), an exotic fruit, rich in carotenoids and still little explored commercially. The SC-CO(2) extraction was carried out at two temperatures, 40 and 60 degrees C, and seven pressures, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 bar. The carotenoids were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography connected to photodiode array and mass spectrometry detectors. Lycopene, <b>rubixanthin</b> and P-cryptoxanthin were the main carotenoids present in the freeze-dried pitanga pulp, whereas beta-cryptoxanthin concentration was negligible in the SC-CO(2) extracts, for all the investigated state conditions. The maximum recovery of carotenoids was obtained at 60 degrees C and 250 bar, extracting 55 % of the total carotenoid content, 74 % of the <b>rubixanthin</b> and 78 % of the lycopene from the pulp. Under these state conditions, the total carotenoid concentration in the extract was 5474 mu g/g, represented by 66 % lycopene and 32 % <b>rubixanthin.</b> The experimental state conditions produced different SC-CO(2) extracts {{with respect to the}} extraction yield and concentration of different carotenoids, indicating that the supercritical carbon dioxide was selective in the extraction of the pitanga carotenoids as a function of temperature and pressure.

40|$|In Flavobacterium R 1519, {{nicotine}} blocks zeaxanthin biosynthesis by specifically inhibiting the cyclization reaction. Lycopene (at high nicotine concentrations, e. g. 7. 5 mm) and <b>rubixanthin</b> (at low nicotine concentration, e. g. 1 mm) replace zeaxanthin as {{the main}} carotenoid. On removal of the nicotine lycopene is converted into β-carotene under anaerobic conditions and into zeaxanthin {{in the presence of}} O 2. The conversion in vivo of β-carotene into zeaxanthin was also demonstrated. Cyclization (an anaerobic process) thus precedes hydroxylation (O 2 -requiring) in the biosynthesis of zeaxanthin. The conversion in vivo of <b>rubixanthin</b> into β-cryptoxanthin and into zeaxanthin was demonstrated, thus indicating the operation of alternative pathways of zeaxanthin biosynthesis. Several alternative biosynthetic pathways are considered and the results are also discussed in terms of reaction sequences of carotenoid `half-molecules'...|$|E
40|$|THREE {{xanthophylls}} of {{the formula}} C 4 HJ 560 are known, of which cryptoxanthin [Kuhn & Grundmann, 1933] is related to,-carotene, <b>rubixanthin</b> [Kuhn & Grundmann, 1934] to y-carotene, and lycoxanthin [Zechmeister & Cholnoky, 1936] to lycopene. In this paper we describe a fourth xanthophyll with one oxygen atom, {{which has been}} isolated from the petals of Gazania rigens, and which, judging from its behaviour, is related to y-carotene and <b>rubixanthin.</b> The flowers of G. rigens are very interesting from the biochemical standpoint since {{the great majority of}} its carotenoids belong to the y-carotene series, which rarely occurs in other plants. The greater part of the carotenoids of this plant appears in the "carbohydrate fraction", which includes also the xanthophylls with one oxygen atom. This fraction contains four different carotenoids, three of which are present in about equal amounts, and the fourth-probably y-carotene-only in much smaller quantities. All these four substances have practically the same absorption spectrum as y-carotene; they can be separated chromatographically...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} column and thin-layer chromatography, the author {{investigated}} tit presence of various carotenoids in stems of 3 {{species of the}} Sphagnum genus. Apocarotenals (β-apo- 2 ', β-apo- 10 ' -carotenal and apo- 12 ' -violaxanthal) and the following carotenoids were found: α-, β-,;-carotene, β-cryptoxantin, lutein, lutein epoxide, zeaxanthin, adonixanthin, antheroxanthin, rhodoxanthin, <b>rubixanthin,</b> neoxanthin, vio-laxanthin and mutatoxanthin.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{carotenoid}} extracts of Rose hips (Rosa canina L.) with regard to their phytochemical profiles and their in vitro anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), cytotoxic, multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal and radical scavenging activity. Carotenoid composition was investigated in the different fractionation of rose hips, using extraction methods. Six main carotenoids - epimers of neochrome, lutein, zeaxanthin, <b>rubixanthin,</b> lycopene, β,β-carotene - were identified from Rose hips by their chromatographic behavior and UV-visible spectra, which is in accordance with other studies on carotenoids in this plant material. The active principles in the carotenoid extract might differ, depending upon the extraction procedures. on-line at: www. actabp. pl (Open Access Journal...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of cartenoids in nineteen species of lichens from Kenya (Equatorial Africa) was studied by column and thinlayer chromatography. This investigations revealed the {{presence of}} the following carotenoids: neurosporene, α-carotene, β-carotene, <b>rubixanthin,</b> α-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, lutein, 3 '-epilutein, torularhodin, diatoxanthin, neoxanthin, echinenone, 3 '-hydroxyechinenone, canthaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, astaxanthin, β-carotene epoxide, antheraxanthin, lutein epoxide, violaxanthin, mutatoxanthin, flavoxanthin, capsochrome, β-apo- 8 '-carotenal, β-apo- 10 '-carotenal and apo- 12 '-violaxanthal. Five of these, torularhodin, 3 '-hydroxyechinenone, capsochrome, β-apo- 8 '-carotenal and β-apo- 10 '-carotenal, are reported for the first time from lichens.

40|$|The {{carotenoids}} {{have been}} examined in Japanese apricots, Heiwa and Niigataomi varieties, by means of magnesia column chromatography. The coloured carotenoid pattern which was shown by the average of patterns obtained with each variety was β-carotene about 70, cryptoxanthin 7, γ-carotene 7, lycopene 5,ζ-carotene 2, zeaxanthin 2, lutein 1. 5 and violaxanthin 1. 5 to total coloured caroteinoid 100. Alpha-carotene, mutatochrome, neurosporene, hydroxy-ζ-carotene, <b>rubixanthin,</b> persicaxanthin, luteoxanthin, flovoxanthin and auroxanthin as other constituents were presents a little amounts. The carotenoid pattern of canned apricot was also similar to fresh raw apricot, excepted 5, 6 -epoxide carotenoids converted to 5, 8 epoxides in preparation and storage. It was observed that Niigataomi, as compared with Heiwa, was less β-carotene and cryptoxanthin, and more γ-carotene and lycopene in the carotenoid pattern, and the former was slightly slightly more reddish colour than the latter...|$|E
40|$|Lowering the {{temperature}} of growth of Staphylococcus aureus from 37 to 25 C decreased the growth rate and induced changes {{in the composition of}} the membrane lipids. Changes in lipid composition also occur in the transition between exponential and stationary growth phases at one temperature. To isolate the effects of lowering {{the temperature}}, exponentially growing S. aureus was abruptly switched from 37 to 25 C by transfer to cooler medium. Exponential growth continued at 25 C without a lag period but with a threefold increase in doubling time. In the period of exponential growth at suboptimal temperature, there was essentially no change in the fatty acid composition of the lipids, little change in the vitamin K 2 composition with perhaps a slight increase in the total level, and essentially no change in the phospholipid composition, but a marked stimulation of the synthesis of the rubixanthins. Growth of cells at 25 C was much more sensitive to the inhibition of <b>rubixanthin</b> formation by mixed-function oxidase inhibitors than cells growing at 37 C, suggesting some function for the rubixanthins at suboptimal temperatures. The striking increases in the proportions of monoenoic fatty acids observed at lowered growth temperatures in many biological systems are not detected in S. aureus...|$|E
40|$|Latin America has a {{wide variety}} of carotenogenic foods, notable for the {{diversity}} and high levels of carotenoids. A part of this natural wealth has been analyzed. Carrot, red palm oil and some cultivars of squash and pumpkin are sources of both beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. beta-carotene is the principal carotenoid of the palm fruits burití, tucumã and bocaiuva, other fruits such as loquat, marolo and West Indian cherry, and sweet potato. Buriti also has high amounts of alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene. beta-Cryptoxanthin is the major carotenoid in caja, nectarine, orange-fleshed papaya, orange, peach, tangerine and the tree tomato. Lycopene predominates in tomato, red-fleshed papaya, guava, pitanga and watermelon. Pitanga also has substantial amounts of beta-cryptoxanthin, gamma-carotene and <b>rubixanthin.</b> Zeaxanthin, principal carotenoid of corn, is also predominant only in piquí. delta-Carotene is the main carotenoid of the peach palm and zeta-carotene of passion fruit. Lutein and beta-carotene, in high concentrations, are encountered in the numerous leafy vegetables of the region, as well as in other green vegetables and in some varieties of squash and pumpkin. Violaxanthin is the principal carotenoid of mango and mamey and is also found in appreciable amounts in green vegetables. Quantitative, in some cases also qualitative, differences exist among cultivars of the same food. Generally, carotenoids are in greater concentrations in the peel than in the pulp, increase considerably during ripening and are in higher levels in foods produced in hot places. Other Latin America indigenous carotenogenic foods must be investigated before they are supplanted by introduced crops, which are often poorer sources of carotenoids...|$|E
