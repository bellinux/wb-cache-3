40|$|An S-type {{tubular turbine}} {{is used for}} a low-head {{hydraulic}} turbine. The S-type draft tube {{plays an important role}} in the S-type tubular turbine. The <b>S</b> draft <b>tube</b> has two bend portions, first and second bends. Separation occurs here. The pressure recovery becomes low because of the separation. The paper proposes a new-type <b>S</b> draft <b>tube</b> which has the highest pressure recovery coefficient. One of the characteristics of the new draft tube is a twisted portion in the middle of the <b>S</b> draft <b>tube.</b> Asymmetrical secondary flow is generated in the twisted portion of the new <b>S</b> draft <b>tube.</b> The pressure recovery coefficient Cpo is largely improved because such asymmetrical secondary flow prevents the separation on the bend portion of the <b>S</b> draft <b>tube.</b> Such phenomena are assured by measuring the velocity distribution in the draft tube...|$|R
40|$|When a {{one-dimensional}} standing {{sound wave}} is excited in a rectangular Kundt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tube</b> that the liquid partially fills, general circulations {{of the air}} are induced between adjacent nodes and antinodes, and {{the surface of the}} liquid is deformed depending on the pressure distribution. If the intensity of the sound is exceeded a certain threshold, the liquid surface ruptures and fountains occur at the antinodes. In this work, an experimental study has been made of the mechanism of the formation of the liquid fountain in a Kundt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tube.</b> When the intensity of the sound is increased, a small distortion of the liquid is produced on the surface. The pressure {{at the top of a}} distortion or a liquid boss becomes smaller than that at the sides in an oscillating flow. The distortion or the boss is more sharpened with increase of the intensity of the sound. As a result, at a certain threshold value of the sound, the liquid surface would rupture suddenly and the fountains occur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem of the {{response}} time of concrete pump distribution circuit unmatching pumping construcution requirement,which caused by selecting accumulator based on experience, the parameter configuration of the accumulator was quantitatively expressed. The response time of the distribution circuit is divided into switch time of <b>S</b> <b>tube</b> distribution valve and accumulated pressure differential time of the accumulator. In order to meet the requirements of the response time of the pumping construction, based on the existing parameter configuration of the accumulator, with dynamic characteristic equation and gas state equation respectively, the switch time of <b>S</b> <b>tube</b> distribution valve and accumulated pressure differential time of the accumulator is quantitatively calculated, and the parameters of the accumulator is configurated. Compared to the traditional accumulator choice method, namely selecting accumulator according to experience and testing whether the response time of the distribution circuit is reasonable, quantitative calculated parameter configuration of concrete pump accumulator is more accurate, and can fully meet the requirments of pumping construction. This method also provides theoretical basis for design and choice of engineering machinery accumulator...|$|R

METHODS: Exposures {{were made with}} five different digital panoramic units, of which four were equipped with a direct digital CCD (charge coupled device, "direct digital" technique), and one used storage phosphor plates ("indirect digital" technique). An anthropomorphic phantom served as the patient. An ionization chamber recorded the scattered radiation at 1 m from the phantom at five different locations around the panoramic units, both {{at the level of}} the thyroid gland and the level of the gonads, and effective organ doses were calculated. Exposure parameters were set as recommended by the manufacturers for the particular image and patient size: tube potential settings ranged between 64 kV and 74 kV, exposure times between 8. 2 s and 19. 0 <b>s,</b> <b>tube</b> current values between 4 mA and 7 mA. RESULTS: The maximum organ equivalent dose at 1 m from the panoramic unit was 0. 60 microGy, the maximum organ effective dose was 0. 10 microSv. Organ equivalent doses varied between 0. 18 microGy and 0. 30 microGy and organ effective doses between 0. 01 microSv and 0. 05 microSv for the different positions around the units (average for the different panoramic units). The variations in organ doses for the various machines were 0. 04 - 0. 53 microGy organ equivalent dose and 0. 01 - 0. 08 microSv organ effective dose. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that 500 panoramic radiographs per year are taken by a dental practitioner at 1 m distance from the panoramic unit, he or she will receive an annual additional organ effective dose between 5 microSv and 15 microSv for the thyroid gland and between 5 microSv and 40 microSv for the gonads, depending on the type of digital panoramic unit. status: publishe...|$|R
