50|$|The shear {{strength}} of a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass may have a strong impact on the mechanical behavior of a soil or rock mass. The {{shear strength}} of a discontinuity is often considerably lower than the shear strength of the blocks of intact material in between the discontinuities, and therefore influences, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope engineering, but also the stability of natural slopes. Many slopes, natural and man-made, fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope. The deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities. For example, the modulus of deformation is reduced, and the deformation becomes plastic (i.e. non-reversible deformation on reduction of stress) rather than elastic (i.e. <b>reversible</b> <b>deformation).</b> This may cause, for example, larger settlement of foundations, which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary. Furthermore, the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass.|$|E
50|$|Qualitatively speaking, superelasticity is the <b>reversible</b> <b>deformation</b> by phase transformation. Therefore, it {{competes with}} the {{irreversible}} plastic deformation by dislocation motion. At nanoscale, the dislocation density and possible Frank-Read source sites are greatly reduced, so the yield stress is increased with reduced size. Therefore, for materials exhibiting superelasticity behavior in nanoscale, {{it has been}} found that they can operate in long-term cycling with little detrimental evolution. On the other hand, the critical stress for martensitic phase transformation to occur is also increased because of the reduced possible sites for nucleation to begin. Nucleation usually begins near dislocation or at surface defects. But for nanoscale materials, the dislocation density is greatly reduced, and the surface is usually atomically smooth. Therefore, the phase transformation of nanoscale materials exhibiting superelasticity is usually found to be homogeneous, resulting in much higher critical stress. Specifically, for Zirconia, where it has three phases, the competition between phase transformation and plastic deformation {{has been found to be}} orientation dependent, indicating the orientation dependence of activation energy of dislocation and nucleation. Therefore, for nanoscale materials suitable for superelasticity, one should research on the optimized crystal orientation and surface roughness for most enhanced superelasticity effect.|$|E

40|$|Rate-independence for {{stresses}} {{within a}} granular material {{is a basic}} tenet of many models for slow dense granular flows. By contrast, logarithmic rate dependence of stresses is found in solid-on-solid friction, in geological settings, and elsewhere. In this work, we show that logarithmic rate-dependence occurs in granular materials for plastic (irreversible) deformations that occur during shearing but not for elastic (<b>reversible)</b> <b>deformations,</b> {{such as those that}} occur under moderate repetitive compression. Increasing the shearing rate, Ω, leads to an increase in the stress and the stress fluctuations that at least qualitatively resemble what occurs due to an increase in the density. Increases in Ω also lead to qualitative changes in the distributions of stress build-up and relaxation events. If shearing is stopped at t= 0, stress relaxations occur with σ(t) / σ(t= 0) ≃ A (t/t_ 0). This collective relaxation of the stress network over logarithmically long times provides a mechanism for rate-dependent strengthening. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures. RevTeX...|$|R
