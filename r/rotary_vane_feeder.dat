25|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor {{with a number of}} blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide {{in and out of the}} slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. <b>Rotary</b> <b>Vane</b> compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|R

40|$|The present article {{refers to}} the {{implementation}} of a new technology of <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuums pumps in a filling machine of beer. The reason why the vacuum is applied to the bottle is to remove the oxygen in its interior and thereby sustain the allowed values of TPO Total Packing Oxygen, preventing oxidation of the product and lose their organoleptic characteristics. This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring vacuum pumps using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily. Presenting two alternatives, maintaining the same technology for the vacuum pumps, or change to <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum pumps. I first analyzed the performance curves of existing vacuum pumps for comparison with the <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> and certify that can generate the same levels of vacuum and then compared in a matrix of all parameters involved decision to finally decide for the <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> vacuum pumps and proceed with the selection of power, tank and other accessories needed to completed the system. The result is a new technology of a rotary distributor pumps to generate the required vacuum with less power and also avoids the waste of water as a measure of commitment to the environment...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{high vacuum}} systems like liquid ring pumps, rotary {{positive}} blowers, and <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> blowers are utilized for the extraction systems. Extraction systems must {{be capable of}} handling water (multi-phase extraction) during the extraction process.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] <b>Rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|R

50|$|Most air {{compressors}} either are reciprocating piston type, <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> or <b>rotary</b> screw. Centrifugal compressors {{are common in}} very large applications. There are two main types of air-compressor pumps: oil-lubed and oil-less. The oil-less system has more technical development, but is more expensive, louder and lasts for less time than oil-lubed pumps. The oil-less system also delivers air of better quality.|$|R

40|$|A {{discussion}} {{of the dynamics of}} a multistage <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> engine is given in terms of a simplified model for combustion driving torques, power dissipation, and torque transmission. Torque transmission is effected by conjugate gear pairs attached to each unit of the engine. An argument for the design of such pairs is presented so that unwanted torque fluctuations in a flywheel attached to a member of the pair can be significantly attenuated. It is suggested that a variant of simple Cosserat dynamics offers a useful modelling tool for discussing the complex interaction between interacting gear teeth. A quasi-stationary analysis is used to place bounds of a particular choice of conjugate gear coupling in the presence of such interactions. It is concluded that a multistage <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> engine with at least two units can be usefully coupled to a single flywheel via a well-defined conjugate gear system that attenuates unwanted torque fluctuations over a broad range of rotary speeds...|$|R

High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.|$|R
50|$|The first {{hydraulic}} shock absorbers {{were of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pattern. These consisted of a cylindrical oil-filled body, bolted to the chassis. A lever arm {{was attached to the}} axle and inside the cylinder, this rotated a spindle carrying a vane or paddle. This vane had only a small hole in it, through which the hydraulic oil could pass. Resistance to flow through the hole provided the damping effect.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{is created}} and {{maintained}} {{by a series}} of pumps. The first stage is usually based on a roughing pump, most commonly a standard <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pump. This removes most of the gas and typically reaches a pressure of around 133 Pa. Later stages have their vacuum generated by more powerful vacuum systems, most often turbomolecular pumps. Older instruments may have used oil diffusion pumps for high vacuum regions.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pump is a positive-displacement pump that {{consists}} of vanes mounted to a rotor that rotates inside of a cavity.

50|$|They are {{typically}} {{used as a}} vacuum pump, but {{can also be used}} as a gas compressor.The function of a liquid-ring pump is similar to a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pump, with the difference being that the vanes {{are an integral part of}} the rotor and churn a rotating ring of liquid to form the compression-chamber seal. They are an inherently low-friction design, with the rotor being the only moving part. Sliding friction is limited to the shaft seals. Liquid-ring pumps {{are typically}} powered by an induction motor.|$|R
5000|$|Vacuum pumps; Studies are {{performed}} in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions (< 10−10 torr) {{in order to}} prevent unwanted interference with the ion beam and/or sample. Common UHV pumps include turbomolecular and ion pumps, with roughing pumping typically performed using a <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> pump. Due to the extreme surface (i.e. first-layer) sensitivity of LEIS, samples also need to be rigorously cleaned prior to analysis. Some common processes used to clean samples include sputtering and annealing. Appropriate equipment for cleaning must be contained within the vacuum chamber.|$|R
40|$|The {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} employment of advanced 3 D CFD tools in the analysis and design of <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> machines is the unavailability of methods for generation of a computational grid suitable for fast and reliable numerical analysis. The paper addresses this issue through an analytical grid generation based on the user defined nodal displacement which discretizes the moving and deforming fluid domain of the sliding vane machine and ensures conservation of intrinsic quantities by maintaining the cell connectivity and structure. Mesh boundaries are defined as parametric curves generated using trigonometrical modelling of the axial {{cross section of the}} machine while the distribution of computational nodes is performed using algebraic algorithms with transfinite interpolation, post orthogonalisation and smoothing. Algebraic control functions are introduced for distribution of nodes on the rotor and casing boundaries in order to achieve good grid quality in terms of cell size and expansion. For testing of generated grids, single phase simulations of an industrial air <b>rotary</b> <b>vane</b> compressor are solved by use of commercial CFD solvers FLUENT and CFX. This paper presents implementation of the mesh motion algorithm, stability and robustness experienced with the solvers when working with highly deforming grids and the obtained flow results...|$|R
