40|$|In {{a survey}} <b>of</b> credit card <b>re{{payments}},</b> Stewart (2009) found that lower minimum payments {{are associated with}} lower actual repayments. In a subsequent hypothetical repayment experiment, Stewart (2009) found that omitting minimum payments from a mock credit card statement increased the size <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> people made. In these supporting materials I {{show that there is}} good agreement between the distributions <b>of</b> <b>repayments</b> found in the survey, in the exper-iment, and in the real world.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{publication}} is {{an analysis of the}} regulation containted in Art. 216 of the Civil Code {{in the context of the}} legitimacy principle. This regulation pertains to the possibility of the reduction <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> to co-owners <b>of</b> a farm in the circumstances when it is conceded to one of them. The author ponders on the aspects of the doctrine and the standpoint of the Constitutional Tribunal referring to the premises of the reduction <b>of</b> these <b>repayments</b> and compatibility <b>of</b> the regulations with the Constitution. The author concludes that whereas the legitimacy principle cannot be the basis for the reduction <b>of</b> <b>repayments,</b> the economic welfare of a farm can be such a basis.

40|$|In 1961 Kenya {{embarked}} on a program of agricultural reform called the Million Acre Settlement Scheme providing for the transfer of ownership {{of land in the}} Rift Valley from outgoing white settlers to local farmers. These new settlers were given loans by the Kenya Government {{to cover the cost of}} the purchase of their plots and of certain development inputs. Over course of time most of these farmers have fallen heavily into arrears with <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> their loans and this problem provides the focus for this study of problems of farmers on the settlement schemes, which has the ultimate objective of making recommendations for improving the present poor rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment.</b> Not unexpectedly overall income was found to be the crucial factor affecting rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment,</b> however the relationship of size of income to rate <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> is not straightforward as other factors intervene, especially patterns of expenditure, and more importantly perhaps to any solution are those which indirectly affect rates <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> through their influence on income levels. It was furthermore discovered that some loan instalments are never credited due to poor administration and that the quality of administration permeates many other variables. This is a purely introductory paper since most data is still being analysed and few figures are adduced in support of the main arguments, which should be taken as provisional in nature. For the same reason no suggestions are made herein for action to improve the situation...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} an {{analysis}} of two criter of choice of investment variants: the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested. The defining of these criteria substantiates the hypothesis that individual times <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> for particular variants drawn up in increasing sequence according {{to the size of}} the invested capital, should be calculated only on the grounds of changing basis, hence by the 'chain' method, and not on a permanent basis. In addition the author indicated that the attempts, met with in literature, at applying simultaneously, permanent and changing bases in calculating individual repayment times, is merely illusory. Further on in the article the author proves that the generally accepted hypothesis on the equiponderance of the criterion of limited time <b>of</b> <b>repayment</b> and the criterion of capital invested is not true, and at the same time indicates in which particular cases this equiponderance can take place.
