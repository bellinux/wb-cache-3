40|$|Software {{engineers}} advocate {{that the}} first step in system development should be a systematic elicitation, analysis and documentation of the requirements, because it is much easier and cheaper to correct mistakes and misconceptions {{at the beginning of the}} process than it is to try and fix problems during implementation and maintenance. The software engineering community agrees on the necessity of a complete and consistent software requirements document for evaluating any software system quality, including reliability [1]. Although requirements documentation has been demonstrated to be effective in other application areas, this stage of the software development is often neglected when solving engineering computation problems. This paper argues that the <b>reliability</b> of <b>engineering</b> computation can be significantly improved by adopting software engineering methodologies for requirements analysis and specification. The argument that requirements analysis can improve the <b>reliability</b> of <b>engineering</b> computation is first made by observing the strong similarity between the waterfall model of the software life cycle and the standard model of the scientific method. The strong similarity implies that engineering computation can benefit from methods that have proved to be successfu...|$|R

25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs.
