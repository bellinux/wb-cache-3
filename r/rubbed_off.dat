5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been <b>rubbed</b> <b>off,</b> insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, {{the owner}} of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft × 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat {{partially}} covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were <b>rubbed</b> <b>off.</b> Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken.|$|E

25|$|Salmon {{eggs are}} laid in {{freshwater}} streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay {{for six months}} {{to three years in}} their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily <b>rubbed</b> <b>off.</b> Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage. The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean.|$|E

25|$|Neil Livingstone was a Sunday {{school teacher}} and {{teetotaller}} who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He extensively read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises. This <b>rubbed</b> <b>off</b> {{on the young}} David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read Philosophy of a Future State, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale {{that he needed to}} reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.|$|E
25|$|The iris flower is of {{interest}} {{as an example of}} the relation between flowering plants and pollinating insects. The shape of the flower and the position of the pollen-receiving and stigmatic surfaces on the outer petals form a landing-stage for a flying insect, which in probing for nectar, will first come into contact with the perianth, then with the stigmatic stamens in one whorled surface which is borne on an ovary formed of three carpels. The shelf-like transverse projection on the inner whorled underside of the stamens is beneath the overarching style arm below the stigma, so that the insect comes in contact with its pollen-covered surface only after passing the stigma; in backing out of the flower it will come in contact only with the non-receptive lower face of the stigma. Thus, an insect bearing pollen from one flower will, in entering a second, deposit the pollen on the stigma; in backing out of a flower, the pollen which it bears will not be <b>rubbed</b> <b>off</b> on the stigma of the same flower.|$|E
25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is <b>rubbed</b> <b>off.</b> Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

25|$|In 1985/86 {{the club}} lost their {{equivalent}} of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh, with Salter, Lloyd and Kline all departing the club. Despite record playing numbers, peaking with 15 teams in 1986/87, {{and the introduction}} of the veterans XI in 1988/89, the next few seasons saw the 1st XI languish in {{the bottom half of the}} ladder, but remained in Chandler Shield. Following a year where the highest ranked senior side was the 8th placed reserve side, John Sharman was recruited to the club as captain/coach in 1990/91. His work ethic on the training field <b>rubbed</b> <b>off</b> on the field, as the top 3 teams all made finals. Sharman also brought with him an array of talent, including determined opening batsman Andrew Hood, Campbell Horlock and all-rounder Harry Drysdale. And with the emergence of Warrandyte juniors Tony Sturesteps, Gerald Walshe and David Mooney, the 1st XI were becoming competitive again, returning to the finals in 1992/93. They lost the semi final to Ainslie Park, which would start one of the great RDCA rivalries. The next season, local fruit shop owner and former Australian test cricket Rodney Hogg was talked into rolling the arm over again. Despite being 42 years old at the time, was still extremely quick when in the mood, and terrorised many a batsmen in his 2 seasons at Warrandyte.|$|E

500|$|The {{adult is}} brown {{with a white}} dusted appearance; white downy {{filaments}} cover much of the body, legs and some wing veins, but this silver body fur is easily <b>rubbed</b> <b>off,</b> and so is often substantially diminished in older adults and museum specimens. Individuals {{have a variety of}} body markings, but all have a pale midline on their pronotum. Their legs are brown, sometimes yellowish, but with no distinct markings. Their dry mass is on average 36.2% of their total bodymass, higher than most Australian cicadas, which suggests strong exoskeletal armour. Their eyes are dark brown. They have yellowish opercula that extend laterally well beyond the body. The female is slightly larger than the male, [...] She has generally similar colour and markings, though can be slightly paler in some areas. Her ninth abdominal segment is long and dark reddish-brown, sometimes partly tending toward black. Her ovipositor is long, with a downward tilt, and the ovipositor sheath is black or dark reddish brown.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} other puffball species with which L.perlatum might be confused. L.nettyanum, {{found in the}} Pacific Northwest region of the United States, is covered in {{granular}} patches, but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of L.perlatum. L.pyriforme lacks prominent spines on the surface, and grows on rotting wood—although if growing on buried wood, it {{may appear to be}} terrestrial. The widely distributed and common L.umbrinum has spines that do not leave scars when <b>rubbed</b> <b>off,</b> a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple-brown at maturity, and a purple-tinged base. The small and rare species L.muscorum grows in deep moss. L.peckii can be distinguished from L.pyriforme by the lavender-tinged spines it has when young. L.rimulatum has purplish spores, and an almost completely smooth exoperidium. L.excipuliforme is larger and grayer, and, in mature individuals, the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores. [...] In the field, L.marginatum is distinguished from L.perlatum by {{the way in which the}} spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets.|$|E
500|$|...

[...] Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she feared Megan Mullally could {{not live up to}} her performance in [...] "Ron and Tammy", but she said the follow-up episode [...] "gave Parks and Rec fans everything they could hope for and more".
