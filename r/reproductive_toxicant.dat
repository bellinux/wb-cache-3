The present work is carried out to study the lead toxicity in experimental Swiss albino male and female mice. Lead acetate was given (640 mg/kg/BW) to pregnant Swiss mice during gestation and lactation period. The results indicated that exposure of lead caused a significant alteration in development of gonads at different dose levels of lead acetate. Lead acetate alters the histology of developing testes as well as ovary. In present investigation it is observed that lead acetate given in high dose caused decreased body weight of developing pups in experimental groups as compared to control pups. Microscopic examination revealed that lead induced apparent damage and reduction in the number of seminiferous tubules and primordial germ cells. Studies conducted on females revealed mostly miscarriages, premature delivery and infant mortality. Lead suppresses the development of primordial follicles during foetal and neonatal life.

The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for systemic toxicity was 25 mg/kg/day (males) and 5 mg/kg/day (females), based on effects at higher doses on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, nutritional parameters, hematology (red and white blood cell), clinical chemistry (liver-related), liver weights, and histopathology (liver, teeth, reproductive tract, and mammary gland).

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{endocrine}} disruption has, {{in view of}} human risk assessment, raised the question on whether more sensitive test methods are needed to detect the reproductive toxic properties of xenobiotic compounds with endocrine properties. We studied six known and alleged endocrine disruptors in an existing reproductive toxicology screening test {{to see if this}} test would score these compounds as <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicants.</b> The protocol involves parental dosage from two weeks prenatally to 6 days postnatally for dams, and a total of 28 days exposure in sires. Compounds tested were the contraceptive Ethynylestradiol, the phytoestrogen Coumestrol, the surfactant 4 -Tert-octylphenol, the plastic monomer Bisphenol A, the fungicide Vinclozolin, and the plasticizer Butylbenzylphthalate. Compound dosage was chosen on the basis of relative potency at the estrogen receptor level. Therefore, apart from ethynylestradiol all compounds were tested at dosages much higher than any likely exposure to be expected in humans. Five compounds were clearly scored as <b>reproductive</b> <b>toxicants,</b> affecting one or more parameters such as fertility, luteinization, spermatogenesis and fetal development. 4 -Tert-octylphenol appeared lethal at the dosage selected and had little effect at a tenfold lower dosage. These data suggest that endocrine disruptors are likely to be effective in existing reproductive toxicity test systems used for human risk evaluation.
