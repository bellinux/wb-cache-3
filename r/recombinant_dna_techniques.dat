Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of Mendel's laws, the gene-chromosome theory of heredity was confirmed {{by the work of}} August Weismann who identified chromosomes as the hereditary material. Also, in observing the halving of the chromosome number in germ cells he anticipated work to follow on the details of meiosis, the complex process of redistribution of hereditary material that occurs in the germ cells. In the 1920s and 1930s population genetics combined the theory of evolution with Mendelian genetics to produce the modern synthesis. By the mid-1960s the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction was firmly established through the new discipline of molecular biology. Genetic engineering, the insertion of genes into a host cell for cloning, began in the 1970s with the invention of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>techniques</b> and its commercial applications applied to agricultural crops followed in the 1990s. There was now the potential to identify organisms by molecular [...] "fingerprinting" [...] and to estimate the times in the past when critical evolutionary changes had occurred through the use of [...] "molecular clocks".|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{amphiphilic}} polypeptide polyproline having different chain lengths {{was connected}} to the C-terminus of human lysozyme by the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>technique.</b> The hydrophobicity of human lysozyme increased with increasing length of the polyproline chain. Although the bactericidal activity of wild-type lysozyme is limited to Gram-positive bacteria and the hydrolytic activity of the mutant lysozyme decreased with increasing chain length of polyproline, the mutant lysozymes showed bactericidal activity to Gram-negative bacteria and the activity increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the mutant enzyme. Experiments with Escherichia coli phospholipid liposomes revealed that the mutant human lysozymes dissipated the valinomycin-induced transmembrane electrochemical potential, and the dissipation increased with increasing hydrophobicity. The increased hydrophobicity of the mutant enzyme may induce interaction of lysozyme with the outer membrane and subsequent penetration into the inner membrane of E. coli, resulting in an increase of bactericidal activity...|$|R
