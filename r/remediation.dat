5|$|The Department of Energy {{continues}} {{to monitor the}} site {{as part of their}} <b>remediation</b> program. This is expected to continue until 2025, after which the site is intended to become a restricted access wildlife preserve.|$|E
5|$|When Chemetco shut down, {{the site}} was sealed and <b>remediation</b> began. However, the process was to prove {{protracted}} and several years later, {{it had not been}} possible to fully complete the process.|$|E
5|$|When {{interviewed in}} early 2005, the Illinois EPA {{inspector}} {{who discovered the}} secret pipe in 1996 was pessimistic about the chances of rapid <b>remediation</b> of the site. He suggested that the clear-up could take twenty years or so.|$|E
5|$|Because {{chromium}} compounds {{were used}} in dyes, paints, and leather tanning compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and groundwater at abandoned industrial sites, now needing environmental cleanup and <b>remediation.</b> Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium 239, with a 24,000 year half life, {{will persist}} in the {{environment}} {{hundreds of thousands of}} years. The DOE's assessment of the Central Operating Unit indicates that the long-term risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is negligible, but citizen organizations state that the <b>remediation</b> of the site was inadequate.|$|E
5|$|The Penn Central Railroad {{acquired}} the yard {{along with the}} rest of the New Haven in 1968; the property was transferred to Conrail on March 30, 1976, and to Amtrak a day later. The MBTA {{acquired the}} yard from Amtrak on November 11, 1987 and used it to store railroad-related materials. Site <b>remediation</b> for environmental contamination including lead, arsenic, and PAHs was completed in 2011.|$|E
5|$|These {{negotiations}} {{broke down}} in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More {{progress has been made}} on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on <b>remediation</b> of dioxin was held.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive <b>remediation,</b> skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{began to}} work with the Vietnamese {{government}} to measure the level of dioxin at the Da Nang Airbase. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and U.S. government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and environmental <b>remediation</b> of dioxin.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater <b>remediation.</b> Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2007, President Bush {{signed the}} U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 into {{law for the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that {{included}} an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the <b>remediation</b> of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, {{pointing out that the}} U.S. airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup. The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010. An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.|$|E

25|$|The cost of each <b>remediation</b> action {{depends on}} the nature of the {{vulnerability}} it addresses. The Defense Infrastructure Sector Assurance Plan that each infrastructure sector must develop, establishes the priorities and resources for <b>remediation.</b> <b>Remediation</b> requirements are determined by multiple factors. These are analysis and assessment, input from military planners and other DoD sectors, the National Infrastructure Assurance Plan and other plans, reports, and information on national infrastructure vulnerabilities and <b>remediation,</b> as well as intelligence estimates and assessments of threats.|$|E
25|$|New in situ {{oxidation}} {{technologies have}} become popular for <b>remediation</b> {{of a wide}} range of soil and groundwater contaminants. <b>Remediation</b> by chemical oxidation involves the injection of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone gas, potassium permanganate or persulfates.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating the {{moisture}} source {{is the first}} step at fungal <b>remediation.</b> Removal of affected materials may also be necessary for <b>remediation,</b> if materials are easily replaceable and not part of the load-bearing structure. Professional drying of concealed wall cavities and enclosed spaces such as cabinet toekick spaces may be required. Post-remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful <b>remediation.</b> Many contractors perform post-remediation verification themselves, but property owners may benefit from independent verification.|$|E
25|$|Environmental <b>remediation</b> {{deals with}} the removal of {{pollution}} or contaminants from environmental media such as soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water. This would mean that once requested by the government or a land <b>remediation</b> authority, immediate action should be taken as this can impact negatively on {{human health and the}} environment.|$|E

25|$|Marlboro Middle School {{contamination}} {{issue was}} an issue which was handled {{by the state and}} local level. It was not a Superfund site. This field was an Angus bull farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The Mayor closed the fields as soon as the test results came in. The township then applied for and received a grant to help with the <b>remediation</b> work. Marlboro received money from the Hazardous Discharge Site <b>Remediation</b> Fund to conduct soil <b>remediation</b> at the soccer fields.|$|E
25|$|Homebush Bay, New South Wales, Australia {{has been}} the subject of a {{controversial}} <b>remediation</b> project.|$|E

25|$|The {{rezoning}} {{is often}} resisted by local communities {{and local government}} because of the adverse effects on the local amenity of the <b>remediation</b> and the new development. The main impacts during <b>remediation</b> are noise, dust, odour and incremental health risk. Then there is the noise, dust and traffic of developments. Then there is the impact on local traffic, schools, playing fields, and other public facilities of the often vastly increased local population.|$|E
25|$|This rezoning, <b>remediation</b> and {{redevelopment}} of land {{contaminated by}} Union Carbide, ICI and others also involves the <b>remediation</b> of {{a strip of}} dioxin contaminated sediments in Homebush Bay, New South Wales. The Homebush Bay area was home to the main events of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. The soil contamination was addressed in the Commission of Inquiry into the Lednez site formerly owned by Union Carbide, {{but not to the}} satisfaction of local community activists.|$|E
25|$|Hypermediated: This form of <b>remediation</b> {{attempts}} to “refashion the older medium or media entirely, while still marking {{the presence of}} the older media and therefore maintaining a sense of multiplicity or hypermediacy” (p.46). This {{can be seen in the}} use of simultaneous window frames, which are able to run different programs representative of different media. Hypermediated <b>remediation</b> is akin to “a mosaic in which we are simultaneously aware of the individual pieces and their new, in-appropriate setting” (p.47).|$|E
25|$|Translucent: The {{new media}} is still {{justified}} {{in terms of}} the old and seeks to remain faithful to the older medium's character. This form of <b>remediation</b> seeks “to emphasize the difference rather than erase it” (P. 46). In translucent <b>remediation</b> “the new medium does not want to efface itself entirely” (p.46). For instance, in regards to the CD-ROM encyclopedia Encarta, Microsoft is attempting to convey to the consumer that, “she has purchased not simply an Encyclopedia, but an electronic, and therefore improved, Encyclopedia” (p.46).|$|E

25|$|The {{site has}} been {{targeted}} for cleanup and commercial redevelopment by Ewing Township, with a $10.4 million grant received in 2011 {{to cover the}} costs of <b>remediation</b> of the site. The funds would come from the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust established following the 2009 bankruptcy filing by General Motors, to be used for the cleanup of 89 properties that had been owned by GM. It will be distributed to Ewing Township as the <b>remediation</b> project progresses {{under the supervision of the}} New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
25|$|Countries such as South Korea and Italy {{invested}} {{little to}} nothing in Y2K <b>remediation,</b> yet {{had the same}} negligible Y2K problems as countries that spent enormous sums of money.|$|E
25|$|Watch and wait: in some cases, natural {{attenuation}} of oil {{may be most}} appropriate, due to the invasive nature of facilitated methods of <b>remediation,</b> particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as wetlands.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, if {{materials}} {{have failed to}} dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities {{even if it is}} not immediately visible. Through a mold investigation, which may include destructive inspection, one should be able to determine {{the presence or absence of}} mold. In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold <b>remediation</b> may be needed. Mold testing and inspections should be carried out by an independent investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to insure accurate results; free mold testing offered by <b>remediation</b> companies is not recommended.|$|E
