5000|$|In 2002, The VARI*LITE {{luminaire}} {{manufacturing and}} sales division (brand, assets and intellectual property) {{were sold to}} the Genlyte Group. [...] The rental division of the company <b>retained</b> the <b>console</b> division {{of the company and}} continued to develop the Virtuoso console product line. The rental division (by this point called VLPS Lighting Services) was merged with the Production Resource Group (PRG) in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The series' {{familiar}} combat {{was considered}} to have been effectively streamlined while <b>retaining</b> the <b>console</b> versions fluid, simple and satisfying movement with effective striking and countering. Some reviewers considered the transition to be less successful, lacking the same intensity and making enemies easier to defeat, preventing the same kinetic bouncing between enemies of the console games. Controlling Batman during combat was noted to be less precise and responsive, and the 2.5D perspective would see Batman often target the closest, rather than intended, enemy across multiple planes, preventing effective combat strategies as more varied enemies begin to appear.|$|R
25|$|It {{comes as}} {{standard}} in either black or white, with other colors available as special editions. It {{was designed by}} Astro Studios in cooperation with Hers Experimental Design Laboratory. In June 2010 a redesign of the console, known as the Xbox 360 S, was announced. This version of the <b>console</b> <b>retains</b> the same basic shape but is noticeably smaller and more angular than the original version. It comes as standard in either matte or glossy black; like its predecessor, other colors are available as special editions.|$|R
50|$|First- {{through early}} {{fifth-generation}} video game consoles commonly used this method {{to connect to}} the television, which {{was used as the}} audio and video device for the game. In many cases, an RF modulator was used to take the composite output from the game and modulate it before sending the signal to the television. Late fifth- through current eighth-generation video game <b>consoles</b> <b>retain</b> the ability to output through RF modulators, usually through a separately purchased adapter. Recently, some RF demodulators have been marketed on obscure online markets to allow channel 3 inputs from legacy devices to work on RCA composite in.|$|R
500|$|Video games' {{progression}} {{into the}} 1990s brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities, {{and the ability}} to use full-motion video (FMV) content in games. In the United States Senate, Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin led hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society which began in 1992. Two games of this era were specifically cited in the hearings for their content; the fighting game Mortal Kombat featured realistic, digitized sprites of live-action actors, blood, {{and the ability to}} use violent [...] "fatality" [...] moves to defeat opponents, while Night Trap featured 90 minutes of FMV content, with scenes that were considered to be sexually suggestive and exploitive. [...] Both Nintendo and Sega had differing views on objectionable content in video games; a port of Mortal Kombat for the Super NES was censored to remove the game's overly violent content, whereas the port for Sega <b>consoles</b> <b>retained</b> much of this content, which helped increase sales.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{designs of}} the Nintendo Wii console, more specifically the Wii models made pre-2011 were fully backward compatible with GameCube devices including game discs, memory cards and controllers. This {{was because the}} Wii hardware had ports for both GameCube memory cards, and peripherals and its slot-loading drive was able to accept and read the previous console's discs. GameCube games work with the Wii without any additional configuration, but a GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles; neither the Wii Remote nor the Classic Controller functions in this capacity. The Wii supports progressive-scan output in 480p-enabled GameCube titles. Peripherals can be connected via a set of four GameCube controller sockets and two Memory Card slots (concealed by removable flip-open panels). The <b>console</b> <b>retains</b> connectivity with the Game Boy Advance and e-Reader through the Game Boy Advance Cable, which {{is used in the}} same manner as with the GameCube; however, this feature can only be accessed on select GameCube titles which previously utilized it.|$|R

5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version <b>retains</b> the <b>console</b> sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|R
5000|$|It {{received}} positive reception upon release; {{it holds}} an aggregate score of 85 and 86.43% at Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. Computer and Video Games Tamoor Hussain called the console version [...] "this generations greatest fighter" [...] and praised the 3D effects, {{the amount of}} content <b>retained</b> from the <b>console</b> version, and its increased appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers. Fellow CVG editor Andy Robinson recommended {{it as one of}} the better launch games. Famitsus editors found it to be well received, giving praise to the graphics and touchscreen control though noting that the Dynamic Mode can be a [...] "bit hard to see." [...] Eurogamers Johnny Minkley noted that while it was not a [...] "serious alternative for high-level players", its gets as close to it as it can. He also gave praise to its figurines and the Dynamic Mode. Kotakus Brian Ashcraft named it the one game to buy around the 3DSs launch, and praised it as demonstrative of what the 3DS can do. He was surprised by the quality of the online play; while he expected it to be as bad as Super Smash Bros. Brawls, he found it [...] "lag-free, smooth and painless." [...] He also gives praise to the StreetPass function and touchscreen control, though he notes that he has not actually been able to use StreetPass yet. Stuffs James Burnett found it to be a strong launch title due to its [...] "fun, fast and tight" [...] gameplay, sound design, and the online multiplayer.|$|R
