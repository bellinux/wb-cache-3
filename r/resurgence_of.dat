50|$|Presently, {{only rarely}} do lakes {{form in the}} basin of Lake Mojave. Individual occurrences {{occurred}} in 1916-1917, 1938-1939 and 1969; this latter lake stage was photographed and it submerged the Tonopah and Tidewater railroad.

Such <b>resurgences</b> <b>of</b> the lake depend on anomalously high precipitation on the San Bernardino Mountains, and are climatically linked to the Little Ice Age and other glacial expansion episodes.
