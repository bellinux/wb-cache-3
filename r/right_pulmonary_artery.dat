40|$|ObjectivesPulmonary artery {{stenosis}} is {{a potential}} complication after Norwood palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. It is unclear whether the shunt type or position in the Norwood procedure {{is associated with the}} risk of the development of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis. We examined the risk of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis and the need for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> intervention in children undergoing the Norwood procedure with either the <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit or modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. MethodsA retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent the Norwood procedure from January 1, 2003, to September 1, 2011. The data from 100 patients were reviewed, including catheterization and echocardiographic data, <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit (n =  67, right shunt position in 17 and left in 50), and <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> (n =  33). The primary outcome measure was the need for operative or catheter-based <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> intervention. ResultsNo patients in the <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> group required catheterization-based <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> interventions. Surgical <b>pulmonary</b> arterioplasty was performed frequently and equally in both the <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> groups at the bidirectional Glenn procedure. Catheter-based pulmonary arterioplasty was performed more frequently in the <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit group, especially when the conduit was positioned to {{the right side of the}} neoaorta. These patients had a 12. 73 increased odds of a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> intervention compared with the left to <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit (P = . 04). ConclusionsConsistent with a previous multicenter randomized trial, patients who received a <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit versus a <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> have a greater risk of requiring <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> interventions. Patients with <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit placement to the right underwent a greater number of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> interventions but demonstrated overall improved growth of the branch <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> compared with the patients receiving a left-sided <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{previously}} reported {{no difference in}} morbidity or mortality in a cohort of infants undergoing stage 1 and 2 reconstructions for hypoplastic left heart syndrome with either a modified Blalock–Taussig shunt or a <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit. This article compares the hemodynamics and perioperative course {{at the time of}} the Fontan completion and reports longer-term survival for this cohort. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of all patients who underwent stage 1 reconstruction between January 2002 and May 2005 and subsequent surgical procedures, as well as cross-sectional analysis of hospital survivors. ResultsA total of 176 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant underwent stage 1 reconstruction with either modified Blalock–Taussig shunt (n =  114) or <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit (n =  62). Shunt selection was at the discretion of the surgeon. The median duration of follow-up was 58 months (range 1 – 87 months). By Kaplan–Meier analysis, shunt type did not influence survival or freedom from transplant at 5 years (<b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit 61 %; 95 % confidence limit, 47 – 72 vs modified Blalock–Taussig shunt 70 %; 95 % confidence limit, 60 – 77; P = . 55). A total of 107 patients underwent Fontan (69 modified Blalock–Taussig shunts and 38 <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduits) with 98 % (105 / 107) early survival. Patients with a <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit shunt pre-Fontan had higher <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> (13  ± 8 mm Hg vs 11  ± 3 mm Hg, P = . 026) and common atrial (8  ± 2. 3 mm Hg vs 6. 8  ± 2. 7 mm Hg, P = . 039) pressures. By echocardiography evaluation, there was more qualitative moderate to severe ventricular dysfunction (<b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit 31 % [12 / 36] vs modified Blalock–Taussig shunt 17 % [11 / 67], P = . 05) and moderate to severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation (<b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit 40 % [14 / 35] vs modified Blalock–Taussig shunt 16 % [11 / 67], P = . 01) in the <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit group. Use of diuretic therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, reflux medications, and tube feedings were not different between groups. Overall, 5 patients underwent heart transplantation (<b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit 4 vs modified Blalock–Taussig shunt 1, P = . 1) before Fontan. There was no difference in age or weight at Fontan, bypass time, intensive care unit or hospital length of stay, postoperative pleural effusions, or need for reoperation between groups. ConclusionsInterim analyses continue to suggest there is no survival advantage of one shunt type compared with the other. Longer-term follow-up of a randomized patient population remains of utmost importance...|$|R

For the 10 patients (14. 5 ± 5 years) with a <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit, the mean (±SD) predilation conduit valve gradient was 57 ± 22 mm Hg, right ventricular pressure 104 ± 21 mm Hg and <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> gradient 75 ± 23 mm Hg; 2 of the patients had additional <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis requiring dilation. In one patient, the balloon could not be advanced across the conduit valve. In 9 of 10 patients in whom dilation was successfully performed, the conduit valve gradient decreased by 59 ± 13 %, <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> gradient by 43 ± 22 % and right ventricular pressure by 31 ± 11 %. After dilation, right ventricular pressure was < 65 % of systemic pressure in seven patients, although no pressure was < 40 %. In 8 of the 11 patients, surgery was avoided or postponed. Complications included loss of a balloon fragment after rupture during the unsuccessful dilation of the right atrium to left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> graft and circumferential balloon rupture requiring catheter retrieval of the distal portion of the balloon from the femoral vein after successful dilation of the <b>right</b> ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit.

40|$|AbstractObjective:Perioperative mortality, {{prolonged}} postoperative recovery {{after the}} Norwood procedure, and mortality between stage I and stage II might {{be related to}} shunt physiology. A <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit offers a banded physiology in contrast to a Blalock-Taussig shunt. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the hemodynamic differences and their consequences in the postoperative course between Norwood patients with a Blalock-Taussig shunt and those with a <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit. MethodsFrom October 1999 until May 2002, 32 unselected consecutive patients underwent a Norwood procedure at the General Hospital Linz. The first 18 patients received a Blalock-Taussig shunt. In the remaining 14 patients we performed a <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit. Both groups were compared. ResultsThe diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit group (P <. 001). Despite a higher FIO 2, PO 2 levels tended to be lower in the first 5 postoperative days. At the age of 3 months, catheterization labora- tory data showed a lower Qp/Qs ratio in the same group (0. 86 [0. 78; 1] versus 1. 55 [1. 15; 1. 6]; P =. 005) and a higher dp/dt (955 [773; 1110] vs 776 [615; 907]; P =. 018). (Descriptive data reflect medians and quartiles [in brackets].) Hospital survival was 72 % in the Blalock-Taussig shunt group versus 93 % in the <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> ar- tery conduit group. Mortality between stage I and stage II was 23 % in the Blalock-Taussig shunt group versus 0 % in the <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit group. ConclusionsA higher diastolic blood pressure and a lower Qp/Qs ratio were associated with a more stable and efficient circulation in patients with a <b>right</b> ventricular to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit.

50|$|The right main {{bronchus}} is wider, shorter, {{and more}} vertical than the left main bronchus. It enters the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. The right main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi), which deliver oxygen {{to the three}} lobes of the right lung—the superior, middle and inferior lobe. The azygos vein arches over it from behind; and the <b>right</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> lies at first below and then in front of it. About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. Eparterial refers to its position above the <b>right</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> The right bronchus now passes below the artery, and {{is known as the}} hyparterial branch which divides into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the impact of relieving branch <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis on <b>pulmonary</b> valve insufficiency and right ventricular function. Long-standing pulmonary insufficiency causes progressive right ventricular dilatation, leading to decreased right ventricular function. Adults with pulmonary insufficiency {{are at risk of}} decreased exercise tolerance, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Branch <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis frequently occurs in these patients, and the presence of branch stenosis may exacerbate valve insufficiency. MethodsNeonatal piglets (n = 7) underwent surgery to create pulmonary insufficiency and left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis. At 3 months of age, the animals underwent baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging followed by stenting of the left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed 1 week after intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation included (1) velocity mapping to assess the forward and reverse flow at the main, left and <b>right</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> and aorta; and (2) volumetric assessment of the <b>right</b> ventricle. ResultsLeft <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> flow increased from 14. 5 % to 36. 3 % of total net flow after stenting (P <. 01). Pulmonary regurgitation decreased from 38. 7 % to 27. 4 % (P <. 02). Right ventricular ejection fraction improved from a median of 53. 5 % to 58. 2 % after stenting (P <. 01). Cardiac index improved from a median of 2. 7 to 3. 5 L/min/m 2 (P =. 01). ConclusionRelief of branch <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis reduces insufficiency and improves right ventricular systolic function in this animal model.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Repair of {{the right}} {{ventricular}} outflow tract (RVOT) in paediatric cardiac surgery remains challenging due to the high reoperation rate. Intimal hyperplasia and consequent arteriosclerosis {{is one of the}} most important limitation factors for graft durability. Since local shear stress and pressure are predictive elements for intimal hyperplasia and wall degeneration, we sought to determine in an oversized 12 -mm RVOT model, with computed fluid dynamics simulation, the local haemodynamical factors that may explain intimal hyperplasia. This was done with the aim of identifying the optimal degree of oversizing for a 12 -mm native RVOT. METHODS: Twenty domestic pigs, with a weight of 24. 6 ± 0. 89 kg and a native RVOT diameter of 12 ± 1. 7 mm, had valve conduits of 12, 16, 18 and 20 mm implanted. Pressure and flow were measured at 75, 100 and 125 % of normal flow at RVOT at the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery,</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> bifurcation and at the left and <b>right</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Three-dimensional computed fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in all four geometries in all flow modalities was performed. Local shear stress and pressure conditions were investigated. RESULTS: Corresponding to 75, 100 and 125 % of steady-state flow, three inlet velocity profiles were obtained, 0. 2, 0. 29 and 0. 36 m/s, respectively. At inflow velocity profiles, low shear stress areas, ranged from 0 to 2 Pa, combined with high-pressure areas ranging from 11. 5 to 12. 1 mmHg that were found at distal anastomosis, at bifurcation and at the ostia of the left and <b>right</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> in all geometries. CONCLUSIONS: In all three oversized geometries, the local reparation of shear stress and pressure in the 16 -mm model showed a similar local profile as in the native 12 mm RVOT. According to these findings, we suggest oversizing the natural 12 -mm RVOT by not more than 4 mm. The elements responsible for wall degeneration and intimal hyperplasia remain very similar to the conditions present in native RVOT...|$|R
