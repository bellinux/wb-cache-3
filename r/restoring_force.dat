5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The <b>restoring</b> <b>force</b> is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the <b>restoring</b> <b>force</b> is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E

We show that viscoelastic coupling leads to in-phase synchronization while elastic coupling favours anti-phase synchronization. To study the impact of symmetry and nonlinearity, the <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> in the Van der Pol oscillators are extended to include nonlinear and asymmetric components. If the asymmetry, or rather the nonlinearity, of the <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> exceeds a certain threshold, only in-phase synchronized motion {{is found to be}} stable.

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple nonparametric method for {{the identification of}} a class of close-coupled nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom systems has been developed. The identification of arbitrary memoryless nonlinearities is possible through knowledge of the accelerations, velocities, and displacements of the various masses. These quantities are used to obtain the surfaces of the <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> as functions of the intermass displacements and velocities. The method was demonstrated by application to a four-degree-of-freedom system to identify the <b>restoring</b> <b>forces.</b> It is found that the identification results are relatively insensitive to measurement noise...|$|R

Both solids and liquids also have tensile strengths, which when exceeded in solids causes irreversible deformation and fracture, and in liquids causes the onset of cavitation. Gases do not have tensile strength, and freely expand in response to changes in pressure.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{characteristic}} time expansion method (CTEM) for estimating nonlinear <b>restoring</b> <b>forces.</b> Because noisy data and numerical instability {{are the main}} causes of numerical developing problems in an inverse field, a polynomial to identify <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> is usually adopted to eliminate these problems. However, results of the way doing are undesirable for a high order of polynomial. To overcome this difficulty, the characteristic length (CL) is introduced into the power series, and a natural regularization technique is applied to ensure numerical stability and determine {{the existence of a}} solution. As compared to previous solutions presented in other researches, the proposed method is a desirable and accurate solver for the problem of <b>restoring</b> the <b>force</b> in the inverse vibration problems...|$|R
40|$|A nonparametric {{identification}} {{technique for}} {{the identification of}} close coupled dynamic systems with arbitrary memoryless nonlinearities is presented. The method utilizes noisy recorded data (acceleration, velocity and displacement) to identify the <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> in the system.

The <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> are expanded in a series of orthogonal polnomials and the coefficients of these polynomial expansions are obtained by using least square fit method.

25|$|The rate of {{relaxation}} of density fluctuations will be rapid if the <b>restoring</b> <b>force,</b> which {{depends upon the}} network elasticity, is large—and if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small.

Popularized in the 1920s as Baldwin Mica Diaphragm radio headphones, balanced armature transducers were refined during World War II for use in military sound powered telephones.

40|$|Background—Peak early-diastolic mitral annulus {{velocity}} (e) by tissue Doppler imaging {{has been}} introduced as a clinical marker of diastolic function. This study investigates whether lengthening load (early-diastolic load) and <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> are determinants of e in addition to rate of left ventricular (LV) relaxation. Methods and Results—In 10 anesthetized dogs, we measured e by sonomicrometry and tissue Doppler imaging during baseline, volume loading, caval constriction, dobutamine infusion, and occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Relaxation was measured as the time constant () of LV pressure decay by micromanometer. Lengthening load was measured as LV transmural pressure at mitral valve opening (LVPMVO). <b>Restoring</b> <b>forces</b> were quantified by 2 different indices: (1) As the difference between minimum and unstressed LV diameter (LminL 0) and (2) as the estimated fully relaxed LV transmural pressure (FRPEst) at minimum diameter. In the overall analysis, a strong association was observed between e and LVPMVO (0. 49; P 0. 001), which indicates an independent effect of lengthening load, {{as well as between}} e and LminL 0 (0. 38; P 0. 002) and between e and FRPEst (0. 31; P 0. 002), consistent with an independent contribution of <b>restoring</b> <b>forces.</b> A direct effect of rate of relaxation on e was observed in a separate analysis of baseline, dobutamine, and ischemia when postextrasystolic beats were included (0. 06, P 0. 01). Conclusions—The present study indicates that in the nonfailing ventricle, in addition to LV relaxation, <b>restoring</b> <b>forces</b> and lengthening load are important determinants of early-diastolic lengthening velocity.

25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her <b>restoring</b> <b>force</b> and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car {{entrance}} located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol was leaning 30 degrees to port.|$|E
25|$|Tonearm skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (<b>restoring</b> <b>force)</b> used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E

25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the <b>restoring</b> <b>force</b> of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E
