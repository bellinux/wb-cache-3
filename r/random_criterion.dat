40|$|The {{heuristic}} method {{is a well-known}} constructive method for initialize trail quality solutions in capacitated vehicle routing problem. Cheapest insertion heuristic is a popular construction heuristic known for being fast, producing decent solutions, simple to implement and easy to extend handling complicated constraints. However, in previous work, there was less focus on diverse initial quality solutions. Therefore, this study proposed an extension to the cheapest insertion heuristic which consider various combinations of seed customer criteria (the first customer inserted on a route) to preserve solutions diversification. Three seed customer criteria proposed which based on the combination of two criteria based on (farthest, nearest and <b>random</b> <b>criteria).</b> The best performing criteria selected and tested on benchmark dataset, later compared with Clarke and Wright saving heuristic. The results shown {{that the combination of}} (farthest and <b>random)</b> <b>criteria</b> obtained the best initial solution which preserve balance between the quality and diversity, with less time when compared to Clarke and wright saving heuristic.

No smoothness assumptions are imposed on the criterion function in order that the results might apply to a broad class of simulation estimators. Complete analyses of two simulation estimators, one introduced by A. Pakes (1986) and the other by D. McFadden (1989), illustrate the application of the general theorems.

Experimental analytical studies identify the prevention, control and assessment of treatments set up {{as well as the}} determination of their efficiency offering; in that way, there are more possibilities than risks during the trial period. That type of study refers to the <b>random</b> <b>criterion</b> in order to measure differences and, in that way, it establishes causal associa-tions which may better determine the intervention mechanism. As inferred by this criterion, con-trol groups would not profit from the benefit of providing a second chance by means of the pro-posed maneuver during rescue. Such determination leaves those included in the control group deserted to their own ill-fate, adding—consequently—a certain lethal risk, which should basic and advanced CPR fail.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{review the}} {{dentistry}} literature regarding methodologies and parameters {{used to evaluate}} the quality of performance of root canal debridement techniques and instruments. MethodsAn extensive literature search with pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria was undertaken to identify studies that assessed root canal debridement, methodologies and parameters used to assess shaping and cleaning ability of root canal debridement and instruments. The relevant literature in the field of endodontics published from November 1950 to February 2014 was reviewed using PubMed and MEDLINE databases in all languages. ResultsA large number of studies have assessed the quality of root canal instrumentation through the evaluation of cleaning ability (debris, smear layer) using histological sections and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The majority (71. 9 %) of studies evaluated the shaping ability. A body of literature has illustrated in-vitro applications of extracted teeth in muffle system and radiographic analysis. Additionally, the majority of studies have used Schneider angle technique as a <b>random</b> <b>criterion.</b> Micro-CT analysis has been increasingly used in the last decade. ConclusionSeveral parameters are employed in the assessment of the post-operative shape or changes in the root canal morphology. Shaping ability of the root canal instrumentation techniques has been more extensively investigated than the cleaning ability. Additional care needs to be taken regarding entire angular changes by combining both Schneider and Canal Access Angel (CAA) methods and their variants. Finally, more concern regarding micro-computed tomography technique has been expressed...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible relationship between the exfoliation of the deciduous second molars (Es) and the onset of the pubertal growth spurt assessed with the cervical vertebral maturation method. Methods: The ability to identify the onset of the pubertal growth spurt (cervical stage 3, CS 3) was evaluated in a sample of 123 patients with exfoliation of the Es (exfoliation group) with respect to a control group of 250 subjects in the late mixed dentition selected with <b>random</b> <b>criteria.</b> Tests of diagnostic performance were applied. Results: The comparison of the prevalence rates of CS 3 in the exfoliation group vs the control group was not statistically significant. The positive likelihood ratio was smaller than 1, thus indicating lack of diagnostic power of the exfoliation of the deciduous second molars with regard to CS 3.

40|$|In Romania {{there are}} several tens of billions lei in {{tangible}} assets {{in various stages of}} implementation and that are more or less subject to funding according to <b>random</b> <b>criteria</b> usually strictly related to political and electoral reasons. The big number of financial fixed assets generates considerable damage to the business environment which in such a critical period of the economic crisis has been its own cause – lack of cash. Certainly, the process may be difficult and in needs of professional solutions with regard to the complex and precise identification, the present value of these assets, the analysis of the opportunity to maintain or propose valuation, the resources that could be made circulate in the economic environment. Business can be stimulated by supporting robust investments and can be challenged by sale, lease or rental of in progress tangible assets that if completed, they would produce added value and would lead to a real value of public patrimony. Domestic and international economic conditions are conducive to such an approach while the Government and local authorities are required to carry out, in a concerted effort, a financial audit of all the intangible fixed assets and, {{on the basis of its}} findings, to adopt the most appropriate measures. Public investment resources within the existing budgetary constraints will hardly be available, but the return to the potential internal resources, available even in the State or local authority patrimony, could generate the necessary additional resources.

40|$|In {{science and}} engineering, {{there is often}} {{uncertainty}} in the linear model assumed for a response when an experiment is being designed. The errors in predictions made from a fitted model may then be more dependent on the systematic errors (bias) that arise from model misspecification than from errors related to the variance of the estimators of the unknown model coefficients. This may result in commonly used criteria, such as D– optimality, being inappropriate for {{the selection of a}} design. In this paper the true model is allowed to differ from the model assumed for design purposes by an additive contamination term which is a <b>random</b> variable. Design <b>criteria</b> are defined which involve properties of the resulting <b>random</b> bias. These <b>criteria</b> are applied to assumed linear models constructed from polynomials or from polynomial splines where the contamination is modeled by random variables that represent the unknown numbers, locations and coefficients of additional knots (or breakpoints). Designs are found using an exchange algorithm which incorporates Monte Carlo simulation to approximate properties of the bias distribution. When the expectation of the contamination is zero, theoretical results enable a reduction in the computationally intensive design search.

As the education of parents increases, the gap between childcare supplied by mothers relative to that supplied by fathers decreases. A two steps semi-cooperative marital decision model is proposed to explain these two facts. First, parents collectively choose the amount of labor to supply and, in a second step, each of them chooses the amount of childcare as the outcome of a Cournot game. This framework gives rise to indeterminacy of the equilibrium and four selection criteria are proposed: one of a machist society, one of a feminist society, one of a random equilibrium and a last one that estimates the degree of social gender bias towards men.
