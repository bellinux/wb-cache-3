5|$|In 1973, Ray Davies dived {{headlong into}} the {{theatrical}} style, {{beginning with the}} rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially <b>reconfiguring</b> {{the group as a}} theatrical troupe.|$|E

BAC modified the specification to solely satisfy Royal Air Force (RAF) needs, <b>reconfiguring</b> the design as the UKVG and sought out new partners to procure the aircraft, which ultimately emerged as the Anglo-German-Italian consortium-funded MRCA (Panavia Tornado), a variable-geometry wing fighter/strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several proposals have been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop sign at the intersection with a traffic light, <b>reconfiguring</b> the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E
30|$|As noticed, when {{a module}} is <b>reconfigured,</b> the data flow is paused until the {{subsequent}} modules are also <b>reconfigured.</b> As mentioned earlier, {{the time needed}} to <b>reconfigure</b> a block is related to its size. This is illustrated in Fig.  10 in which {{the time needed to}} <b>reconfigure</b> the IFFT block is greater than that required by the other ones.

40|$|By {{examining}} the relative benefit of <b>reconfigured</b> airspace {{to the original}} airspace under the same traffic conditions, this paper assessed Flexible Airspace Management that <b>reconfigures</b> airspace boundaries. Using weather rerouted flight plans, four airspace design methods <b>reconfigured</b> the original airspace design in Kansas City Center. Air traffic simulations with estimated NextGen midterm (2018) airport capacities and traffic demand were performed for the original and each <b>reconfigured</b> airspace design. Analysis showed that within the simulated scenarios, <b>reconfigured</b> airspace demonstrated user benefit by decreasing 68 % {{of the number of}} flights needing to be delayed or turned away from entering the airspace to maintain balance between traffic demand and capacity. Utilization of available air traffic control resources increased by 8 %, demonstrating service provider benefit. Airspace design methods that applied more changes to the original airspace achieved more benefit. However, increased change from the original airspace configuration implied a possible increase in air traffic controller workload during the transition from the original to the <b>reconfigured</b> airspace...|$|R
5|$|All of M-63's routing {{was part}} of US33 before that highway's {{truncation}} south of Niles in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has worked on <b>reconfiguring</b> parts of the roadway {{in the early part}} of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River, the Blossomland Bridge, has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Four columns {{were built}} through the {{existing}} Main Stand {{to support the}} Club Deck, which resulted in approximately 1,000 seats having a restricted view. After opening the Club Deck, Ibrox had a capacity of 44,500. When a new playing surface was installed in 1992, Rangers were able to add a further 1,300 seats {{to the front of}} three stands by lowering the pitch slightly. The only standing area of the ground, the enclosure of the Main Stand, was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations. The multi-coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats. A further 1,200 seats was added in this process by <b>reconfiguring</b> passageways, giving a total capacity of 47,998.|$|E

The house originally began as a Colonial, but was greatly modified to Greek Revival around 1825, <b>reconfiguring</b> the central door {{to the left of}} the facade and adding two chimneys.

He flew 66 combat {{missions}} over occupied Kuwait and Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. In June 1998, Zamka was selected for the astronaut program, and reported for training in August. Zamka served as lead for the shuttle training and procedures division and as supervisor for the astronaut candidate class of 2004. Zamka completed his first spaceflight as the pilot of STS-120 (October, 13– November 7, 2007). STS-120 (Discovery) traveled to the International Space Station to deliver the U.S. Node 2 Module, while also <b>reconfiguring</b> part of the station to prepare it for future assembly missions.|$|E

Few now require or even permit configuration adjustments at first install time. This makes installation less daunting, particularly for new users, {{but is not}} always acceptable. For specific requirements, much software must be carefully configured to be useful, to work correctly with other software, or to be secure, and local administrators are often obliged to spend time reviewing and <b>reconfiguring</b> assorted software.|$|E

25|$|At {{a pivotal}} {{meeting with the}} USAAC and NACA in August 1939, Larry Bell {{proposed}} that the production P-39 aircraft be configured without the turbocharger. Some historians have questioned Bell’s true motivation in <b>reconfiguring</b> the aircraft. The strongest hypothesis is that Bell’s factory didn’t have an active production program and he was desperate for cash flow. Other historians mention that wind tunnel tests made the designers believe the turbocharger installation was so aerodynamically cluttered that it had more disadvantages than advantages.|$|E

40|$|Collaborating {{with others}} during recall shapes both group and {{individual}} memories. Individuals contribute less when recalling in groups than when recalling alone, a phenomenon called collaborative inhibition. In contrast, collaboration improves post-collaborative individual memory by providing re-exposure to {{information that would}} have been otherwise forgotten. Collaboration also influences collective memory-the overlap in post-collaborative memory among group members. We examined the role of group configuration on such transmission of memory by varying group configuration across repeated recalls. Participants (N = 162) studied words and completed three recall sessions in one of three conditions (N = 54 /condition) : Individual-Individual-Individual (Control), Collaborative-Collaborative (Identical group) -Individual and Collaborative-Collaborative (<b>Reconfigured</b> group) -Individual. Collaborative inhibition occurred in both the Identical and <b>Reconfigured</b> groups during the first recall but disappeared in the <b>Reconfigured</b> groups during the second recall. Post-collaborative individual memory was greater following <b>Reconfigured</b> than Identical group collaboration. This pattern reversed for collective memories; repeated collaboration increased overlap in the remembered and forgotten items in Identical groups compared to <b>Reconfigured</b> groups. Finally, <b>Reconfigured</b> groups provided a quantifiable index of the influence of distal partners (i. e., no direct collaboration involved) on post-collaborative individual memory. We conclude that group configuration has powerful consequences on the amount, the similarity and the variety of memory representations. 16 page(s...|$|R
