"It may <b>readily</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>in</b> an idolatrous nation, {{that though}} men [...] admit the {{existence}} of several limited deities, yet there is some [...] one God, whom, in a particular manner, they make the object of [...] their worship and adoration. They may either suppose, that, in the [...] distribution of power and territory among the Gods, their nation [...] was subjected to the jurisdiction of that particular deity; or, [...] reducing heavenly objects to the model of things below, they may [...] represent one god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest, [...] who, though of the same nature, rules them with an authority like [...] that which an earthly sovereign exerts over his subjects and [...] vassals. Whether this god, therefore, be considered as their [...] peculiar patron, or as the general sovereign of heaven, his [...] votaries will endeavour, by every art, to insinuate themselves into [...] his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with [...] praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration which will [...] be spared in their addresses to him. In proportion as men's fears [...] or distresses become more urgent, they still invent new strains of [...] adulation; and even he who outdoes his predecessor in swelling the [...] titles of his divinity, {{is sure to be}} outdone by his successor in [...] newer and more pompous epithets of praise. Thus they proceed, till [...] at last they arrive at infinity itself, beyond which there is no [...] further progress; And it is well if, in striving to get further, [...] and to represent a magnificent simplicity, they run not into [...] inexplicable mystery, and destroy the intelligent nature of their [...] deity, on which alone any rational worship or adoration can be [...] founded. While they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect [...] being, the Creator of the world, they coincide, by chance, with the [...] principles of reason and true philosophy; though they are guided to [...] that notion, not by reason, of which they are in a great measure [...] incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar [...] superstition."--(IV. pp. 463-6.) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{crystallization}} dynamics of nanoparticles reversibly tethered by DNA hybridization. We {{show that the}} crystallization <b>happens</b> <b>readily</b> only <b>in</b> a narrow temperature "slot," and always proceeds via a two-step process, mediated by a highly-connected amorphous intermediate. For lower temperature quenches, the dynamics of unzipping strands in the amorphous state is sufficiently slow that crystallization is kinetically hindered. This accounts for the well-documented difficulty of forming crystals in these systems. The strong parallel to the crystallization behavior of proteins and colloids suggests that these disparate systems crystallize in an apparently universal manner.

5000|$|In January 2009, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department {{released}} their Strategic Habitat Plan, covering many topics on {{preserving the}} Wyoming wildlife habitat and providing coexistence with wildlife and civilization. The plan is partly designed to start assessing the necessary steps {{required to keep}} up with the natural changes in the climate, environment, and ecosystems. According to the plan, predictions gathered in 2007 by a panel on climate change deem average air temperatures to change in North America by 1-3°C between the years 2010 and 2039. Correlating with climate change, scientists also predict that new plant and animal congregations and associations will change the environment and the ecosystem [...] For more natural changes <b>happening</b> <b>readily</b> <b>in</b> the ecosystems and habitat, the plan stresses that insects such as bark beetles and budworms combined with drought are significantly changing the Wyoming landscape.|$|R
