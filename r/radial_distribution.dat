25|$|Correlation {{functions}} are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations. From knowledge of elemental structure factors, {{one can also}} measure elemental pair correlation functions. See <b>Radial</b> <b>distribution</b> function for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation {{functions are}} measured with neutron scattering as opposed to x-ray scattering. Neutron scattering can also yield information on pair correlations as well.

25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion <b>radial</b> <b>distribution</b> function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, {{in a manner that}} is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the above}} {{correlation}} functions have been defined {{in the context of}} equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of , it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions and spins, away from equilibrium. As such, their scalar product is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the scalar product across the entire sample. This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the <b>radial</b> <b>distribution</b> functions of glasses.|$|E

25|$|The {{coefficients}} ci {{were determined}} empirically for a 1 M KCl solution, using MD simulations to benchmark the ion <b>radial</b> <b>distribution</b> functions against Equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. The effect of hydration shells {{was found to}} be important in simulations at higher salt concentrations where the conductance of many ion channels, porin among them, is observed to saturate as the salt concentration in the electrolyte baths is further increased. Earlier simulations that did not include a model of hydration shells did not reproduce the conductance saturation behavior. This suggests an additional repulsive potential acting to prevent ion crowding, and hence limiting the concentration of ions and current density in the confined space of the pore even at high bath salt concentration. When the repulsive potential was included moderate channel conductance was observed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Commonly, dynamic line rating (DLR) calculates {{conductor}} temperature {{with a basic}} energy balance equation, which assumes homogeneous {{conductor temperature}}. With this 0 D temperature assumption, however, {{there is a risk}} that inner layers of the conductor might exceed the limit temperature, if the rating current approaches its ampacity. Since conductor overheating should be avoided for operational safety, it is valuable to investigate <b>radial</b> temperature <b>distributions</b> of conductors. Throughout this study, therefore, homogeneous 1 D conductor model with a <b>radial</b> temperature <b>distribution</b> is simulated in steady and transient states. For steady state simulations, <b>radial</b> temperature <b>distributions</b> under various ambient conditions are studied. Higher wind velocity, lower solar radiation, and lower ambient temperature make the temperature gradients more pronounced. Also, transient temperature distribution is modeled with a various stepwise current changes. When the core temperature reaches 80 °C, momentous <b>radial</b> temperature <b>distributions</b> are analyzed. Compared to the steady state, transient phases show smaller temperature differences between core and surface. Both lower initial and higher final currents result in a flatter <b>radial</b> temperature <b>distribution,</b> whereas higher final currents cause faster transient heating.

The <b>radial</b> <b>distribution</b> of interstellar atomic hydrogen often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, allowing the sampling of rotation curves – and thus of the total mass distribution – to a new dynamical regime. Early mapping of Andromeda with the 300-foot telescope at Green Bank [...] and the 250-foot dish at Jodrell Bank [...] already showed that the HI rotation curve did not trace the expected Keplerian decline.
