The corporate bond market in India demonstrates poor investor participation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an account of piece wise cubic spline methodology of yield estimation that can be feasibly implemented by practitioners. This paper attempts to approximate the corporate bond yield using <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> for listed and traded bonds using traded data from the period January 2001 to October 2014. We use a two stage process, where in the first stage, we model the yield behavior of corporate bonds against their <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> nodes of 3 years, 5 years and 20 years, respectively. In the second stage, we identify the significant factors of bond liquidity that impacts the cubic spline residual to improve accuracy in estimation. The first step of piece wise cubic spline estimates the 3 node parameters to predict the logarithmic yield to maturities against their remaining maturity in years. The second step intends to analyze the prediction errors and provides for correction in accuracy incorporating factors of bond liquidity such as issuer, issue and liquidity factors, respectively. The dual approach explains the variation in yields and could be used for identifying quality papers and the reasons for lower investor participation in bond markets and for arriving at term structure in related markets.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 82). BRAC Bank Limited is a scheduled commercial bank in Bangladesh. It established in Bangladesh under the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and incorporated as private limited company on May 20, 1999 under the Companies Act, 1994. Its operation started on July 4, 2001 with a vision to be the market leader through to providing all sorts’ support to people in term of promoting corporate, small entrepreneurs and individuals all over the Bangladesh. BRAC Bank will be a unique organization in Bangladesh. The bank consist of major divisions named 1) Corporate banking, 2) Retail banking, 3) Operations 4) Small & Medium Enterprise (SME). At present the Bank operating its business by 165 branches and 624 SME offices. BRAC Bank is the first local commercial banks that proving online banking service to its customers {{from the very beginning}} of its starts. BRAC Bank, for the first time among local commercial banks, starts providing loan facilities to small and medium trading, manufacturing and service oriented enterprises all over the country. The bank has already established its network in different area of the country with assistance of BRAC. BRAC Bank is trying to develop economic condition of the country. So the bank provides loan facility 3 to 30 lacs taka to that small and medium enterprise that has no easy access to banks/financial institutes. The bank already established 41 Zones and 624 SME offices all over the country. There is 2104 Officers providing service to clients. Till 2014, the bank Disbursed 471618 loans which amount is Tk 291871 million. The success of SME will largely depends on the selection of a business and man behind the business. BRAC Bank provides this facility to those whose business operation is minimum one year and environment friendly business. It provides no loan facility to tobacco business. The business should be legally registered and must have valid trade license. The entrepreneur should be physically able, preferably between the ages 21 to 50. She/he must have the necessary technical skills to run the business and acceptable social standing in the community i. e. people should speak highly of him/her. BRAC Bank gives equally important to the guarantor to getting the SME facility. The guarantor must have the ability to repay the entire loan and is economically solvent. The guarantor should know the entrepreneur reasonable well and should preferable live in the same community. SME loan can be repaid in two ways, 1) in equal monthly loan installment with monthly interest payment. 2) By one single payment at maturity, with interest repayable a quarter ends <b>residual</b> on <b>maturity.</b> Customer relation officers search new potential customer by providing door-to-door service. They talk with clients and monitor their manners, activities of their business and provide the loan to the potential customers. SME, BRAC Bank may provide 100 % of net required working capital but not exceeding 75 % of the aggregate value of the inventory and account receivable. Normally, organizations meet their working capital from over draft loan but BRAC Bank designed the loan to meet working capital but as term loan which is repaid in installment. The customer relation officers also monitor the borrowers’ activities after the loan disbursement. Monitoring also facilitates the buildup of an information base for future reference. Asset Operation Department acts as the last line defense of the bank. This division is responsible for the complete disbursement, recovery and closing procedures. The procedures start from the sanction of the SME loan. The respective select potential enterprise, collect confidential information about the enterprise, open clients account is the respective bank where BRAC Bank has its own account, filled up CIB form and send it to the Asset Operation Department. Then the Asset Operation Department starts its activities. The Asset Operation Department sends the CIB form to the Bangladesh Bank to know the CIB status of the applicant. If the report found clean then it send back to the unit office for send proposal for the loan. Then the unit office sanction loan and send it again in Asset Operation Department for disbursement. The Asset Operation Department then prepare a loan file and checks all necessary documents, prepare a list and disburse it. Then the Asset Operation Department starts enter all information regarding the loan in the banking software “Millennium Banking System (MBS) ” which includes initial ID generation, loan account opening, risk fund collection, activation of the loan. Post disbursement manual activities includes repayment schedule send to unit office, documents stamp cancellation, send the loan file to archive. Recovering activities include receive SMS/Fax for installment deposit, entry the installment information to MBS, print vouchers, cross check SMS/Fax and solve problems, repayment voucher check and posting. Closing activities includes receive SMS/Fax requesting for closing, bring the loan file from archive, obtained approve to closing from the concern authority, checking in MBS, SMS sent to concern customer relation officer (CRO), receiving and print closing SMS/Fax. The core competence of the BRAC Bank is to provide the fastest loans to the clients in this country. To retain this competitive advantage BRAC Bank would provide computer and palmtop facilities whether they can give fastest services to clients than other banks. Also to convey the customer focus, BRAC Bank is trying to reduce collateral securities than other banks. It provides more collateral free secured loans to capture the market. Regarding the services by the CRO, almost all clients are satisfied by get these quick facilities from them. Though it is pioneer division of this bank, I tried to give an in-depth analysis for every factor, which relates the SME division from the perspective of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Risikostruktur in Leasingverträgen und versucht damit Einblicke und Handlungsempfehlungen für das Risikomanagement von Leasingfirmen zu geben. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf einer besonderen und wichtigen Risikoart in eben diesen Verträgen, dem sogenannten Restwertrisiko. Dieses beschreibt das Risiko der Abweichung des vertraglich festgelegten Restwertes vom tatsächlichen Wert des Leasingobjektes am Ende der Vertragslaufzeit. Meine Untersuchung beschäftigt sich dabei mit Automobilleasing, das den größten Anteil am Leasingmarkt besitzt. Das Ziel der Arbeit ist die Untersuchung der folgenden zwei Forschungsfragen: 1.) 	Welche Faktoren beeinflussen in welcher Weise den Restwert? 2.) 	Wie lassen sich Restwerte voraussagen? Zum einen ist ein Mindestmaß an Berechenbarkeit notwendig, um das Restwertrisiko managen zu können. Daher ist eine Identifikation von Einflussfaktoren von Restwerten von großer Wichtigkeit. So lassen sich Schwankungen in den Restwerten auf Veränderungen in den beeinflussenden Variablen zurückführen, wodurch der Werteverlauf des Fahrzeuges von dem Werteverlauf der Einflussfaktoren abgeleitet werden kann. Zum anderen sind Restwerte nicht vorab bekannt, werden jedoch beim Abschluss eines Leasingvertrages benötigt. Aus diesem Grund müssen Restwerte prognostiziert werden. Beide Fragen werden mit Hilfe einer empirischen Untersuchung auf Basis einer ARIMAX-Regression untersucht. Hierfür wird ein Datensatz bestehend aus monatlichen Restwerten von 17 Fahrzeugen des deutschen Automobilmarktes im Untersuchungszeitraum von Juni 1992 bis Dezember 2008 verwendet. Die Einflussfaktoren der Restwerte beschreiben die Marktumgebung dieser Fahrzeuge. Diese lassen sich in drei Kategorien einteilen, wobei die erste Kategorie die gesamtwirtschaftliche Lage, die zweite die Situation auf dem Neu- und Gebrauchtwagenmarkt und die dritte die Charakteristika eines bestimmten Fahrzeuges beschreiben. Die empirischen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die gewählten Faktoren einen Einfluss auf die Restwerte von Fahrzeugen haben. Darüberhinaus lassen sich mit der Hilfe der Einflussfaktoren Fahrzeugrestwerte sehr genau vorhersagen, was zu einer guten Vorhersagefähigkeit führt. Zusätzlich werden die empirischen Ergebnisse und Überlegungen verwendet, um Implikationen für das Risikomanagement von Leasingfirmen theoretisch zu untersuchen. Dazu wird das Bewertungsmodell von McConnell und Schallheim (1983) herangezogen, um zum einen die Auswirkungen v on Schwankungen in einem der zugrundeliegenden Faktoren auf die Leasingrate zu quantifizieren und zum anderen, um die Auswirkungen von Fehlspezifikationen einer der beeinflussenden Faktoren auf die Leasingrate und den Wert des Leasingvertrages zu bestimmen. Die theoretischen Überlegungen geben Einblicke und Handlungsempfehlungen, um das Restwertrisikomanagement für Leasingverträge zu verbessern. The work at hand {{concentrates}} on the risk structure of lease contracts and therefore aims to give insights and support to the risk management of lease firms. The focus lies on a special and highly important type of risk in such contracts named residual value risk describing the risk arising from deviations of the actual <b>residual</b> value at <b>maturity</b> stage of the contract from the estimated one fixed in the contract at its completion. My analysis deals with automobile leases covering the major share of this market. The main objective of this work is the analysis of two research question: 1.) What determines residual values? 2.) How can residual values be predicted? On the one hand, a minimum level of predictability is necessary to manage residual value risk. That is why an identification of determinants of residual values is extremely important. The possibility to link fluctuations in residual values to changes in explanatory variables allows one to trace the pattern of residual values based on {{the pattern of the}} identified risk factors. On the other hand, residual values are not known in advance but needed at the completion of the lease contract. This is why residual values have to be predicted. These questions are assessed by an empirical analysis using the ARIMAX regression methodology. The analysis uses a sample covering monthly residual values of 17 cars in the German automobile market for the observation period from June 1992 to December 2008. The determinants of the residual values describe the market environment of used cars. Those can be classified into three man categories. The first one illustrates the overall economic situation, the second one describes the situation in the new and used car market and the third one specifies a certain car model in more detail. The empirical results give evidence that the chosen factors influence the residual values of cars. Moreover, those determinants lead to very accurate predicted residual values showing a high forecast ability. Furthermore, the empirical results and considerations are used to conduct a theoretical analysis in order to derive implications for the residual value risk management. The valuation model of McConnell and Schallheim (1983) is used on the one hand to quantify the impact of fluctuations in the underlying factors on the lease rate and, on the other hand, to analyse the effects of misspecifications in an underlying market factor on the lease rate and the value of the lease contract. These theoretical considerations give insights and support to improve the risk management of residual values in lease contracts...|$|R

In this paper we propose a new framework to estimate benchmark- default and liquidity risk free- yield curve along with an illiquidity discount using the stochastic frontier functions.

Using the daily secondary market data from National Stock Exchange-Wholesale Debt Market for Government of India bonds for the period January 1997 to July 2002, we find that the new methodology not only identifies frontier yield curve that is significantly different from the standard zero coupon yield curve and gives reasonable estimates of illiquidity discounts, but also performs better than the standard yield curve models in terms of tracking observed bond prices...|$|E

The present exercise contributes to the existing empirical literature with an analysis of the Government of India bond market. The term structure is estimated using the Nelson-Siegel functional form, using daily information on secondary market trades in Government of India securities from NSE-WDM for the period January 2000 to June 2001. We find that significant pricing errors exist when Government bonds are priced using the term structure alone. The security specific factors such as <b>residual</b> <b>maturity,</b> time since issuance or age, current yield and issue-size account for most of the variation in pricing errors.

40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the Euro-currency Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a <b>residual</b> <b>maturity</b> breakdown of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary memorandum items (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one memorandum item, viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve flexibility in reserve management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one memorandum item - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the Euro-currency Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|E
