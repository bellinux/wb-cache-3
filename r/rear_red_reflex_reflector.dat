40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> (Brückner) screenings in newborns and infants. Material and Method: The study included 2718 newborns and infants screened between January 2007 and January 2010. Red reflex examination was done during routine visits at 2 - 8 weeks of age. In cases where the <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> was not observed or abnormal <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> was present, infants were referred to the opthalmology outpatient clinic and risk factors were investigated. The study {{was approved by the}} ethics commite (15. 01. 2007 - 21). Results: Red reflex examination of 2715 infants (99. 8 %) were normal. Red reflex was absent in both eyes in two infants (00. 7 %) and in one eye in one infant (00. 2 %). The infants with bilateral absence of <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> were diagnosed with bilateral cataracts, while the infant with unilateral absence of <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> was diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Risk factor investigation revealed that one of the infants with bilateral cataracts had Down syndrome. No risk factors were identified in the other cases. Conclusions: This study highlights the appropriateness of usage of the <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> test by pediatricians and primary care physicians during routine examinations of all newborns and infants in order to prevent vision loss and ensure that relevant treatment is successful.

Methods: The <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> exam was released in 30 cities of the surrounding Botucatu area, lectures were done in the cities invited to participate by the Regional Department of Health. 109 pen torch ophthalmoscopes were distributed to the hospital maternities and primary care units. The Red reflex screening attended cases of altered or doubtful <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> and established the diagnosis. The Center for treatment of childhood cataract performed the preoperative examination, surgical treatment and follow-up of children with cataracts. Results: After one year the Red reflex screening attended 29 children, 17 males and 12 females, mean age and pattern deviation (PD) of 10. 09 +/- 20. 35 months (7 days - 98 months old). 16 patients were referred with altered <b>red</b> <b>reflex,</b> with a mean age and pattern deviation of 13. 17 +/- 24. 14 months (7 days - 98 months old).

Methods: Six eyes of 6 patients with cataracts without <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> were submitted to phacoemulsification using a direct injection of 0. 2 to 0. 5 ml of 0. 025 % trypan blue in the anterior chamber previous to viscoelastic injection.

Results: In all cases the capsule became stained with a faint blue color that enabled an adequate visibility of the flap during the continuous curvilinear anterior capsulotomy (CCC). There were no intra-or postoperative complications. The endothelial cell loss varied between 1. 8 % and 26. 6 % (mean 12. 8 %).

Methods: We describe {{a case of}} an abnormal <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> seen on a newborn exam. Results: A full-term female born via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications {{was seen in the}} newborn nursery. She was noted to have an abnormal eye exam. Pupils were large with circular dark excrescences of the iris pigment epithelium. She was referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist where she was noted to fixate and follow faces. No afferent pupillary defect was seen. OD <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> was normal whereas OS <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> was blocked mostly by dark excrescences. A 2 – dark brown lesion was seen in the OD iris and a 3 – 5 mm dark brown lesion was seen in the OS iris, consistent with a pupillary iris pigment epithelial cyst. Central visual axis was clear OU. Glaucoma was not present and patching was not performed. Observations and clinical photographs were recommended with follow-up in three months. Conclusion: Iris pigment epithelial cysts are uncommonly seen in children. The primary care provider first seeing a newborn must be aware of lesions obscuring a <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> with appropriate follow-up. Follow-up in three months with IOP measurements is recommended.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} ocular health {{practices}} within the neonatal {{units of the}} City of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 36 neonatal units that performed 3000 or more deliveries during 2004. Data were collected on Credè’s method of ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis, <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> testing, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and treatment, and ophthalmic referral systems. Results: All of the identified neonatal units completed the survey. Credè’s method was used correctly in 31 (86 %) units and the <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> test was performed in 29 (81 %) units. All units {{were aware of the}} risk factors for ROP, but the examination for its detection was executed on a routine basis in only 31 (86 %) units and only 22 (61 %) of the units were aware of the correct timing for the first examination for ROP. Treatment for ROP was done by the identifying hospital in 17 (55 %) units and 14 (45 %) hospitals transferred the neonate to an external service. After the patient’s discharge, 30 (83 %) neonatal units reported that they appropriately referred neonates for ophthalmic follow up. Conclusions: Prophylaxis against gonococcal conjunctivitis and the <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> test need to be implemented more widely, tertiary referral systems need to be established in some services and the management of ROP should be improved. These recommendations may be achieved by designing and implementing guidelines around prevention and control activities to ensure that all avoidable ocular diseases are identified and managed appropriately within this vulnerable age group.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prerequisites}} {{for a good}} capsulorhexis include a deep, well maintained anterior chamber, globe stabilization and globe manipulation. This helps to achieve a capsulorhexis of optimal size, shape and obtain the best possible position for a red glow under retroillumination. We report the use of irrigation handpiece of bimanual irrigation aspiration system to stabilize the globe, maintain a deep anterior chamber and manipulate the globe {{to a position of}} optimal <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> during needle capsulorhexis in phacoemulsification. Methods Two side ports are made with 20 G MVR 'V' lance knife (Alcon, USA). The irrigation handpiece with irrigation on is introduced into the anterior chamber through one side port and the 26 -G cystitome (made from 26 -G needle) is introduced through the other. The capsolurhexis is completed with the needle. Results Needle capsulorhexis with this technique was used in 30 cases of uncomplicated immature senile cataracts. 10 cases were done under peribulbar anaesthesia and 20 under topical anaesthesia. A complete capsulorhexis was achieved in all cases. Conclusion The irrigating handpiece maintains deep anterior chamber, stabilizes the globe, facilitates pupillary dilatation, and helps in maintaining the eye in the position with optimal <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> during needle capsulorhexis. This technique is a safe and effective way to perform needle capsulorhexis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To analyse {{and discuss}} {{screening}} {{for the detection}} of congenital cataract in two Nordic countries, Denmark and Sweden. Methods: Until 2011, in Denmark, no guideline concerning screening for congenital cataract existed. Since 2011, Danish guidelines regarding eye examination include examination with a pencil light at age 5 weeks, whereas newborn <b>red</b> <b>reflex</b> examination using a handheld ophthalmoscope is routine protocol in Swedish maternity wards. Data regarding age of referral were derived from the Pediatric Cataract Register (PECARE). All children operated on before 1 year of age between January 2008 and December 2012 were included. Statistical comparison of the different screening strategies was made. Results: The number of children undergoing surgery for congenital cataract before 1 year of age was 31 (17 bilateral cases) in Denmark and 92 (38 bilateral cases) in Sweden. The proportion was 14 per 100. 000 children in Denmark and 16 in Sweden (p < 0. 05). There was a statistically significant difference between Denmark and Sweden in the percentage of children referred within 42 days of birth (p < 0. 0001) and within 100 days (p < 0. 001).
