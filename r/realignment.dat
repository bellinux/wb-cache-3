5|$|On 1955-09-12, SH-8 {{underwent}} a small <b>realignment.</b> Previously, the highway went due north from Carmen, then turned due east, running through Lambert before connecting to US-64 south of Cherokee. As {{a result of}} the 1955 <b>realignment,</b> SH-8 cut northeast to connect to US-64 directly, bypassing Lambert.|$|E

40|$|Most {{analysis}} of {{the relative importance of}} different countries in the EMS has focused on the interaction of monetary policies. This paper addresses more directly the interdependence of exchange markets. Guided by the desire to know to what extent developments in one EMS country can influence the value of another 2 ̆ 7 s currency, we look at exchange rate movements around <b>realignments.</b> We find no evidence of a systematic effect of <b>realignments</b> on the US dollar/DM rate, while the US dollar value of other currencies has clearly changed {{as a result of the}} <b>realignments.</b> Furthermore, <b>realignments</b> have tended to influence the forecastability of the US dollar/DM rate less than that of other EMS currency/dollar rates. We conclude that the <b>realignments</b> provide no evidence against the proposition that the DM is a dominant currency, and that movements in the other member currencies have little effect on the external value of the DM. In this limited sense, we maintain that the EMS is a DM zone...|$|R

On that date, {{the commission}} approved a <b>realignment</b> of US-59 {{from a point}} south of the intersection with US-270 and US-271, to that junction, and on into Poteau. The <b>realignment</b> was submitted to AASHO on April 10 of that year, received on April 13, and approved on June 26. A section of highway north of Jay was straightened on October 7, 1974. Another straightening was approved the following year, {{this time in the}} vicinity of Heavener; this change was approved by the highway commission on August 19, 1975, and approved by AASHO, now renamed to , on July 13, 1976.

5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total <b>realignment</b> between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a <b>realignment</b> across a bend in the river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges.|$|E
