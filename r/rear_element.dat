2500|$|The rear of {{the skull}} is {{dominated}} by a large eye socket, often covering the {{major part of the}} rear side surface. In the socket, a large scleral ring is present; this is a circular structure of small, overlapping bone segments protecting the eye against the water pressure. Both in the relative and absolute senses, ichthyosaurs have the largest eye sockets of all known vertebrates. The other rear skull elements are typically so compressed and fused that they are difficult to identify. The top <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of the skull was usually assumed to be the supratemporal bone, while the squamosal and quadratojugal were sometimes fused. However, in 1968, Alfred Sherwood Romer stated that the presumed supratemporal was in fact the squamosal, which was in 1973 confirmed by McGowan. In 1990, though, John Steve Massare convinced most researchers that the original identification had been the correct one after all. The supratemporal forms the rear rim of the supratemporal opening; a lower temporal opening at the side is lacking. The front rim of the supratemporal opening is typically formed by the postfrontal; only with the very basal Utatsusaurus the postorbital and the squamosal still reach the edge. Between the paired supratemporal openings, the skull roof is narrow; some species have a longitudinal crest on it as an attachment for the jaw muscles. Basal Ichthyopterygia have a parietal eye opening between the paired parietal bones. With ichthyosaurs proper, this opening moves to the front, first to the border between the parietals and the frontals and ultimately between the frontals, a condition shown by derived species. [...] Postparietal and tabular bones are lacking. Often, the bones {{of the back of the}} skull and the palate are incompletely ossified, apparently having partly remained cartilage. The occipital condyle is typically very convex. The stapes, the bone transmitting sound waves from the eardrum to the middle ear, is elongated and not pierced by a foramen. Pterygoid teeth are typically lacking.|$|E

50|$|Telephoto series. The 360 mm / 600 mm are triple-convertible lenses with 500 mm and 720 mm / 800 mm and 1200 mm {{interchangeable}} <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> {{which were}} available separately.|$|R
50|$|The lens is {{designed}} to split into two pieces, the front and <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> screwed, usually by a trained technician, into {{the front and back}} of the shutter assembly, and the whole fitted in a lensboard.|$|R
5000|$|Both IX Nikkor lenses, for Nikon's Advanced Photo System (APS) SLRs, {{and very}} old [...] "invasive" [...] Fisheye-Nikkor lenses from the 1960s {{must not be}} mounted on the FM, as their <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> will damage the FM's reflex mirror.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of a retrofocus lens of 18 mm to be more than 25 mm from the film plane. This makes it possible to design wide-angle lenses for single-lens reflex cameras.|$|E
50|$|Some M42 lenses extend too {{far into}} the camera body, causing {{interference}} between the mirror mechanism of the camera, and <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> or aperture pin of the lens. This issue is most commonly encountered with certain Takumar lenses adapted to Canon full frame cameras.|$|E
50|$|The Hologon is a {{modification}} of the Biogon lens design. It contains a <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> that is close to film plane for better contrast, but interferes with mirror for SLR. There is significant light falloff at edges, so it is frequently used with ND center graduated filters.|$|E
5000|$|Both IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's Advanced Photo System (APS) film SLRs {{and very}} old [...] "invasive" [...] Nikkor 35 mm fisheye lenses {{must not be}} mounted on the FM10, as their <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage.|$|R
50|$|With the 2014 {{technical}} regulations banning the cars' lower <b>rear</b> wing <b>elements</b> and introducing a mandatory central exhaust position the monkey seat is now increasingly designed and positioned {{to use the}} flow from the exhaust {{to increase the efficiency}} and consistency of the main <b>rear</b> wing <b>element</b> above it in addition to generating its own downforce.|$|R

50|$|Due to its old design, the 135mm SF {{does not}} feature USM technology; rather, it uses arc-form drive technology. Despite this, {{focusing}} is quite fast and reasonably quiet. Since focusing is achieved with the <b>rear</b> <b>element,</b> the front element does not rotate or extend. The lens supports all 52mm filters.|$|E
50|$|The gliding {{mirror is}} Hasselblad's {{solution}} to the problems experienced when using telephoto lenses on select 500 and 200 series SLR cameras. The mirror is able to glide backwards about 8mm before folding upwards, which allows it to clear the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of certain telephoto lenses while still providing 100% viewfinder coverage.|$|E
50|$|The second {{benefit is}} that, since a {{body with a}} smaller sensor can use a smaller mirror, the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of the lens can extend {{somewhat}} into the body without danger of being struck by the mirror. Particularly for a wide-angle lens, this gives the lens designers more freedom in designing the lens' optical formula.|$|E

50|$|Yamagata also {{landed a}} {{detachment}} with two infantry brigades and 1,200 policemen behind the rebel lines, {{so as to}} fall on them from the rear from Yatsushiro Bay. Imperial forces landed with few losses, then pushed north seizing the city of Miyanohara on March 19. After receiving reinforcements, the imperial force, now totaling 4,000 men, attacked the <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> of the Satsuma army and drove them back.|$|R
50|$|By {{reducing}} {{the distance between}} the <b>rear</b> lens <b>element</b> and the sensor, a more compact construction is possible.|$|R
50|$|Since , {{it follows}} that no lens can be faster than 0.5 if it {{operates}} in air. Lenses can be made faster than this by requiring the film emulsion to be in physical contact with the <b>rear</b> <b>element,</b> thus eliminating the air gap between the lens and the emulsion. Another option is to use oil immersion techniques.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of wide-angle lens: short-focus lenses and retrofocus lenses.Short-focus lenses are generally {{made up of}} multiple glass elements whose shapes {{are more or less}} symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases.|$|E
50|$|The 55th TSC (MMC) {{consists}} of forward and rear elements. This organization operates under a split-based concept with a forward element {{that is in}} support of deployed theater units while maintaining a <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> in support of non-deployed units. When required, this organization deploys Material Management Teams (MMTs) capable of providing limited Corps Materiel Management Center (CMMC) forward functions and immediate communications with all elements prior {{to the establishment of}} the theater communications network.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{inherited}} from the Stradale was of tubular steel. The fuel tank was lined with rubber. The body was a coupé executed in fibreglass.

40|$|The list is a {{fundamental}} data structure. It stores a linearly ordered collection of elements and allows access only {{to the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> of the list. Catenation can be applied to lists, unifying the rear of one list with the front of another. Absent other requirements, the basic list operations, including catenation, have straightforward implementations. If the list has certain secondary properties, however, the operations, particularly catenation, become more difficult. Non-destructive list...|$|R
50|$|The Biogon is an ultra-wide-angle {{design by}} Ludwig Bertele {{based on a}} {{double-ended}} reversed-telephoto objective. It was made by Zeiss for their 35mm Contax and the medium-format Hasselblad cameras. The design was physically large, being two focal lengths in length and one focal length in diameter. There are two menisci at the front, and a single strong meniscus element at the rear. The <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> {{is close to the}} film plane for low distortion and better contrast, but interferes with the mirror on a single-lens reflex camera.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{photographic}} lenses {{designed for}} film cameras cannot {{be adapted to}} work on 3-chip video cameras. In many cases, the prism block simply leaves no room for the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of the lens. In cases where the lens does fit, the resulting optical aberrations created by the prism (primarily spherical) would destroy image quality. Apart from this, the sensors on a [...] "2/3 inch" [...] video camera are closer in size to a 16 mm film frame and so would produce a similar depth of field.|$|E
5000|$|Despite common belief, the Tessar was not {{developed}} from the 1893 Cooke triplet design by replacing the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> with a cemented achromatic doublet. In fact, Paul Rudolph designed the Anastigmat with two cemented doublets in 1890. In 1899, he separated the doublets in the Anastigmat to produce the four-element, four-group Unar lens. In 1902, he realized that reversing the two rear elements of the Unar and returning to a cemented doublet would improve performance; he named the result [...] "Tessar", from the Greek word τέσσερα (téssera, four) to indicate a four-element design.|$|E
50|$|Nikon's {{most recent}} 35 mm film SLR lenses, the AF Nikkor G type (introduced in 2000) lacking an {{aperture}} control ring; and the AF Nikkor DX type (2003) with image circles sized for Nikon's digital SLRs will mount, {{but will not}} function properly. IX Nikkor lenses (1996), for Nikon's Advanced Photo System (APS) film SLRs, must not be mounted, as their <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> will intrude far enough into the mirror box to cause damage.|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{vignetting}} {{is caused}} by the physical dimensions of a multiple <b>element</b> lens. <b>Rear</b> <b>elements</b> are shaded by elements in front of them, which reduces the effective lens opening for off-axis incident light. The result is a gradual decrease in light intensity towards the image periphery. Optical vignetting is sensitive to the lens aperture and can often be cured by a reduction in aperture of 2-3 stops. (An increase in the F-number.) ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{upon hearing}} {{the sounds of}} battle from Płowce, <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> of the German {{formations}} rushed to aid their fellow knights, and soon another third of the Teutonic Order's forces arrived. The long and bloody battle resumed and continued until dark, with high casualties on both sides. Poland scored a clear victory, with Reuss von Plauen, commander of the German army, and another 40 knights taken prisoner by the Poles. After fleeing Płowce, the knights withdrew to Toruń (Thorn).|$|R
50|$|The battle raged {{throughout}} the afternoon until, as Finnegan committed {{the last of}} his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finnegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. However, the Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> of Seymour's forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of black soldiers. The Confederate cavalry commander received criticism for failing to pursue the retreating Union forces.|$|E
50|$|The Leicaflex SL {{replaced}} the mirror lock-up {{function of the}} original Leicaflex with a depth of field preview. The principal effect of this change was to obsolete the rangefinder-derived 21mm f/3.4 Schneider Super-Angulon lens which, due to the protrusion of the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> into the camera body, was designed {{to work with the}} mirror locked up in conjunction with an external viewfinder. This lens cannot be mounted on the SL or its followers without mirror lockup. The original Leicaflex Super-Angulon was replaced by the retrofocus type 21mm f/4 Super-Angulon-R, which can be mounted in the conventional way.|$|E
50|$|Inverting the {{telephoto}} configuration, employing one or {{more negative}} lens groups {{in front of a}} positive lens group, creates a wide-angle lens with an increased back focal distance. These are called retrofocus lenses or inverted telephotos, which have greater clearance from the <b>rear</b> <b>element</b> to the film plane than their focal length would permit with a conventional wide-angle lens optical design. This allows for greater clearance for other optical or mechanical parts such as the mirror parts in a single-lens reflex camera. Zoom lenses that are telephotos at one extreme of the zoom range and retrofocus at the other are now common.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, single-lens reflex cameras {{cannot be}} made as small or as light as other camera designs—such as {{rangefinder}} cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with electronic viewfinders (EVF)—owing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed <b>rear</b> <b>elements</b> from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a mirror lockup feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required.|$|R
50|$|On 13 June 1944, {{an attack}} by the 22nd Armoured brigade group of the British 7th Armoured Division outflanked Panzer Lehr's defences around Tilly-sur-Seulles and cut through the German lines, taking the village of Villers-Bocage and {{threatening}} Panzer Lehr's <b>rear.</b> <b>Elements</b> of Panzer Lehr, the 2nd Panzer Division, and the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion were committed to defeating the British penetration. The ensuing Battle of Villers-Bocage saw the British withdraw to their start lines {{after two days of}} inconclusive fighting. By 17 June, Panzer Lehr had been forced to withdraw.|$|R
