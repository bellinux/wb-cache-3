5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was pressed by <b>regional</b> <b>bodies</b> from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} <b>regional</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{national}} governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

25|$|Wolverhampton {{city centre}} falls {{outside of the}} area {{traditionally}} known as the Black Country, although some districts such as Bilston and Heath Town and the Willenhall side of Wolverhampton fall within the Black Country coalfields, leading to confusion {{as to whether the}} entire city falls within the region. Modern usage has tended towards using the term to refer to {{the western part of the}} West Midlands county, excluding Birmingham, Solihull and Coventry. Examples would be UK Government <b>regional</b> <b>bodies</b> such as the Black Country Development Corporation, under whose remit the city fell.|$|E
30|$|But {{the fact}} that the <b>regional</b> {{cooperation}} <b>body</b> does not possess monetary incitements (ownership) towards the PTA, is used by the PTA as an argument against involving the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> in all matters.

25|$|The {{provisional}} government {{decided that the}} National Assembly would take place in Nafplio, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and proposed that the Assembly take place in Nafplion, while the city remained under his control. His stance divided his supporters and weakened him politically. Most {{of the members of}} the Peloponnesian Senate obeyed the decisions of the government, and the captains were forced to negotiate their participation in the Assembly. Finally, the Second National Assembly was gathered in March 1823 in Astros. Central governance was strengthened at the expense of <b>regional</b> <b>bodies,</b> a new constitution was voted, and new members were elected for the executive and legislative bodies.|$|E
25|$|Military {{leaders and}} representatives of Filiki Eteria were marginalized, but {{gradually}} Kolokotronis' political influence grew, and he soon managed to control, along with the captains he influenced, the Peloponnesian Senate. The central administration tried to marginalize Kolokotronis, who also had under his control the fort of Nafplion. In November 1822, the central administration decided that the new National Assembly would take place in Nafplion, and asked Kolokotronis to return the fort to the government. Kolokotronis refused, and the Assembly was finally gathered in March 1823 in Astros.

25|$|Local {{churches are}} {{typically}} gathered together in <b>regional</b> <b>bodies</b> called Associations. Local churches often give {{financial support to}} the association to support its activities. The official delegates of an association are all ordained clergy {{within the bounds of}} the association together with lay delegates sent from each local church. The association's main ecclesiastical function is to provide primary oversight and authorization of ordained and other authorized ministers; it also is the ecclesiastical link between the local congregation and the larger UCC. The association ordains new ministers, holds ministers' standing in covenant with local churches, and is responsible for disciplinary action; typically a specific ministerial committee handles these duties. Also, an association, again {{with the assistance of the}} ministerial committee, admits and removes local congregations from membership in the UCC.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{cover is}} {{provided}} by over fifty fire and rescue services (FRS), which is the term used in modern legislation and by government departments. Many FRS were previously known as brigades or county fire services, but almost all now use the standard terminology. They are distinct from and governed by a fire authority, which is the legislative, public and administrative body, made up of civilians (usually members of elected local or <b>regional</b> <b>bodies).</b> Fire authorities in England and Wales (and formerly Scotland), and therefore fire and rescue services, receive {{a large proportion of}} their funding through a share of Council Tax. Scotland and Northern Ireland have centralised fire and rescue services, and so their authorities are effectively committees of the devolved parliaments. The total budget for fire services in 2014-15 was £2.9 billion.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches in the U.S. {{merged with}} the Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ. About 90% of the CC congregations {{affiliated}} with the General Council joined the United Church of Christ. Some churches abstained from the merger while others voted it down. Most of the latter congregations became members of either the CCCC (mentioned above) or the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches. The latter was formed by churches and people who objected to the UCC merger because of concerns that the new national church and its <b>regional</b> <b>bodies</b> represented extra-congregational authorities that would interfere with a congregation's right to govern itself. Thus, the NACCC includes congregations {{of a variety of}} theological positions. Still other congregations chose not to affiliate with any particular association of churches, or only with regional or local ones.|$|E

Additionally the COTED resolved the disagreement on duck meat trade between Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, with Trinidad and Tobago now willing (by mid-November 2017) to approve Suriname as one of the countries that has met the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements for exporting duck meat to the country.|$|E

The {{bilateral}} accord {{was signed in}} the presence of representatives from the two regional states, including politicians, traditional leaders and civil society activists. Among the clauses of the accord were equitable allocation of international assistance by the federal authorities, agreeing on pre-civil war boundaries and regional demarcations established by the military government, and recommending that the federal authorities both delegate powers to <b>regional</b> <b>bodies</b> and adopt a No Objection Policy. Additionally, the memorandum stipulates that the two regional states will form a security committee consisting of representatives from both administrations, which will facilitate launching joint counterinsurgency operations, extradition, and expertise and intelligence sharing. The two administrations also proposed the creation of an interstate commission to liaise between the federal government and constituent regional states. They likewise indicated that their respective Chambers of Commerce would buttress commercial exchanges and cross-border trade.|$|E

30|$|The {{relationship}} between the county council and the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> seems to have changed due to the election in 2006. The PTA president stated that before the 2006 election, political dialogue between the PTA, <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body,</b> and county council was very productive. Before 2006, the political orientation of the majority was the same in both the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> and the county council; according to the PTA president, both the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> and county council chairs were good friends. After the 2006 election, the political majorities of the different organizations changed, and now the county council was governed by a Conservative block, whereas the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> had a Social Democratic chair. According to the PTA president, the dialogue between the county council and the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> had become “frosty”. Due to these frosty relations, the PTA president almost exclusively discussed policy issues with the county council as a single part [31]. In addition, civil servants working in the municipalities stated in interview that their main dialogue was with PTA directly, not via the <b>regional</b> cooperation <b>body</b> (see, e.g., [32]).|$|R
