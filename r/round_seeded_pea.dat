40|$|As {{part of the}} EU Core Organic II {{research}} project ICOPP (Improved contribution of local feed to support 100 % organic feed supply to pigs and poultry), a feeding trial was conducted in which grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> were included in diets for weaned piglets. The grass pea is a hardy grain legume that produces protein-rich seeds, but due to its content of the neurotoxin ODAP, intensive feeding is risky. Since ODAP is water-soluble and susceptible to heat, hydrothermal treatment (=toasting) greatly reduces toxicity. In the feeding trial, four isocaloric diets with a similar lysine content were compared: A control diet, one diet containing 20 % raw grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds,</b> and two diets with toasted grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> (20 and 30 %, respectively; as fed basis). Including grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> in the diet had no significant influence on feed intake of the piglets. The body weight development of the piglets did not differ between the control diet and the two diets containing toasted grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds,</b> whereas including raw grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> had a significantly negative effect: Two weeks after weaning, piglets weighed significantly less than all other groups, and this difference became even more pronounced with time. As a consequence, the feed conversion ratio was significantly higher in the diet with raw grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> as well. Therefore, toasting of grass <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> is recommended prior to feeding to piglets...|$|R

40|$|Sorption isotherms of <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> {{with three}} {{different}} treatments were measured by equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) determination technique at five temperatures. Four ERH models with a temperature term and the GAB model were adopted to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of sorption isotherms. Sorption data from literature were also selected to compare the effect of varieties on the sorption isotherms of <b>pea</b> <b>seeds.</b> The result of this study indicated that <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> revealed a hysteresis and that treatment temperature affected the sorption isotherms. The Modified-Henderson equation was an adequate model for the sorption data of three treatments used in study. No universal or best sorption model was found for the isotherms of <b>pea</b> <b>seeds</b> from published data.
