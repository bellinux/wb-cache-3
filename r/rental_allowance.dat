40|$|This study {{examines}} benefits (and losses) from the rent control law in Metro Manila. The {{results show that}} net benefits from rent control are positive and targets mainly the poor families. However, benefits have negligible effects on income. They {{also tend to be}} eroded by the regressive effects of rent control on supply of rental housing, in particular, the strict eviction provisions of the law. Stiff competition for low-priced rental housing, low quality of housing for the poor, higher rents for the uncontrolled sector, and misallocation of resources are the possible effects of rent control on housing. It is recommended that government find other alternative schemes to the rent control law. Possible schemes include the provision of <b>rental</b> <b>allowances</b> to the poor; provision of low-cost financing to landlords, including those who are into self-help housing; and rent of government land on leasehold basis to developers interested to go into rental housing. rent control, rental housing market...|$|R

Given any set of production and consumption coefficients and any set of world factor endowments which, when suitably allocated among countries, result in positive production of all commodities in all countries, and given any mode of aggregating the n commodities into at most n- 1 industrial categories, it is shown that there exists an allocation of the world factor endowments among the K countries such that each country engages in trade and 100 % of each country's trade is intra-industry trade (i. e., the values of imports and exports balance each other in each aggregate category) ...|$|R
40|$|Privatization, {{creation}} of markets and economic regulation are terms that few would immediately {{associate with the}} housing sector. Mainstream housing markets {{in most of the}} free market economies of the developed world are regarded as competitive markets, with little need for economic regulation of the market. Regulations that attempt to control behavior directly are generally limited to policies relating to rent control, the provision of rental housing or <b>rental</b> <b>allowances</b> for lower income groups, as well as land use regulations and building controls. The housing sectors of Singapore and Korea are highly unusual in the extent of government involvement and intervention. A large segment of the housing market comprises housing built by the government and sold to households who do not have complete ownership rights, as these markets are heavily regulated to prevent speculation and profiteering. Section 2 of this paper describes the phases of housing policy in Singapore from the post war period of chronic housing shortage to the present period of excess housing stock. In Section 3, the numerous instruments used by the government to regulate supply, demand and prices in the various housing segments are described. Section 4 briefly describes the phases of Korea’s housing policies and Section 5 concludes by drawing relevant lessons from Singapore’s experience in creating and regulating housing markets for Korea...|$|R

Namibia is no exception. The study is aimed at figuring out whether government actions and interventions are meant to address homelessness challenges for low-income households. Furthermore, the research problem is broadened to gain insight on the effects from four countries’ housing policies as covered in the study; namely Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria and South Africa. The literature review undertaken proved that Botswana and South Africa have the best housing allowance schemes for public servants below management cadres, and have already successfully addressed public housing problems in their respective countries. Other findings of the study are; land shortage for housing development, housing affordability problems, escalating prices for building materials, lack of intergovernmental relations systems, unemployment and low incomes. Several recommendations include; to assist the Namibian government to emulate good examples of Botswana and South Africa, especially by providing land free of charge to its citizens (in the case of Botswana), solve financial institutions’ attitude of denying low-in-come earners loans, review housing allowances, rent allowances and subsidies every two years, increase government/member contribution ratios to either 50 percent or 100 percent due to high inflation rates.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} the use of in-cash housing subsidy, in the form of housing voucher, to deliver housing welfare in Hong Kong. This type of subsidy is currently the major type of housing assistance implemented in the United States since 1970 s for improving the deteriorating public housing stock as well as the concentrated poverty and racial segregated neighbourhoods developed in the public housing projects. As a foreign policy, the research has taken the academic approach of policy transfer to assess the possibility of importing this American programme for domestic use. Housing subsidies exist in two forms, namely supply side (producer-based, in-kind) subsidy or demand side (consumer-based, in-cash) subsidy. The former refers to the direct construction of social housing by the government or private sector project facilitated by the government via financial incentives, such as construction grants or tax concessions. Hong Kong public housing is using this kind of provision. As for demand side subsidy, the beneficiaries receive financial support from the government in order to enhance the recipients’ affordability in housing. As far as renting is concerned, such kind of consumer subsidy can be <b>rental</b> <b>allowance</b> payable in cash or housing voucher redeemable by the landlord. The American Housing Choice Voucher Program is a prominent example. In 2001, the Hong Kong Housing Authority has also implemented a trial policy on disseminating rental allowances to eligible elderly public housing tenants but was called off later. If the program worked satisfactorily, the government would consider extending this policy to ordinary applicants of public housing as well. In-kind housing welfare is provided through administrative assignment, the prospective tenants cannot choose which area to reside and their choices on housing units are very restrictive. Since housing location will influence a person’s access to job, education and other chances of life, consumer based housing subsidy allows beneficiary to exercise greater freedom of choice in housing. Policy transfer is about borrowing foreign policy tools or measures for domestic use to solve problems of similar nature. It is a process by which knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political system is used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political system. In evaluating the implementation of housing voucher in Hong Kong, this dissertation using policy transfer theorists’ multi-level approach in evaluating the macro and micro settings of the policy framework. The macro level will look upon the political, social and economic contexts between U. S. and Hong Kong that embed public housing policy, while the micro level is an examination of the responses of selected actors in policy transfer that facilitate or hinder the transfer. Upon the research findings, both the macro and micro level analyses lead {{to the conclusion that the}} transferability of housing voucher system in Hong Kong is relatively low. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
