5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E

25|$|Shaped reflectors– The {{parabolic}} reflector {{can be given}} a noncircular shape, and/or different curvatures in the horizontal and vertical directions, to alter {{the shape of the}} beam. This is often used in radar antennas. As a general principle, the wider the antenna is in a given transverse direction, the narrower the <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> will be in that direction.|$|E
25|$|Arrays of feeds– In {{order to}} produce an {{arbitrary}} shaped beam, instead of one feed horn, an array of feed horns clustered around the focal point can be used. Array-fed antennas are often used on communication satellites, particularly direct broadcast satellites, to create a downlink <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> to cover a particular continent or coverage area. They are often used with secondary reflector antennas such as the Cassegrain.|$|E
25|$|This method {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the {{radiation}} resistance for any antenna whose far field <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance. Unfortunately this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of feedpoint impedance, whose calculation is considered below.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this letter, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) com-puted <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> {{of mobile}} {{telephones}} are carefully {{compared with those}} measured in our laboratory. The question on the capability of the FDTD method to correctly predict the radiated electromagnetic fields of today’s structurally complex mobile telephones is addressed. Two commercially available cellular telephones equipped with two different antennas (one helix and one helix monopole) have been considered and the <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> have been measured and FDTD computed with and without the human head. The FDTD computed and measured <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> show good agreement. This verifies that numerical techniques are suitable for accurately modeling <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> of realistic cellular telephones and, more importantly, that the FDTD method is a valid alternative to measurements {{in the design of}} new cellular telephones.

Significant differences between the <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> for the Higgs signal and the background processes are observed and quantified.

40|$|Software radio {{applications}} demand extremely broadband antennas. An unequally spaced {{array antenna}} composed of log periodic dipole antennas (LPDAs) is proposed.

Finally, <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> of the LPDA array antenna are obtained. Constant beam widths and good sidelobe characteristics are achieved in 2 GHz to 10 GHz.

25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} feedpoint of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{radiating}} sound, {{including a}} loudspeaker system, {{can be thought}} of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.|$|E
25|$|A {{mid-range}} {{speaker is}} a loudspeaker driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added output level and control of <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E

Such approach is employed to obtain UWB antenna radiated fields and <b>radiation</b> <b>patterns</b> directly in time-domain, it being more convenient to perform an unified characterization in time and frequency domains...|$|R
25|$|When a dipole with an {{unbalanced}} feedline such as {{coaxial cable}} {{is used for}} transmitting, the shield side of the cable, {{in addition to the}} antenna, radiates. This can induce radio frequency (RF) currents into other electronic equipment near the radiating feedline, causing RF interference. Furthermore, the antenna is not as efficient as it could be because it is radiating closer to the ground and its <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> may be asymmetrically distorted. To prevent this, dipoles fed by coaxial cables have a balun between the cable and the antenna, to convert the unbalanced signal provided by the coax to a balanced symmetrical signal for the antenna.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ground}} is not {{available}} (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces {{can serve as a}} ground plane (typically the vehicle's roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed {{at the base of the}} antenna can form a ground plane. For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and ground plane elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. For a simple 1/4-wave whip, the radials are often sloped at a 45 degree angle to bring the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms. Since this will introduce RF energy on the shield of the unbalanced feed line which deforms the <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> of the antenna, a choke is often placed near the feed point.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponential}} horn has an acoustic loading property {{that allows the}} speaker driver to remain evenly balanced in output level over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the {{exponential horn}} allows for a narrowing of the <b>radiation</b> <b>pattern</b> as frequency increases, making for high frequency 'beaming' on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing {{the interior of a}} single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.|$|E
