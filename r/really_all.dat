25|$|The above {{example of}} a curve winding around a point has a simple topological interpretation. The {{complement}} of {{a point in the}} plane is homotopy equivalent to the circle, such that maps from the circle to itself are <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that need to be considered. It can be shown that each such map can be continuously deformed to (is homotopic to) one of the standard maps , where multiplication in the circle is defined by identifying it with the complex unit circle. The set of homotopy classes of maps from a circle to a topological space form a group, which is called the first homotopy group or fundamental group of that space. The fundamental group of the circle is the group of the integers, Z; and the winding number of a complex curve is just its homotopy class.|$|E

I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader feel at home in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about."

500|$|Doctor Who {{novelist and}} Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles posted a scathing review of [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] on the Internet {{within an hour}} of its broadcast, {{focusing}} on a perceived political subtext suggesting that asylum seekers (the Gelth) are <b>really</b> <b>all</b> evil and out to exploit liberal generosity (the Doctor). He criticised the script for promoting xenophobia and [...] "claiming that all foreigners were invaders", especially as the top stories in the news were about immigration into Britain. The review produced considerable backlash on the Internet, mainly over his comments about writer Mark Gatiss. Miles was personally contacted and ran into trouble with his publishers. Miles deleted the review and posted a revision, though the original is still available on another of his websites.|$|E

And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to.

Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about, they're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged.

500|$|However, not all reviews were as positive. Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics". Abele felt that the series was a superhero tale, rather than the dark comedy, police thriller and brooding drama that it was promoted to be. Brian Lowry of Variety {{did not think that}} Dexter would impress critics, and noted, [...] "antics of the deranged... aren't <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that pleasant to watch", but praised Hall's acting saying that he [...] "... quickly dispatches any thoughts of his [...] "Six Feet" [...] character, which, by itself, represents quite an accomplishment."

[...] Megan Vick of Billboard was positive on the video, saying that, [...] "We can't be entirely sure what Robyn {{was trying to}} say with this treatment, {{but we do know that}} this video is hot – and intriguing." [...] Robbie Daw of music website Idolator compared it to a scene from The X-Files. He concluded by saying that [...] "This is hardcore, indeed." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy said that Robyn looks [...] "cherubic and futuristic , as if she belongs on the set of “Caprica”." [...] Katz compared Robyn's outfit to Rebecca Horn's [...] "Overflowing Blood Machine".

500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Although his co-stars Attwater and Kenny were axed {{from the}} cast in May 2010, Norwood {{revealed}} his contract had {{been extended to}} December 2010, saying that the producers saw [...] "some future in Fatboy". In January 2011 {{it was reported that}} due to the character's popularity, producers were planning to expand Fatboy's family and {{were in the process of}} casting his father, Ashley Chubb. An EastEnders insider is reported to have said [...] "Fatboy has been a real hit with viewers and the bosses have decided that it's now time to bring in his dad so people can see what Fatboy is <b>really</b> <b>all</b> about." [...] Norwood's contract was once again renewed in late 2013 for another year, by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who promised [...] "juicy storylines" [...] for the character. One source from the programme said [...] "Fatboy is a popular character and appeals to all ages. He's not had a decent storyline for a while but always provides much-needed humour in Albert Square.

500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It <b>really</b> <b>all</b> comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's <b>really</b> <b>all</b> that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you know that this is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to just sit there and endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating: ...|$|E

[...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified.
