Via several bandpass filters the signal goes through RF amplifier and mixer unit before being delivered to the IF unit and AF amplifier. The <b>receiver</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> uses Schottky barrier diodes which results in good performance {{in the presence of}} strong signals. The lownoise premix local oscillator optimizes its receiving performance. A 5 pole IF filter allows a variable IF bandwidth and an optional filter may be put in place for demanding operators. Rx is single conversion superheterodyne functioning in AM/CW/SSB mode and in double conversion mode when the FM print is installed.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} Engineering set up, radiotelegraph {{stations}} may use either a single antenna for both transmit and receive or, separate transmit and receive antennas. In either case, when receivers are {{operating on the}} same or nearby radio frequencies as used by their associated transmitters, while using the same or nearby antennas, the typical radio receiver is thus exposed to extremely large signals from the nearby transmitter. This situation would generally result in the destruction or degradation of the <b>receiver</b> <b>front</b> <b>end</b> circuitry and would be problematic at best and destructive at worst. As of this writing there has yet apparently been no receiver technology developed that can operate with full sensitivity over such a huge range of received signal levels whilst also safely withstanding the high power levels presented by the associated nearby transmitter. And so receiver inputs cannot simply be bridged across transmitting antenna terminals! Receivers must be isolated from the powerful transmitter signals by some means. These means are provided by the so-called T/R switches.|$|E

These inherent mechanisms produces spectrally overlapping acoustic waves that radiate into the depths {{of the ocean}}, and the superposition of these signals from across large area of the sea surface cumulatively constitutes a spatially homogeneous uniform ambient noise field. It is often difficult to utilize such a cluttered and exacerbated acoustic channel for communication or other observational purposes. In this paper a method based on spectral subtraction, for alleviating the uniform acoustic ambient noise is presented. Spectral subtraction is a technique used to retrieve the power spectrum of a non-stationary signal of interest in a uniform noise field by subtracting an estimated average of noise spectrum from the originally observed signal spectrum. The noise spectrum is estimated while the signal of interest is absent or silent and will cyclically updated in a periodic manner at intentionally put blanking periods in communication signals.
