5000|$|The <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> {{allows users}} to view, edit and delete data, along with running queries, forms, reports, macros and VBA module code. The <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> does not allow users to change the design of Microsoft Access tables, queries, forms, reports, macros or module code. The runtime {{versions}} are similar to their corresponding full version of Access and usually compatible with earlier versions; for example Access Runtime 2010 allows a user to run an Access application made with the 2010 version as well as 2007 through 2000. Due to deprecated features in Access 2013, its <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> is also unable to support those older features. During development one can simulate the runtime environment from the fully functional version by using the [...] command line option.|$|E

50|$|Video for Windows {{was first}} {{introduced}} in November 1992. It was developed {{as a reaction to}} Apple Computer's QuickTime technology, which added digital video to the Macintosh platform. Costing around $200, the product included editing and encoding programs for use with video input boards. A <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> for viewing videos only was also made available as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11; it then became an integral component of Windows 95 and later.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1986, Odesta {{released}} Double Helix for $495. The main {{new feature}} set {{allowed for the}} construction of custom menus and menu bars, resulting in [...] "stand-alone" [...] applications. In comparison, the original Helix produced applications that were clearly running within Helix, much as a Microsoft Word document is clearly running [...] "inside Word". Released {{as a part of a}} larger suite of software, the Helix suite also included a stand-alone <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> known as RunTime Helix which would allow users to run Double Helix applications without the full version installed, as well as MultiUser Helix which operated in a client-server fashion.|$|E
5000|$|By {{purchasing}} license packs, {{the database}} gained a multi-user capability in five-user increments. This included a sophisticated (for a DOS application in the day) record-level locking scheme. To work properly, the multi-user database {{had to be}} on a file server with all users accessing the database through a network. It was not true client-server because processing occurred in the clients. The configuration file expanded to allow language support and user-defined re-mapping of characters. For example, German characters such as the letter [...] "ö" [...] (o with an umlaut) could be remapped to the string oe. There were character fold tables and sort orders could be adjusted by the user. An [...] "unlimited number of licenses" [...] <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> was offered, allowing developers to sell applications and include the run-time R:Base engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Identicon source package 0.1 was server-side Java. Version 0.2 was cleaned up, {{added some}} documentation, fixed a color bug, added a cache, and a <b>runtime</b> jar. <b>Version</b> 0.3 included client-side Canvas tags. The current version is 0.5.|$|R

Costing around $200, the software included editing and encoding programs for use with video input boards. A <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> for viewing videos only was also made available. Originally released as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11, it then became an integral component of Windows 95 and later. Like QuickTime there were three components in Video for Windows. The technology introduced a file format designed to store digital video, Audio Video Interleave (AVI). The technology provided an application programming interface that allowed Windows software developers to add the ability to play or manipulate digital video to their own applications. Lastly, it included a suite of software for playing and manipulating digital video.|$|E
5000|$|Microsoft Access {{applications}} can adopt a split-database architecture. The single database can {{be divided}} into a separate [...] "back-end" [...] file that contains the data tables (shared on a file server) and a [...] "front-end" [...] (containing the application's objects such as queries, forms, reports, macros, and modules). The [...] "front-end" [...] Access application is distributed to each user's desktop and linked to the shared database. Using this approach, each user has a copy of Microsoft Access (or the <b>runtime</b> <b>version)</b> installed on their machine along with their application database. This reduces network traffic since the application is not retrieved for each use. The [...] "front-end" [...] database can still contain local tables for storing a user's settings or temporary data. This split-database design also allows development of the application independent of the data. One disadvantage is that users may make various changes to their own local copy of the application and this makes it hard to manage version control. When a new version is ready, the front-end database is replaced without impacting the data database. Microsoft Access has two built-in utilities, Database Splitter and Linked Table Manager, to facilitate this architecture.|$|E

More precisely, we have included a <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> management mechanism into DLLs to support runtime software evolution. In this paper, I will first show the outline of our <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> management mechanism of DLLs.

40|$|This {{paper will}} give a brief {{overview}} of my approach for <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> management of objects for software evolution. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I will briefly describe the notion of versions of objects. Three types of versions: variations, revisions, and mirrors will be introduced. In the third section, I will describe the mechanism for the runtime evolution of these three types of versions. I implemented my version management mechanism for Java objects. Final section will conclude this paper with some discussions to be considered in the future...|$|E
40|$|Software {{systems have}} become playing {{more and more}} {{important}} roles in human daily life. Even a temporary stop of such software systems gives inconvenience and/or damage to human activities. The primary goal of my research {{is to develop a}} mechanism that allows software engineers to fix, enhance, and maintain such software systems without stopping the execution. My approach towards the goal is based on the version management of objects. DVMS is a <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> management system that allows objects in a running program to be replaced with new versions that include bug fixes and enhancements. Using DVMS, new versions of an object can be created without loosing the state of older versions, and versions of an object can be switched in a consistent manner with versions of other related objects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Design-by-contract is a {{software}} engineering technology from the object-oriented world that exploits runtime assertions to define precise verifiable interface specifications with so-called invariants and pre- and post-conditions. This paper describes our idea of extending design-by-contract to support assertions dealing with platform and environment features essential in embedded systems like battery power, localization, or memory and CPU consumption to support variation of these on different deployment targets. While others {{have focused on}} contracts {{as a means for}} component-based design, i. e. for design time issues or dynamic service discovery, we suggest a <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> to enhance system reliability and aim at an actual implementation. This paper motivates the approach, compares it to related work and sketches a possible implementation as well as an example application for mobile phones. F...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} CRITTER, {{a computer}} database program for managing research animals. We designed it especially for institutions which operate health surveillance plans, such as specific pathogen-free schemes. Because CRITTER {{can be used}} to record any type of test result in any species of animal, it can be customized to suit each institution and its management protocol. In addition to maintaining a current inventory of each individual animal and its location, the program retains historical information on those that have been removed from the colony. Output summaries are generated by selecting from a menu of standard reports or by designing a custom query. Although CRITTER has been designed for individual research establishments, it could be modified for use in area health surveillance programs. CRITTER operates on IBM compatible computers using a menu-driven, <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> of Paradox...|$|E
40|$|CO and NO 2 {{measurements}} are {{of importance for}} the ventilation control of automobiles and other applications. For this purpose often semiconducting SnO 2 sensors were used. A well known disadvantage of SnO 2 sensors is the concurrent reaction of the oxidizing NO 2 and the reducing CO on the sensor surface, which causes a near zero sensor signal in presence of both gases in a certain range of mixtures. A second disadvantage of SnO 2 sensors are the long rise and decay times of the sensor signal. The combination of different SnO 2 sensors, operated at different temperatures and combined with a signal evaluation system based on a specially trained neural forward network (Artificial Neural Net - ANN) solves this problem. The <b>runtime</b> <b>version</b> of the neural net is a small program, compatible to micro controllers...|$|E

40|$|With {{multicore}} processors as {{the standard}} building block for high performance systems, parallel runtime systems need to provide excellent performance on shared memory, distributed memory, and hybrids. Conventional wisdom suggests that threads should {{be used as the}} runtime mechanism within shared memory, and two <b>runtime</b> <b>versions</b> for shared and distributed memory are often designed and implemented separately, retrofitting after the fact for hybrid systems. In this paper we consider the problem of implementing a runtime layer for Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages, which offer a uniform programming abstraction for hybrid machines. We present a new process-based shared memory runtime and compare it to our previous pthreads implementation. Both are integrated with the GASNet communication layer, and they can co-exist with one another. We evaluate the shared memory runtime approaches, showing that they interact in important and sometimes surprising ways with the communication layer. Using a set of microbenchmarks and application level benchmarks on an IBM BG/P, Cray XT, and InfiniBand cluster, we show that threads, processes and combinations of both are needed for maximum performance. Our new runtime shows speedups of over 60 % for application benchmarks and 100 % for collective communication benchmarks, when compared to the previous implementation. Our work primarily targets PGAS languages, but some of the lessons are relevant to other parallel runtime systems and libraries. 1...|$|R
