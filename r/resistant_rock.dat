5|$|The Table Rocks {{offer an}} example of {{inverted}} relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> and become new topographic highs after {{the erosion of the}} surrounding region. Each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more <b>resistant</b> <b>rock,</b> resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
25|$|A Makhtesh is a {{geological}} landform considered {{unique to}} the Negev desert of Israel. A makhtesh has steep walls of <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> surrounding a deep closed valley which is usually drained by a single wadi. The valleys have limited vegetation and soil, containing {{a variety of different}} colored rocks and diverse fauna and flora. The best known and largest makhtesh is Makhtesh Ramon.|$|E
50|$|According to {{a second}} {{principle}} of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of varying resistance, so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are eroded by ocean waves. The less <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> erode faster, creating inlets or bay; the more <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> erode more slowly, remaining as headlands or outcroppings.|$|R
30|$|Stream {{frequency}} (SF)—Number of streams {{per unit}} area (SF = TSS/A) (Horton 1945). Higher SF values are indicative of less <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks,</b> which may aid greater erosion in the basin.|$|R
50|$|Headlands and bays {{are often}} {{found on the}} same coastline. A bay is flanked by land on three sides, whereas a {{headland}} is flanked by water on three sides. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where bands of rock of alternating resistance run perpendicular to the coast. Bays form where weak (less <b>resistant)</b> <b>rocks</b> (such as sands and clays) are eroded, leaving bands of stronger (more <b>resistant)</b> <b>rocks</b> (such as chalk, limestone, granite) forming a headland, or peninsula. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and {{the erosion of the}} headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out then start the same process all over again.|$|R
500|$|At about 2.5 and 1.8 {{billion years}} ago in Precambrian time, sand, mud, silt, and ash were laid down in a marine basin {{adjacent}} to an orogenic belt. From 1.8 to 1.6{{billion years ago}} at least two island arcs collided with the proto-North American continent. This process of plate tectonics compressed and grafted the marine sediments in the basin onto the mainland and uplifted {{them out of the}} sea. Later, these rocks were buried [...] under the surface and pressure-cooked into metamorphic rock. The resulting Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite, {{which is part of the}} Vishnu Basement Rocks, consists of the metasedimentary Vishnu Schist and the metavolcanic Brahma and Rama Schists that were formed 1.75billion to 1.73billion years ago. This is the <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> now exposed at the bottom of the canyon in the Inner Gorge.|$|E
500|$|The rocks {{containing}} the fossils {{are on the}} border between two partially overlapping bands of rock that run along the western face of the Canadian Rockies. On the eastern side of this border is the Cathedral Formation, a platform of limestone formed by algae. The western surface of the Cathedral Formation is steep and consists of the <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> dolomite, which was originally part of the limestone platform, but between the Mid Silurian and Late Devonian was transformed by hydrothermal flows of brine at up to , which replaced much of the limestone's calcium with magnesium. A layer of shale lies partly on top of and partly {{to the west of the}} Cathedral Formation. This shale layer used to be called the [...] "thin" [...] Stephen Formation where it lies above the Cathedral Formation and the [...] "thick" [...] Stephen Formation where it lies to the west; but the [...] "thick" [...] Stephen Formation is now generally known as the Burgess Formation.|$|E
2500|$|The cliffs {{along the}} Delaware River, known as Nockamixon Cliffs, appear {{to rise from}} the land, but are in fact {{formations}} of very hard stone that have eroded at a much slower pace than the surrounding land. These cliffs are made of weather <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> called hornfel, formed {{at the end of the}} Triassic Period when magma rose up from deep within the Earth's crust and flowed into beds of sedimentary rock. The cliffs [...] "rose" [...] during the Jurassic Period when the surrounding sandstone and shale was eroded by wind and water.|$|E
5000|$|Bays form where weak, or less <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving {{bands of}} stronger, or more <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks,</b> such as chalk, limestone, and granite), which form a {{headland}} or peninsula. Refraction of waves occurs on headlands concentrating wave energy on them, {{so many other}} landforms, such as caves, natural arches, and stacks, form on headlands. Wave energy is directed {{at right angles to}} the wave crest, and lines drawn at right angles to the wave crest (orthogonals) represent the direction of energy expenditure. Orthogonals converge on headlands and diverge in bays, which concentrates wave energy on the headlands and dissipates wave energy in the bays.|$|R
50|$|Cornwall {{forms the}} tip of the {{south-west}} peninsula of the island Great Britain, and is therefore exposed to the full force of the prevailing winds that blow in from the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline is composed mainly of <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> that give rise in many places to impressive cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Raven Rock State Park sits {{along the}} fall zone, {{an area where}} the hard, <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> of the foothills give way to the softer rocks and sediments of the coastal plain. The {{underlying}} rocks of the area were formed more than 400 million years ago by intense heat and pressure.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning 2 {{million years}} ago a series of glacial periods {{repeatedly}} covered the region with ice, scouring the bedrock and scooping out a great basin. [...] The glaciers, and later meltwater, wore away less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock,</b> leaving behind hills and ridges of the harder diabase and anorthosite. [...] At {{the end of the}} last glacial period the basin filled with meltwater. [...] The water level fluctuated significantly over time due to blockages of the outlet and post-glacial rebound. [...] The high-water Glacial Lake Duluth deposited clay sediments inland, while later, lower precursors of Lake Superior eroded bluffs and beach terraces.|$|E

50|$|Volcanic {{or other}} {{processes}} may {{give rise to}} a body of rock resistant to erosion, inside a body of softer rock such as limestone, which is more susceptible to erosion. When the less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> is eroded away to form a plain, the more <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> is left behind as an isolated mountain. The strength of the uneroded rock is often attributed to the tightness of its jointing.|$|E
50|$|Rock veneers {{commonly}} {{arise from}} the weathering of <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> of quartzite, felsic granites, coarse granites, and dense basalts. As these larger rocks are deposited on a surface, smaller sands either are removed by wind or water erosion, or settle and form a fine-grained layer beneath the larger veneer rocks. The larger clasts then rearrange and settle to form the rock veneer.|$|R
50|$|The gorge that Salem Creek {{flows through}} {{is lined with}} <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Catskill Formation and the Trimmers Rock Formation. A boulder-rich glacial till occurs {{to the east of}} the creek. Additionally, there is a large and pitted field of kame in the {{vicinity}} of the its headwaters. Illinoian till occurs at elevations lower than 700 ft above sea level in the creek's valley.|$|R
5000|$|Differential erosion- Erosion {{that occurs}} at {{irregular}} or varying rates, {{caused by the}} differences in the resistance and hardness of surface materials; softer and weaker rocks are rapidly worn away, whereas harder and more <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> remain to form ridges, hills, or mountains. Differential erosion, along with the tectonic setting, are two of the most important controls on the evolution of continental landscapes on Earth.|$|R
50|$|The {{term has}} an origin in Appalachia, {{where it was}} used to refer to a narrow river gorge {{confined}} by <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> layers.|$|E
50|$|Tuscarora Formation {{quartzite}} of the Silurian Age {{underlies the}} summit; {{it is this}} weather <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> which gives Big Mountain its high prominence.|$|E
50|$|Buttes form by {{weathering}} {{and erosion}} when hard caprock overlies {{a layer of}} less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> that is eventually worn away. The harder rock {{on top of the}} butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the scree or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms hoodoos.|$|E
25|$|The South Atlantic margin {{developed}} on Archean stable cratons consisting of hard and <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> and {{partly on the}} Neoproterozoic mobile belts composed of less <b>resistant</b> metamorphic <b>rocks.</b> The Precambrian basement of the Santos Basin is exposed as the Araçuaí Belt along the Brazilian coast, most notably in the inselbergs of Rio de Janeiro, of which Sugarloaf Mountain is the most iconic. The ancient rocks consist of a Neoproterozoic to Cambrian high-grade metamorphic core of granites and gneisses, formed during the collision of Gondwana in the Pan-African-Brasiliano orogeny. Basalts similar to the Paraná and Etendeka traps, exposed to {{the west in the}} Paraná Basin, have been found underlying the Santos Basin. The Tristan da Cunha hotspot, known as the Tristan hotspot, is considered the driver behind the formation of these flood basalts.|$|R
25|$|Cornwall {{forms the}} tip of the {{south-west}} peninsula of the island of Great Britain, and is therefore exposed to the full force of the prevailing winds that blow in from the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline is composed mainly of <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> that give rise in many places to tall cliffs. Cornwall has a border with only one other county, Devon, which is formed almost entirely by the River Tamar, and the remainder (to the north) by the Marsland Valley.|$|R
50|$|Weathering {{and erosion}} of the {{different}} rock strata of the Palatine Forest with their variable hardness {{have resulted in a}} low mountain landscape with a dense, deeply incised system of valleys and wide variety of hill shapes. The hard and <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Lower and Middle Bunter have produced a scarpland relief, whose cuestas characterize the landscape, especially in the north and east, whilst the southeastern part of the Palatinate Forest is dominated by rather isolated types of hill separated by erosion surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Caprock is {{a harder}} or more <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> type {{overlying}} a weaker or less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> type. [...] Common types of caprock are sandstone and mafic rock types. An analogy of caprock {{could be the}} outer crust on a cake that is a bit harder than the underlying layer. In processes such as scarp retreat, the caprock controls the rate of erosion of the scarp. As the softer rock is cut away, periodically the caprock shears off. Caprock is also found {{on the top of}} mesa formations.|$|E

[...] Common types of caprock are sandstone and mafic rock types. An analogy of caprock {{could be the}} outer crust on a cake that is a bit harder than the underlying layer. Common caprock locations are escarpments, mesa formations, and salt domes. In the petroleum industry, caprock is generalized to any nonpermeable formation that may prevent oil, gas, or water from migrating to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|The Caprock Chief or Caprock Xpress was a {{proposed}} Amtrak inter-city rail service which would run from Fort Worth, Texas to Denver, Colorado, {{passing through the}} Texas Panhandle, which currently does not have passenger rail service of any kind. Initially proposed 2000-2001, the project has not yet seen significant progress and {{is unlikely to be}} implemented. [...] "Caprock" [...] is a geological term for a harder or more <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> type overlying a weaker or less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> type, and lends its name to the Caprock Escarpment that defines the edge of the high plains of the Llano Estacado.|$|E
50|$|Since that time, the {{relentless}} force of running water has eroded the geologic layers, resulting in older rocks becoming exposed {{in the middle}} of the Swell, and younger rocks exposed around the edges. Many of the most impressive landforms are composed of more <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks,</b> including the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, Jurassic Wingate Sandstone, and Permian Coconino Sandstone. The folding is much steeper on the eastern edge of the Swell than in the west, and this eastern edge is referred to as the San Rafael Reef.|$|R
25|$|Mont Saint-Hilaire {{is one of}} the Monteregian Hills, a {{group of}} erosional {{remnants}} of intrusive mountains spreading across southern Quebec. It is composed of three distinct plutonic intrusions that formed during the Cretaceous Period between 133 and 120million years ago. Like the other Monteregian Hills, Mont Saint-Hilaire forms part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, which was created when the North American Plate slid over the New England hotspot. During this time, melting occurred, creating subsurface magma intrusions. Erosion of the surrounding softer sedimentary rocks revealed the more <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> of Mont Saint-Hilaire.|$|R
500|$|Natural {{features}} seen on {{this stretch}} of coast include arches, pinnacles and stack rocks. In some places the sea has broken through <b>resistant</b> <b>rocks</b> to produce coves with restricted entrances, and in one place, the Isle of Portland {{is connected to the}} land by a narrow spit. In some parts of the coast, landslides are common. These have exposed a wide range of fossils, the different rock types each having its own typical fauna and flora, thus providing evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region.|$|R
50|$|Mesas form by {{weathering}} {{and erosion}} of horizontally layered rocks {{that have been}} uplifted by tectonic activity. Variations {{in the ability of}} different types of rock to resist weathering and erosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings. This process is called differential erosion. The most <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert, limestone, lava flows and sills. Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to weathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or caprock, of a mesa. The less <b>resistant</b> <b>rock</b> layers are mainly made up of shale, a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Resistant</b> <b>rock</b> strata {{interrupt}} the flow in places, including at Pashupatinath Temple. Beyond the temple, the river flows south until {{joined by the}} larger west-flowing Monahara River, then turns west itself. After entering Kathmandu's urban area more tributaries enter: relatively unpolluted Dhobī Kholā and sewage-laden Tukucha Khola.|$|E
