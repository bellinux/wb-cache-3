40|$|A {{population}} replacement experiment {{has been}} devised {{to test the}} ability of a challenge virus to replace the <b>resident</b> <b>virus</b> in a persistently infected cell culture. BHK- 21 cells persistently infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus of serotype C (clone C-S 8 c 1) were challenged with a large excess of either the parental foot-and-mouth disease virus C-S 8 c 1, genetically marked variants differing in their degree of virulence, or a mutant rescued after prolonged persistence in BHK- 21 cells. After challenge, the composition of the <b>resident</b> <b>virus</b> population in the carrier culture was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. The dominance of the initial persisting virus was seen in all cases, except when virulent viruses were used in the challenge. The experiments document that, paradoxically, virulence can be a positive factor in the reestablishment of a virus population in a persistently infected cell culture. A model based on the selection of virus-resistant cell variants during persistence is proposed to interpret these observations.

Mutant cells were selected which were increasingly restrictive to the replication of the <b>resident</b> <b>virus,</b> but concomitant changes in the virus enabled it to replicate in a subpopulation of the restrictive cells. The persistent infection could be reconstructed by infection of mutant cells with mutant virus; in contrast, neither infection of parental cells with mutant virus nor infection of mutant cells with parental virus led to persistence.

40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is able {{to cause}} {{persistent}} infection in ruminants besides acute infection and disease. Since the mechanisms of viral persistence and the determining factors are still unknown, in vitro systems help explore and reveal mechanisms of persistence in vivo by providing useful models {{for the study of}} RNA genome mutations and evolution. Ammonium chloride, a lysosomotropic agent that raises intralysosomal pH, reduces the yield of FMDV during infection of BHK- 21 cells. Results The persistent infection with FMDV serotype O in BHK- 21 cells was selected and established readily after treatment of ammonium chloride that acts primarily on the cells. Intact virions were observed located inside the endosomes. Viral genome RNAs and specific proteins were detected in the persistent cells to validate the establishment of viral persistence. Infection of the persistent viruses could not form plaques in host cells but virulence was enhanced. Basing on analysis and comparison of cDNA sequences of <b>resident</b> <b>viruses</b> and wild type viruses, 15 amine acid mutations were found, all of which were located in nonstructural proteins rather than in structural proteins. Conclusions Therefore, persistent infection of cell cultures with FMDV is successfully established with some distinctive features.

It is the first report of a reassortment of the pandemic virus, which in humans {{has been slow to}} evolve. Nancy Cox, head of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said, [...] "This particular paper is extremely interesting because it demonstrates for the first time what we had worried about at the very onset of the pandemic, and that is that this particular virus, when introduced into pigs, could reassort with the <b>resident</b> <b>viruses</b> in pigs and we would have new gene constellations. And bingo, here we are." [...] Pigs have been termed the mixing vessel of flu because they can be infected both by avian flu viruses, which rarely directly infect people, and by human viruses. When pigs become simultaneously infected with more than one virus, the viruses can swap genes, producing new variants which can pass to humans and sometimes spread amongst them. [...] "Unlike the situation with birds and humans, we have a situation with pigs and humans where there's a two-way street of exchange of viruses. With pigs it's very much a two-way street".|$|R

Here we ask to what extent these findings might hold true in another T-cell-immunocompromised cohort, HIV-positive hemophilic patients. Resident EBV strains were rescued within lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the blood and throat washings of 39 such individuals, using the same in vitro protocols of virus isolation as for the homosexual cohort. A mean of 19 independent cell lines was made per patient, and in each case the <b>resident</b> <b>virus</b> was characterized by PCR-based viral genomic analysis and by immunoblotting to reveal the viral “EBNAprint. ” By these criteria a significant proportion (14 of 39) of the hemophilic cohort carried more than one EBV strain, suggesting that T-cell impairment does indeed sensitize virus carriers to reinfection with new strains of exogenously transmitted virus. However, the overall incidence of type 2 EBV infection was 10 %, which is close to that observed in the earlier work with healthy carriers and substantially lower than that seen in HIV-positive homosexuals. We infer that type 2 EBV is relatively rare in the general Caucasian population but has become endemic in the homosexual community...|$|E
40|$|Poxvirus DNA is not {{infectious}} because {{establishing an}} infection requires {{the activities of}} enzymes packaged in the virion. This barrier can be overcome by transfecting virus DNA into cells previously infected with another poxvirus, since the <b>resident</b> <b>virus</b> can provide the trans-acting systems needed to reactivate transfected DNA. In this study we show that cells infected with a leporipoxvirus, Shope fibroma virus (SFV), can reactivate vaccinia virus DNA. Similar heterologous packaging systems which used fowlpox-infected cells to reactivate vaccinia virus have been described, but SFV-infected cells promoted a far more efficient reaction that can produce virus titers exceeding 106 PFU/μg of transfected DNA. SFV-promoted reactions also exploit the hyperrecombinogenic systems previously characterized in SFV-infected cells, and these coupled recombination and reactivation reactions {{could be used to}} delete nonessential regions of the vaccinia virus genome and to reconstruct vaccinia virus from overlapping DNA fragments. SFV-catalyzed recombination reactions need only two 18 - to 20 -bp homologies to target PCR amplicons to restriction enzyme-cut vaccinia virus vectors, and this reaction feature was used to rapidly clone and express a gene encoding fluorescent green protein without the need for plaque purification or selectable markers. The ability of SFV-infected cells to reactivate fragments of vaccinia virus was ultimately limited by the number of recombinational exchanges required and one cannot reconstruct vaccinia virus from multiple PCR fragments spanning essential portions of the genome. These observations suggest that recombination {{is an integral part of}} poxvirus reactivation reactions and provide a useful new technique for altering the structure of poxvirus genomes...|$|E
40|$|Liver {{cirrhosis}} is {{a potentially}} life-threatening disease caused by progressive displacement of functional hepatocytes by fibrous tissue. The underlying fibrosis is often driven by chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Matrix metalloproteinases including MMP- 8 are crucial for excess collagen degradation. In a rat model of liver cirrhosis, MMP- 8 delivery by an adenovirus (Ad) vector achieved significant amelioration of fibrosis but application of Ad vectors in humans {{is subject to}} various issues, including a lack of intrinsic liver specificity. HBV is highly liver-specific and its principal suitability as liver-specific gene transfer vector is established. HBV vectors have a limited insertion capacity and are replication-defective. Conversely, in an HBV infected cell vector replication may be rescued in trans by the <b>resident</b> <b>virus,</b> allowing conditional vector amplification and spreading. Capitalizing on a resident pathogen to help in its elimination and/or in treating its pathogenic consequences would provide a novel strategy. However, resident HBV may also reduce susceptibility to HBV vector superinfection. Thus a size-compatible truncated MMP- 8 (tMMP 8) gene was cloned into an HBV vector which was then used to generate a chimeric Ad-HBV shuttle vector that {{is not subject to}} superinfection exclusion. Rats with thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis were injected with the chimera to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Our data demonstrate that infectious HBV vector particles can be obtained via trans-complementation by wild-type virus, and that the tMMP 8 HBV vector can efficiently be shuttled by an Ad vector into cirrhotic rat livers. There it exerted a comparable beneficial effect on fibrosis and hepatocyte proliferation markers as a conventional full-length MMP- 8 Ad vector. Though the rat cirrhosis model does not allow assessing in vivo HBV vector amplification these results advocate the further development of Ad-HBV vectors for liver-specific gene therapy, including and perhaps particularly for HBV-related disease...|$|E

A representative sample was drawn from 574 GGII. 4 outbreak strains collected over 15 years of systematic surveillance in The Netherlands, and capsid genes were sequenced for a total of 26 strains. The three-dimensional structure was predicted by homology modeling, using the Norwalk virus (Hu/NoV/GGI. 1 /Norwalk/ 1968 /US) capsid as a reference. The highly significant preferential accumulation and fixation of mutations (nucleotide and amino acid) in the protruding part of the capsid protein provided strong evidence for the occurrence of genetic drift and selection. Although subsequent new epidemic variants differed by up to 25 amino acid mutations, consistent changes were observed in only five positions. Phylogenetic analyses showed that each variant descended from its chronologic predecessor, {{with the exception of the}} 2006 b variant, which is more closely related to the 2002 variant than to the 2004 variant.

A 3 -year repeated cross sectional {{study on the}} epidemiology of avian influenza in Australian nomadic wild aquatic birds was conducted in this potential biosecurity hotspot using molecular and serological techniques. Avian influenza virus subtypes H 6 and H 9 were commonly present in the studied population. It is likely {{that one of the}} H 6 viruses was newly introduced through migratory birds confirming the perceived biosecurity risk. The matrix gene of another H 6 virus was similar to the Australian H 7 subtypes, which suggests the reassortment of a previously introduced H 6 and local viruses. Similarly, a H 9 subtype had a matrix gene similar to that found in Asian H 9 viruses suggesting reassortment of viruses originated from Australia and Asia. Whilst H 5 N 1 was not found, the serological study demonstrated a constant circulation of the H 5 subtype in the sampled birds. The odds of being reactive for avian influenza viral antibodies were 13. 1 (95 % CI: 5. 9 – 28. 9) for Pacific Black Ducks over Plumed Whistling Ducks, highlighting that some species of waterfowl pose a greater biosecurity risk.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the induction of Fc receptor (FcR) in different types of lymphoid cell lines (LCL) infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV). Subpopulations of certain of these LCL normally express FcR unrelated to herpetic infection. Differentiation of virus-induced FcR from that related to normal cell function was therefore possible. FcR detection {{was carried out by}} means of a rosette assay using ox erythrocytes coated with 7 S immunoglobulin G (EA rosettes). Both HSV types 1 and 2 were found to induce FcR in B, T, and “null” (i. e., non-B, non-T) type LCL; however, in all the LCL tested, this HSV-induced FcR expression appeared to be more restricted in the responding T LCL than in responding B and null type LCL. In addition, kinetic experiments revealed that the time course of HSV-induced FcR expression differed among these LCL types tested. Interestingly, a number of LCL were resistant to HSV infection or restricted HSV gene expression, including expression of the viral products responsible for FcR induction. In all the responding HSV-infected LCL, induction of FcR always paralleled the expression of HSV antigens. Synthesis of HSV-induced FcR was shown to be inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid, an inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerase activity, whereas FcR of non-HSV origin was found to be resistant to inhibitor. This would infer that HSV codes for an FcR which can be differentiated from that of cellular origin by using phosphonoacetic acid. Therefore, two different mechanisms of FcR synthesis may be suggested, one virus mediated and the second probably under cellular control. In addition, the data obtained using Epstein-Barr virus producer as well as isogeneic monoclonal cell lines, with and without the Epstein-Barr virus genome, indicated that the <b>resident</b> Epstein-Barr <b>virus</b> genome in the target cell did not have a detectable effect in the induction of FcR by HSV...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the risk factors}} and source of infection leading to human infections with the Influenza A(H 7 N 9) virus in urban and rural areas. METHODS: We conducted a case-control investigation to identify potential exposures and risk factors. Controls {{were randomly selected from}} the same community as the cases using random digit dialing. We used exact conditional logistic regression to evaluate the exposures and risk factors, stratified by urban and rural residence. RESULTS: Buying live or freshly slaughtered poultry from a market was significantly associated with illness onset among both urban [48 % of 25 case-patients and 12 % of 125 control-persons, adjusted odds ratio (AOR)  = 19, 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 929] and rural (33 % of 18 case-patients and 8. 9 % of 90 control-persons, AOR = 13, 95 % CI: 1. 5 -∞) residents.

40|$|Type I interferons (IFN-I) are {{essential}} for organisms survival upon viral infection. During infection of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by neurotropic <b>viruses,</b> <b>resident</b> cells are mostly responsible for local IFN-I production. This IFN-I is crucial to restrict viral replication and spread awaiting the development of adaptive immunity that allows the clearance of the virus. Virtually all CNS cells can produce and respond to IFN-I. Firstly, we studied the specificity of neuronal response to IFN-I. In our laboratory, Sophie Paul had previously observed that mouse neurons treated with IFN-I remain susceptible to infection by two neurotropic viruses, Theiler's virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), unlike other cell types. We demonstrated that neurons readily respond to IFN-I treatment by expressing antiviral genes. However, they display a specific gene expression signature. We determined that 15 genes, induced by IN-I in fibroblasts, are weakly or not expressed in neurons in response to IFN-I. Among those genes, ApoL 9 b codes for an apolipoprotein L that exerts an antiviral activity against Theiler’s virus when ectopically expressed in neurons. The low expression of ApoL 9 in IFN-treated neurons likely contributes to the high susceptibility of these cells to viral infection.

The paramyxovirus family contains several zoonotic viruses, including highly pathogenic viruses such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus, and an increasing number of largely uncharacterized animal viruses. Here, we report the characterization of IFN antagonism by the rodent viruses J virus (JPV) and Beilong virus (BeiPV) of the proposed genus Jeilongvirus of the paramyxoviruses. Infection of cells by JPV and BeiPV was found to inhibit IFN-activated nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1). However, in contrast to most other paramyxoviruses, the JPV and BeiPV V proteins did not interact with or inhibit signalling by STAT 1 or STAT 2, suggesting that JPV/BeiPV use an atypical V protein-independent strategy to target STATs, consistent with their inclusion in a separate genus. Nevertheless, the V proteins of both viruses interacted with melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA 5) and robustly inhibited MDA 5 -dependent activation of the IFN-β promoter. This supports a growing body of evidence that MDA 5 is a universal target of paramyxovirus V proteins, such that the V-MDA 5 interaction represents a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral approaches.

We have readdressed the question of nonlymphoid persistence using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68). To dissect lymphoid from nonlymphoid persistence, we used �MT transgenic mice that are defective in B cells. MHV- 68 DNA persisted in the lungs of intact and B cell–deficient mice. Both episomal and linear forms of the virus genome were present in lungs, implying the presence of both latency and productive replication. In situ hybridization for virus tRNA transcripts revealed latent MHV- 68 in pulmonary epithelial cells.

We show that although cell morphology and expression levels of activation markers were markedly different, differentiation with either factor yielded microglia that phenotypically and functionally resemble macrophages. Both M-CSF and GM-CSF-differentiated microglia were responsive to TLR 1 / 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 / 2, and 8 -mediated activation, but not to TLR 7 or 9 -mediated activation. Intriguingly, M-CSF-differentiated microglia expressed higher levels of TLR 8 -encoding mRNA and protein, and produced larger amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in response to TLR 8 -mediated activation as compared to GM-CSF-differentiated microglia.

40|$|AbstractDefective {{provirus}} genomes {{of human}} T-cell leukemia virus type I are frequently detected in lymphocytes from infected individuals and in infected cell lines. One type of defective provirus contains internal deletions spanning gag, pol, and env genes but retains portions of open reading frames for trans-regulatory proteins. The deleted proviruses could potentially contribute to viral pathology by producing novel gene products that directly affect cell metabolism or that modulate expression of <b>resident,</b> wild-type proviruses. <b>Virus</b> gene products {{and the control}} of their expression were examined in cells transfected with defined molecular clones of wild-type and defective proviruses. Internally deleted provirus clones, which are unable to produce functional Tax and Rex proteins, were transcriptionally inactive in transfected cells. Ectopic expression of p 40 Tax activated transcription of the deleted provirus, resulting in the accumulation of a two-exon mRNA that yields a truncated form of Rex (p 21 Rex). Although this two-exon mRNA also has a potential initiation codon in the tax frame, a truncated form of Tax was not detected by immunoblotting or in transactivation assays. When complemented with p 40 Tax and p 27 Rex, cells transfected with deleted proviruses accumulated an unspliced mRNA that could potentially encode gag-pX fusion proteins. Although expression of deleted proviruses was dependent on trans-acting factors produced from intact proviruses, gene products from defective proviruses did not significantly affect expression of a cotransfected, full-length provirus...|$|R

Phylogenetic analyses of influenza viruses found in other animals revealed that all were directly or indirectly derived from <b>viruses</b> <b>resident</b> in aquatic birds. 1 However, the prevalence, movement, and evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses in these avian hosts have not been well defined. Southern China was hypothesized to be an ‘epicenter’ for the generation of human pandemic influenza viruses as all major influenza pandemic viruses in the 20 th century emerged from this region. 2 The ecological background that facilitates the occurrence of these pandemic influenza strains has not been fully explored. In the past two decades, four lineages, belonging to H 5 N 1, H 9 N 2, and H 6 N 1 viruses, have become established and long-term endemic in different types of poultry in this region. 3 – 5 Some of these viruses were disseminated to many countries in Eurasia and Africa and have continued to cause sporadic human infection, posing a persistent pandemic threat to the world. 6 In the mean time, the endemic influenza lineages have undergone extensive genetic reassortment events giving rise to many variants, dramatically increasing the genetic diversity of the influenza virus in this region …link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{knowledge}} on viral respiratory infections in nursing home (NH) residents and their caregivers is limited. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to assess and compare the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in nursing home (NH) residents and staff, to identify viruses involved in ARI and to correlate viral etiology with clinical manifestations of ARI. Methods The prospective surveillance study was accomplished in a medium-sized NH in Slovenia (central Europe). Ninety NH residents and 42 NH staff were included. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all participants at enrollment (December 5 th, 2011) and at the end of the study (May 31 st, 2012), and from each participant that developed ARI within this timeframe. Molecular detection of 15 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed. Results The weekly incidence rate of ARI in NH residents and NH staff correlated; however, it was higher in staff members than in residents (5. 9 versus 3. 8 / 1, 000 person-days, P[*]=[*] 0. 03), and was 2. 5 (95  % CI: 1. 36 – 4. 72) times greater in residents without dementia than in residents with dementia. Staff members typically presented with upper respiratory tract involvement, whereas in residents lower respiratory tract infections predominated. Respiratory viruses were detected in 55 / 100 ARI episodes. In <b>residents,</b> influenza A <b>virus,</b> respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were detected most commonly, whereas in NH staff rhinovirus and influenza A virus prevailed. 38 / 100 ARI episodes (30 / 56 in residents, 8 / 44 in staff) belonged to one of three outbreaks (caused by human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial <b>virus,</b> respectively). NH <b>residents</b> had higher chances for virus positivity within outbreak than HN staff (OR[*]=[*] 7. 4, 95  % CI: 1. 73 – 31. 48, P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions ARI are common among NH residents and staff, and viruses were detected in a majority of the episodes of ARI. Many ARI episodes among NH residents were outbreak cases and could be considered preventable. Trial registration The study was registered on the 1 th of December 2011 at ClinicalTrials (NCT 01486160) ...|$|R
