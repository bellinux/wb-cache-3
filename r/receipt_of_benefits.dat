25|$|The {{passage of}} the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, in 2000, allows the worker to earn {{unlimited}} outside income without offsets in the year after they reach full retirement. It also allows the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal full retirement age to receive benefits under some circumstances while he/she does not. The full retirement age worker must have begun the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspended their own benefits {{in order to continue}} the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount (5.5–8.0%/yr increase) up to the age of 70. Thus a worker can delay retirement up to age seventy without affecting spousal or children's benefits.|$|E
25|$|The Third Modification Law (1974) {{extended}} individual entitlements {{to social}} assistance {{by means of}} higher-income limits compatible with <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and lowered age limits for certain special benefits. Rehabilitation measures were also extended, child supplements were expressed as percentages of standard amounts and were thus indexed to their changes, and grandparents of recipients were exempted from potential liability to reimburse expenditure of social assistance carrier. The Third Social Welfare Amendment Act (1974) brought considerable improvements for the handicapped, those in need of care, and older persons, and a new fund of 100 million marks for disabled children was established. Allowances for retraining and advanced training and for refugees from East Germany were also increased, together with federal grants for sport. In addition, increases {{were made in the}} pensions of 2.5 million war victims. Following a sudden increase in the price of oil, a law was passed in December 1973 granting recipients of social assistance and housing allowances a single heating-oil allowance (a procedure repeated in the winter of 1979 during the Schmidt Administration). Improvements and automatic adjustments of maintenance allowances for participants in vocational training measures were also carried out, and increased allowances were provided for training and retraining, together with special allowances for refugees from East Germany.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} by the authors found evidence that up to 10 % of particular household categories may be exposed to elevated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations from poor quality gas appliance installations. The literature suggests certain neurological symptoms are linked to exposure to low levels of CO. This paper addresses the hypothesis that certain self-reported neurological symptoms experienced by a householder are linked to an estimate of their CO exposure. Methods Between 27 April and 27 June 2006, 597 homes with a mains supply of natural gas were surveyed, mainly in old, urban areas of London. Qualified gas engineers tested all gas appliances (cooker, boiler, gas fire, and water heater) and reported, according to the Gas Industry Unsafe Situations Procedure, appliances considered At Risk (AR), Immediately Dangerous (ID) or Not to Current Standards (NCS). Five exposure risk categories were defined based on measurement of CO emitted by the appliance, its features and its use, with "high or very high" exposure category where occupants were considered likely {{to be exposed to}} levels greater than 26 ppm for one hour. The prevalence of symptoms at each level of exposure was compared with that at lowest level of exposure. Results Of the households, 6 % were assessed as having a "high or very high" risk of exposure to CO. Of the individuals, 9 % reported at least one neurological symptom. There was a statistically significant association between "high or very high" exposure risk to CO and self-reported symptoms compared to "no exposure" likelihood, for households not in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit,</b> controlling for "number of residents" and presence of pensioners, OR = 3. 23 (95 %CI: 1. 28, 8. 15). Risk ratios across all categories of exposure likelihood indicate a dose-response pattern. Those households in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> showed no dose-response pattern. Conclusion This study found an association between risk of CO exposure at low concentration, and prevalence of self-reported neurological symptoms in the community for those households not in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b> As health status was self-reported, this association requires further investigation. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} issue in deciding how a QROPS is taxed internally on funds, and on payout, {{would be the}} double tax treaty between the country of residence of the beneficial owner (the pensioner or beneficiary) and the jurisdiction where the pension is based. Taxation can be affected by whether the country of residence of the beneficial owner recognises trusts or contract based pensions. For example, in France and Spain they apply tax on <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> such as the Pensions Commencement Lump Sum (commonly known as the tax free lump sum) which is no longer tax free.

Design Prospective population-based cohort survey linked to national registers. Participants In the ‘Youth studies’ from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, 15   966 10 th graders in 6 Norwegian counties answered a health behaviour and mental health questionnaire; 88 % were linked to National Insurance Administration Registers (FD-Trygd). Outcome measure Time to <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>benefits,</b> based on FD-Trygd. Follow-up was from age 18  years until participants were aged 22 – 26  years. Method We performed Cox regression analyses to examine {{the extent to}} which variations in health behaviour and mental health problems during 10 th grade were associated with <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>benefits</b> during follow-up. Results Daily smoking at age 15 – 16  years was associated with a significant increase in hazard <b>of</b> receiving health <b>benefits</b> at follow-up compared with not smoking for boys, HR (95 % CI) 1. 56 (1. 23 to 1. 98), and for girls 1. 47 (1. 12 to 1. 93). Physical activity was associated with a decrease in hazard compared with inactivity from 23 % to 53 % in boys and from 21 % to 59 % in girls, while use of alcohol showed a mixed pattern. The hazard for benefits use rose with increasing levels of emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity–inattention problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) at 15 – 16  years among both genders.
