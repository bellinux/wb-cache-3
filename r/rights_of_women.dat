5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave was legally required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|In rural areas, women {{traditionally}} work alongside {{their family}} to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory workers are young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in factories, {{labor unions and}} organizations were built. In their homes, women {{take care of their}} children and cook.|$|E
5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the Basque Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much more deeply into Basque society than other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the Basque language and adopted aspects of Basque culture such as increased <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national Basque ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and Basque facilitated the adoption of Basque grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E

5|$|The ILO {{successfully}} {{restricted the}} addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week.

5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century feminist critics {{embraced the}} work, {{integrating}} {{it into the}} history of the novel and feminist discourse.

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{dedicated}} the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> to Talleyrand: [...] "Having {{read with}} great pleasure a pamphlet {{which you have}} lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> and national education." [...] At the end of 1791, French feminist Olympe de Gouges had published her Declaration <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> and the Female Citizen, and the question <b>of</b> women's <b>rights</b> became central to political debates in both France and Britain.|$|R
500|$|The <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men. In the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> particular men (18th-century British men) while in the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> she is concerned with the rights afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> addresses the issue <b>of</b> natural <b>rights</b> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. The <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R
5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing its government responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{was very}} active in working with Latina feminists through the CIM. At the Seventh Pan-American Conference, held in 1933 in Montevideo, Uruguay, the women {{presented}} their analysis of {{the legal status of}} women in each of the 21 member countries. The first report ever to study in detail the civil and political <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> it had been prepared solely by women. They proposed a Treaty on the Equality of Rights for Women, and it was rejected by the conference, though it was signed by Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Three of those states had already granted suffrage to women, and none of the four ratified the Treaty after the conference. However, the women had presented the first international resolution to recommend suffrage for women. Next, Stevens presented their materials which showed the disparity between rights of men and women. For example, in 16 countries of the Americas women could not vote at all, in two countries they could vote with restrictions, and in three countries they had equal enfranchisement. In 19 of the American countries, women did not have equal custody over their children, including in seven US states, and only two countries allowed joint authority for women of their own children. None of the Latin American countries allowed women to serve on juries, and 27 US states prohibited women from participating in juries. Divorce grounds in 14 countries and 28 states were disparate for men and women, and a woman could not administer her own separate property in 13 countries and two US states.|$|E

5000|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. The <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote [...] "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".The suffragist (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to suffragette) Millicent Garrett Fawcett wrote the introduction to the centenary edition <b>of</b> the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. While the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new [...] "experiments in living", as Virginia Woolf termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft. However, {{there is some evidence that}} the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> may be influencing current feminists. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a feminist who is critical of Islam's dictates regarding <b>women,</b> cites the <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> in her autobiography Infidel, writing that she was [...] "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights".|$|R
