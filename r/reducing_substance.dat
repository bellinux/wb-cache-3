According to {{the modern}} {{technology}} of sugar production normative expansion <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> in the cleaning diffusion juice, should {{be held in the}} main liming controlled temperature with an excess of lime alkalinity, followed by removal of the decay products have appeared due to the adsorption of calcium carbonate in the processing of juice carbon dioxide. Test data show the growth rate of thermochemical quantities of sucrose decay with increasing temperature, with the greatest degree in the experiments with a small share of <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> in solutions. With increase in the proportion of <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> to 0, 3 %, the rate is reduced to about twice, with a 80 ° C and found to decrease its rate of growth. Main liming process preceded progressive preliming, not only where the epimerization faster but less stable, and the decomposition of fructose in the composition of the <b>reducing</b> <b>substances</b> to produce reactive products influencing the alkalinity of the solution and the surface state of microparticles of calcium hydroxide. The presence on the surface OH-groups and the appearance of tumors in the working environment, having in their structures group (= CO), (= O), (- СОН) contributes to the appearance of induced hydrogen bonds and partial reduction of the specific surface of the mass transfer between the solid particles and the components of the solution. Carboxyl group reduce the level of active alkalinity, which as a result of blocking is limited, which reduces the pH of the environment and the decay constant <b>reducing</b> <b>substances.</b> When heated to about 85 °C decomposed 20 % of the <b>reducing</b> <b>substances,</b> and chromaticity increased by 83, 1 %, taking into account the heating and hot main liming chromaticity increased by 116, 9 %.

5000|$|Pentosuria is a {{condition}} where the sugar xylitol, a pentose, presents in the urine in unusually high concentrations. It was characterized as an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism in 1908. It {{is associated with a}} deficiency of L-xylulose reductase, necessary for xylitol metabolism. [...] L-Xylulose is a reducing sugar, so it may give false diagnosis of diabetes, as it is found in high concentrations in urine.

40|$|PurposeFamilias Unidas is an efficacious and {{effective}} family-based intervention for preventing and <b>reducing</b> <b>substance</b> use and unsafe sexual behaviors among Latino youth. To facilitate its dissemination, Familias Unidas was shortened from a 12 -week intervention to a 6 -week intervention and evaluated. We hypothesized that brief Familias Unidas would be efficacious in <b>reducing</b> <b>substance</b> use and unsafe sexual behaviors {{relative to a}} comparison condition. MethodsWe randomized 160 ninth-grade Latino adolescents and their families to brief Familias Unidas or a community practice control condition. Adolescents were surveyed at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after baseline. ResultsAt 24 months, youth randomized to brief Familias Unidas had a significantly lower sexual initiation rate (34. 0 %) relative to control (55. 0 %), p =. 02. Brief Familias Unidas also increased positive parenting. Moderation analyses revealed that brief Familias Unidas {{was significantly associated with}} decreased substance use initiation among girls (30. 4 % vs. 64. 0 %, respectively; p =. 02), but not boys (28. 0 % vs. 26. 7 %, respectively; p =. 91). Brief Familias Unidas was also significantly associated with reduced unsafe sex among adolescents aged 15 years or less (p <. 001), but not among older adolescents (p =. 37). Moderating effects were also found for family-level variables. ConclusionsBrief Familias Unidas was efficacious in reducing sex initiation and improving positive parenting.
