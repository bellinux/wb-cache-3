The <b>relative</b> <b>response</b> factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an internal standard (or external standard) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} revised {{effective}} wavelength and photometric calibration for the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W 4 band, including tests of empirically motivated modifications to its pre-launch laboratory-measured <b>relative</b> system <b>response</b> curve. We derived these by comparing measured W 4 photometry with photometry synthesised from spectra of galaxies and planetary nebulae. The difference between measured and synthesised photometry using the pre-launch laboratory-measured W 4 <b>relative</b> system <b>response</b> {{can be as}} large as 0. 3 mag for galaxies and 1 mag for planetary nebulae. We find the W 4 effective wavelength should be revised upward by 3. 3 %, from 22. 1 micron to 22. 8 micron, and the W 4 AB magnitude of Vega should be revised from m = 6. 59 to m = 6. 66.

50|$|Gravity {{separation}} is also called relative gravity separation as it separates particles {{due to their}} <b>relative</b> <b>response</b> to a driving force. This is controlled by factors such as particle weight, size and shape. These processes can also be classified into multi-G and single G processes. The difference is {{the magnitude of the}} driving force for the separation. Multi-G processes allow the separation of very fine particles to occur (in the range of 5 to 50 micron) by increasing the driving force of separation in order to increase the rate at which particles separate. In general, single G process are only capable of processing particles that are greater than approximately 80 micron in diameter.|$|E
50|$|The {{photoreceptor}} {{proteins in}} {{the three types of}} cones differ in their sensitivity to photons of different wavelengths (see graph). Since cones respond to both the wavelength and intensity of light, the cone's sensitivity to wavelength is measured in terms of its relative rate of response if the intensity of a stimulus is held fixed, while the wavelength is varied. From this, in turn, is inferred the absorbance. The graph normalizes the degree of absorbance on a hundred-point scale. For example, the S cone's <b>relative</b> <b>response</b> peaks around 420 nm (nanometers, a measure of wavelength). This tells us that an S cone is more likely to absorb a photon at 420 nm than at any other wavelength. If light of a different wavelength to which it is less sensitive, say 480 nm, is increased in brightness appropriately, however, it will produce exactly the same response in the S cone. So, the colors of the curves are misleading. Cones cannot detect color by themselves; rather, color vision requires comparison of the signal across different cone types.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effectiveness}} of psoriasis therapies in real-world settings remains relatively unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought {{to compare the}} {{effectiveness of}} less commonly used systemic therapies and commonly used combination therapies for psoriasis. METHODS: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study of 203 patients with plaque psoriasis receiving less common systemic monotherapy (acitretin, cyclosporine, or infliximab) or common combination therapies (adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab and methotrexate) compared with 168 patients receiving methotrexate evaluated at 1 of 10 US outpatient dermatology sites participating in the Dermatology Clinical Effectiveness Research Network. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, patients on acitretin (<b>relative</b> <b>response</b> rate 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 18 - 3. 41), infliximab (<b>relative</b> <b>response</b> rate 1. 93; 95 % CI 1. 26 - 2. 98), adalimumab and methotrexate (<b>relative</b> <b>response</b> rate 3. 04; 95 % CI 2. 12 - 4. 36), etanercept and methotrexate (<b>relative</b> <b>response</b> rate 2. 22; 95 % CI 1. 25 - 3. 94), and infliximab and methotrexate (<b>relative</b> <b>response</b> rate 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 10 - 2. 70) {{were more likely to}} have clear or almost clear skin compared with patients on methotrexate. There were no differences among treatments when response rate was defined by health-related quality of life. LIMITATIONS: Single time point assessment may result in overestimation of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of therapies in clinical trials may overestimate their effectiveness as used in clinical practice.

Response to selection in environment 1 and correlated response in environment 2 depend on heritability and phenotypic variance in environment 1, genetic covariance between performance of identical genotypes in the two environments, and selection intensity.
