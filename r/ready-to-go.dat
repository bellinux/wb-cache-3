Kirshner quickly corralled songwriting talent from his Brill Building stable of writers and musicians to create catchy, engaging tracks which the band could pretend to perform on the show. This move was not because of any lack of the Monkees' talent but was required in order {{to keep up with the}} demanding schedule to churn out <b>ready-to-go</b> recordings to give each week's episode its own song. While Mike Nesmith and Peter Tork were already experienced musicians - and Davy Jones was an established musical performer - as a working band, they had little experience; and Micky Dolenz was completely new to drums.

50|$|As the {{popularity}} of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, {{it was a simple}} matter to type in the code from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from Creative Computing as BASIC Computer Games. This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of <b>ready-to-go</b> programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform. The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the home computer market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as Learn to Program BASIC would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused CP/M computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, Microsoft BASIC (MBASIC) was one of the leading applications.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo perform quality {{assessment}} of standardized random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis for epidemiologic typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MethodsThirty K. pneumoniae, 15 K. oxytoca, 30 S. marcescens and 33 P. aeruginosa epidemiologically unrelated isolates and four collections of clinically related isolates of each species {{were included in}} the study. RAPD analysis was performed using <b>Ready-To-Go</b> RAPD Analysis beads with primer ERIC- 1 R and <b>Ready-To-Go</b> primer 2 for K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, primer set ERIC- 2 / 1026 and <b>Ready-To-Go</b> primer 2 for S. marcescens, and primers D- 10514 and D- 14306 for P. aeruginosa. ResultsAll epidemiologically unrelated K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca isolates were distinguished. Twenty-nine types were distinguished among the 30 unrelated S. marcescens isolates and 32 types among the 33 unrelated P. aeruginosa isolates. Indistinguishable banding patterns were obtained in repeated analyses of two isolates and from 11 serial subcultures of three isolates of each species included in the study. The RAPD data from the clinically related isolates correlated with the epidemiologic origin of the isolates. ConclusionsThe use of <b>Ready-To-Go</b> RAPD Analysis beads resulted in reproducible and stable banding patterns with a high discriminatory capacity, and the RAPD typing results corresponded with the epidemiologic origin of the isolates...|$|E

MERGE, SQL joins, formats, SAS indexes- all serve the purpose of the table lookup. For do-it-yourselfers, SAS offers arrays directly addressable data structures suited for implementing just about any searching algorithm. An array-based lookup is not a <b>ready-to-go</b> food: It has to be cooked at home. However, it results in dishes digested by the computer more easily, programmatically more nutritious, and with less CPU time going into the wastebasket. In this paper, SAS arrays are used to organize the fastest class of in-memory data lookups- direct addressing. Three such techniques- key-indexing, bitmapping, and hashing- are considered in their logical sequence using a real-life example of matching data files by a common key. The results of benchmarking presented in the paper show that home-grown direct addressing methods beat even the quickest <b>ready-to-go</b> tools like "large formats " by a wide margin.

This corollary {{does not require}} the consideration of any coefficients of polynomials, only evaluations of polynomial functions. In certain situations, our corollary is more directly applicable and more <b>ready-to-go</b> than the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz itself. It is also of interest from a numerical point of view. We use it to explain a well-known connection between the sign of 1 -factorizations (edge colorings) and the List Edge Coloring Conjecture. For efficient calculations and {{a better understanding of the}} sign, we then introduce and characterize the sign of single 1 -factors. We show that the product over all signs of all the 1 -factors in a 1 -factorization is the sign of that 1 -factorization. Using this result in an algorithm, we attempt to prove the List Edge Coloring Conjecture for all graphs with up to 10 vertices. This leaves us with some exceptional cases that need to be attacked with other methods. Comment: 14 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{complementary}} {{solutions are}} available for the identifier mapping problem. This creates an opportunity for bioinformatics tool developers. Tools {{can be made to}} flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage. This approach requires an interface layer between tools and mapping services. Results Here we present BridgeDb, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping. This framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations. BridgeDb provides its own <b>ready-to-go</b> mapping services, both in webservice and local database forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and adaptation to any identifier mapping service. BridgeDb has already been integrated into several bioinformatics applications. Conclusion By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All described software is open source and available at [URL]. </p...|$|E
40|$|Network {{function}} virtualization {{has enabled}} data center providers to offer new service provisioning models. Through {{the use of}} data center management software (cloud managers), providers allow their tenants to customize their virtual network infrastructure, enabling them to create a network topology that includes network functions (e. g., routers, firewalls), either chosen among the natively supported catalog or provided by third-parties.

This paper proposes an architecture that extends current cloud management software to enable the configuration of network functions.

A prototype of this solution has been also implemented and tested, in order to validate our approach and evaluate its effectiveness in the configuration phase...|$|E
