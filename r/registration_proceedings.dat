40|$|A {{cadastre}} is a {{based on}} a cadastral map official register of land, property and other utilities that constitute subjects of taxation {{as well as the}} source of information on cadastral objects. As indicated in the reference books, it constitutes an institution of law, which in the social perception is seen as providing legal order in the scope of establishing the range of laws, of the sense of security resulting from the fact of the entering of the subjects of taxation and the possibility to exert one’s rights under the <b>registration</b> <b>proceedings.</b> However, the current shape of the register does not meet social expectations. The suggested reform of the taxation of property in Poland (cadastre) meets numerous obstacles such as a formal and legal, political, financial or social barrier...|$|E

50|$|Among other things, the Trade Marks Act defines {{trade marks}} (including {{certification}} marks and collective marks), what constitutes trademark infringement and defences and exceptions thereto, and (together with the Trade Marks Regulations) sets out procedures for <b>registration</b> and other <b>proceedings</b> before the Registrar of Trade Marks. The legislation does not codify {{the law of}} trade marks in Australia; as a common law jurisdiction, a trade mark owner may also (for example) seek to protect its rights through legal proceedings for passing off.|$|R
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the functioning of judicial systems and the situation of the economy in the European Union Member States. The study includes draft country fiches for all EU Member States and a comparative report, reflecting the questions of a scoreboard provided by the European Commission. This list of questions focuses on civil and commercial justice and encompasses 1) Business-friendliness of land and property registration, company <b>registration,</b> insolvency <b>proceedings</b> and obtaining licenses 2) Resources of justice, including budget, human resources, workload and ICT 3) Use and accessibility of justice, including length and cost of procedures, use of simplified and ADR procedures. While in the country fiches, facts, figures and analysis on the performance of individual (country-level) judicial systems are provided, the link with the economic situation is assessed in the comparative part. To our knowledge, {{it is the first time}} that such assessment has relied not only on data from surveys or from coding but also actual data provided by the judicial authorities (number of judges, budget, etc.). The findings are preliminary but suggestive. They are preliminary because econometric processing should be implemented to have a more precise assessment. They are nevertheless suggestive because, though weak, correlations go in the expected direction and are statistically significant at standard levels...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is an {{introduction}} into {{the basic principles of}} electoral law and instruments of their protection, especially through the judicial power, in the local elections. The right to participate on public affairs is one of the fundamental attributes of the citizens of a democratic state. Its protection through independent and impartial courts is very important. The first chapter sets out rights relating to elections into municipal councils. The second chapter explains the stages of the electoral process, including examples of selected court decisions related to some institutes. The third chapter deals with the protection of public subjective rights in the election judiciary. The protection is provided to political rights of voters, political parties, candidates and elected members of representative bodies. There is a brief mention about the protection that has been previously provided by civilian courts. In accordance with the system of the Judicial Administrative Procedure Code I discuss four particular types of proceedings - proceedings in matters of electoral rolls, proceedings in matters of <b>registration</b> of candidates, <b>proceedings</b> in matters of invalidibity of elections and voting and proceedings concerning termination of the mandate. The third type of procedure, judicial [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As {{in other}} jurisdictions, the Dutch {{judiciary}} has been confronted with public unease about criminal justice {{and is trying}} to enhance its legitimacy. System and culture however contain hardly any opening for public involvement in criminal justice, and this implication of the publicity principle traditionally encounters disapproval. In its aim of (re) gaining confidence in the criminal justice system, publicity intertwines procedural fairness and public influence: it requires that the (perception of the) lay public is taken into account when conducting proceedings and phrasing the judgment, thereby ensuring visible conformity with publicly-held fairness standards and thus a perception of legitimacy by participants and the public alike. Procedural justice research confirms these notions in finding that the perception of proceedings as fair legitimizes the judiciary and the justice system. The judiciary’s wish to enhance transparency – of which the press guidelines (2013) are the most important expression – is therefore essential. Both publicity and the procedural justice concept refer to the procedure as central in legitimization and therefore provide important arguments for allowing the audiovisual <b>registration</b> of criminal <b>proceedings.</b> As system and culture do not change easily, this may lead to more public-minded proceedings and to a shift in the public debate towards procedure...|$|R
40|$|For many years, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has re-fused {{to address}} {{constitutional}} claims {{raised in the}} course of <b>registration</b> or cancellation <b>proceedings.</b> A recent example involves the Washington Redskins trademark, which {{is the subject of a}} cancellation proceeding now before a U. S. Court of Appeals. The Board’s refusal to address constitutional issues rests on the assumption that the Board lacks the authority to make constitutional decisions. That may seem odd, given the fact that the Board is an arm of the federal government, and its members are bound to uphold the Constitution. This Article examines the basis of the Board’s claim of incapacity. Although the Board’s claim is not with-out precedent, it is argued that the better reading of current law is that the Board does have the capacity to address constitutional claims and that it should do so. The Article further examines ways in which the Board can decide constitutional issues without overstepping its bounds as an administrative agency. In particular, the Article examines the possible use of a familiar constitutional principle of avoidance as a means of allowing the Board to incorporate constitutional principles into its decision-making without having to rule on the constitutionality of the provisions of the federal trademark statute...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acute {{anterior}} dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation. Subsequently, {{the shoulder}} is less stable and {{more susceptible to}} redislocation, especially in active young adults. Objectives: To compare surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Search strategy: The authors searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (14 August 2009), The Cochrane Library (2009, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), trial <b>registration</b> databases, conference <b>proceedings</b> and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions. Data collection and analysis: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results were pooled. Main results: The four included studies involved 163 participants, mainly active young adult males. All had had a primary (first time) traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Methodological quality was variable. All participants of one trial returned to active military duty. Two trials respectively reported similar numbers with reduced sports participation or non return to previous activities. The other, an inadequately reported, trial found significantly fewer people in the surgical group failed to attain previous levels of sports activity. Pooled results from all four trials showed that subsequent instability, either redislocation or subluxation, was statistically significantly less frequent in the surgical group (risk ratio 0. 25, 95...|$|R
