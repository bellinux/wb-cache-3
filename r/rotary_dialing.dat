50|$|While a tone-to-pulse {{converter}} {{could be}} deployed to any existing mechanical office line using 1970s technology, its speed {{would be limited}} to pulse dialing rates.The new central office switches were backward-compatible with <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|E
50|$|As direct {{distance}} dialing {{expanded to}} {{a growing number of}} communities, local numbers (often four, five or six digits) were extended to standardized seven-digit named exchanges. A toll call to another area code was eleven digits, including the leading 1. In the 1950s, AT&T conducted extensive studies of product engineering and efficiency and concluded that push-button dialing was preferable to <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{telephone}} keypad is the keypad {{installed on}} a push-button telephone or similar telecommunication device for dialing a telephone number. It was standardized when the dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) system {{was developed in}} the Bell System in the United States in the 1960s that replaced <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing</b> originally developed in electromechanical switching systems. Because of the installed abundance of rotary dial equipment well into the 1990s, many telephone keypads were also designed to produce loop-disconnect pulses electronically, and some could be optionally switched to produce either DTMF or pulses.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> is {{a device}} mounted on or in a {{telephone}} or switchboard {{that is designed to}} send electrical pulses, known as pulse dialing, corresponding to the number dialed. The early form of the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.|$|R

50|$|Such key-locked telephones, if {{wired to}} a modern DTMF capable exchange, can also be {{exploited}} by a tone dialer that generates the DTMF tones used by modern keypad units. These signals are now very uniformly standardized worldwide, and along with <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing,</b> they are almost {{all that is left}} of in-band signaling. It is notable that the two methods can be combined: Even if the exchange does not support DTMF, the key lock can be circumvented by switch-hooking, and the tone dialer can be then used to operate automated DTMF controlled services that can't be used with rotary dial.|$|E
50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A global {{teleprinter}} network, {{called the}} [...] "Telex network", {{was developed in}} the late 1920s, and was used through most of the 20th century for business communications. The main difference from a standard teleprinter is that Telex includes a switched routing network, originally based on pulse-telephone dialing, which in the United States was provided by Western Union. AT&T developed a competing network called [...] "TWX" [...] which initially also used <b>rotary</b> <b>dialing</b> and Baudot code, carried to the customer premises as pulses of DC on a metallic copper pair. TWX later added a second ASCII-based service using Bell 103 type modems served over lines whose physical interface was identical to regular telephone lines. In many cases, the TWX service was provided by the same telephone central office that handled voice calls, using class of service to prevent POTS customers from connecting to TWX customers. Telex is still in use in some countries for certain applications such as shipping, news, weather reporting and military command. Many business applications have moved to the Internet as most countries have discontinued telex/TWX services.|$|E

50|$|A {{vertical}} {{service code}} (VSC) is {{a sequence of}} digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) dialed on a telephone keypad or <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> to enable or disable certain telephony service features.

On a touch tone telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name star codes. On <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> telephones the star is replaced by dialing 11.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, {{the base}} of the {{telephone}} also enclosed its bell and induction coil, obviating a separate ringer box. Power was supplied to each subscriber line by central office batteries instead of the user's local battery which required periodic service. For the next half century, the network behind the telephone grew progressively larger and much more efficient, and after the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> was added the instrument itself changed little until Touch-Tone signaling started replacing the <b>rotary</b> <b>dial</b> in the 1960s.|$|R
