5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is close to that of light (relativistic).|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
25|$|Steric forces between polymer-covered {{surfaces}} or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, {{producing an}} additional steric <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive depletion force between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made superplasticizers developed {{to increase the}} workability of concrete and to reduce its water content.|$|E
5000|$|Air (or wind) element (vāyu-dhātu)Air element {{represents}} {{the quality of}} expansion or <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces.</b> Any matter where <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> are in prominence are called air elements. Internal air elements includes air associated with the pulmonary system (for example, for breathing), the intestinal system ("winds in the belly and ... bowels"), etc.|$|R
5000|$|Electrostatic <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> {{dominate}} in polyelectrolyte stabilized emulsions., Although {{there are}} steric interactions, they are negligible in comparison. As {{the concentration of}} polyelectrolyte increases, <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> increase. When there are more polyelectrolyte molecules, the distance between individual particles decreases. As the distance [...] decreases, the exponential term becomes greater. Consequently, the repulsion energy also increases.|$|R
30|$|To avoid {{obstacles}}, many studies [14, 15] {{deal with}} virtual <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> from obstacles to the robot. In limit-cycle-based bipedal gait, however, such <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> may deviate the robot’s state from the limit cycle to guarantee stability, thereby causing falling down. This {{problem can be}} solved by indirect interaction with the obstacles {{by means of the}} leader point, as mentioned in “Overview” section.|$|R
25|$|The tritium nucleus, {{containing}} one proton and two neutrons, has {{the same}} charge as the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, and it experiences the same electrostatic <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> when brought close to another atomic nucleus. However, the neutrons in the tritium nucleus increase the attractive strong nuclear force when brought close enough to another atomic nucleus. As a result, tritium can more easily fuse with other light atoms, compared with the ability of ordinary hydrogen to do so.|$|E
25|$|Two {{unprotected}} oil droplets {{with small}} radii in water are favored thermodynamically to coalesce into one bigger droplet because the process yields a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio. The energetic {{contribution of the}} interfacial layer over that same volume of oil is minimized when the two droplets fuse together. Thus, the coalescence process puts the system in a lower energy state and the process would occur spontaneously. However, when the oil droplets are coated with emulsifying agent, electrostatic <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> is introduced among the oil droplets which keeps the droplets from coming together.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron immediately gave scientists a new tool for probing the properties of atomic nuclei. Alpha particles had been used over the previous decades in scattering experiments, but such particles, which are helium nuclei, have +2 charge. This charge {{makes it difficult for}} alpha particles to overcome the Coulomb <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> and interact directly with the nuclei of atoms. Since neutrons have no electric charge, {{they do not have to}} overcome this force to interact with nuclei. Almost coincident with its discovery, neutrons were used by Norman Feather, Chadwick's colleague and protege, in scattering experiments with nitrogen. Feather was able to show that neutrons interacting with nitrogen nuclei scattered to protons or induced nitrogen to disintegrate to form boron with the emission of an alpha particle. Feather was therefore the first to show that neutrons produce nuclear disintegrations.|$|E
50|$|Anion and π-aromatic systems (typically {{electron}} deficient) {{create an}} interaction that {{is associated with}} the <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> of the structures. These <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> involve electrostatic and anion-induced polarized interactions. This force allows for the systems to be used as receptors and channels in supramolecular chemistry for applications in the medical (synthetic membranes, ion channels) and environmental fields (e.g. sensing, removal of ions from water).|$|R

After 25 years of design and study, a quantitative model to explain and predict repulsion under strong compression is still lacking. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and theory to study polymer coatings under high loads and demonstrate a validated model for the <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces,</b> proposing that this universal behavior can be predicted from the polymer solution properties...|$|R
25|$|In {{electrodynamic}} suspension (EDS), {{both the}} guideway {{and the train}} exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive and attractive force between these magnetic fields. In some configurations, the train can be levitated only by <b>repulsive</b> <b>force.</b> In {{the early stages of}} maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system. The magnetic field is produced either by superconducting magnets (as in JR–Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive and attractive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable – changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position. In addition, the attractive force varies in the opposite manner, providing the same adjustment effects. No active feedback control is needed.|$|E

500|$|However, {{already in}} quantum {{mechanics}} {{there is one}} [...] "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete [...] intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the [...] "spin", {{and there is the}} Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. [...] If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. [...] parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force),</b> and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.|$|E

50|$|For {{attractive}} forces, F(r) is negative, {{because it}} works {{to reduce the}} distance r to the center. Conversely, for <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces,</b> F(r) is positive.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a parametrized family of energy/stress functions useful for proximity analysis, nonlinear dimension reduction, and graph drawing. The functions {{are inspired by}} the physics intuitions of attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> common in graph drawing. Their minimization generates low-dimensional configurations (embeddings, graph drawings) whose interpoint distances match input distances as best as possible. The functions model attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> with so-called Box-Cox transformations (essentially power transformations with the logarithmic transformation analytically embedded and negative powers made monotone increasing). Attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> are balanced so as to attempt exact matching of input and output distances. To stabilize embeddings when only local distances are used, we impute infinite non-local distances that exert infinitesimal <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces.</b> The resulting energy/stress functions form a three-parameter family that contains many of the published energy functions in graph drawing and stress functions in multidimensional scaling. The problem of selecting an energy/stress function is therefore translated to a parameter selection problem which can be approached with a meta-criterion previously proposed by the authors (Chen and Buja 2009). Of particular interest is the tuning of a parameter associated {{with the notion of}} “clustering strength” proposed by Noack (2003). Such tuning greatly helps identifying “zero-dimensional manifolds”, i. e., clusters...|$|R

Assume that a black hole is surrounded by a disc of luminous gas.

If the gravitational force exerted by the black hole is less than the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> due to radiation pressure, the disc will be blown away by radiation pressure. of the black hole can be calculated using: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Poe, {{the initial}} {{state of matter}} was a single [...] "Primordial Particle". [...] "Divine Volition", manifesting itself as a <b>repulsive</b> <b>force,</b> {{fragmented}} the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order {{to begin the process}} of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason Poe anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.|$|E
2500|$|Optical {{tweezers}} (originally called [...] "single-beam {{gradient force}} trap") are scientific instruments that use a highly {{focused laser beam}} to provide an attractive or <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> (typically {{on the order of}} piconewtons), depending on the refractive index mismatch to physically hold and move microscopic dielectric objects similar to tweezers. Optical tweezers have been particularly successful in studying a variety of biological systems in recent years.|$|E
40|$|Vector field (otherwise {{known as}} force vector or force field) {{navigation}} {{has been used}} in mobile robotics primarily for goal oriented navigation and obstacle avoidance. At the most basic level the vector field consists of attractive <b>forces,</b> goals, and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces,</b> usually objects. Both attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> are usually characterised as point forces. The shortfall of this characterisation {{is that there is no}} way of controlling the heading of the mobile robot as it reaches the goal position. In this paper various methods of altering the goal vector field will be looked at. These methods include investigating clustered attractive and <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> as well as introducing rotational and line based forces. This investigation was run using a simulated model of an Ackermann steering vehicle. Results indicated that a complex vector field approach was able to give position and heading control at waypoints with the chosen simulated vehicle. ...|$|R

To achieve better performance for detergent and cleaning product, mixed surfactants are commonly used to lower electrostatic forces between the surfactant heads. One of the best combinations to reduce such <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> is by mixing anionic and cationic surfactants. The oppositely charged surfactants can act as counterions {{to each other and}} thus screen the <b>repulsive</b> <b>forces</b> (Sohrabi et al. 2008; Tondre and Caillet 2001; Li and Liu 1994).|$|R

2500|$|The {{amygdala}} {{is suspected}} of processing people's strong reactions to personal space violations since these are absent in those {{in which it is}} damaged and it is activated when people are physically close. Research links the amygdala with emotional reactions to proximity to other people.

As the researchers have noted: [...] "Our findings suggest that the amygdala may mediate the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> that helps to maintain a minimum distance between people. Further, our findings are consistent with those in monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions, who stay within closer proximity to other monkeys or people, an effect we suggest arises from the absence of strong emotional responses to personal space violation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, {{in a book}} {{entitled}} Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité, Tellier formulated an all-new problem called the [...] "attraction-repulsion problem", which constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R {{in such a way}} that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the <b>repulsive</b> <b>force</b> exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted spatial economics theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003). The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005) as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.|$|E
