25|$|The {{investigation}} by the Australian Department of Civil Aviation was completed in September 1969 and concluded:The cause of this accident was that the fatigue endurance of the starboard inner main spar lower boom was substantially reduced by the insertion of a flared bush at Station 143 when the margin of safety associated with the <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> specified for such booms did not ensure that this boom would achieve its <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> {{in the presence of}} such a defect.|$|E
25|$|The sole {{remaining}} Stinson Model A in Australia, VH-UKK Binana, had its {{certificate of}} airworthiness suspended {{and it did not}} fly again. The accident drew public attention to the potential for metal fatigue to cause sudden failure of the structure of a modern civil aircraft. The Department of Civil Aviation began a practice of calculating the safe <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of metal aircraft registered in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Fatigue-failure of {{the wing}} of VH-RMQ {{immediately}} raised doubt {{about the validity of}} the <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of the inner lower boom in the Type 700 so British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board (ARB) took the precaution of reducing the life from 11,400 flights to 7,000. This soon resulted in British Aircraft Corporation obtaining a number of inner lower booms with time in service greater than 7,000 flights. Nineteen of these retired booms were examined in detail. Sixteen contained minor fatigue cracks in different critical locations. The longest crack was 0.054-inch (1.37mm) in a boom that had been in service for 8,194 flights. This evidence convinced British Aircraft Corporation and the UK Air Registration Board that the inner lower boom did not possess the fatigue endurance originally intended so the precautionary life of 7,000 flights was made permanent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mandatory}} <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of {{the lower}} boom in the inner wing was 11,400 flights. [...] A pair of new inner lower booms had been installed in VH-RMQ in 1964 and had been in service for only 8,090 flights. [...] The investigation concentrated on determining why the inner lower boom had failed at 70% of its <b>retirement</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{wing of the}} Vickers Viscount used {{a single}} main spar {{made up of a}} centre-section in the fuselage, two inner {{sections}} and two outer sections. [...] The main spar comprised an upper boom, a shear web and a lower boom. [...] The aircraft was designed and type-certificated to the principle of a safe-life. [...] Before a component reaches its safe-life it must be removed from the aircraft and retired. [...] At the time of the accident the <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of the lower boom in the centre-section was 20,500 flights; the inner lower boom was 11,400 flights; and the outer lower boom was 19,000 flights. [...] The <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of the spars in the horizontal tailplanes and the vertical fin was 30,000 flights.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of {{the wing}} spar of a {{transport}} category aeroplane type-certificated to the safe-life principle {{is based on a}} safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. [...] The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this class of aeroplane. [...] A 50% reduction of mean time to failure does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its <b>retirement</b> <b>life.</b> In anticipation that the atmospheric gust spectrum in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the gust spectrum was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric gust spectrum these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The fatal {{fatigue crack}} in the inner lower boom had {{initiated}} at a bolt hole at Station 143, the rearmost of five bolt holes for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom. [...] These holes were ⅞ inch (2.22cm) diameter and were anodised to resist wear and corrosion. [...] A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole. [...] Each bush was an interference fit in the hole to improve fatigue resistance and substantially increase the <b>retirement</b> <b>life</b> of the inner lower boom.|$|E
