Twelve {{of them are}} specific to the data and method of analysis {{and two of them}} (comment No. 7 & 10) general comments on the characteristics of the Alpine basins. We would like to respond to the comment No. 7 & 10 first, as it is concerned with the most important conceptual issues discussed in this paper. C- 7 (453 - 22) We completely agree with the view that the buffering capacity of glaciers during the period of low runoff in glacier fed rivers is a typical aspect of glaciated Alpine basins. What is atypical about the ‘Himalayan catchment ’ is that this buffering occurs during the wet period of the annual <b>runoff</b> <b>cycle</b> in contrary to the Alpine basins, where this buffering occurs during the dry period. We feel {{it is very important to}} dispel the C 146 notion that the glaciers world over are contributing to the dry period of the annual <b>runoff</b> <b>cycle,</b> because over the years this concept has become the corner stone of glacier research and management strategies of glacier fed streams in the Himalayan region.

40|$|The runoff {{regime in}} the basins of the rivers Ganges (917 ' 444 km) and Brahmaputra (547 ' 346 km) is {{modelled}} from precipitation, remotely sensed snow covered areas and temperatures. The <b>runoff</b> <b>cycle</b> roughly corresponds to a calendar year. In view of the small proportion of snowmelt, it is mainly governed by the distribution of rainfalls resulting in flow peaks {{in the summer and}} recession flow in the winter. The accuracy of runoff simulations is acceptable in view of the available data and because the SRM model was for the first time used in basins of this order of magnitude. In addition, for the given climate change scenario (T+ 1. 5, summer precipitation increased by 10 %), the already high risk of floods in July-September is slightly increased...|$|E
40|$|The high abundances and cyclic {{distribution}} of {{remains of the}} freshwater fern Azolla in early-Middle Eocene sediments from the Arctic Ocean have previously been related to episodic surface-water freshening, which was speculated to be orbitally modulated. Our integrated palynological and cyclostratigraphical analysis of the recovered Azolla interval in Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) core 302 -M 0004 A- 11 X resulted in the recognition of two clear periodicities: a dominant ~ 1. 2 m cyclicity, which we relate to changes in obliquity (~ 40 k. y.), and a weaker ~ 0. 7 m cyclicity, which we link to precession (~ 21 k. y.). Cycles in the abundances of Azolla, cysts of freshwater-tolerant dinoflagellates, and swamp-vegetation pollen show covariability in the obliquity domain. This strong correlation suggests periods of enhanced rainfall and runoff during Azolla blooms, presumably linked to increased local summer temperatures during obliquity maxima. Larix and bisaccate conifer pollen covary at the precession frequency, with peak occurrences corresponding to precession minima, possibly {{as a result of}} enhanced continental runoff from a more remote source area and a stronger seasonal contrast. Following the sudden demise of Azolla ca. 48. 1 Ma, <b>runoff</b> (<b>cycles)</b> continued to influence the central Arctic at decreased intensity. This and a concomitant decline in swamp-vegetation pollen suggest edaphically drier conditions on land and decreased runoff into the Arctic Ocean, causing salinity changes, which might have been fatal for Azolla. Moreover, a sea-level rise, inferred from overall decreasing total terrestrial palynomorph concentrations, possibly facilitated oceanic connections. © 2011 Geological Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Norwegian Coastal cod form a {{stationary}} population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) consisting of several genetically separated subpopulations. A small-scale differen- tiation in marine populations with pelagic eggs and larvae {{is made possible}} by local retention of early life stages in coastal regions. A numerical model was implemented for {{a part of the}} northern Norwegian coast with 800 m horizontal resolution, in addition to two fjord systems with higher resolution; Folda in Nordland and Porsangerfjorden in Finnmark. The model results were used to simulate connectivity and retention of cod eggs among coastal regions and fjords. The cod eggs in Folda attained a subsur- face vertical distribution, avoiding the surface and causing retention. River regulations caused by hydroelectric power production alters the seasonal <b>runoff</b> <b>cycle</b> and reduced the retention of cod eggs in Folda. The dispersion of planktonic organisms in Por- sangerfjorden is highly affected by the local wind and varies with resolution on the atmospheric forcing in the model. Coastal spawning areas have intermediate connec- tivity of early life stages between neighboring areas. High retention of eggs in fjords combined with strong homing to spawning areas indicate that fjord subpopulations may be described as a metapopulation...|$|E
40|$|The Logan River, one of Utah 2 ̆ 7 s better trout streams, {{has carried}} {{more than its}} share of the {{increased}} fishing pressure of the past few years. Careful management of the drainage by the U. S. Forest Service has kept the Logan River free of serious water fluctutations and relatively unpolluted by silt and wastes. The only noticeable fluctuations in the stream is the annual <b>runoff</b> <b>cycle</b> which usually reaches its peak in May. This alone has contributed greatly to the ability of the river to withstand the increased fishing pressure which it has done quite well. The increase in fishing pressure can be better understood which it is learned that there has been a 500 percent increase since 1920; and along with the increase in pressure came a relative decrease in the fishing waters for the state as a whole. If the Logan River is to continue to support the present army of angles and retain a harvestable crop of fish for them, the management of the crop and the fishermen will have to be established on a sound basis. The chief purpose of this study is to contribute a share of knowledge to the sound management of, not only the Logan River, but to other similar bodies of water. Overlooking a single phase of management in such a delicate ecologically balanced area as this renders all other phases ineffective. However, there is much to be learned if the balance is to be maintained...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) influence climate by suppressing canopy transpiration {{in addition to}} its well-known greenhouse gas effect. The decrease in plant transpiration is due to changes in plant physiology (reduced opening of plant stomata). Here, we quantify such changes in water flux for various levels of CO 2 concentrations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research s (NCAR) Community Land Model. We find that photosynthesis saturates after 800 ppmv (parts per million, by volume) in this model. However, unlike photosynthesis, canopy transpiration continues to decline at about 5. 1 % per 100 ppmv increase in CO 2 levels. We also find that the associated reduction in latent heat flux is primarily compensated by increased sensible heat flux. The continued decline in canopy transpiration and subsequent increase in sensible heat flux at elevated CO 2 levels implies that incremental warming associated with the physiological effect of CO 2 will not abate at higher CO 2 concentrations, indicating important consequences for the global water and carbon cycles from anthropogenic CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Urbanization changes {{characteristics}} of a drainage area and alters components of a natural hydrologic <b>cycle.</b> <b>Runoff</b> volumes increase, stormwater runs off more quickly and consequently peak flows become larger. Human alteration of the flow regime changes the natural pattern of hydrologic variation and disturbance, which may ultimately lead to river ecosystem degradation. For this reason an alternative stormwater management approach has been devised that mimics natural hydrologic functions by means of sustainable measures which manage rainfall where it falls. This investigation uses a hydrological model {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of different sustainable measures and their combinations in reducing runoff volumes and peak flows on a small drainage area which is representative for a wider city center of Ljubljana. We assumed these measures to be distributed across the drainage area having regard to the current legislation, spatial and technical constraints. The effects were studied for rainfall events of different return periods. Discharge measurements were made at the drainage area outflow and a rain gauge was situated in the vicinity of the study site. In the case of events with a return period of 1 year or less, the runoff volumes and peak flows reduction was approximately 45...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} colored {{dissolved}} organic matter (CDOM) from freshwater <b>runoff</b> and seasonal <b>cycle</b> of temperature on the dynamic of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and production in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) are studied using a 3 -D coupled physical-plankton ecosystem model. Three simulations are conducted: (1) the reference simulation based on Le Fouest et al. (2005), in which light attenuation by CDOM is not considered and maximum growth rate (μmaxμmax) of phytoplankton and zooplankton are not temperature-dependent (REF simulation); (2) light attenuation by CDOM is added to REF simulation (CDOM simulation); and (3) in addition to CDOM, the μmaxμmax of phytoplankton and zooplankton are regulated by temperature (CDOM+TEMP simulation). CDOM simulation shows that CDOM substantially reduces phytoplankton biomass and production in the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (LSLE), but slightly reduces overall primary production in the GSL. In the LSLE, the spring phytoplankton bloom is delayed from mid-March to mid-April, resulted from light attenuation by CDOM. The CDOM+TEMP simulation shows that the spring phytoplankton bloom in the LSLE is further delayed to July, which is more consistent with observations. Annual primary production is reduced by 33 % in CDOM+TEMP simulation from REF and CDOM simulations. Zooplankton production is the same in all three simulations, and export of organic matter to depth is reduced in CDOM+TEMP simulation, suggesting that temperature controlled growth of phytoplankton and zooplankton enhances the coupling between primary production and zooplankton production under the seasonal temperature cycle of the GSL...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh-quality {{rainfall}} {{information is}} critical for accurate simulation of <b>runoff</b> and water <b>cycle</b> processes on the land surface. In situ monitoring of rainfall has a very limited utility at the regional and global scale {{because of the high}} temporal and spatial variability of rainfall. As a step toward overcoming this problem, microwave remote sensing observations can be used to retrieve the temporal and spatial rainfall coverage because of their global availability and frequency of measurement. This paper addresses the question of whether remote sensing rainfall estimates over a catchment can be used for water balance computations in the distributed hydrological model. The TRMM 3 B 42 V 6 rainfall product was introduced into the hydrological cycle simulation of the Yangtze River Basin in South China. A tool was developed to interpolate the rain gauge observations at the same temporal and spatial resolution as the TRMM data and then evaluate the precision of TRMM 3 B 42 V 6 data from 1998 to 2006. It shows that the TRMM 3 B 42 V 6 rainfall product was reliable and had good precision in application to the Yangtze River Basin. The TRMM 3 B 42 V 6 data slightly overestimated rainfall during the wet season and underestimated rainfall during the dry season in the Yangtze River Basin. Results suggest that the TRMM 3 B 42 V 6 rainfall product can be used as an alternative data source for large-scale distributed hydrological models...|$|R

Selected sizes and a composite sample of unconsolidated surface material were placed within 0. 75 m wide by 4. 0 m long metal frames. Flow was then introduced at the top of the frames in successive increments. The discharge rate and flow velocity necessary to cause movement of unconsolidated surface material was measured. Hydraulic measurements were used to determine the ratio of critical flow depth to particle diameter, critical flow rate, critical flow velocity, critical shear velocity, critical Reynolds number, critical shear stress, critical dimensionless shear stress, and critical boundary Reynolds number. Measurements of these parameters for the composite material were 0. 556, 0. 499 L s- 1, 0. 0787 m s- 1, 0. 0643 m s- 1, 695, 4. 12 Pa, 0. 0436, and 1040, respectively.
