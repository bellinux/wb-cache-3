50|$|There {{are mainly}} two methods to {{manufacture}} glass flakes. One is bubble method. Firstly, melt the glass marble to liquid form, then blow the glass liquid to bubble by air; smash the glass flakes and sieve it to different particle size distribution. The other is centrifuge method, drop high-temperature liquid form glass to <b>rotating</b> <b>tub,</b> glass flakes would be spun off by centrifuge force.|$|E
50|$|Pioneer 4 was {{launched}} with a Juno II launch vehicle, which also launched Pioneer 3. Juno II closely resembled the Juno I (Jupiter-C based) vehicle that launched Explorer 1. Its first stage was a 19.51 m elongated Jupiter IRBM missile {{that was used}} by the U.S. Army. On top of the Jupiter propulsion section was a guidance and control compartment that supported a <b>rotating</b> <b>tub</b> containing the rocket stages 2, 3 and 4. Pioneer 4 was mounted on top of stage 4.|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{armament}} configuration included twin M2HB [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) {{machine guns}} {{forward in a}} <b>rotating</b> shielded <b>tub,</b> a single rear M60, one or two 7.62 mm light machine guns mounted on the port and starboard sides, and a Mk 19 grenade launcher. There was also {{a full complement of}} M16 rifles, shotguns, [...]45 ACP handguns, and hand grenades. Some had a [...] "piggyback" [...] arrangement, a [...]50 cal machine gun on top of an 81mm mortar; others had a bow-mounted Mk16 Mod 4 Colt 20 mm automatic cannon, derived from the AN/M3 version of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 and also found on the LCMs and PBRs.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "chestnut coal jig" [...] - This was {{yet another}} {{circular}} coal jig. Used for lumps of coal which were chestnut size or smaller, {{the bottom of the}} jig was a circular tub. A convex (or concave upwards) perforated iron plate moved {{up and down in the}} water, creating upward water pressure. The upper part of the jig was a <b>rotating</b> round <b>tub</b> with a spiral shelf running around the inside. The iron plate forced the lighter coal toward the top of the water, where the rotating spiral shelf picked it up and conveyed it to the top of the jig and out a chute. The heavier impurities slid off the iron plate and out a culm gate.|$|R
