To this end, an experimental study has been conducted based on a survey of commercial <b>risk</b> <b>analysts</b> employed in Spanish companies. The results indicate that the type of audit report (unqualified or qualified) does have an influence on commercial decisions taken by <b>risk</b> <b>analysts.</b> In particular, there are differences between an unqualified and qualified audit report if we analyse the following decisions: when commercial <b>risk</b> <b>analysts</b> decide to begin commercial relationships with another company, when they evaluate the risk of the commercial operation, when they demand additional guarantees beyond the normal, and when they must decide the amount of commercial credit to grant to the possible client. On the other hand, the results have shown that the effect of the nature of the qualification differs depending on the decision to be taken by the commercial <b>risk</b> <b>analysts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Individuals, organizations, {{and devices}} are now {{interconnected}} {{to an unprecedented}} degree, forcing identity <b>risk</b> <b>analysts</b> to redefine “identity ” in such contexts and explore new techniques for analyzing expanding threat contexts. Major hurdles to modeling in this field include a lack of publicly available data due to privacy and safety concerns, {{as well as the}} unstructured nature of incident reports. Thus, this report uses news story text mining to develop a new system for strengthening identity risk models. The NewsFerret system collects and analyzes stories about identity theft, establishes semantic relatedness measures between identity concept pairs, and supports analysis of those measures with reports, visualizations, and relevant news stories. <b>Risk</b> <b>analysts</b> can utilize the resulting analytical models to define and validate identity risk models.

Such “uncertainty characteri-zation ” is said to be an important part of fully and honestly informing decision makers about the estimates and uncertainties in analyses that support policy recommendations, enabling them to make better decisions.
