500|$|In 1772 Thomas Johnson {{opened the}} [...] "Little Factory" [...] for carding and {{spinning}} cotton. [...] "The Great Leviathon" [...] powered a steam-driven mill for woollen spinning on Factory Street in 1792. More cotton mills were built {{close to the}} Hindsford and Shakerley Brooks which provided water for steam power. In 1823, after a strike for increased wages and lockout by the millowners at New Mills, owned by J & G Jones in Factory Street, the workforce was sacked and new hands hired to replace them. The scab labourers, knobsticks had {{to be protected from}} assault by the dismissed workers. Joseph Wilson built Hope Mill in James Street. By 1838 James Burton owned most of the town's mills. He lived in Charles Street surrounded by his workers' houses. His company owned 74cottages and 57cellars, a house in Elliot Street and the King's Arms public house. Burton died in 1868. In 1883 a fire at Burton's mills caused £15,000 damage (equivalent to £ in [...] ) and by 1920 his mills were demolished. Caleb Wright owned Barnfield Mills which had a workforce of about 800. The last of his mills, Barnfield No 6 on Shuttle Street, was built in 1894 on the site of Resolution Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1891. Barnfield No 6 was a concrete-floored multi-storey mill for spinning, powered by an external engine house via a <b>rope</b> <b>race.</b> The mill was demolished in the 1990s and the site is occupied by a supermarket.|$|E

50|$|This {{was a large}} six storey double mill with 260,000 spindles. It {{was built}} by Stott and Sons, and its {{features}} were described as Byzantine in style. Each mill was 12 bays wide and 9 bays deep,the <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> forming a thirteenth bay. The basic bay dimensions were 22 ft by 15 ft, thus, the internal dimensions at the second floor were 266 ft by 137 ft. The <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> is 12 ft wide internally. At ground floor level a single storey card shed extends {{the width of the}} mill; this is 5 bays, 68 ft deep.|$|E

50|$|The mill {{was built}} to house {{self-acting}} mules, and originally used the engine house from the old mill which powered the machinery via a <b>rope</b> <b>race.</b> A second engine house {{was built on the}} north side. Ring spinning machinery was installed in the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The 1865 mill {{consists}} of two five storeyed blocks of 18 bays, with a narrower 9 bay central block for warehousing and offices. The central block has two italianate stair towers and carries a central clock. The floors have become wider to accommodate the larger mules of the period. All floors are fireproof, with transverse vaults. The detached engine house used horizontal shafts that connected to vertical shafts in each spinning block. The chimney was octagonal, on a plinth with a highly embellished oversailer. In the early 20th century this was replaced with separate inverted compound engines for each block with external <b>rope</b> <b>races</b> for <b>rope</b> drives.|$|R

50|$|The Wilton Mill was a late mill. It {{was built}} as a mule mill, but was {{converted}} by the LCC to rings. It had four storeys, it was 36x10 bays with a six bay engine house. The chimney was detached, round on a square plinth. It had an ornate domed water tower, and its name was displayed on a pediment above the <b>rope</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mill has a {{reinforced}} steel frame clad in red brick with buff-coloured brick bands and dressings. The six-storey blocks are ten bays long and seven wide and have corner water towers. The water tower {{to the older}} 1913 block rises two stages above roof level and is topped with a cupola. Both blocks have offices, an engine house and <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> towers. The mill has a single chimney and the 1923 boiler house contains a cross compound mill engine made by Yates and Thom of Blackburn and once contained seven Lancashire boilers. The mill ran more than 200,000 mule and 4,800 ring spindles and its spinning machinery was supplied by Platt Brothers of Oldham.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{were run}} at higher {{pressures}} and from 1875, powered horizontal shafts on each floor {{by means of}} ropes. This was a prominent change as a <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> had to be built running {{the height of the}} mill. The engine needed more space and the engine house, boiler house and economiser were external to the main mill. Mills continued to get bigger, and were sometimes paired; two mills being driven by one engine. Another change was the trend of having carding on one floor. To achieve this, the ground floor was extended outwards behind the mill often a full mill width. In a single mill, the crosswall divided the blowing room from the rest, as it was here that there was greatest risk of fire.|$|E
50|$|Slack {{events are}} events {{that do not}} fit into the normal rodeo hours in the afternoon. Slack rodeo events {{are open to the}} public at no charge and usually take place in the early to mid morning hours. Slack events include calf roping, team roping, steer <b>roping,</b> barrel <b>racing,</b> and steer wrestling.|$|R
5000|$|Since the mares {{are used}} for foals and milking, they are not often used for work; this {{is the job of}} the geldings. Geldings rather than stallions are the {{preferred}} work animals. Members of the Darkhad ethnic group ride their stallions only once a year, on three special days during the winter. There are special horses within each herd used for <b>roping,</b> <b>racing,</b> beauty, or distance riding. A herdsman may own one or several herds of horses, each headed by its own stallion. [...] A newly wedded couple will be given a gift of horses by the parents on both the husband and wife's sides. Each family will give the couple 10 - 15 horses apiece and two stallions so that they can start up their own herd. The extra stallion is sold or traded away.|$|R

50|$|Barnfield No 6 Mill, {{designed}} by Bradshaw Gass & Hope {{was constructed in}} 1894. The brick-built mill was internally approximately 65 metres wide by 40 metres deep. It had ten bays with a large rectangular window in each bay. It was six storeys high with a water tower topped with a copper dome at its south west corner. The tower contained a tank for the mill's sprinkler system. Its roof had multiple ridges corresponding to the bays and was covered with slates. When built, No 6 Mill was {{at the leading edge}} of mill design, its concrete floors were supported by steel beams and the supporting cast iron columns were encased in concrete. The mill had a dust flue {{in the form of an}} Italianate tower incorporated in the <b>rope</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mills are {{constructed}} in brick with yellow brick decoration. Both mills are of five storeys over a basement and {{were built in}} the same style with wide segmentally arched windows and flat concrete roofs. They have a yellow brick eaves band and a stone dentilled cornice. Their projecting stair towers have Italianate details and balustraded parapets. The double engine house on the north-west side was built to power both mills. The <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> tower projects behind it. The mill chimney has been reduced in height but retains an emblem of a swan in white lettering. Its internal construction is of cast iron columns and brick arched ceilings. No.1 Mill is 25 bays wide and five deep with a single storey and basement extension to its north side, possibly a card room, but now used as a warehouse. No.2 Mill is 23 bays long and six deep. The mill's two-storey office block is attached next to the site entrance.|$|E
5000|$|Mills of {{this period}} were large, their {{decoration}} was lavish reflecting Edwardian taste and prosperity. Most mills were built for mules. Kent Mill Chadderton (1908) was a five storey, 11 bay mill, 84.6m x 43.9m. It had 90,000 spindles. Ring frames were smaller and heavier than mules so the mills were narrower with fewer storeys. Pear Mill Bredbury (1912) was planned to be a 210,000 spindle double mill. Only the first mill was completed, it had 137,000 spindles. They had more stair columns than earlier mills, it had dust flues often built into the <b>rope</b> <b>race.</b> There were two or three windows per bay. Decoration was often in terracotta and the mill name displayed in white brick on the stir tower or chimney. Stott and Sons employed Byzantine styling in Broadstone Mill, Reddish.Specialist architects built new mills and then created extensions. The last steam-powered mill, Elk Mill, was built by Arthur Turner ...|$|E

50|$|The episode {{starts with}} the two teams {{receiving}} a scroll telling them to choose two members from their team who they wish to eliminate. The Brats choose Kiri and Suzzana while the Om Blues decide on Samrat and Paulomee. But {{at the site of}} immunity task when Rannvijay asks the Om Blues, Palak nominates Dev and Tamanna. The task is a tight <b>rope</b> <b>race</b> in a Best-of-3 contest. Dev and Tamanna win the task and they get to choose two members from their team who will be voted against in the vote-out in addition to Kiri and Suzzana. At the vote-out Tamanna and Dev choose Palak and Samrat and in the vote-out Palak is eliminated. As the Om Blues were left with just five members and the Brats had seven, so to even it out one member of the Brats had to switch to the Om Blues. In the resulting vote Bobby, Kiri and Suzzana each get three votes and finally Om Blues choose Kiri to join them.|$|E

60|$|An immensely complex {{plan had}} {{suddenly}} flashed into Findlayson's mind. He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles--each rope {{a line of}} white fire. But there was one rope which was the master-rope. He could see that rope. If he could pull it once, it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guard-tower. But why, he wondered, was Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank? It was necessary to put the lascar aside, gently and slowly, because {{it was necessary to}} save the boats, and, further, to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult. And then--but it was of no conceivable importance--a wire <b>rope</b> <b>raced</b> through his hand burning it, the high bank disappeared, and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem. He was sitting in the rainy darkness--sitting in a boat that spun like a top, and Peroo was standing over him.|$|R

5000|$|Within the Natural Horsemanship movement, {{the phrases}} [...] "traditional" [...] or [...] "traditional methods" [...] {{generally}} refer to brutal methods of horse-breaking that trained horses by dominating {{the horse and}} breaking its spirit. [...] Some of these techniques are attributable to simple human failings such as ignorance or machismo. Others were derived from certain types of military training that insisted upon complete submission and learned helplessness from the horse, with misbehavior attributed to deliberate acts by the horse instead of a reaction to pain or fear of the handler.

40|$|Bone spavin is {{the most}} common hindlimb {{lameness}} diagnosed at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine and ranks second only to navicular syndrome (caudal heel pain) as the most common lameness diagnosis in the horse. Bone spavin is an osteoarthritis and periostitis that typically involves the tarsometatarsal, distal intertarsal, and occasionally the proximal intertarsal joints. 1, 2 Osteoarthritis is widely recognized as a significant source of lameness in all disciplines of horse use, 3 although the disease is more often associated with mature performance horses that practice jumping or western performance horses used for reining, <b>roping,</b> barrel <b>racing,</b> or cutting. The most common treatments are oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and intra-articular medications. Surgical therapies are typically reserved for horses that have become unresponsive to medical management. Recently devel-oped surgical techniques have increased the success of returning horses to their intended use after medical therapy is no longer efficacious.

However, unlike the <b>roping,</b> riding, and <b>racing,</b> this contest never attracted a following among Anglo cowboys or audiences. [...] It is however a favorite event included in the charreada, the style of rodeo which originated in the Mexican state of Jalisco. There would probably be no steer wrestling at all in American rodeo {{were it not for}} a black cowboy from Texas named Bill Pickett who devised his own unique method of bulldogging steers. He jumped from his horse to a steer’s back, bit its upper lip, and threw it to the ground by grabbing its horns.
