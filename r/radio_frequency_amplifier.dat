25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) signal {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak signal at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E

50|$|A {{preselector}} can be engineered so that {{in addition}} to attenuating interference from unwanted frequencies, it will limit input signal voltage to protect a sensitive receiver from damage caused by static discharge, nearby voltage spikes, and overload from nearby transmitters’ signals. It can also incorporate a small <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage to boost the filtered signal, although pre-amplification typically isn’t needed. None of these extra conveniences is a necessary part of preselection.|$|E

50|$|The Doherty {{amplifier}} is {{a modified}} class B <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> invented by William H. Doherty of Bell Telephone Laboratories Inc in 1936. In Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000 watt implementation, {{the driver was}} a complete 5,000 watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000 watt level to the required 50,000 watt level.|$|E
5000|$|The tuned radio {{frequency}} receiver (TRF) {{consists of a}} <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> having one or more stages all tuned to the desired reception frequency. This {{is followed by a}} detector, typically an envelope detector using a diode, followed by audio amplification. This was developed after the invention of the triode vacuum tube, greatly improving the reception of radio signals using electronic amplification which had not previously been available. The greatly improved selectivity of the superheterodyne receiver overtook the TRF design in almost all applications, however the TRF design was still used as late as the 1960s among the cheaper [...] "transistor radios" [...] of that era.|$|E
50|$|The {{noise figure}} {{can also be}} seen as the {{decrease}} in signal to noise ratio (SNR) caused by passing a signal through a system if the original signal had a noise temperature of 290 K. This is a common way of expressing the noise contributed by a <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> regardless of the amplifier's gain. For instance, assume an amplifier has a noise temperature 870 K and thus a noise figure of 6 dB. If that amplifier is used to amplify a source having a noise temperature of about room temperature (290 K), as many sources do, then the insertion of that amplifier would reduce the SNR of a signal by 6 dB. This simple relationship is frequently applicable where the source's noise is of thermal origin since a passive transducer will often have a noise temperature similar to 290 K.|$|E

50|$|Its {{internal}} {{construction is}} unlike other diodes {{in that it}} consists only of N-doped semiconductor material, whereas most diodes consist of both P and N-doped regions. It therefore does not conduct in only one direction and cannot rectify alternating current like other diodes, which is why some sources do not use the term diode but prefer TED. In the Gunn diode, three regions exist: two of those are heavily N-doped on each terminal, with {{a thin layer of}} lightly n-doped material between. When a voltage is applied to the device, the electrical gradient will be largest across the thin middle layer. If the voltage is increased, the current through the layer will first increase, but eventually, at higher field values, the conductive properties of the middle layer are altered, increasing its resistivity, and causing the current to fall. This means a Gunn diode has a region of negative differential resistance in its current-voltage characteristic curve, in which an increase of applied voltage, causes a decrease in current. This property allows it to amplify, functioning as a <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier,</b> or to become unstable and oscillate when it is biased with a DC voltage.|$|E

5000|$|Hazeltine's {{innovation}} was to add {{a circuit}} to each <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage which fed back {{a small amount of}} energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite phase to cancel ("neutralize") the feedback which was causing the oscillation. This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets. A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured [...] "Neutrodyne" [...] receivers throughout the 1920s. [...] At the time, RCA held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong regenerative and superheterodyne circuits. The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior superheterodyne the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each tuned amplifier stage had to be neutralized, adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the parasitic oscillations which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in North America.|$|E
