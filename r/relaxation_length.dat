40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{investigate}} electron spin relaxation in low-doped n-type GaAs semiconductor bulks {{driven by a}} static electric field. The electron dynamics is simulated by a Monte Carlo procedure which keeps into account all the possible scattering phenomena of the hot electrons in the medium and includes the evolution of spin polarization. Spin <b>relaxation</b> <b>lengths</b> are computed through the D’yakonov-Perel process, {{which is the only}} relevant relaxation mechanism in zinc-blende semiconductors. Since semiconductor based devices are always imbedded into a noisy environment that can strongly affect their performance, the decay of initial spin polarization of conduction electrons is calculated {{in the presence of a}} fluctuating component added to the static driving electric field. The starting point for our analysis is the computation of changes in the depolarization length caused by the addition of an external correlated noise source, at different values of field strength, lattice temperature, doping density, noise amplitude, noise correlation time, etc. Our findings show that, only for values of noise correlation time comparable to the dephasing time, <b>relaxation</b> <b>lengths</b> decrease with the increasing of noise intensity. Moreover, for each value of the noise amplitude, a nonmonotonic behavior of spin depolarization length with the noise correlation time is found. The presence of a minimum is well explained by studying the effective mean electric field experienced by the electrons ensemble within the relaxation time. Furthermore, our study reveals that the system receives a benefit in terms of weakening of the length reduction by the inclusion of the electron-electron scattering mechanism.

Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E
