40|$|Abstract Incidence {{rates for}} <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer,</b> which {{accounts}} for 85 % of kidney cancers, have been rising more rapidly among blacks than whites, almost entirely accounted for by an excess of localized disease. This excess {{dates back to the}} 1970 s, despite less access among blacks to imaging procedures in the past. In contrast, mortality rates for this cancer have been virtually identical among blacks and whites since the early 1990 s, despite the fact that nephrectomy rates, regardless of stage, are lower among blacks than among whites. These observations suggest that <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> may be a less aggressive tumor in blacks. We have reviewed the epidemiology of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer,</b> with emphasis on factors which may potentially {{play a role in the}} observed differences in incidence and mortality patterns of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> among blacks and whites. To date, the factors most consistently, albeit modestly, associated with increased <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> risk in epidemiologic studies among whites - obesity, hypertension, cigarette smoking - likely account for less than half of these cancers, and there is virtually no epidemiologic evidence in the literature pertaining to their association with <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> among blacks.

We investigated whether alcohol is associated with (epi) genetic changes of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer.</b> The Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) on Diet and Cancer started in 1986 (n = 120, 852) and uses the case-cohort method. After 11. 3 years of follow-up, 314 <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> cases and 4, 511 subcohort members were available for analysis.

In multivariate analysis, hazard ratios of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> for cohort members who consumed up to 5, 15, 30, and > or = 30 g of alcohol per day were 0. 72, 0. 64, 0. 81, and 0. 69, respectively, compared with nondrinkers [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) for the > or = 30 category, 0. 44 - 1. 07; P for trend, 0. 17].

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore how {{physical}} activity, obesity, weight change, and birth weight influence the risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer.</b> The relation between occupational physical activity and risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> was studied in a cohort of Swedish men and women identified in the nationwide censuses in 1960 and 1970, and followed for the occurrence of cancer by linkages to the Swedish Cancer Registry 1971 - 1989 (Paper I). We identified 2, 704 male and 587 female cases with {{the same level of}} occupational physical activity in 1960 and 1970 (n= 674, 025 men and 253, 336 women). In multivariate models, men with long-term sedentary jobs had a 25 % increased risk compared to men with physically demanding occupations. In contrast, we found no clear evidence of an association between occupational physical activity and <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> risk among women. The association between occupational and leisure time physical activity and <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> risk was further studied in a prospective cohort of 17, 241 Swedish twins (Paper II). Exposure information was obtained through a mailed questionnaire. During follow-up from 1967 through 1997 we identified 102 <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> cases. We found no evidence of a significant association between either occupational or leisure time physical activity and risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> in this cohort. To evaluate the existing evidence that obesity increases the risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> among both men and women, we conducted a quantitative summary analysis of published studies (Paper III). Fourteen studies on each sex assessed obesity as body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2), or equivalent, and were included in our analysis. In contrast to previous qualitative reviews, our quantitative summary showed that increased BMI is equally strongly associated with <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> risk among both men and women. The risk increased by 7 % per one unit of increase in BMI (1 kg/m 2, corresponding to about 3 kg body weight increase for a subject of average height). The relation between body size and <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> was evaluated in more detail in a population-based case-control study with 877 patients with newly diagnosed <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> and 1, 508 control subjects, frequency-matched by age (Paper IV). Exposure information was obtained through a mailed questionnaire. General and abdominal obesity (measured as BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, respectively) were independently associated with increased risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> among both men and women. Furthermore, tall height was associated with an increased risk among both sexes. Weight gain and repeated weight changes in adult life were associated with an increased risk, especially among those with a high BMI already at age 20. The relation between birth weight, a marker of fetal nutrition and growth, and <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> was evaluated in the case-control study described above (Paper V). A total of 648 cases and 900 control subjects reported their birth weight and were included in the analyses. An increased risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> was suggested among men with a high (> 3500 g) birth weight, compared to men with a birth weight between 3000 and 3499 g. We found no clear association among men with a low (< 3000 g) birth weight, or among women.

METHODS: From 1999 to 2003, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study in seven areas of the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Russia. A detailed occupational history was collected from <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> cases and controls, together with information on potential confounders.

RESULTS: A total of 992 histologically confirmed incident <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> cases and 1459 controls were included in the analysis. An increased risk of <b>renal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cancer</b> was observed for workers in agricultural labour and animal husbandry (OR 1. 43; 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 93), particularly among women employed as general farm workers (OR 2. 73; 95 % CI 1. 05 to 7. 13).
