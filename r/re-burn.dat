5000|$|This model {{separated}} the keyboard from another unit {{which could be}} placed under the monitor. Only the ADFS Version 2 filing system was supplied as standard, running via a Western Digital 1772 chip (a faster version of the widely used 1770), though {{it is possible to}} load a 1770 DFS ROM into sideways RAM, or to insert a ROM or EPROM containing it. The Compact also utilised a limited <b>re-burn</b> EEPROM, instead of the battery backed clock plus CMOS memory found in the other models, and hence had no real time clock of its own (the time could be fetched via Econet where available). As a result of this, the [...] and [...] commands returned dummy values.|$|E
50|$|A {{long-term}} {{agreement between}} Detroit Edison and Wayne allows landfill gas from Woodland Meadows Landfill to be collected, compressed, and sent through underground piping to the plant. The boilers burn {{a combination of}} natural gas and landfill gas to create steam {{for use in the}} plant., The landfill gas also powers three engine generators, which produce approximately 2.4 megawatts of electricity. The electricity is sent to Detroit Edison's grid system using a step-up transformer. Flaring of the landfill gas is minimized in turn reducing emissions from the landfill. Exhaust from the engines is recycled via ducts to the boilers' fireboxes; the combustion in the boilers acts as a <b>re-burn</b> cycle to further reduce the emissions from the engines. The 2 MMBTU per hour of recovered heat from the engines means less gas in the boilers, reducing energy consumption and emissions. The partnership of Ford and Detroit Edison gives the utility company an electricity source from garbage that displaces coal-fired power.|$|E
50|$|Cliff {{recalls that}} when the fire began to race along the treetops, {{all of them had}} reached the rockslide where he urged them to lie down in the crevices. However a burning snag fell on the rockslide and the crew {{continued}} running. Cliff attempted to stop Pop, pulling off his watch and ID tag as they grappled, but Pop knocked him into a crevice that protected Cliff from the worst of the fire. Ed furiously accuses Cliff of deserting his men and goes AWOL, parachuting from a private airplane onto Bugle Peak, where he finds Pop's identification bracelet on the ridge, not on the rockslide, where Cliff says he saw Pop last. Believing he has obtained proof that Cliff abandoned his men on the ridge, Ed returns to base, only to discover that Cliff and another team of men have been sent to fight a fire in Carson Canyon. Confronting Dick with the ID tag, Ed accuses Cliff of killing his father, and Dick fires him from the smokejumper unit for going AWOL on a personal grudge. In Carson Canyon, Cliff's crew brings the fire under control but weather conditions threaten a <b>re-burn,</b> prompting Cliff to request more men and equipment.|$|E
30|$|The {{few large}} <b>re-burns</b> likely play a {{different}} ecological role than small <b>re-burns</b> {{in spite of}} the fact that there are more of the latter. The juxtaposition of large <b>re-burned</b> areas with unburned, once-burned, and small <b>re-burned</b> areas may impact species diversity and ecosystem resilience (Buma and Wessman 2011, Dillon et al. 2011). Species diversity (both plant and animal) could be enhanced if there are a variety of vegetation types and age classes, as well as variations in patch size, shape, and distribution across the landscape. Potential ecological impacts of large <b>re-burns</b> likely differ based on the homogeneity and arrangement of burned areas on the landscape. This includes such things as the types and amount of vegetation that return following fires, and changes in site productivity for some time into the future. Areas that burn multiple times may serve to maintain a single species (which may be an undesirable species); for example, persistent grasslands or shrublands may be maintained on previously forested areas. Changes in landscape structure and function as a result of invasive species include altered fire cycles (Buma and Wessman 2011) and changes in site productivity (Harrod 2001). However, if large <b>re-burned</b> areas are set back successionally and regenerate with the native vegetation types that existed in those locations previously, then the result might be increased age class and structural diversity on the landscape, which may influence future fire spread and behavior.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to suggesting that large fires generally constrain {{the extent of}} subsequent fires, the occurrence of mostly small <b>re-burns</b> results in many small openings and gaps in both the understory and overstory that likely contribute to landscape evolution {{in a number of}} ways. Post-fire patches—including those that burn more than once—add diversity to the landscape, provide additional mechanisms for successional pathways to exist, and promote differential tree recruitment and plant establishment. <b>Re-burns</b> create patches in the vegetation mosaic by breaking up larger vegetation patches, thereby promoting structural diversity on the landscape with perhaps disproportionately large ecological impacts.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of electric diesel particulate trap (E-DPT) that has been proposed by the authors, behavior of trapping and re-burning of diesel soot was investigated using an electric diesel particulate trap {{with a pair of}} electro-plates (1 -channel E-DPT). The E-DPT was capable to trap soot by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. Experimental results showed that soot was accumulated on the electro-plates and some of soot deposits were like whiskers. Soot trapped on the plates formed bridge structures in narrow space between electro-plates and was ignited with Joule heat of electrification. When a soot bridge was <b>re-burned,</b> soot deposits on the plates near the bridge were also <b>re-burned.</b> After the re-burning, a new soot bridge was re-formed and above behaviors were automatically repeated...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} from the review that very limited experimental study has been conducted on using FB as <b>re-burn</b> fuel and there exists no model using FB as <b>re-burn</b> fuel. The objective of the current research {{is to develop a}} simplified numerical model for NOx reduction process with FB volatiles as the <b>re-burn</b> fuel and compare results with experimental data. In order to satisfy the objective, the proposed work has been divided into 4 tasks. (1) Modeling the combustion process involving the main fuel, ammonia mixture in the main burner. (2) Developing of a simple mixing model of main gases with reburn jet. (3) Selection of a suitable overall global mechanism of reactions for the <b>re-burn</b> fuels, coupling the reaction model with the mixing model and thereby developing the complete <b>re-burn</b> model. (4) Comparing the simulation results with the experimental results obtained from TAMU combustion facility...|$|E
30|$|The {{fact that}} the size of <b>re-burn</b> patches and the amount of <b>re-burn</b> in the Frank Church Wilderness Area was {{significantly}} smaller than expected based on random simulations provides additional support to the idea that older fires constrain the spread of newer fires by acting as barriers, or perhaps suggests that {{the size and shape of}} the study area and its fires predisposes the landscape to produce less <b>re-burn</b> than expected by chance. Certainly the abundance of small (40 ha to 121 ha) <b>re-burn</b> patches (versus randomized) can be explained by the propensity of shared edges to intertwine in nature in ways that cannot be duplicated in random redistributions of large fire polygons. Conversely, the results for the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area show that fires are generally smaller, and that the observed numbers and sizes of <b>re-burn</b> patches are nearly identical to what would be expected if fires were randomly distributed across the landscape. Local fire managers attribute the recent legacy of smaller fires to a relatively long history of fire use (G. Weldon, US Forest Service, personal communication), yet our data show that fires have interacted infrequently in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area in comparison with the other two wilderness areas. If previous fire is indeed constraining subsequent fire in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, we would expect to see fewer, smaller re-burns and less re-burned area than modeled, as was observed in the Frank Church Wilderness Area. An alternative explanation might be that the fires that are currently occurring in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area are constrained by older fire scars that are outside of the time period of this study and whose influence cannot be determined. This landscape may still be recovering from the fires in the early- to mid- 1900 s, when much of the area burned and re-burned, and the current fuels may not be predisposed to large fires. In any case, the fire interactions in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area are unexpectedly different in many ways from the Frank Church and Bob Marshall wilderness areas, and deserve further exploration.|$|E
30|$|In re-burned stands, more exposed {{surface area}} of decayed wood (from {{standing}} and down trees killed in the first fire) {{had the potential to}} increase charring levels. Certain size classes of WD were more prevalent in the <b>re-burn</b> (e.g., 100 h and 1000 h), and those present were likely to have shed bark and decayed significantly, two factors increasing the likelihood of wood charring. Indeed, black C generation and overestimation biases (11 % to 29 % for 1 h through 1000 h) were consistently higher in these stands (Table 2). Summed across all size classes, black C generation in the <b>re-burn</b> area (on down wood only) was estimated to be ∼ 655 kg ha− 1 —over twice that of single-burn stands.|$|E
30|$|In {{the face}} of the {{large-scale}} wildland fires of 2003, these preserved lands appear to have successfully maintained a consistent level of avifauna species diversity. San Diego County experienced a repeat of these large-scale fires in the fall of 2007. The Witch Creek, Poomacha, and Harris Fires, which burned or <b>re-burned</b> portions of the study sites described here, may warrant further study to build on the body of knowledge present herein.|$|R
50|$|One chief {{engineer}} supervised the boilers {{with two men}} directly under him. To control the boilers, there was the head operator who, from the control desks, controlled steam production, while the sub-head operator gave instructions {{from the top of}} the boiler. Regarding the coal burning, the operator controlled the combustion quality, while the stoker, from behind the boiler, pushed the unburnt coal to be <b>re-burned,</b> thereby clearing the combustion conveyor belt.|$|R
30|$|The {{locations}} and amounts of Total Available Edge that were encountered by subsequent fires were thus identified, resulting in polylines depicting the total Edge Encountered {{on an annual}} basis. These common boundaries were analyzed {{to determine how much}} of the previous fire edges were shared by subsequent fires (e.g., stopped the fire; Length Shared) versus how much was breached by subsequent fires (e.g., led to re-burns; Length Breached), regardless of the actual age of the perimeter. Finally, those areas in which the Edge Encountered polylines were overlapped by fire intersections (i.e., <b>re-burned</b> areas) were identified. These locations were attributed as Length Breached; locations at which the Edge Encountered polylines did not overlap with fire intersections represented Length Shared. Although the cumulative outer extent could span many years, with different segments of the perimeter being different ages, the different ages of the outer extent were not considered. The purpose of this exercise was to identify the locations of edges and <b>re-burns</b> and to quantify the Total Available Edge, the total Length Encountered, the total amount of previously created perimeter that stopped new fires, and the total amount of edge that was breached. Total length of Edge Encountered, Edge Shared, and Edge Breached were summarized for each study area by year and over the entire period.|$|R
30|$|The {{factors that}} govern whether fires <b>re-burn</b> on {{previously}} burned landscapes are complex, {{and controlled by}} interactions of topography, weather, and fuels. Given wildfire’s propensity to stop on topographic breaks such as ridgelines and drainages in the heavily dissected study areas, one would expect fire-on-fire interactions to occur most often in these places, {{especially in terms of}} shared edges. This assumption has not been tested for the study areas, although a qualitative assessment of fire perimeters in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area showed that about 30 % of shared fire edges could be explained by the presence of ridges, drainage bottoms, trails, roads, and water bodies (D. Yost, National Center for Landscape Fire Analysis, unpublished data). The relative impacts of fuel discontinuities and weather are unknown, but our data suggest that fire readily burns onto previously burned landscapes nearly 80 % of the time, although rarely covering large areas. The latter result, combined with the fact that observed areas of <b>re-burn</b> are lower than what are produced by random simulation in only one of the three study areas, suggests that fuels associated with previous burns often have a dampening effect on propagation of subsequent fires across much of the landscape. Additionally, the largest and most frequent incursions of fire-on-fire occur in large fire years, suggesting that climate and weather can override fuels in the <b>re-burn</b> phenomenon.|$|E
30|$|Our {{research}} {{provides a}} systematic assessment of fire-on-fire interactions in three large wilderness {{areas of the}} northern Rocky Mountains. As such, it represents a perspective for exploring one aspect of fire regime characteristics by describing the interactions of older fires with subsequent fires using consistent data, criteria, and definitions. We explicitly quantify edge effects, the relationships of edges with re-burns, and <b>re-burn</b> characteristics. The results show {{a high degree of}} complexity in the fire-on-fire interactions of large wildfires.|$|E
30|$|If {{the goal}} is to {{maintain}} surface fuels below pre-treatment levels, managers may need to treat mixed conifer areas again in about ten years. Waiting longer, however, may not mean that surface fuels will accumulate greatly over pre-fire levels (Figures 7 and 8). Continued monitoring of fuels will help to inform managers about the most favorable time to <b>re-burn</b> these areas. In addition to reducing surface fuel loads, burning to maintain ecosystem functions is also important, therefore, waiting too long between treatments could have consequences for other aspects of the ecosystems.|$|E
30|$|All {{research}} plots were <b>re-burned</b> in 1972 in a 26 -ha prescribed fire but {{fuels and}} vegetation were not re-measured following the prescribed fire. The research plots were re-measured in 2003 using a modified planar intercept method following Brown (1974, 1982) for woody fuels and depth measurements for litter and duff (National Park Service 2003). Litter and duff depths recorded 31 years post-fire were converted into fuel loads using relationships established by van Wagtendonk et al. (1998). Rotten logs were not sampled in 1971, and therefore, were {{separated from the}} other fuel components in the 2003 data to allow for more direct comparison with the earlier data.|$|R
30|$|The rate {{at which}} fuels {{accumulate}} is one determinant of fire regimes, specifically fire return intervals, and of the natural range of variability in fuels loads (van Wagtendonk and Sydoriak 1987). For example, ponderosa pine, which has {{a high rate of}} flammable litter fuel accumulation, sustains frequent fires, while white fir, with a lower accumulation rate, burns less frequently. Given the same lightning ignition and fire weather patterns, the two species produce different fire regimes. Fire managers need to know when an area is ready to be <b>re-burned</b> with a prescribed fire in order to accomplish the task of simulating natural processes and managing wildlands consistent with ecological principles.|$|R
40|$|A {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a laboratory scale controlled-air incinerator in to observe the effect of secondary combustion air temperature to secondary burner operation and its fuel consumption. Sawdust was partially burned in a primary combustion chamber while feeding with primary air at 30 % of stoichiometric condition. An incomplete product of combustion flowed into the secondary combustion chamber to be <b>re-burned</b> with preheated secondary combustion air. It was discovered that increased secondary combustion air temperature affected {{the characteristics of the}} operation of the secondary burner and reduced its fuel consumption to a factor of 7. 7 and 22. 9 % at a preheated secondary combustion air temperature of 500 oC and 1000 oC, respectively...|$|R
30|$|Re-burned {{areas were}} {{classified}} by size thresholds based on standard fire size classes used by fire management {{and policy makers}} (NWCG 2006). Using standard fire size classes for reporting units facilitates easy comprehension of results by fire managers already accustomed to these units. Three size classes were used: 40 ha to 121 ha (NWCG Class D), 121 ha to 405 ha (NWCG Class E), and > 405 ha (NWCG classes F and G, combined). Time-since-previous-fire (TSPF) was calculated by subtracting {{the year of the}} first fire from the year of the subsequent fire in order to assess relationships between TSPF and <b>re-burn</b> sizes.|$|E
30|$|Minnich and Chou (1997) {{suggest that}} the {{systematic}} suppression of ignitions promoted the landscape-scale fire events that plague twentieth century southern California. They contend that fire suppression has increased fuel continuity by deferring the combustion of chaparral vegetation patches relative to local thresholds of fuel accumulation. This, in turn, has selected for escaped fires in mature patches to coincide with extreme wind events, which create conditions that are unmanageable from a fire suppression standpoint. The current fire regime of rapid fire spread and extensive patch <b>re-burn</b> is, therefore, interpreted to be a product of these management actions (Minnich and Chou 1997).|$|E
40|$|The {{infrequent}} {{occurrence of}} large wildfires {{in the southern}} Appalachian Mountains {{over the last several}} decades has offered few opportunities to study the impacts of these types of disturbances. As a result, relatively little is known about how heterogeneity in topography, vegetation, and recent disturbance history interact to influence patterns of fire severity across the landscape. Since 2000, five separate wildfires burned {{a large portion of the}} area in, and surrounding the Linville Gorge Wilderness in western North Carolina, two burned the same area a second time. Burn severity and vegetative recovery were measured in 152 plots established in 1992 prior to any wildfires. Field measurements of severity were strongly related to GIS data, allowing an accurate map of severity conditions in all 5 burned landscapes. Severity followed similar patterns at all fires. The most severely-burned areas were on the higher elevations, probably ridges, on slopes of moderate steepness, and facing to the south, southwest, west, or northwest. The effects of 1 burn vs. 2 burns were more pronounced in dry-site than in moist-site communities. Shrub and tree cover decreased at all levels of <b>re-burn</b> severity. Herb richness and total richness were highest in the highest level of <b>re-burn</b> severity. Significant changes (increases) in species richness occurred only at scales 3 ̆c 1 m 2, which is likely a reflection of large-scale community heterogeneity and/or heterogeneous patterns of burn severity. Woody plant community assembly was not substantially affected by burning, nor did burning appear to promote exotic plant invasion. Our measurements and maps of fire severity will help managers to better understand vegetative response to wildfire across widely diverse topographic and severity conditions...|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} though difficult to retrofit a catalytic converter to older stoves models, and retrofits rarely perform well. However, a drawback with catalytic converters is that (as when fitted to automobiles) {{they have a}} limited life before needing to be replaced, although new catalysts often last 5 - 10 years. More modern wood stoves are designed from the outset with an integral secondary combustion chamber. This mixes exhaust gases (smoke and particulates) with preheated fresh air and thus <b>re-burns</b> otherwise wasted fuel. The end result is similar, with much reduced emissions and increased fuel efficiency; stoves utilizing this design are often marketed as clean-burning stoves and exempted from smoke control regulations.|$|R
30|$|The {{existence}} of fires {{after the turn}} of the century is unique for fire history reconstructions in the Sierra Nevada and allows for comparison with the fire atlas (Figure 6). Although samples were not specifically collected to calibrate the fire atlas, Clusters 1, 2, and 5 were within the boundaries of mapped fires. Cluster 1 was within the perimeter of two fires; the first fire occurred in 1914 and then was subsequently <b>re-burned</b> in 1960. Nine out of the 11 samples recorded the 1914 fire but none recorded the 1960 fire. Cluster 2 was within the boundary of a 1926 fire with two samples recording the event. Cluster 5 was also within the 1960 fire, and three out of the five samples recorded this event. The fact that not all samples recorded the fires in the atlas can be testament to the patchy mosaic of fire in this ecosystem. Beaty and Taylor (2007) found that fire propagation and spread in the Lake Tahoe Basin was dictated more by the spatial pattern of fuels (abundance, pattern, and forest structure) rather than strictly by forest structure.|$|R
40|$|These {{comments}} are submitted {{on behalf of}} Sierra Forest Legacy and ten other conservation organizations. We have reviewed the scoping notice and accompanying maps. Below we identify {{a number of issues}} and concerns about the proposed action. We ask that you address these in the draft environmental impact statement for the Rim Fire Recovery project. I. Overview The Rim Fire was an extraordinary event that occurred over several weeks beginning in August 2013. Ultimately, the fire area encompassed over 257, 000 acres of public and private land and spanned elevations ranging from 1, 900 feet to over 7, 300 feet. A wide range of plant communities and wildlife habitats were affected by the wildfire and the fire effects on these resources were highly variable. A significant portion of the fire area had been burned and <b>re-burned</b> within the past 30 years with substantial areas on national forest and private lands being planted and re-planted with tree farms. The Rim Fire itself was a combination of unintentionally lit wildfire and intentionally lit fire intended to control the approaching wildfire. Because of this variability in the project landscape, the post-wildfire landscape presents a variety of challenges and opportunities...|$|R
30|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to assess the cumulative impacts of small fires on the <b>re-burn</b> phenomenon, given quality concerns with fire atlas perimeter data, we observed 101 instances in which small fires may have been constrained by large fires, and another 316 instances in which large fires burned around or through small fires. With the addition of small fires, the total area re-burned in the study areas increased by 0 %, 0.3 %, and 0.6 % in the Bob Marshall, Selway-Bitterroot, and Frank Church wilderness areas, respectively. In the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, the rate of re-burning increased from 7 ha per 100 ha burned to 8 ha per 100 ha burned; the rate remained unchanged in the other two wilderness areas.|$|E
30|$|As the {{dependent}} variable in our conceptual model, we use the cumulative area burned on the landscape over fire season (Figure 6). This is important because for almost all Canadian ecozones, vegetation burned {{early in the year}} is unlikely to <b>re-burn</b> later in the year, and forested vegetation types will sometimes not <b>re-burn</b> for several years (Lavoie and Alexander 2004). Cultural fires most commonly occur during two seasonal pulses—early and late in the fire season when vegetation is cured, ignition is easy, and fires have relatively low rates of spread and flame lengths (Lewis and Fergusson 1988, Boyd 1998, Kasischke and Turetsky 2006, Pyne 2007, Farukh et al. 2009; Figure 6 a, b). During years of moderate fire danger (Figure 6 a), the early season ignitions burn dormant vegetation on moist soils, smolder lightly, and usually go out over night as the relative humidity rises, or in a few days as vegetation greens up (Lewis 1980). In contrast, in dry years when soils have low moisture content or when spring rains do not occur, these early season burns can persist (Anderson 2010) and begin to spread (Figure 6 b), possibly well in advance of the lightning season (Granström and Niklasson 2008, Farukh et al. 2009). Significantly, these fires would then be active during the spring foliar moisture dip when conifer needles are highly flammable (Van Wagner 1977) and may thus burn large areas of conifer forests. Further, in dry years, existing spring-season or new cultural ignitions could continue into the summer (Figure 6 b), resulting in fires additional to those ignited by lightning, occurring during the main period of seasonal drought (Farukh et al. 2009). However, where cultural fire is uncommon, or is easily contained in moderate fire danger years, the area burned is less but occurs during a major pulse during summer when lightning occurs (Figure 6 d).|$|E
30|$|Although it {{is common}} for a new fire to breach an edge and <b>re-burn,</b> large fires that occur {{completely}} within previously burned areas are rare. Only one instance was observed in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area, and two instances in the Frank Church Wilderness Area (of which only one was during a large fire year). There were also three instances in the Frank Church Wilderness Area in which more than 95 % of a subsequent fire occurred within a previously burned area, although the data did not indicate whether these fires started outside of the previous fire and spread into it, or whether they started within the previous fire and spread out of it. None of these re-burns occurred in the same year as the first fire, and the TSPF ranged between 2 years and 13 years.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{distribution}} and relative abundance of snowshoe hares in Glacier National Park (Glacier NP), Montana, USA, where fires are common and tend to cluster in time because of regional climatic drivers (Morgan et al. 2008). Like Yellowstone National Park, both 1988 and 2003 were large fire years in Glacier NP; in 2003, the largest fire year for Glacier NP since 1910, approximately 13 % (55 000 ha) of the park’s more than 410 000 ha burned in wildfires. Over the past century, memorable fire years have occurred at an average frequency of 15.5 years. The majority of wildfires are stand-replacing fires on the park’s west side. Fires {{on the east side}} of the park are both rarer (due to forest type and spatial configuration) and more actively managed to avoid fires burning into nearby human communities. Our research focused on hare use of the 1988 Red Bench Fire, which burned over 13 000 ha of primarily lodgepole pine forest in the park’s northwest corner, and on the 1994 Adair and Howling fires, which burned 340 ha along the park’s western edge (an additional 3000 ha that burned in these fires were <b>re-burned</b> in 2001 and 2003, so were excluded from our study).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} used {{overlapping}} burn scars from natural wildfires {{to examine the}} effects of changes in the fire-free interval on early successional plant communities in boreal forests of centralYukon Territory, Canada. Data on plant community composition and residual organic material were collected in the first decade of post-fire regeneration in two study areas with recent fire overlap. Sites with a shorter fire-free interval had reduced loads of deadwood and shallower organic layers after the most recent fire. Multivariate analysis of species cover indicated that sites in and out of the burn overlap zones also supported distinct plant communities. Differences in the plant communities were associated with a greater abundance of woody deciduous species, such as Populus tremuloides, Salix spp., and Shepherdia canadensis, at sites that had recently <b>re-burned.</b> Sites that burned after a longer interval had higher moss cover and greater abundance of Picea mariana, Calamagrostis canadensis, and Ribes glandulosum in one study area, and Epilobium angustifolium in the second area. Ordinations of species cover indicated that plant community patterns were most strongly associated with gradients related to fire history and topography. In general, shorter fire-free intervals reduced pools of residual plant material and favored dominance of resprouting, woody deciduous species...|$|R
30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{considerations}} that may offer insight into our results. First, MTBS perimeter data alone may not be sufficient for fully enumerating fire-on-fire interactions. The inclusive dates of the MTBS dataset span only a portion of the fire rotation and thus provide a short period of record and an incomplete picture of fire-on-fire interactions, especially for areas that typically have long fire rotations. Second, the MTBS project only maps large wildfires (i.e., greater than 405 ha). In {{spite of the fact that}} a few large fires contribute the majority of the total area burned, perhaps smaller fires (those less than 405 ha) or older ones are inordinately important in governing fire-on-fire interactions. The use of additional data sources such as historical fire atlases, which span longer time periods and include more small fires, may help to explain and corroborate the findings of this research, although the analyses of the Gibson (2005) fire atlas in this study did not suggest that small fires are influential in terms of stopping fires or in terms of area burned and <b>re-burned</b> (at least for the same 24 year time period). Third, this research only used vector-based data, but raster data characterizing fire severity, topography or vegetation type, amount, and arrangements could offer insights into these results (e.g., see van Wagtendonk et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|In autumn (April) 2005, {{some three}} years after the {{prescribed}} fire and two years after the wildfire, fire was again introduced to London Forest. This was performed in two ways: (1) on the ground using drip torches to light {{around the edge of the}} forest to aid burn security and to attempt to <b>re-burn</b> the young B. quercifolia study population that had regenerated following the 2003 wildfire, and (2) by dropping aerial incendiaries on a grid pattern within the forest. As expected, given the young fuel age and the mild weather conditions, there was little ignition and sustained fire spread, with only the most flammable parts of the landscape re-burning (Table 1). Despite attempts to burn the recently regenerated B. quercifolia population using a drip torch, the mild conditions and the sparsity of fuel resulted in the population not burning.|$|E
30|$|The severities of an {{original}} fire and a subsequent fire were examined {{by looking at}} the agreement for each of the five severity classes: high, moderate-high, moderate-low, low, and unburned. In this context, agreement indicates what percentage of the twice-burned area showed the same severity on both first and second entry. The similarity in subsequent severities can be attributed to a combination of chance, the proportions of area in each severity class, and the spatial allocation of the areas that burned with the same severity. The difference in subsequent severities {{can be attributed to the}} difference in area in each severity class on first and second entry, and to the different spatial arrangement of these severity classes. Because all severity <b>re-burn</b> data for the study period were used, the matrix is unbiased (Pontius and Millones 2011).|$|E
30|$|Notably, fires {{less than}} 405 ha are not {{included}} in the MTBS dataset, which has the potential to censor <b>re-burn</b> and fire size distributions. To address this concern, the MTBS analysis was supplemented with data from a regional fire atlas compiled by Gibson (2005), which was further updated with fire perimeters through 2007 obtained by data-mining regional fire records. This atlas includes fires of all sizes, and was used to examine whether small fires interacted with large fires (and vice versa). Because the perimeters of small fires are not derived systematically and are known to contain errors (Morgan et al. 2001, Lentile et al. 2006), the fire atlas was used only to examine the spatial coincidence of small fires with larger ones, in order to assess the likelihood that small fires have influenced the sizes and shapes of other fires. The results from this analysis are presented in a separate section from the MTBS-based analysis.|$|E
30|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence of limitations {{in the capacity}} of ponderosa pine forests to regenerate following large high-severity (i.e., tree-killing) fires in combination with drought conditions in a warmer climate (Bonnet et al. 2005, Lentile et al. 2007, Keyser et al. 2008, Moser et al. 2010, Puhlick et al. 2012, Feddema et al. 2013, Collins and Roller 2013, Savage et al. 2013, Rother et al. 2015, Chambers et al. 2016, Owen et al. 2017). Severely burned patches are often warmer and drier than adjacent landscape patches with intact forest canopy (Meyer et al. 2001). For some burned areas, post-fire regeneration has been observed in areas with mature forest canopy, while seedling regeneration was absent or drastically reduced in areas that burned at high severity, presumably because of warmer and drier conditions in the severely burned areas (Lentile et al. 2005, Crotteau et al. 2013). Open areas created by high-severity forest fire and drought are often colonized by, and can become dominated by, drought-tolerant species of shrubs or grasses (Barton 2002, Savage and Mast 2005, Foxx et al. 2013, Abella and Fornwalt 2015, Guiterman et al. 2017, Barton and Poulos 2018). Areas of hyper-dense conifer regeneration also have been documented post fire in the US Southwest, but such regeneration can be especially susceptible to substantial mortality during <b>re-burns</b> (Savage and Mast 2005).|$|R
30|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} of fire severity patches across a landscape is of critical importance to managers and researchers. Of particular interest are those areas that burn multiple times. Understanding the complexity of these “multiple entry, mixed severity” patches {{is an important component}} of managing the landscape. We investigated the role that initial fire severity might play on subsequent fire severity (for a given <b>re-burned</b> area) to assess whether high severity patch distribution was impacted by initial burn conditions. In our study area, the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA, the fire severity patch distribution of one fire had little influence on the fire severity distribution of a subsequent fire and second entry severity patches were distributed on top of the first entry severity patches in a close to random distribution. Of all areas that burned twice between 2000 and 2011 on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, 48 % burned with equal severity, 26 % burned with a lower severity, and 26 % burned with a higher severity in the second fire. The majority of the agreement can be attributed to a similarity in the proportions of each severity class and not to a match in the spatial allocation of the equal severity patches on first and second entry fires. The distribution of high severity patches showed little change when comparing post-first entry and post-second entry distributions. The mean and the standard deviation of the high severity patch size did not change after a second fire entry. The total area of high severity did increase; this was due to both the addition of new patches as well the growth of existing patches. These findings can help to inform land managers about the roles that fire-on-fire events play on the landscape and how those interactions may impact management goals and decisions.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from March 26, 2017 - September 26, 2017 Historically fire has been the primary disturbance factor in the sagebrush-steppe. The settlement of the West by Euro-Americans, grazing by domestic livestock, and the concomitant spread of invasive species have altered the historical fire regime. Understanding the long-term vegetation structure and fuel succession of the various sagebrush-dominated communities of this biome is important for managing the landscape {{in a way that}} will facilitate the complicated life histories of wildlife species of concern. The objectives of this study were to address the following current knowledge gaps: a lack of studies examining long-term post-fire fuel succession, a lack of studies that address repeated burns, and a lack of studies in basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata) and low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula). 	To assess long-term fuels succession, the effects of repeated burns, and basin big and low sagebrush fuel structures, I conducted 2 different studies. I resampled previous fire effects studies where pre-fire and immediate post fire fuels data existed at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (HMNAR), John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Sheep Rock Unit (JODA), and on Prineville BLM land adjacent to Bear Creek (BEAR). Two of these studies were conducted in basin big sagebrush communities (JODA, BEAR), and one of these studies had <b>re-burned</b> since the study’s inception (JODA). The studies were designed so that fuel loads could be statistically tested and compared to their corresponding past studies. Fuels were first stratified into overstory and understory fuels. Overstory fuels consisted of all living and dead shrubs. Understory fuels consisted of downed wood (DWD); duff and shrub-related litter, bryophitic materials; and herbaceous fuels. Herbaceous fuels where then further divided into living grasses and forbs, standing dead grasses and forbs, and detached grass and forb litter. In Wyoming big sagebrush communities at HMNAR that are now seventeen years post fire (YPF), overstory fuels only recovered to 13...|$|R
