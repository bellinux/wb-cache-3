40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the Rieger periodicity of approximately 153 days {{is part of a}} complex of periodicities, all multiples of a basic period of approximately 25. 5 days. However, it has not been clear why the sixth subharmonic of this periodicity should be preferentially manifested. We here note that if the Sun contains two <b>rotating</b> <b>elements,</b> with different periods and different axes, a special situation will arise if the two periods have a lowest common multiple, for in this case the relative configuration of the two rotators would repeat exactly at that (LCM) period.

40|$|Unbalance {{effect on}} <b>rotating</b> <b>element</b> is a {{condition}} resulted from an off centered mass concentration about a rotor s rotating centerline which will then generate centrifugal forces with increasing running speeds. This phenomenon will bring about excessive noise and vibration which in turn causing damages to the <b>rotating</b> <b>elements</b> and its support mechanism. To overcome this problem, a correction is required so as to minimize the excessive vibration as low as possible. In this study, unbalance problems including single and two-plane balancing are studied extensively by using theoretical influence coefficient method followed by the experimental verifications. Experimental procedure is performed by using trial mass to calculate the influence coefficient and the corrected mass values {{as well as the}} phase angles. The studies cover the static and dynamics balancing for the single plane and two-plane balancing respectively. Finally, the vibration reduction of the rotor is compared theoretically and experimentally. Based on the results, the improved vibration reduction could be obtained reasonably for both single and two-plane balancing by using influence coefficient method...|$|R
