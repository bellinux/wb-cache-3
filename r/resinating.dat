40|$|Rosin is {{a natural}} product from pine forests and it {{is used as a}} raw {{material}} in <b>resinate</b> syntheses. <b>Resinates</b> are polyvalent metal salts of rosin acids and especially Ca- and Ca/Mg- <b>resinates</b> find wide application in the printing ink industry. In this thesis, analytical methods were applied to increase general knowledge of <b>resinate</b> chemistry and the reaction kinetics was studied in order to model the non linear solution viscosity increase during <b>resinate</b> syntheses by the fusion method. Solution viscosity in toluene is an important quality factor for <b>resinates</b> to be used in printing inks. The concept of critical <b>resinate</b> concentration, c crit, was introduced to define an abrupt change in viscosity dependence on <b>resinate</b> concentration in the solution. The concept was then used to explain the non-inear solution viscosity increase during <b>resinate</b> syntheses. A semi empirical model with two estimated parameters was derived for the viscosity increase on the basis of apparent reaction kinetics. The model was used to control the viscosity and to predict the total reaction time of the <b>resinate</b> process. The kinetic data from the complex reaction media was obtained by acid value titration and by FTIR spectroscopic analyses using a conventional calibration method to measure the <b>resinate</b> concentration and the concentration of free rosin acids. A multivariate calibration method was successfully applied to make partial least square (PLS) models for monitoring acid value and solution viscosity in both mid-infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) regions during the syntheses. The calibration models can be used for on line <b>resinate</b> process monitoring. In kinetic studies, two main reaction steps were observed during the syntheses. First a fast irreversible resination reaction occurs at 235 °C and then a slow thermal decarboxylation of rosin acids starts to take place at 265 °C. Rosin oil is formed during the decarboxylation reaction step causing significant mass loss as the rosin oil evaporates from the system while the viscosity increases to the target level. The mass balance of the syntheses was determined based on the <b>resinate</b> concentration increase during the decarboxylation reaction step. A mechanistic study of the decarboxylation reaction was based on the observation that <b>resinate</b> molecules are partly solvated by rosin acids during the syntheses. Different decarboxylation mechanisms were proposed for the free and solvating rosin acids. The deduced kinetic model supported the analytical data of the syntheses in a wide <b>resinate</b> concentration region, over a wide range of viscosity values and at different reaction temperatures. In addition, the application of the kinetic model to the modified <b>resinate</b> syntheses gave a good fit. A novel synthesis method with the addition of decarboxylated rosin (i. e. rosin oil) to the reaction mixture was introduced. The conversion of rosin acid to <b>resinate</b> was increased to the level necessary to obtain the target viscosity for the product at 235 °C. Due to a lower reaction temperature than in traditional fusion synthesis at 265 °C, thermal decarboxylation is avoided. As a consequence, the mass yield of the <b>resinate</b> syntheses can be increased from ca. 70 % to almost 100 % by recycling the added rosin oil...|$|R

The tablets consisted of the DMP <b>resinates</b> and direct compression fillers, such as microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP), and spray-dried rice starch (SDRS). Physical properties of tablets, such as hardness, disintegration time, and in vitro release, were investigated. A good performance of the tablets was obtained when MCC or SDRS was used. The use of rod-like and plate-like particles of Amberlite IRP 69 caused a statistical decrease in tablet hardness, whereas good tablet hardness was obtained when spherical particle of Dowex 50 W was used. The plastic deformation of the fillers, such as MCC and SDRS, caused a little change in the release of DMP. A higher release rate constant was found in the tablets containing DCP and Dowex 50 W, indicating the fracture of the <b>resinates</b> under compression, which was attributable to the fragmentation of DCP. However, the release of DMP from the tablets using Amberlite IRP 69 was not significantly changed because of the higher degree of cross-linking of the <b>resinates,</b> which exhibited more resistance to deformation under compression.

Drug <b>resinates</b> in 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 4 weight ratios were prepared by simple batch operation and subsequently studied for drug content, residual solvent content, molecular interactions, solid state characterisation and solubility characteristics. During initial characterisation, all the proportions of drug <b>resinates,</b> except 1 : 1 proportion showed partial amorphisation of the drug, whereas 1 : 1 proportion showed complete amorphisation of the drug. This proportion reported distinctly enhanced solubility characteristics over pure drug and other proportions. Such amorphisation and solubility enhancement could be attributed to the binding of individual drug molecules to the functional sites of the resin molecules, either partially or completely, resulting in reduction of crystal lattice energy, a main barrier to dissolution. Hydrophilic nature of ion exchange resin matrices also assisted in enhancing dissolution of the drug from the <b>resinates.</b> During accelerated stability study, there was an insignificant decrease in solubility characteristics of the drug and its amorphous form was also found to be stable in 1 : 1 proportion.

Phenylephrine HCl was complexed with cationic resin that is Amberlite IR- 120 and then coated with ethylcellulose to obtain microencapsulated <b>resinate</b> which will be having a release profile up to 24 hours. Chitosan coating was further given to microcapsulated <b>resinate</b> to increase the transit time of the dosage form in the GIT. The optimized formulation was achieved with the ratio 1 : 2. 5 of drug-resin complex and coat/core ratio of 1 : 2 having 6 % w/v ethylcellulose. The bioadhesive coating of chitosan was found to be optimum with 1 % w/v concentration...|$|R

Some of them, such as verdigris and copper <b>resinate,</b> were widely used in easel paintings from the 15 th to 17 th centuries, for their transparency, brilliance and pure green tones. However these pigments often undergo chromatic modifications, like browning or darkening. This phenomenon is not systematic, and altered and non-altered areas can coexist in a same painting. The understanding of the darkening process is crucial for conservation issues, to improve the readability of degraded paintings and decide how to treat them...|$|R
