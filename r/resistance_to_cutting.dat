40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a number of physical and chemical attributes upon muskmelon texture as described by sensory evaluation. Measurements of turgor pressure, percent moisture, total sugars, alcohol-insoluble-solids, three pectic fractions, total pectic materials, starch and cellulose were performed on 50 melons. The melons were purchased at random from a retail market in Corvallis, Oregon, over a five-week period during July and August, 1966. Subjective evaluation of textural quality was provided by a five-membered panel employing a pre-tested ballot. On five-point scales, judges rated <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting,</b> resistance to biting, resistance to crushing, crispness, fibrousness and sweetness. Simple and multiple correlation analyses were performed to elucidate relationships between the objective and subjective observations. Considerable variation was found among melons for most of the attributes. Variation was largest in the case of water-soluble pectic substances and cellulose and least for alcohol-insoluble-solids. According to the results of this study, melon texture is determined to a great extent by the type and amount of cell wall constituents. Significant multiple correlations were found between cell wall constituents, cellulose and protopectin, and sensory panel scores for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting,</b> resistance to biting, resistance to crushing and crispness. Fruit maturity, as inferred from starch and protopectin content, also exerted an effect upon texture. Significant multiple correlations were found between starch and protopectin and panel scores for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting,</b> resistance to crushing and crispness. Although not specifically related to texture, a significant and positive simple correlation was found between total sugars and sweetness. Similarly, significant negative correlations were found between starch and total sugars and starch and sweetness. Turgor pressure, percent moisture, alcohol-insoluble-solids, total sugar, water-soluble pectic substances, pectates-pectinates and total pectic materials were found not to be reliable indicators of muskmelon texture. Although turgor pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship to any textural aspects, a trend was observed in the data. As a result of this observation and difficulty encountered in measuring turgor pressure, further work with this variable is recommended. Proximate composition of the melons analyzed compared favorably with published data. This observation lends confidence to the methods and analyses employed. Large standard deviations calculated for some of the attributes measured emphasize the extent of variation among melons, the difficulty in assessing texture in an objective manner and the problem encountered in marketing and purchasing the fresh fruit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} wear rate with respect <b>to</b> height of <b>cutting</b> tool on components of <b>resistance</b> force <b>to</b> <b>cutting</b> during ripping of congealed materials. An urgency of this scientific work is substantiated, based on overviewed studies into the processes of cutting and ripping of different congealed materials. It is found that the wear rate of multiblade tool substantially increases the consumed power of technological machines, energy capacity and cost of technological processes of cutting and ripping the congealed media. Therefore, to reduce the energy expenses of technological machines, energy capacity and costs of technological processes of cutting and ripping the congealed media, {{it is necessary to}} create a method for calculating limiting loads on multiblade cutting tools and determine tool life until limiting wear, as applied to exploiting the drilling-ripping machines, designed for ripping the congealed coal in winter period. Trigonometric transforms were used to derive formulas for calculating the constituent <b>resistance</b> forces <b>to</b> <b>cutting,</b> which act on the wear area of cutting tool and on leading surface of cutting.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research to develop preliminary engineering data necessary if the cobalt-rich manganese crusts {{that occur in}} the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Hawaiian Archipelago are to be mined. The research was divided into the following sections: (1) physical, mineralogical, and chemical descriptions; (2) mechanical property testing, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, and a rippability index; and (3) mechanical cutting characteristics, including average and peak cutter forces, the specific energy, and cuttings size distribution. Section 1 utilized microscope, X-ray powder diffractometer, and electron microprobe analyses. Section 2 utilized standard mechanical property testing techniques. Section 3 utilized a converted planer mill with full-size coal cutters to fragment the crust and substrate samples. The manganese crust samples were mainly manganese and iron oxides and hydroxides with an average cobalt content of 1 pct and had a nucleus or substrate of rock or sediment. The significant results shown by the mechanical property and cutting tests are that the crust and all but two types of substrates (basalt and trachyte) are weak materials and easily cut with standard drag cutters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the effect of tool rake angle in single point diamond turning (SPDT) of silicon using experimental and simulation methods. Machining trials under the same cutting conditions were carried out using three different rake angle tools. In order to delve further into the rake angle effect on the output parameters including material removal, stresses, and crack formation, at the onset of chip formation and steady-state conditions, a simulation study using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach was performed. The simulations results were incorporated and found in good agreement with experimental observations. The results indicate that diamond tool wear rate and surface generation mechanism significantly vary using different rake angle tools. The continuance of compressive and shear deformation sequence at the chip incipient stage governs the high-pressure phase transformation (HPPT) as a function of rake angle and tool wear. The capability of diamond tool to maintain this sequence and required hydrostatic pressure under worn conditions is highly influenced by a change in rake angle. The proportional relationship of cutting forces magnitude and tool wear also differs owing to disparate wear pattern which influence distribution of stresses and uniform hydrostatic pressure under the tool cutting edge. This subsequently influences structural phase transformation and therefore frictional <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting.</b> Mainly frictional groove wear was found dominant for all diamond tools in machining of silicon...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{material}} behaviour during nanoscale machining {{is critical}} for improving machining efficiency. This paper investigates the benefits of using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation in studying the effects of machining parameters in nanometric machining of copper workpiece with a diamond tool. The material behaviour under multi cutting pass conditions was examined. The copper-copper interactions were modelled by the EAM potential and the copper-diamond interactions were modelled by the Morse potential. The diamond tool was modelled as a deformable body and the Tersoff potential was applied for the carbon-carbon interactions. It was observed that the average tangential and normal components of the cutting forces increase with increase in depth of cut and they reduced in consecutive cutting passes for each depth of cut. The ratios of the tangential to the normal force components decreases as the depth of cut increases, but remain constant after the depth of cut 1. 5 nm. The magnitudes of the cutting forces decrease from pass 1 to pass 2, but they are identical for both pass 2 and pass 3. The least <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting</b> was observed at 2. 0 nm, which may indicate {{the existence of a}} critical depth of cut in nanomachining, for tool wear reduction. After the first pass, the average tangential and normal components of the cutting forces increase with increase in the feed. Also, there is always an increase in friction from pass 1 to pass 2. In multipass processes, the arrangement should be effected with minimum overlap in the runs, for efficient machining...|$|E

Near-periodic thickened nodes of the fibres are staggered with those in adjacent fibres in two- and three-dimensional planes, creating a fibre–matrix texture with high attributes for crack stopping and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> transverse <b>cutting.</b> Close association of the fibre layer with the underlying ‘spongy’ medulloid pith indicates the potential for higher buckling loads and greater elastic recoil.

A number of polymer composite panels of different thicknesses and construction have been tested. A dynamic test which simulated the real threat has been used and the results compared to a simpler quasi-static test that might be used in initial materials selection. The materials tested were glass-epoxy, and glass-nylon composite panels of several thicknesses between 1. 8 and 5. 8 mm. Additional tests were also performed on similar composites containing tungsten wires. An accelerated instrumented drop-tower was used to drive a knife through composite panels and record the force resisting penetration by the knife. The final penetration of the knife through the armour into a soft backing was also measured. For comparison,a similar geometry quasi-static test was carried out on the same specimens. It was found that energy absorbtion took the form of an initial resistance to perforation and then by a resistance to further penetration. This is thought to stem from <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cutting</b> ofthe panel material and gripping of the knife blade. The energy required to produce a given penetration in dynamic tests was found to be in good agreement with the penetration achieved at similar energies under quasi-static conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Cutting {{steel is}} {{required}} to have high wear resistance with certain hardness and deformation resistance. The commonly used machinery material for meat processing in china is 4 Cr 13, which is far inferior to the imported German steel X 80 CrVMo 13 - 2. After studying the influence of different heat treatment process on its wear resistance, {{we have come to}} the following conclusion: X 80 CrVMo 13 - 2 steel, after quenched at 1050 ℃ and tempered at 500 ℃, has an excellent wear resistance and 4 Cr 13 steel, after normalized at 1010 ℃ and tempered at 500 ℃ has a fairly good wear resistance. X 80 CrVMo 13 - 2 cutting steel is used as a material to cut and mix meat products. In the high-speed cutting process, meat products produce high friction <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>cutting</b> tool. Thus it’s necessary for the <b>cutting</b> steel <b>to</b> have high hardness and wear resistance. In addition, meat products also contain biological tissue fluid. The corrosion caused by it, which should not be ignored, will affect the wear resistance. Furthermore, from the aspect of food hygiene and human health, cutting materials for food should not generate excessive wear debris. Or, the alloying elements in the tool will penetrate into the food with the wear debris, endangering people's health. These require that the cutting steel has high hardness and good wear resistance...|$|R
