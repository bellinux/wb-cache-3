40|$|Greece {{has been}} characterised by {{relatively}} high irregular migrant population stocks and flows {{during the past}} 25 years. Of particular concern have been the Greek Turkish land and sea borders that {{bear the brunt of}} irregular migration and asylum seeking pressures from neighbouring and far away Asian and African countries. Migration and asylum pressures at Greece’s and the EU’s external borders are strongly influenced by geopolitical developments in the region since the Arab spring in 2011 and particularly the implosion of the Libyan regime, the conflict in Syria as well as overall instability and conflict in the Middle East. Arrivals at the Greek Turkish sea borders had peaked in 2008 - 2009 but are dramatically rising again during 2014. The Greek Turkish land border by contrast was heavily under pressure in 2010 - 2011 but has now largely been abandoned. The flows are mixed in terms of composition; young men but also families and unaccompanied children, people who flee war and political unrest as well as people migrating mainly for economic reasons. Syrians have emerged as the largest nationality group arriving at the Greek Turkish border in 2013 - 2014 while Afghans occupied the top position in 2011 - 2012. Pakistanis have consistently been among the 5 largest nationality groups but their numbers have sharply declined from nearly 20, 000 in 2011 to approx. 2, 000 in 2014. Sadly, Greece has hit the headlines for illegal pushbacks of small vessels in the Aegean, and overnight <b>refoulements</b> across the Evros river, but also for grimy detention centers and violence that went unpunished (see ProAsyl 2007; Human Rights Watch 2009; MSF 2014; Convictions by the European Court of Human Rights) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{conditions}} of the elaboration, and production, of languages and writings that revisit a subjective and collective memory by rewriting History beyond violence, denial, repression, and censorship. This work analyses the relationship between the autos, the I, the self – inseparable from the bios, life as an experience the body goes through - and the graphein, the act of writing, the written form, at once text, testimony and narrative, by examining the question of how the “mother tongue” is involved in this relationship. Firstly, it concerns the analysis of the testimony The history we rewrite with memory through which “comfort women”, survivors of sexual slavery in South Korea during the Japanese occupation, emerge as a subject of History and writing. This analysis shows how women have begun to write by agitating the idea of the woman in the writing of History. Thanks to the collaboration of a Team of Testimonies, testimonies become life stories, biographies. Then, in the autobiographical text Dictée, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha brings to light another subject of the enunciation, an “embodied voice” addressing the other part of South Korean history, through her own family’s story in a language of exile, a language of the other. Autobiographical writing, an account of an individual’s story, meets the writing of History, yet resists the subsumption of the Woman and thought. In this perspective, this work question the complexity of the “mother tongue” and the shortcomings of autobiography in philosophers’ works such as Arendt, Adorno, Derrida, Todorov, Mizubayashi. The “mother language” reveals itself sometimes as the language of the Nation, of the law, of the other and sometimes as the language of affection, and intimacy, of the genealogical relationship. Ce travail montre les conditions d'élaboration et de production de langues et écritures qui relisent une mémoire subjective et collective, en récrivant l'Histoire par-delà les violences, les dénis, les <b>refoulements</b> et les censures. Il analyse le rapport entre l’autos, je, soi-même, inséparable du bios, la vie comme expérience qui traverse le corps, et la graphie, l’écriture, à la fois texte, témoignage et récit, en examinant comment la question de la « langue maternelle » intervient dans ce rapport. Cela concerne d’abord l'analyse du texte du témoignage L’histoire qu’on réécrit avec la mémoire (2001) à travers lequel émergent en sujet de l'histoire et de l'écriture les « femmes de réconfort » survivantes de l'esclavage sexuel en Corée du Sud pendant l'occupation japonaise. Cette analyse montre comment des femmes viennent à l’écriture en troublant la femme dans l’écriture de l’Histoire. Grâce au dispositif du Team de Témoignages, les témoignages se modulent en écriture de vie, en biographies. Ensuite, dans le texte autobiographique Dictée, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha fait apparaître un autre sujet d'énonciation une « voix peuplée » qui vise l'autre histoire de la Corée du Sud à partir de son histoire familiale dans une langue d'exil, une langue de l’autre. L’écriture autobiographique, qui est une écriture de l’histoire individuelle, croise l’écriture de l’Histoire en résistant à la subsumption de la femme ainsi que de la pensée. Dans cette perspective, ce travail interroge la complexité de la « langue maternelle » et de l'autobiographie chez des philosophes tels qu’Arendt, Adorno, Derrida, Todorov, Mizubayashi. La « langue maternelle » se révèle tantôt comme langue de la Nation, de la loi, de l’autre tantôt comme langue de l’affection et de l’intime, de la relation généalogique...|$|R
5000|$|It {{introduced}} the [...] "absolute" [...] prohibition of <b>refoulement,</b> whereas the 1951 Refugee Convention allowed return or expulsion of refugees if {{the national security}} of the state would be at risk. However, if asylum seekers commit certain serious crimes, they will be excluded from the refugee definition and could still be returned or expelled. <b>Refoulement</b> is thus only limited but not absolutely prohibited.|$|E
50|$|Following {{terror attacks}} in the United States and Europe, states have renewed calls for {{permitting}} <b>refoulement</b> {{in the interest of}} national security, as repatriation is the most effective method of dispatching refugees thought to present a credible threat. Furthermore, newer treaties typically include specific obligations that prevent <b>refoulement</b> under essentially any circumstances. These factors have led individual states and the European Union to seek ways around non-refoulement protections that balance security and human rights.|$|E
50|$|As {{repatriation}} can be voluntary {{or forced}} {{the term is}} also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to {{their country of origin}} under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from <b>refoulement</b> and given, if possible, temporary or permanent asylum. The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as <b>refoulement,</b> which is against international law.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, the European Commission on Human Rights {{recognized}} non-refoulement as {{a subsidiary}} of prohibitions on torture. As the ban on torture is jus cogens, this linkage rendered the prohibition on <b>refoulement</b> absolute and challenged the legality of <b>refoulement</b> {{for the purposes of}} state security. Through court cases (see Soering v. United Kingdom and Chahal v. United Kingdom) and interpretations of various international treaties in the 1980s, the European Commission on Human Rights shifted preference away from preserving state sovereignty and towards protecting persons who might be refouled. This interpretation permitted no abridgments of non-refoulement protections, even if the state was concerned a refugee may be a terrorist or pose other immediate threats to the state.|$|E
5000|$|As {{refugees}} are protected from deportation (or <b>refoulement)</b> by the 1951 Refugee Convention some host countries may indirectly {{force them to}} leave by gradually decreasing refugees' living standards and living conditions or by spreading lies about them {{to make them feel}} less welcome.

50|$|Thailand's forcible {{repatriation}} of 45,000 Cambodian refugees at Prasat Preah Vihear on June 12, 1979, {{is considered to}} be a classic example of <b>refoulement.</b> The refugees were forced at gunpoint across the border and down a steep slope into a minefield. Those who refused were shot by Thai soldiers. Approximately 3,000 refugees died.|$|E
50|$|Refugees {{cannot be}} {{deported}} or otherwise {{forced to go}} back to their country of origin as this would be <b>refoulement,</b> which is against international law.

In practice the government provided protection against <b>refoulement,</b> the return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The government granted refugee status or asylum and subscribed to a [...] "safe country of transit" [...] policy, which required asylum seekers who transited a country determined to be [...] "safe" [...] to return to that country to seek refugee status. With the expansion of the European Union (EU) this concept has lost some of its importance because upon their accession, neighboring Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Hungary became subject to the EU provisions that establish criteria and mechanisms for determining the EU member state responsible for examining an asylum application. In 2005 new legislation introduced stricter detention and removal policies as part of a stronger enforcement of the 2003 Dublin II regulation (also referred to as the Dublin Convention) which discourages asylum shopping by allowing serial asylum-seekers to be returned to the EU country where they first applied for asylum. EURODAC, the EU's system for comparing fingerprints of asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, has facilitated the application of the Dublin Convention. As a result, asylum applications dropped by more than 30 percent during the year with a noticeable trend in applicants attempting to conceal their routes of transit.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of Non-Refoulement {{is a concept}} that is very well known in the framework of International protection applicable to refugees and or asylum seekers. Non <b>Refoulement</b> is a concept in which State shall not expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee or asylum seeker in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The {{principle of}} Non <b>Refoulement</b> is generally relevant to the protection of human rights, especially in relation with the freedom of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In the context of International refugee law, the principle of Non <b>Refoulement</b> is a fundamental concept and considered as the back-bone of the whole frameworks of International protection for refugee and asylum seeker. This article discussed three aspects relevant to the principle of Non <b>Refoulement,</b> namely : the existence of such a principle in the existing International legalsystem, the character of the principle of Non <b>Refoulement</b> as Jus Cogens, and the condition of which the benefit of such a principle may not be applied. It is obvious that the principle of Non- <b>Refoulement</b> has been accepted by International community as explicitly established in International legal instruments and consistently implemented in the practice of State and the relevant International organisations. Such a principle is accepted by International community and gained ground as Jus Cogens in the International legal system, consequently States individually or collectively shall not derogate in a manner whatsoever, otherwise it is modified by a subsequent norm of general International law having the same character. However, should there are reasonable grounds, the benefit of the present principle may not be granted to a refugee...|$|E
40|$|Every year, {{millions}} of people are seeking protection from countries other than their own for fear of being tortured, persecuted or killed. Finding protection is not easy. States are closely guarding their borders, making it difficult for aliens to seek and enjoy protection from serious harm. No matter where they are or why they flee, people seeking international protection are vulnerable and insecure; in dire need of knowing, understanding and receiving their rights. This book explores the basic right of every forcibly displaced person to be protected from <b>refoulement.</b> The prohibition of <b>refoulement</b> is the cornerstone of international refugee and asylum law and aims to provide protection to people at risk of persecution, torture, inhuman treatment or other human rights violations upon return to their own country. This book provides a comprehensive legal analysis of prohibitions of <b>refoulement</b> contained in four human rights treaties: the Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. The emphasis of the analysis is on the international meaning of the prohibitions of <b>refoulement</b> and on the responsibilities of States deriving from these prohibitions. The four treaties are analysed in separate chapters. The final chapter compares the prohibitions of <b>refoulement</b> contained in the four investigated treaties. This book will be an important resource for legal scholars, students and practitioners working with asylum seekers and refugees throughout the world. It is also a reminder for States, which have obliged themselves to protect people from becoming victims of unspeakable atrocities. Promotor: P. Boeles, B. P. VermeulenWith summary in Dutc...|$|E
40|$|Where {{international}} human rights instruments lack explicit prohibitions on <b>refoulement,</b> non-refoulement obligations are read into other substantive rights. In this context, state responsibility is engaged by the act of removal of an individual to a state {{where he or she}} will be exposed to a certain degree of risk of having his or her human rights violated. In its so-called medical cases, the European Court appears to position the source of the risk to which removal exposes the individual, in terms of whether it emanates from circumstances that can give rise to the responsibility of the destination state or not, as a significant factor in establishing the proper scope of protection from <b>refoulement</b> under the ECHR. In light of this, this article argues that there is something problematic about the use of the ‘removal plus risk’ formulation to read prohibitions on <b>refoulement</b> into human rights provisions. This is linked to the failure of the European Court adequately to address the legal basis for reading non-refoulement obligations into the prohibition on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is the contention of this article that none of the possible legal bases identified in the academic commentary really offer a solid foundation upon which to base implicit non-refoulement obligations and, in this sense, non-refoulement under the ECHR is a castle built on sand...|$|E
