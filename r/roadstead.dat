5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); <b>Roadstead</b> (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter <b>Roadstead</b> (the same operation as <b>Roadstead</b> but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E
5|$|Following {{her return}} from the North Sea sortie, Admiral Hipper was {{assigned}} to the forces tasked with the invasion of Norway, codenamed Operation Weserübung. The ship was assigned as the flagship of Group 2, along with the destroyers Paul Jakobi, Theodor Riedel, Friedrich Eckoldt, and Bruno Heinemann. KzS Heye was given command of Group 2 during the operation. The five ships carried a total of 1,700 Wehrmacht mountain troops, whose objective was the port of Trondheim; the ships loaded the troops in Cuxhaven. The ships steamed to the Schillig <b>roadstead</b> outside Wilhelmshaven, where they joined Group 1, consisting of ten destroyers, and the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which were assigned to cover Groups 1 and 2. The ships steamed out of the <b>roadstead</b> at midnight on the night of 6–7 April.|$|E
5|$|The High Seas Fleet {{managed to}} punch through the British light forces without drawing the {{attention}} of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. Off Helgoland, Grosser Kurfürst had taken in so much water that {{she was forced to}} reduce speed. She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig <b>roadstead.</b> Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Grosser Kurfürst went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer <b>roadstead.</b> The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 16 July. In the course of the battle, Grosser Kurfürst fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.|$|E

50|$|For a port to {{efficiently}} {{send and}} receive cargo, it requires infrastructure: docks, bollards, pilings, cranes, bulk cargo handling equipment, and so on - equipment and organization supporting {{the role of the}} facilities. From pier to pier these may differ, one dock handling intermodal transport needs (container-ships linked to rail by cranes); another bulk handling capabilities (such as conveyors, elevators, tanks, pumps) for loading and unloading bulk cargoes like grain, coal, or fuels. Others may be outfitted as passenger terminals or for mixed mode operations. Generally, Harbors, seaports and marinas all host watercraft, and consist of components such as piers, wharfs, docks and <b>roadsteads.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} esteemed marine {{painters}} of his time, and early in his career he substituted a sincere study of nature for the extravagant and artificial conventionality of most of his predecessors. He painted the peaceful life of rivers, the poetry of wide estuaries, the regulated stir of <b>roadsteads</b> and ports. And while he thus broke away from old traditions he also threw off the trammels imposed on him by his master, the marine painter Théodore Gudin (1802-1880). Endeavouring only to give truthful expression to the nature that delighted his eyes, he sought to render the limpid salt atmosphere, the weight of waters, the transparency of moist horizons, the gem-like sparkle of the sky.|$|R

5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the <b>roadstead.</b> There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E

The State possesses several harbours on its long seaboard, but except Cayta, an important place, all are either small and inconvenient inlets in an iron-bound coast--like Esmeralda, for instance, sixty miles to the south--or else mere open <b>roadsteads</b> exposed to the winds and fretted by the surf.|$|R

On the return voyage, König struck bottom in a heavy swell. The ship was repaired in Kiel; the work lasted until 17 November.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Hampton Roads, often {{referred}} to as either the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack (or Virginia) or the Battle of Ironclads, was the most noted and arguably most important naval battle of the American Civil War {{from the standpoint of the}} development of navies.

60|$|In {{the mean}} time {{the war with}} Sweden went on. Many campaigns were fought, for the contest was {{continued}} through several successive years. The King of Sweden made repeated attempts to destroy the new city of St. Petersburg, but without success. On the contrary, the town grew and prospered more and more; and the shelter and protection which the fortifications around it afforded {{to the mouth of}} the river and to the adjacent <b>roadsteads</b> enabled the Czar to go on so rapidly in building new ships, and in thus increasing and strengthening his fleet, that very soon he was much stronger than the King of Sweden in all the neighboring waters, so that he not only was able to keep the enemy very effectually at bay, but he even made several successful descents upon the Swedish territory along the adjoining coasts.|$|R
60|$|A sharp {{look-out}} for {{the squadron}} was kept, {{not only from}} the Peak, but from {{the southern end of the}} cliffs, all that day. The vessels were seen until they were quite near to the volcano, when their sudden disappearance was ascribed to the circumstance of their shortening sail. Perhaps they anchored. This could only be conjecture, however, as no boat could be trusted out to watch them, near by. Although there was no anchorage near the Peak, it was possible for a vessel to anchor anywhere in the vicinity of the volcano. The island of Vulcan's Peak appears to have been projected upwards, out of the depths of the ocean, in one solid, perpendicular wall, leaving no shallow water near it; but, as respects the other islands, the coast shoaled gradually in most places; though the eastern edge of the group was an exception to the rule. Still, vessels could anchor in any or all the coves and <b>roadsteads</b> of the group; and there the holding ground was unusually good, being commonly mud and sand, and these without rocks.|$|R
60|$|Of all on board, the Pathfinder {{viewed the}} scene with the most unmingled delight. His eyes feasted on the endless line of forest, and more than once that day, {{notwithstanding}} he found it so grateful to be near Mabel, listening to her pleasant voice, and echoing, in feelings at least, her joyous laugh, did his soul pine to be wandering beneath the high arches of the maples, oaks, and lindens, where his habits had induced him to fancy lasting and true joys were only to be found. Cap viewed the prospect differently; more than once he expressed his disgust at there being no lighthouses, church-towers, beacons, or <b>roadsteads</b> with their shipping. Such another coast, he protested, the world did not contain; and, taking the Sergeant aside, he gravely assured him that the region could never come to anything, as the havens were neglected, the rivers had a deserted and useless look, and that even the breeze had a smell of the forest about it, which spoke ill of its properties.|$|R

While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to Gourjean <b>roadstead</b> outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

The Germans captured the ship and re-floated her, though she was sunk by Allied bombers on 23 October. The Germans re-floated the ship again, and again she was sunk by bombers, on 23 September 1944 in the outer La Spezia <b>roadstead,</b> where the Germans had moved the hulk to block one of the entrances to the Gulf of La Spezia. Taranto was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap in 1946–1947.|$|E
40|$|In {{maritime}} logistics the 'time factor' traditionally holds {{a critical}} importance for shippers, freight forwarders, shipping agents, logistics service providers, shipowners and port terminal operators. Also, academic literature widely recognized the key role of this variable for benchmarking and evaluating operational performances along transport supply chains. The {{centrality of the}} time factor in planning new services and shaping firm strategies derives from the consciousness that an adequate and reliable knowledge of this variable is capable of improving the overall efficiency and productivity. Therefore, an in-depth time-related analysis of various processes and cargo flows appears a sine qua non condition for balancing the interests of stakeholders interacting within the supply chain, and enhancing the competitiveness of the entire port system. Seaports, indeed, are major nodes inserted in maritime logistics chains and the different cargo handling facilities have to manage both ship and inland operations for synchronizing (massified) foreland and (atomized) hinterland traffic flows. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} paper is to demonstrate the relevance of the time factor in seaports, analysing the operational performance and the productivity of an Italian seaport, basically declined as <b>roadsteads</b> queuing time and seaport turn round time...|$|R
50|$|The {{blockade}} {{which first}} {{gave rise to}} serious theoretical discussion on the subject was that instituted by France in 1884 in Chinese waters. On the 20th of October 1884 Admiral Courbet declared a blockade of all the ports and <b>roadsteads</b> between certain specified points of the island of Formosa. The British government protestmi that Admiral Coubert had not enough ships to render the blockade effective, {{and that it was}} therefore a violation of one of the articles of the Declaration of Paris of 1856; moreover, that the French government could only interfere with neutral vessels violating the blockade if there was a state of war. If a state of war existed, England as a neutral was bound to close her coaling stations to belligerents. The British government held that in the circumstances France was waging war and not entitled to combine the rights of peace and warfare for her own benefit. Since then pacific blockades have only been exercised by the great powers as a joint measure in their common interest, which has also been that of peace; and in this respect the term is taking a new signification in accordance with the ordinary sense of the word pacific.|$|R
